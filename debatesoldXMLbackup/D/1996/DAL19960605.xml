    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to report that I had a very positive meeting with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed &mdash; INOU &mdash; on 28 May 1996.  I was happy to have this opportunity to exchange views at first hand with the INOU.  In the course of our discussions, the INOU delegation outlined in detail its case for greater participation in the social partnership process.  We discussed INOU participation in both the NESC and the NESF; and the importance of the INOU input into the reports being prepared by both of these bodies in respect of a new national programme. These reports will provide much of the economic and social context in which any new programme will be set and I indicated that I appreciated the specific contribution the INOU had made to the reports.</P>
      <P>Among the other issues raised in our discussions were the progress that has been made in reducing unemployment, by some 51,000 since April 1993, and the very positive signal of the Government's commitment to the unemployed, especially to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment, which the wide range of measures included in the budget this year represent.  I indicated my desire to augment those measures in the light of the experience gained in implementing the current initiatives.  I also indicated my intention to give priority to employment issues during our forthcoming EU Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With some seven months to run before the end of the current programme, firm decisions about negotiating and monitoring arrangements for any new programme have not been <Col N="863" /> made.  I am very satisfied that the Central Review Committee system is working well and have indicated previously that I would be reluctant to expand the committee.</P>
    <P>I agreed to consider the INOU's views and proposals in the context of preparations for a new national programme. In the meantime it would be useful for the INOU to have structured dialogue with the Government on matters of concern to it.  I therefore proposed that regular meetings would take place between senior officials of my Department and the organisation to pursue issues of interest to the INOU. The INOU has welcomed this proposal, and the first such meeting will take place in the first week of July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the INOU put forward a case for greater participation in any new programme that might succeed the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Will he accept it is not greater participation that organisation wants but to be full members, to be treated as full partners? Will the Taoiseach say why, for example, five groups representing an agricultural perspective are full partners in that process while the INOU is still assigned to a role of consultation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those organisations were included mainly for historic reasons and have participated since the outset in programmes of this nature. They were included in the 1987 Central Review Committee arrangement which has been operated, without change, by successive Governments, including the Government of which the Deputy was a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Taoiseach I was conscious of the need to reflect the changes which had occurred in the representative organisations for various segments of society, particularly the growth of an organisation representing specifically the unemployed in the form of the INOU.  As a result I decided to do something which had never been done <Col N="864" /> by a previous Government, that is to include a representative of the INOU on the National Economic and Social Council so that it could play a more effective role in the process.  As a result of my meeting with it on 28 May I decided to take a further initiative and bring it more intimately into the process. I arranged with it a structured dialogue which involves bi-monthly meetings, the first of which will take place during the first week of July.  I hope to have bi-monthly meetings with it on a continuous basis subsequently so that it will have an input at the highest level.</P>
    <P>As I explained previously to the Deputy and others, I am reluctant to change the representative arrangement on the Central Review Committee for the simple reason that it has worked well in giving us national agreements and understandings and programmes for competitiveness and work.  While one could argue from a theoretical standpoint that its representative character is not all that others might wish it to be, as the old adage, with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar, says &ldquo;if it ain't broke don't fix it&rdquo;.  I would be reluctant to start changing the compositions of the Central Review Committee at a time when we are trying to build on existing success and carry it forward into a new agreement. However, I recognise that there are some deficiencies in the arrangement and that is why I have taken steps to give a greater voice to the INOU in the preparation of the groundwork for the programme and in consultation at the highest political level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When we began the process of centralised programmes of this kind almost ten years ago it was agreed they had a particular cycle and should be considered at the end of it.  I am not arguing that the present arrangement should be changed but changes should be introduced for the next programme. Will the Taoiseach agree that while the employed have a voice at the table the unemployed have no direct <Col N="865" /> voice at it?  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed has not argued against ICTU, which traditionally has-stated it argues for the employed and unemployed.  The unemployed were not strongly represented a number of years ago and there was much antagonism between the organisations on the second programme.  However, this is no longer the case.  Will the Taoiseach give the unemployed a voice in the framework process for a new programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question in part in response to Deputy Harney and in my reply to the original question.  I said that at this stage, with seven or eight months to run, we should not come to final decisions about the precise structures for monitoring a successor programme to the existing programme. I also said that I am willing to look at ways in which the monitoring arrangements conducted by the Central Review Committee principally could be improved.  At the same time I have indicated a reluctance to change arrangements which have worked reasonably well in the past.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has made a valid point about the employed being more represented than the unemployed, although I would point out that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions specifically operates centres for the unemployed and represents them in a very direct way through that activity.  I would not wish to cast any reflection on that activity of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Obviously one of the benefits of trade unionism has been the promotion of unity rather than factionalisation of the interests of working people and those who wish to work but cannot do so through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structured dialogue I initiated with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed should not be underestimated in terms of its importance. The official who will meet the INOU early in July as part of the structured dialogue is the same person who acts as chairperson of the Central Review <Col N="866" /> Committee.  Its views will be taken into account through that process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked the Taoiseach why five organisations represented the farming perspective he said that was for historic reasons and, as the old adages says, &ldquo;if it ain't broke don't fix it&rdquo;.  There is another adage which says, &ldquo;we are here to make history, not to follow it&rdquo;.  Historically, Fine Gael might not have gone into Government with Democratic Left but history changes, and it is right that it should. That being the case, it is not satisfactory that the only group which represents unemployed people &mdash; they have only been organised in recent years &mdash; should be treated differently from other organisations. Will the Taoiseach agree that if we are serious about unemployment being the priority of all parties then that organisation should be at the table and fully participate in the negotiations so that it does not have to deal with the process at arms length through a consultative process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole basis for the concern of the unemployed is to influence the policies which will be implemented under an agreement.  The drafting of those policies in so far as the social partners are concerned is primarily done by the National Economic and Social Council, the body which prepares the reports and priorities which form the policy basis of national understandings and programmes for competitiveness and work.  While previous Government excluded the INOU from the National Economic and Social Council this Government included it. We have now gone further and offered them a structured dialogue, the first manifestation of which will be early in July.  It would be better for all concerned to await evidence of how that works.  Without speaking for it, I believe the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed was very happy with the approach taken by us and with the outcome of its meeting with me on 28 May. If the Deputy wishes, she should contact <Col N="867" /> the organisation which will assure her of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check the position when I meet the organisation shortly.  Does the Taoiseach, who has had meetings with it recently, believe that the INOU is sufficiently representative of the unemployed on a countrywide basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of my personal opinions.  We are dealing with arrangements for making sure we have a programme on a partnership basis which works and is satisfactory to all concerned.  The arrangements I have put in place to enhance the role of the long-term unemployed and the unemployed generally in social partnership are very good and deserve the support of the House.</P>
      <P>I might make the point that initially the long-term unemployed were not involved in any organisation.  When I was in the Deputy's position I agitated successfully for the establishment of the National Economic and Social Forum which gave them and their representative body, the INOU, their very first input to social partnership.  As Taoiseach I brought them on to the National Economic and Social Council and have offered them structured dialogue.  Of course, I am willing to look at other ways in the future for improving that but my record is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach omitted to add that in the intervening period he voted against social partnership and spoke against it whenever offered an opportunity.  Is it the Taoiseach's view that the INOU is sufficiently representative of the unemployed nationally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a repetition of a previous question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to Deputy Ahern but I will repeat <Col N="868" /> what I said verbatim if I can recollect it. I said that my personal opinions or views are not at stake here.  What is at stake is having a system of social partnership, involving a broadly representative arrangement which will ensure that all relevant people have an input to the policy content of social partnership and that the arrangements for monitoring that are as effective as possible.  There is a need to increase the level of involvement of organisations like the INOU, representing as it does specifically those who are unemployed, in the policy-making process involved in social partnership. I am very glad that, in Opposition and as Taoiseach, I have been responsible for a very substantial increase in INOU involvement, something that is acknowledged by the INOU, who were very happy with the outcome of the meeting, as I said to Deputy Harney, and I intend to continue in that vein.  I do not exclude further progress and changes in this area.  However, I also indicated a reluctance to alter arrangements that have worked well in regard to the Central Review Committee, a reluctance I am willing to review in the light of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach is confusing two things; they were very happy to meet him since they had been awaiting such a meeting for over a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They never met a previous Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach keeps telling us he is not like any previous Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They were very happy that I was the first Taoiseach who had met them.  Indeed I am not so sure that Deputy Harney met them when she was in office but I did and I did something for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm it is his view that the INOU is happy that it is not part of the social <Col N="869" /> partnership and will not be at the negotiating table when a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is negotiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney should not endeavour to misquote me. I said they were very happy with their meeting with me and its outcome.  Of course, they have desires in regard to further developments they would like to see.  I said, in response to Deputy Bertie Ahern, that I do not exclude further development.  In fact my record, as Taoiseach, will show that I have done more to bring the INOU into social partnership than any of my predecessors, particularly in view of the fact that none of my predecessors, including one for whom the Deputy voted religiously in the House, bothered to meet them.</P>

I do detect a certain reluctance to change arrangements that are working reasonably well &mdash; that is my observation from my discussions with them &mdash; but if the Deputy wishes to contact the social partners individually, I am sure they would be better able <Col N="870" /> to express their views on that matter themselves rather than have me speak on their behalf.</P>

      <QRef>[11166/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to written Question No. 44 of 26 March 1996, in which I stated that the Government is committed to initiating constitutional amendment Bills on votes for emigrants and Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      <P>I also stated that the Minister for Justice, having examined the Law Reform Commission Report on the law of bail, would be bringing proposals, including options for a constitutional amendment, to the Government for consideration.</P>
      <P>The timing of any referendum arising out of the all-party negotiations commencing on 10 June is not possible to predict at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach definitely envisage referenda being held within the lifetime of this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think it is likely that we will consider amendments, certainly on votes for emigrants and Cabinet confidentiality.  There is also the possibility that there may be amendments considered on the matter of bail. I can only postulate at this stage.  Until firm decisions are taken to introduce legislation to provide for referenda, one cannot be definite about that.  If the Deputy is trying to inquire about the lifetime of this Government, I can tell him it will be a very long one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of Cabinet confidentiality, in advance of putting any proposals to the House, will the Taoiseach be willing to circulate a discussion document on the issues involved and of the scope of any amendment proposed to ascertain whether he can obtain all-party consensus on this <Col N="871" /> issue?  Did I hear the Taoiseach refer to the possibility of a referendum on bail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the Government has come to conclusions about the matter one cannot go further than refer to possibilities.  No decisions have been taken.  We are looking at options for dealing with the problem of crime committed while on bail.  We shall look at options that might be helpful which do not involve constitutional change and others that might include or involve constitutional change.  However, until the Government has concluded its examination of these options, it is not possible for me to go beyond referring to possibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to Cabinet confidentiality, the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to provide for a constitutional amendment thereon, at present being worked on by the draftsmen but there are other drafting priorities, including the freedom of information Bill being dealt with simultaneously by them.  I am interested in what the Deputy had to say about a consultation paper.  It may well be that, when the wording is prepared, a consultation paper would be a useful part of the process.  I will certainly bear that in mind if I think it is a constructive proposal put forward for a constructive purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the constitutional review group had a number of issues excluded from its remit and the all-party constitutional review committee due to be established in the near future, I take it that any discussion of issues such as bail, Cabinet confidentiality and proposed legislation in relation to the latter, will be submitted to a committee of the House prior to Government approval?  In other words, will members of that all-party committee be given an opportunity of submitting their views before a proposal is submitted for Government approval?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be normal to consult a committee of the House before a matter goes to Cabinet; that would be without precedent.  Obviously, after a matter has been considered by Cabinet no bar is placed on consultation with anybody.  In so far as the work of the all-party committee is concerned in regard to issues like bail, votes for emigrants, Cabinet confidentiality and the like, I have written to the Deputy's party leader in some detail indicating an open approach to that matter, which he has probably received by now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>I would not care to get involved in commentary on private meetings of the kind the Deputy is inviting. The meeting I had with Mr. David Trimble was constructive and informative, as were those I had with other party leaders recently in regard to this matter.  The concerns expressed by Mr. Trimble, to which the Deputy referred, were made prior to his meeting with me. They did not in any sense flow from any discussions he had with me.  The issues on which agreement is sought are difficult in light of the divided nature of the community in Northern Ireland and the differing perceptions there in regard to matters other people might regard as not as important as they may be seen to <Col N="878" /> be in the light of the perceptions and the traditional divisions of view that exists in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The two Governments have already agreed an enormous range of issues concerning the talks.  We agreed in February that there should be a fixed date for those talks, something that had not been agreed previously and which had been the cause of great concern and frustration.  Subsequently we agreed on very detailed and extensive ground rules for the talks.  We had also previously agreed on a joint Framework Document which outlined a possible outcome for the talks which would be a useful working document as a contribution in the talks.</P>
      <P>Some issues still remain to be settled and it is the wish of the two Governments to agree as many as possible of the remaining issues before the talks commence, but the purpose of the talks is to reach agreement on issues that are currently disagreed and, therefore, it is not necessarily a failing that everything that could possibly be agreed between the two Governments is not agreed by them in advance.  However, as far as possible one should seek to agree everything possible in advance and that is what we are trying to do.</P>

      <P>I am certainly anxious that there should be an IRA ceasefire as it would be of great importance and of major assistance to the success of the talks starting on 10 June.  It is important to see these all-party talks for what they are: the first opportunity for many years for all political parties to get around the same table, including those who have traditionally relied on physical force. This opportunity must be grasped now. It is not something about which there should be procrastination as opportunities of this nature do not come easily. I told the Deputy previously that it <Col N="880" /> was not easy to get agreement to a fixed date for all-party talks.  It was one of the most difficult tasks that any Government of this country has had to undertake but it was successfully undertaken. We now have a fixed date and decisions need to be made by others so that all parties will be able to participate, according to the agreed rules, on that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>An important reassurance was given by the Taoiseach's predecessor in the summer of 1994.  Will the Taoiseach state whether the Government, like its predecessor, endorses the report of the New Ireland Forum?  The Fianna Fáil-Labour Partnership Government in 1993 stated that its long-term policy was to make possible the eventual achievement of a united Ireland by agreement and consent in the spirit of the New Ireland Forum.  Does that remain the policy of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The New Ireland Forum contains many important statements about the nature of the problem in Ireland.  The report was presented a considerable number of years ago.  It was at the time my predecessor referred to it the only report of its kind in existence. Since then a further report, the report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, has been prepared on these same topics.  Many important insights are contained in the report of the New Ireland Forum.  Paragraph 4.15 of the New Ireland Forum Report said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to both the historic problem and the current crisis of Northern Ireland and the continuing problems of relations between Britain and Ireland necessarily require new structures that will accommodate together two sets of legitimate rights, the right of Nationalists to effective political, symbolic and administrative expression of their identity and the right of Unionists to effective political symbolic and administrative expression of their identity, their ethos and <Col N="881" /> their way of life.  So long as the legitimate rights of both Unionists and Nationalists are not accommodated together in new political structures acceptable to both, that situation will continue to give rise to conflict and instability.  The starting point of genuine reconciliation and dialogue is mutual recognition and acceptance of the legitimate rights of both.  The forum is convinced that dialogue which fully respects both traditions can overcome the fears and divisions of the past and create an atmosphere in which peace and stability can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the possibility of the dialogue sought in the New Ireland Forum report has been created by the setting of a fixed date for all-party talks to commence next week.  It is, of course, the wish of the Government to see the coming together in unity of all the Irish people in their diverse traditions and their diverse national allegiances.  That is something to be earnestly wished for but the focus now has to be on seeking an agreement based on consent between the different groups who have different points of view about this matter rather than on emphasising one point of view alone.  In that regard probably the best and most recent statement on this matter was made in the final paper of the drafting committee of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>This part of that report was agreed to by Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the parties of this Government, the Progressive Democrats and the Alliance Party.  It represents a more comprehensive statement both as to its representative character and as to its recentness than the New Ireland Forum report.  The final paper of the drafting committee of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which was agreed to by Sinn Féin among others, stated:</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the option of a sovereign united Ireland, which is also the preferred option of a majority of <Col N="882" /> the people in Ireland, does not command the consent of the Unionist tradition, nor does the existing status of Northern Ireland, which is the preferred option of a majority of people there, command the consent of the Nationalist tradition.  There is a need for new arrangements and for new structures, not simply based on majoritarianism which, on the basis of a new and balanced constitutional accommodation, will reflect the reality of diverse aspirations, reconcile as fully as possible the rights of both traditions, promote co-operation between them and afford each, on the basis of equality of treatment, secure and satisfactory expression and protection in all spheres of public life.</P>
    <P>That statement, agreed by all of the parties in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is one with which I agree and which informs this Government's approach to the all-party negotiations that will commence next week.  I hope on that basis, as a result of an IRA ceasefire, we will be able to see all the parties taking their places so that the agenda agreed by all of the parties in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation can be pursued.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his detailed reply.  He worked hard on the working group, and I have no difficulty with the final report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Can I take it the Taoiseach has no difficulty in agreeing that the long-term policy is to make possible the eventual achievement of a united Ireland by agreement and consent, in the spirit of the New Ireland Forum?  That is not contrary to what is in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>

      <P>While I have quoted extensively from both documents, I do not have the originals here, and a discourse of this kind would probably require more time than is available to us at Question Time.  I would regard the coming together of the Irish people in <Col N="883" /> their diverse traditions and diverse allegiances as something earnestly to be wished for based on consent and through agreement.  At this juncture in our history the urgent matter is to get people around the table.  We should emphasise not the differences that may exist about ultimate goals but the unity of purpose in regard to having a dialogue. The principal factor blocking a truly comprehensive dialogue at this time is the refusal to date by the IRA to reinstate its ceasefire.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that any such balanced political accommodation in Northern Ireland would necessarily entail a different attitude to the relationship between the Republic and Northern Ireland, and that it cannot be the case that the Republic can in future be regarded simply as any other foreign State?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the Unionist population in particular owes to the Nationalists a duty of regarding the Republic as having a special status just as, in the same way, were the Unionists at some future stage to be in the minority, the Nationalist people would owe to the Unionists in Northern Ireland an obligation to regard Britain as not just some other foreign state?</P>

      <P>I do not find anything to disagree with in what the Deputy has said.  Obviously the words chosen are his own but the sentiments are not ones with which I would disagree.  There is a symmetrical requirement on the other side not in regard simply to some future possibility where roles may be reversed <Col N="884" /> but to the present time for people in this State and people of the Nationalist tradition to recognise also the Britishness of the Unionist population.  That is something that needs to be shown now, not simply offered as something that might happen if demographics were to change at some distant time in the future.  There is a need for parity of esteem in both directions.  Having put in that qualifier, I would have no quarrel with what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <P>I could answer that question, but it is better that I do not become involved in referring to individual topics that I might have discussed because such discussions are, of their nature, confidential; more progress can be made if there is confidentiality in regard to discussions.  The Deputy can take it that in various meetings with Mr. Trimble &mdash; I have had quite a number now &mdash; we have discussed all relevant topics, including the one the Deputy has mentioned.  All of these have been discussed in one way or another, not necessarily at every meeting, but in considerable depth.  So also have they been discussed with the SDLP and the Alliance party.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if that is a trick question the Deputy is trying to put to me.  As to whether all the meetings I have had are in the public arena, I am not sure, to be quite honest. I have had many meetings with many people.  I report on any meetings that <Col N="885" /> are relevant.  Any meetings I have had with Mr. Trimble have been or have become public knowledge.  I have no great problem with that.  Nor, I believe, has he.  Naturally it is sometimes the case that one can do better business when one knows there is not a camera crew waiting to ask what happened just as one comes out the door.  In practical terms, given that people in positions of responsibility are human beings, not machines, there is sometimes a case for having an opportunity for informal discussion where there is no requirement to answer instantly questions that might be posed by very well informed and interested journalists and Deputies in Opposition.  To the best of my recollection I have had no meetings of the kind the Deputy might be concerned about.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on recent reports which suggest that in excess of 56,000 Irish jobs could be vulnerable as a result of Ireland joining a single currency and Britain staying out of such a currency system.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11612/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference to 56,000 jobs mentioned by the Deputy is contained in the recent Forfás report Shaping Our Future: A strategy for Enterprise in Ireland in the 21st Century.  This states:</P>
      <P>Forfás data in 1995 indicated that some 673 manufacturing firms employing more than 56,000 people would be sensitive to a disimprovement in competitiveness against UK competitors.  These firms received support under the Market Development Fund during the previous currency crisis or have 30 per cent or more of their exports going to the UK.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to point out that the importance of the UK market must be balanced against the wider benefits of economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of firms with a high exposure to competition from UK producers, including in the UK market.  However it must be recognised that the future prospects for these firms, and for the people they employ, depend upon a range of factors in addition to their competitiveness <i>vis-à vis</i> their UK counterparts.  This holds true whether or not the UK stays outside the single currency area and Ireland joins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of factors to be considered includes, in addition to the UK decision on economic and monetary union, the overall strength of the Irish economy (including our competitive position relative to the UK) when stage 3 of economic and monetary union comes into being; the level of interest rates in Ireland as compared with the UK; the performance of sterling: and the extent <Col N="887" /> of diversification of these firms to other markets.  The arrangements to be put in place at EU level to regulate the relationship between the euro and the currencies of member states not participating in the economic and monetary union from the outset are also of importance.  This relationship is of concern to all member states and the matter has been under discussion at EU level over the past few months, including at recent meetings of the Ecofin Council. As President of Ecofin over the next six months I look forward to making further substantial progress, with a view to presenting, if possible, conclusions to the European Council in Dublin in December.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would point out that the UK Government has never said the UK will not participate in economic and monetary union.  Rather it has indicated that the UK will not do so in 1997, but that if economic and monetary union commences at a later date, a decision on UK participation will be made closer to that time.  The agreed commencement date for economic and monetary union is now 1 January 1999.  As the Forfás report says:</P>
    <P>The best policy approach, at this point, is for Ireland to take whatever measures are necessary to be fully prepared to join the European Monetary Union when the time comes.</P>
    <P>In this context the Deputy will be aware that I have commissioned, on behalf of the Government, an in-depth study by the ESRI of the likely economic implications of economic and monetary union for Ireland.  The study will assist us to deepen our understanding of how the Irish economy interfaces with its trading partners.  By having more detailed information, we will be better prepared to plan our national policies with a view to economic and monetary union &mdash; both in preparation for it and in order to participate successfully in it. The study is due for completion by the end of this month and its findings will be made public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past ten days or so the Minister has quoted from a study which reports favourably on Ireland's prospects of proceeding to economic and monetary union.  Would he not agree, however, that there are conflicting views on this matter and it depends on whose report he reads?  As the Minister will be aware exporters have one opinion, depending on which branch they come from, and trade unionists and academics also have separate viewpoints.</P>
      <P>When will the study the Minister commissioned on behalf of the Department of Finance be published?  I read recently that only a summary of the report would be published but I suggest the report in its entirety be published. When will it be published so that we can have an overall view of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question.  It is my intention to publish the report as soon as practicable.  I am not aware of nor have I seen the reference to which the Deputy alluded regarding the publication of a partial report.  I understand we will get the full report and we are committed to publishing it.  As far as I am concerned I will publish the full report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the earlier part of the Deputy's question, there has been speculation for some time that in the event of Ireland joining in economic and monetary union and Britain staying outside it there would be a rapid deterioration in the value of sterling and of employment prospects in this country. There is nothing to suggest, however, in the logic of that argument that if we choose not to join in economic and monetary union and the UK chooses to stay outside the euro zone that sterling of itself would not fall because the cause of the fall in the relative value of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the euro would not be determined by whether Ireland was a member but by how the markets perceive the relative value of sterling in the medium to long-term against the new family of currencies that go to form the <Col N="889" /> euro.  Our decision to join in economic and monetary union will not in any way alter the negative fall or positive rise in sterling.  I do not think the people who are arguing this case have thought out the consequences of their opening position.</P>
    <P>What we have to do is ensure that Irish firms maintain and preferably improve their competitive position generally but specifically within the UK economy.  We have tried to address that issue in a number of ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we discussed this matter on a number of occasions, what progress, if any, is being made at the Council of Ministers regarding the arrangements to guard against predatory devaluation policies by currencies outside economic and monetary union?  If the UK stays outside economic and monetary union, it is essential for the Irish economy to put in place strict arrangements which guard against predatory devaluation policies. No matter what way one looks at figures for exports between Ireland and the UK, it is our largest trading partner in volume, manufacturing and employment terms.</P>
      <P>Is it the Government's intention to have this matter sorted out during the Irish Presidency?  It is a worry for all Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from Monday's meeting of Ecofin in Luxembourg it is the intention that we have a definitive document that would be agreed to at the Dublin Summit in December and that <i>inter alia</i> the document would provide for a new currency exchange rate mechanism between the ins and outs, as it is known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about predatory devaluations, more commonly known as competitive devaluations.  Other than the fallout from Black Wednesday in September 1992, there is no sighted evidence of a specific competitive devaluation undertaken by a member state. Hypothetically the case exists but from <Col N="890" /> market behaviour by various Governments since September 1992 or when the currency settled down in the following July-August 1993 and the expanded band of 15 per cent was brought into place, there is no evidence of competitive devaluation of the kind that people have been speculating about.  When we see the final form of ERM Mark 2, as I refer to it, we will have a clearer picture. It is my intention to try to make as much progress as possible in that regard during the course of the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>It is too early to say at this stage what the impact, from a finance perspective, of UK non-co-operation might be for Ireland or the EU.  The situation remains very fluid and complex.</P>
      <P>What is clear, however, is that every effort must continue to be made to seek an early resolution of the matter.  In this connection, I note the recent decision by the Agricultural Council, albeit by a simple majority, to lift the ban on the importation of certain beef products from the UK.  This should ease the situation. I am aware also that the Italian Presidency is working very hard to find a solution.  I would hope that their efforts prove successful before Ireland assumes the Presidency of the EU.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, it is in the interests of all member states to ensure that the European Union continues to operate in a constructive and effective manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with certain statements attributed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who has put the case very clearly on behalf of Ireland.  The Government's <Col N="891" /> position spells out clearly to the UK that this attitude is not helping its cause one bit with friendly countries.  If this matter is not resolved before Ireland takes the EC Presidency what measures will be put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak only from direct experience of the recent Ecofin Council where the British Chancellor of the Exchequer objected to the passing of certain items which Britain previously had supported vigorously.  He made the observation that he hoped the matter would be resolved quickly and that in due course the items that were being blocked by Britain as a result of the beef ban would appear in some council as &ldquo;A&rdquo; items, in other words, agreed in principle and ready to go through on the nod.  The view of the British authorities as expressed at that council and expressed by the permanent representative on behalf of the UK in similar vein is that it does not see this matter continuing for a very long period. In those circumstances I cannot tell the Deputy what items may be blocked as a result of the British position during the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>Some of the British obstructionist tactics used in the past week have been outrageous.  The UK blocked a series of measures yesterday which would have strengthened Europe's hand in the fight against international terrorism.  A few days ago they blocked an initiative to make 1997 the European Year Against Racism.  It is outrageous that such obstructionist activity should be allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister for Finance to outline the Irish position at meetings of the Council of Finance Ministers.  It must also be pointed out to the UK that it is a mess of its own making.  Ireland suffers more as a result of the beef crisis than any other member of the Union because we are the largest exporters of beef throughout the EU.  I ask the Minister to take a strong line on behalf of the Government and to spell out clearly to <Col N="892" /> the British that these tactics will not be tolerated and that they will not do their cause any good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of years Ireland has been undergoing a programme of tax changes with a view to increasing competitiveness and growth and thereby contributing to the maintenance and creation of sustainable employment.  A key element in these changes, under successive Governments, has been to broaden the tax base and to seek to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues.  A number of allowances, reliefs and exemptions have been abolished, restricted or refocused across several tax heads.  These measures have enabled tax rates to be reduced and the proportion of earned income taken in tax to be lessened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly there is further scope for widening the tax base.  This is a matter which receives ongoing consideration each year prior to the budget.  The Tax Strategy Group has on a number of occasions examined the issue of base broadening.  There have been recent proposals also by Forfás in the VAT and property tax areas.  There is also scope for restricting or eliminating reliefs and allowances to make more resources available for tax reduction. The Deputy can be assured that all relevant base broadening options will be <Col N="893" /> examined yet again in the run-up to next year's budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the fact that the Minister referred to the Forfás report.  Expanding the VAT net and having more tax allowances at the standard rate, which the report mentions, are either on the agenda or they are not.  I ask the Minister to indicate if they are on the agenda and if the Government is seriously contemplating expanding the VAT net to food or introducing personal allowances only at the 27 per cent rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fortás report was published only last Thursday.  We will have a comprehensive debate on it in this House before we break for the summer recess and that will provide a better opportunity to address the Deputy's questions in detail.  All measures designed at improving the overall competitive position of the Irish economy, which include <i>inter alia</i> the lessening of the tax burden on earned income, are being and will continue to be looked at in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that extending VAT to food and having more tax allowances at the standard rate are potentially on the agenda.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to property taxes.  The Forfás report mentions levels of services provided and ability to pay. Does that imply a new form of funding for local government?  Could the Minister indicate if it is proposed to transfer the burden of tax on work into some form of finance for local government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Less than a week after its publication it would be wrong and it would do a great disservice to the people who worked hard to produce the Forfás report to respond in precise detail to one of the many measures it suggests we should look at in the context of enhancing our performance over the next 15 years.  There will be a debate in this House on the overall thrust of the <Col N="894" /> report and on the various measures it outlines.</P>
      <P>As regards the question on local authority taxation, the Deputy knows from a previous answer I gave in this House that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has commissioned a study in this regard in line with <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> When that document is available it will be debated in full and we will look at the options in that context. Any other answer at this stage, no matter how much the Deputy might like me to reply, would be premature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few years there have been major developments in the methods of delivering retail financial services.  These developments have been based on the use of increasingly sophisticated information technology systems.  As the banking market continues to develop, access to the types of services currently offered by the major high street banks will be essential to ordinary day-to-day living for all our people as telephone banking, plastic money, the electronic purse, etc. become the normal means of transacting business.</P>
      <P>The credit unions and indeed An Post have a major role to play in providing access to such services for the current non-banked.  One of the issues being considered by myself and my colleagues in Cabinet in relation to the restructuring of the State banking sector is how we ensure the widest possible availability of financial services at competitive prices which encompasses the needs of all sectors of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in view of the implications for retail banking of these developments that the future role of the credit unions is being considered in the context of the Government's current review of the State banking sector.  My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, is preparing a new credit union Bill.  This Bill proposes to allow credit unions to expand their range of financial and advisory services, subject to the approval of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  The Bill will also consolidate and update the credit union legislation, reflecting the role of the modern credit <Col N="896" /> union movement as a major player in the provision of personal financial services.</P>

      <P>This is becoming a long-running saga.  In 1994 the Minister said, in reply to a parliamentary question, that he would move slowly as regards a third banking force.  Would he not agree that it is over 18 months since the Government came to power, more than two years since the matter was before the last Government and various reports were commissioned, and well over two years since the National Australian Bank proposed a take-over of the TSB?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was quoted as saying that, perhaps, it would be better if the idea were abandoned. Will he agree that, rather than try to square the ideological positions of the three partners in Government with three sets of proposals, it would be better to bring this saga to an end to protect our reputation internationally as a country with which one can do business? This may be the best course to take because it is highly improbable that a good decision will be made.  Has the idea been abandoned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.  I regret to inform the Deputy that the <i>raison d'être</i> for the fire sale proposals to sell off the ICC and the ACC which emerged during the stewardship of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats administration no longer applies because of the wonderful performance of the economy.  We are not so starved of cash that we have to rush to sell off these valuable State assets which are performing adequately.  If the sale had been proceeded with because of the desperation of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, it would have resulted <Col N="897" /> in a contraction of competition in banking services.</P>
      <P>We are assessing the impact of new technology, including the electronic purse, and trying to ensure that within the timeframe of the next five to 15 years all people who receive moneys will not be divided into two new categories; those who have access to forms of banked plastic and those who do not. This is an extraordinarily complex area worthy of detailed consideration.</P>
      <P>To respond to the Deputy's specific question, as he is probably aware, the credit unions have control of assets of approximately £1.6 billion and are growing at a rapid rate.  We have to ensure the way they perform and the services they provide are interchangeable and interlinked with the rest of the financial system.  One has to consider also the consequences of economic and monetary union.  As the Deputy will readily see from the reply I have given, we are a long way from fire sale proposals to sell off the ACC and the ICC which is what the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil wanted to do.</P>

    <P>The blocking of EU business is a matter of great concern.  It is not appropriate for any country to adopt such an approach as it politicises an issue which is not political but one of restoring consumer confidence on the basis of good solid scientific information and reassurance. Rather than emphasising its political character the British Government should emphasise the consumer character of the issue and seek to address consumer concerns in a meaningful way. The European Union should assist Britain in any way possible to provide <Col N="1097" /> the necessary reassurance to consumers.

    <Title>Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to moving the adjournment of the debate I referred to the costs of the Luas system and the underground option and suggested the costings available to me indicated that putting the system's centre city sections &mdash; the part which lies between the canals &mdash; underground would not have been more expensive than the proposals for an on-street unsegregated system. These costings showed that constructing a tunnel in Dublin would cost in the order of £11 million per kilometre and this compared favourably with the estimated cost of £12.5 million per kilometre for an on-street unsegregated system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to the Minister and his Department to assess the comparative <Col N="1103" /> costs of the underground and over-ground options for the system's city centre sections.  On the issue of comparative costs, I want to address a number of questions directly to the Minister. Did the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications or CIE carry out a study of the costs of going underground in the City Centre?  What firm of consultant engineers was used to carry out this study; what were its conclusions and will the Minister publish them?</P>
    <P>This Government has made great play of its commitment to openness, transparency and accountability.  It is time we had some openness about Luas. It may be the case that the city centre sections of the system could be put underground without the need for any increase in the present project's budget. If so, the Minister should explain why he is going ahead with an on-street system in the city centre which will cause enormous disruption during construction, and will deliver no real increase in journey times than could not be achieved by running a faster bus service.</P>
    <P>What of the third line which must form an essential part of any rapid transit system for Dublin?  How can it be funded?  The Ballymun-Dublin Airport line must be built.  We cannot construct a system at huge public expense which simply ignores the needs of the people of the city's northside.  It is vital the Ballymun line is included in the first phase of the Luas project because there may not be a second phase.  We are told there is not enough money available to build the northside link, but if we make better use of the resources at our disposal, it can be built.</P>
    <P>Several hundred million pounds of public money have been earmarked for the construction of the north-south port access road tunnel.  Everybody recognises the need for the port access tunnel to relieve the chronic congestion and environmental damage caused by thousands of heavy trucks trundling through the city centre every day.  However, one does not have to be a traffic engineer to <Col N="1104" /> see that what is needed is an east-west tunnel linking the port with the main routes to Cork, Limerick, Galway and the north-west.  One only has to stand on O'Connell Bridge to see that the heavy commercial traffic using the port moves along an east-west, not a north-south, axis.  Does anybody expect a driver of a heavy vehicle travelling from Cork to make a detour as far north as Whitehall to get to the port?  Would it not make sense to abandon the north-south route and proceed instead with the east-west option?  Private sector interests have already come forward with a proposal to build an east-west port access tunnel at no cost to the taxpayer, so why not use private money to build the tunnel in the right place instead of using public money to build it in the wrong place?</P>
    <P>Ditching the publicly funded north-south tunnel in favour of the privately funded east-west option could save the State £170 million.  This money added to the existing Luas budget would be sufficient to fund the entire proposal, complete with three lines and underground sections in the city centre.  In other words, provided we adopt a strategic approach to the problem, we have the financial resource to provide Dublin with a state of the art rapid transit system covering both sides of the city.  It is a matter of ensuring that we get the best possible value for the money available.</P>
    <P>This whole issue highlights, once again, the need for an integrated approach to transport management.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, is the Minister for planes and trains, but not automobiles.  There should be a single Department responsible for all aspects of transport policy at national level. This would involve bringing roads under the same departmental roof as CIE.  At present, responsibility for roads and traffic in Dublin is split among the Departments of the Environment and Justice, and four separate local authorities. Responsibility for public transport is split among the Department of <Col N="1105" /> Transport, Energy and Communications, Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus.  Remarkably, the people of Dublin have no democratic say in the formulation of public transport policy for their city.  This is a very unsatisfactory situation and it is certainly not the norm in other major European cities.</P>
    <P>There are important questions with regard to the strategic management of transport policy in Dublin, and the desirability of proceeding with the north-south port access tunnel in particular. I appreciate this project does not fall within the Minister's area of responsibility, as he does not have responsibility for roads.  However, perhaps he could prevail upon his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to answer questions on this issue on behalf of the Government.  The following are among the questions I want to see answered.  Was there a Government decision to switch funding from the Ballymun line to the north-south port tunnel?  If so, when; and by whom was it proposed?  On what basis was the decision made to reallocate the funding; and was approval received from Brussels for this move?  Why, and by whom, was the privately funded east-west port access tunnel rejected? Finally, is the north-south port access tunnel part of a larger roads plan for the capital about which we have not been told?</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to get clarification on this latter point.  The proposed port access tunnel will start at the southern end of the M1 motorway at Whitehall and surface at the East Wall. The existing road network in the East Wall area is poor and would be totally inadequate to cope with the huge volume of traffic coming out of the tunnel, much of which will be heading for the south city and beyond.  The net result will be a major bottleneck and serious traffic congestion.  At that stage, the case for resurrecting the proposal for an eastern by-pass would be so strong as to be unstoppable.  This proposal would involve running a four-lane motorway <Col N="1106" /> across Sandymount Strand, Booterstown March and the south-eastern suburbs of Dublin resulting in untold damage to the natural environment and the quality of life in those areas.  The cost of building such a road would be enormous and, depending on the route chosen, could be as high as £400 million.  In the context of reduced EU funding, this would place a huge burden on the taxpayer. I ask the Government to state clearly whether the proposed port access tunnel is intended to be the northern leg of an eastern motorway around Dublin?  Is the eastern by-pass now back on the political agenda?  The people of Dublin should be told.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with some of the basic assumptions in the Bill.  It is automatically assumed that the whole Luas project will be publicly funded and controlled by CIE.  Consideration does not appear to have been given to involving the private sector even though this is the policy favoured by the EU, which is, after all, putting up most of the funding. It is also the policy of the recently published Forfás proposals for the future, which clearly state a preference for private funding of major transport projects.</P>
    <P>Private provision of public infrastructure is now common practice in most western economies.  In Ireland, there are two good examples of this principle in action: the East Link and West Link toll bridges.  These two vital pieces of Dublin's road infrastructure were put in place by private enterprise.  It is a great pity the Minister could not have borne these examples in mind when it came to Luas.  Why could he not have taken an innovative and imaginative approach to the issue of funding and the potential for private sector involvement?  Could the whole project not be put out to tender? A competitive tendering process could produce significant savings for the State.  Even a small saving would be sufficient to fund the extenstion of the Dundrum line as far as the Sandyford Industrial Estate.</P>
    <P>I question the assumption that CIE is <Col N="1107" /> the organisation best equipped to manage this project.  CIE has no experience of managing a construction project of this magnitude and complexity.  It has handled the DART project and, more recently, the upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast mainline but both these projects essentially involved the upgrading of existing rail track, not the construction of new infrastructure.  By contrast, Luas is one of the largest infrastructural projects in the history of this State and the biggest ever undertaken in the public transport area.  It will involve digging up half the streets of central Dublin, building new bridges, repairing others and laying new rail track.  This will be a tall order for CIE.  Already there are indications of serious cost overruns, even before the project has got under way.  I understand that an over-estimation of the carrying capacity of the new trams means that additional vehicles will have to be ordered and the total cost of this slip-up could be as much as £25 million. This does not augur well for future management of the project.</P>
    <P>We are about to make major decisions about transport planning in Dublin, which will cost several hundred million pounds of public money and shape the city's transport infrastructure for decades to come.  Those decisions should be made after calm deliberation, after consideration of all the alternatives and detailed assessment of all the available options.  That is not what is happening.  The Minister's Department and CIE seem to be determined to steamroll this proposal through in its present form regardless of what alternatives might be on offer.  That is not the way to handle such an important project.</P>
    <P>Depending on the Minister's reply to some of the points made, my party will consider whether it will table amendments. The indications from public statements so far are that it may be necessary to amend this Bill to achieve the objectives of the Progressive Democrats in regard to the light rail transport system for Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should be a good news story for Dublin and yet residents and business people along the route are full of apprehension.  Overall the light rapid transit proposals are a good news story for Dublin provided the total concept is embraced and that sensitive and sensible routes are adopted.</P>
      <P>I welcome this enabling Bill which is modelled on much of the road legislation. Even though in parts of my constituency there is concern about the precise lines proposed and I have been asked to oppose the Bill I do not intend doing so.  I intend to support the Bill and the Minister.  However, I wish to raise some major concerns.  First, I am concerned about the time limit in which to enact this legislation, to set up the public inquiry, to allow for the public inquiry to be held, to give adequate time to all the witnesses, to allow for the inspector's report to be drafted, for the Minister to consider that report and to make his decisions on it.  There is much to be done in those phases alone before any work can commence.  Yet we are told we have to comply with a specific deadline if we are not to lose some of the EU funds allocated for this purpose. Will the Minister clarify if it is absolutely necessary that this legislation and what will follow from it &mdash; the public inquiry process and the construction process &mdash; are rigidly fixed to a timetable as suggested or can the project be phased in over a slightly longer period? It is important not to rush our fences and that we get it right.  This is one of the most major infrastructural proposals for Dublin since the foundation of the State.  Do we have to rush our fences and is there a possibility of some leeway in relation to the EU funds?  Without wishing to delay the project we must take due care and attention to ensure we get it right.  There is a second reason we need to clarify the position about phasing in the project over a slightly longer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As proposed, the Government appears to be embracing only part of the light rail concept, in other words the <Col N="1109" /> overall proposals are cut down to the amount of money available.  It is extremely important that the light rail, when finally developed, is part of an integrated public transport system for Dublin.  For that reason it has to go beyond O'Connell Street and interact with the DART and Busáras if it is to make sense.  Second, the northern line to Dollymount or Finglas should also have a clear timetable.  Third, there will be an absolute need to vary the route in a number of places, along the Tallaght line in particular.  Fourth, if the proposals go ahead the present snarl-up of traffic in Dublin will be minor compared with what will emerge.  All these things will happen because the overall budget provided for the LRT will meet only the lines proposed from Tallaght, through Inchicore, Kilmainham, Benburb Street to O'Connell Street, by O'Connell Bridge, Westmoreland Street, College Green, Nassau Street, Dawson Street to Harcourt Street and the Harcourt Street line to Dundrum, not to Sandyford. There is no mention of interaction with the DART, the Arrow, Busáras or the northern route to the airport.</P>
    <P>One of the mistakes we made in the not too distant past was to throw money at projects or, worse, to spend money on half projects and to cut back in the middle of a project.  I call it the half dam project, where you build half a dam and you might as well not have spent a penny because the water still gets through.  The LRT proposal has a hint of that.</P>
    <P>I make a strong plea to the Government and Ministers to support the construction of a complete LRT system, even if it means phasing the cost over a longer period because this system will have an influence for good or ill on the city for many decades.  It has the potential to do great things for the city but, if its full concepts is not embraced and provided for, we will end up with an unintegrated system and more traffic on the roads, fewer people opting for public transport and greater traffic problems than already exist.  I do not have to urge the Department in which I was a <Col N="1110" /> Minister as I know what it would like to do.  I am sure, as head of that Department, the Minister is fully seized of the need for an integrated transport system for Dublin, but he is subject to the constraints laid down by the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet in regard to financial expenditure.  However, while prudence in public expenditure is necessary, the Government must implement the LRT proposals in their entirety and that will mean providing for components not included in the current plan.</P>
    <P>The present proposal for the Dundrum and Tallaght lines to meet at O'Connell Street without interacting with the DART line is crazy.  The LRT should interact with the DART line by extending from O'Connell Street to the end of Abbey Street and across Tara Street Bridge.  While tunneling would ad significantly to the cost of the service, it will be unavoidable if we are not to gridlock the inner city.  There is a strong case for tunneling from Tara Street to St. Stephen's Green.  The LRT should also interact with the Arrow service.</P>
    <P>The current proposals are that the line run in front of Heuston Station at Kingsbridge, at least 1,000 metres from the loop line under the Phoenix Park, which is part of CIE's proposals for the development of the Arrow service.  The Arrow station should be located nearer to where the loop line crosses the River Liffey.  That makes sense not only from the point of view of integration with the developing Arrow service but also on the grounds that the present Stephen's Lane-John's Road-Victoria Quay junction is already extremely busy.  If the LRT runs across that junction it will cause major traffic problems back to Inchicore along St. John's Road and to the city centre along the quays.</P>
    <P>A timetable should be set for the development of the LRT line to the north of the city and it should not be based on the current proposals along Drumcondra Road which would further gridlock traffic.  Rather it should be built along the present vacant Broadstone <Col N="1111" /> line as far as Glasnevin Cemetery and to the Finglas Road, giving people the option to go to Ballymun via either Finglas or Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>If those proposals are met we will have an integrated public transport system in Dublin.  However, if the LRT line runs along Abbey Street, turns left towards O'Connell Bridge, goes up Westmoreland Street and runs along College Green to Nassau Street and Dawson Street that route will remain in place forever and we will have missed an opportunity to interconnect the LRT and DART lines, the only way to give a semblance of an integrated system.  It would be similar to the loop line which is an eyesore in front of the Custom House.  That was built in the middle of the last century and, as Minister, Erskine Childers tried to demolish it, but that will not happen.  The additional £10 million to £15 million needed to extend the LRT to Lower Abbey Street and across Tara Street should be provided so that it would interconnect with the DART line.</P>
    <P>As proposed the LRT will affect the Dublin Central constituency more than any other because there will be more physical problems and obstacles nearer the centre of the city.  However, the proposed line will give an uplift to the south west part of the inner city from Jame's Street to Inchicore, which is currently the most rundown part of the inner city. It has not benefited from urban renewal designation.  If the LRT runs down Tirconnell Road in Inchicore and a one way road system westward is built, people living, say, 300 yards from the Oblate Church will have to travel only 300 yards to get to the church but three miles to get home from it.  Also, people living 300 yards from the centre of Inchicore Village, around the Blacklion pub area, will have to travel three miles to get to the village but only 300 yards to get home.  That is not acceptable. Those plans must be changed and I have pointed that out to the Department and to CIE.</P>
    <P>When announcing the LRT proposals <Col N="1112" /> at a press conference the Minister did not refer to those problems.  However, a report on the conference the following day in <i>The Irish Times</i> alluded to the fact that there may be provision for a new bypass road at Inchicore from Goldenbridge Industrial Estate to Spa Road or St. Vincent's Street.  It is crucial that such a road is provided.  Otherwise the proposed line would be untenable.  The bypass would be a better route for the LRT because it would avoid disruption to business in Inchicore Village which is already at a low ebb due to the lack of urban renewal designation and other problems in the area.  It would also open up the old Spa Road CIE busworks for urban renewal and the part of that site not used by the LRT could be used to provide badly needed housing in the area.  Furthermore, it would avoid the need for removing underground services. If the building of a road is unavoidable, why not build the LRT along that route?  Those proposals must be adhered to so as to avoid disruption to residents and businesses in Inchicore.</P>
    <P>There will also be major difficulties on the proposed line from Tallaght to O'Connell Bridge at Old Kilmainham and Mount Brown where a civil war has been taking place for years between neighbours about parking problems.  If the LRT is built along that route it will cause great disruption to residents and be fatal for many businesses in the area.</P>
    <P>There is great resistance to the proposed line and a number of alternative routes have been proposed.  They include the High Road-Bow Bridge route, Davitt Road-Linear Park to the old James's Street Basin or along Bulfin Road to South Circular Road and through the grounds of St. James's Hospital.  There is a good argument for the High Road alternative because it would facilitate crossing St. John's Road further up from Heuston Station and avoid a bottleneck at the busy St. Stephen's Lane-St. John's Road junction. It would also facilitate the LRT-Loop Line intersection at the Liffey crossing to the northside.  An integrated service in this area would be welcome. <Col N="1113" /> Traffic travelling down High Road to Bow Bridge could take the military road at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, crossing the existing railway line and intersecting with the Arrow service at that point.  That is the first alternative for Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>The second alternative is to take the South Circular Road-St. James's Hospital route, which would pose much fewer problems than the proposed route. It would not, however, have the advantage offered by the High Road route of crossing St. John's Road at a point other than the St. Stephen's Lane junction and intersecting with the Arrow service. There is also the Davitt Road-Linear Park possibility, which is probably the cheapest alternative and the most direct route, but it would have the effect of taking the service from the centre of Inchicore which, for urban renewal purposes, badly needs such a service.</P>
    <P>There are three possible alternatives to the existing route and I would welcome any of them.  There are arguments for each one over the existing route. The Davitt Road-Linear Park route would be an alternative to the Inchicore section and the Kilmainham-Mount Brown section.</P>
    <P>The proposal to demolish 11 houses at Arran Quay Terrace, a beautiful row of houses in the inner city, is unacceptable.  Alternative routes should be considered via Hendrick Street and Haymarket to Smithfield Major objections should be taken on board.  A certain amount of tunnelling in the inner city, even if only at major junctions, is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I am concerned there is no provision in the Bill for appeals.  I wonder if that is constitutional.  A decision made by the inspector and approved by the Minister, which may greatly affect residents and businesses, may not be subject to appeal.  I would like the Minister to consider making provision for appeals. While there is provision for compensation for those who will be relocated, there is no provision for compensation <Col N="1114" /> for businesses that will be severely disrupted during the construction phase.</P>
    <P>This proposal started off as a good news story for Dublin and it should end that way, but that will happen only by integrating the DART and the Arrow service more fully, taking on board reasonable objections to the proposal and making minor changes where necessary. Apart from tunnelling, the cost involved will not be significant, but even if extra money is needed it should be provided.  The overall effect will be to provide for Dublin a much better public transport service than that proposed in the present curtailed plan.  Unless an integrated system is provided people will not use public transport, which is one of the key objectives of this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil recognises the vital importance of a good public transport system for our capital city.  We are proud of our role in approving construction of the DART, the reopening of the western line to Maynooth on suburban rail and the introduction of the Arrow service to Kildare.  The policy of a previous Coalition Government, pronounced in the programme, Building on Reality, resulted in a slow death sentence for the rail system.  That Government stated 12 years ago that there would be no substantial investment in railways, but when we returned to office in 1987 we rescinded that policy.  We are proud that in the National Development Plan we as a Government negotiated £226 million in EU aid as part of a total investment of £356 million for the Dublin Transportation Initiative and other related measures.  We are now debating the manner of its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil remains broadly supportive of the idea of building a light rail system, but, for reasons explained last week by our spokesperson, Deputy Séamus Brennan, we are opposed to giving draconian powers to State companies that would allow them to ride roughshod over local communities and businesses.  As established by the courts in the case of the Office of Public <Col N="1115" /> Works, State bodies should not be completely exempt from the planning system. As Minister at the time with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I find it incomprehensible that while the Office of Public Works is required to seek full planning permission to build a car park and visitor centre at Mullaghmore, County Clare, no permission is required to knock down houses and disrupt businesses in the centre and suburbs of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is amazing to contrast the furore that surrounded the proposed demolition of homes on the route of the eastern by-pass with the acceptance that such demolitions are par for the course in constructing a light rail system.  Those who fought for the widening of roads, interpretative centres and other developments are now advocating a different policy.  I do not understand the inconsistency of people who regard knocking down houses in Clanbrassil Street for road widening as a social crime but knocking down houses on Arran Quay for a tram as a social blessing.</P>
    <P>CIE must proceed as far as possible by consultation and consensus.  It must work with communities and businesses rather than impose decisions over their heads.  The House must reconcile the broader public interest with the interests of those likely to be most closely affected by the construction and operation of a light rail system.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed under a number of headings and it is our job as the main Opposition party to bring these concerns to the consideration of the Dáil and to represent the people involved.  There are EU concerns, as well as concerns of communities in north Dublin, that social factors are not being given sufficient weight or priority. Those without cars need public transport most and, therefore, there is a strong case for the Ballymun line to be given priority &mdash; the EU Commission is right in that regard.  As we said on a previous occasion, the Minister was very economical with the truth in announcing a go-ahead without reference to known <Col N="1116" /> European Union objections.  Planning for the Ballymun line needs to be accelerated. I had the opportunity of meeting the officials involved in the front line of work in Luas and I thank them for taking time to listen to my case.</P>
    <P>There is strong public concern that houses and public amenities may have to be abolished to make way for light rail.  Those concerns are particularly evident in the Arran Quay-Kilmainham-Mount Brown area and along the proposed route of the Tallaght Line. Deputy Mitchell went into great detail in that regard and there is no need for me to repeat what I said at numerous meetings, both public meetings and with the officials concerned.</P>
    <P>There is great concern among the business community in Kilmainham and Inchicore and in the chamber of commerce generally at the disruption and loss of business that may occur during construction.  That matter must be negotiated with the people involved to see if their fears can be allayed and to try to find alternatives.  Fourth, concern has been expressed by planners that the proposed light rail system will not integrate adequately into the DART and suburban rail system.  The experts must ascertain if this argument holds up and, if not, allay these fears.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the inhabitants of the north side of the city, particularly those in Ballymun and the wider area, whose social needs have been put on the back burner.  Even before a light rail system is provided, there is considerable scope to improve the public transport system to serve working class communities on the north side.  I welcome the opening of a new DART station at Fairview which will also serve the needs of the community in the East Wall where for the first time in half a century there is growing employment in the non-port area.  I also welcome the decision to open a station in Drumcondra on the Maynooth line, a development for which I have long lobbied.</P>
    <P>Consideration must also be given to opening stations in the North Strand and the bridge over Prospect Avenue <Col N="1117" /> which is within easy walking distance of Glasnevin.  The cost of building extra stations is minimal when compared to the larger investments proposed and should be undertaken as a matter of priority, particularly if there is any question of a delay in extending the line to Ballymun.</P>
    <P>I am sceptical of the argument that construction of the port access route will make it impossible to build a light rail system to Ballymun.  I did not have time to consider this argument fully as we had to depart from Government rather quickly.  However, the Northern Cross motorway will be open at that stage and much of the port route will be under ground and away from the Ballymun route.  If the construction work was properly co-ordinated then the projects could be made compatible.  The social argument for the provision of a line to Ballymun is unassailable.</P>
    <P>In due course there should be a link from Ballymun to the airport so as to integrate transport systems and assist airport workers living in the area.  There is a general view that there should be a frequent high speed rail link from the city centre to the airport off the main Belfast line, whether by DART or otherwise, and that this should be independent of any light rail link to the airport via Ballymun.  Aer Rianta and CIE should come together to provide this service sooner rather than later, particularly as airport passenger numbers are expected to increase from six million to eight million.  It should be possible for the Government to earmark some of Aer Rianta's profits and dividends for this purpose.  International research and EU surveys show that airports with fast transport to the city centre have a competitive advantage over those which do not have such a service.</P>
    <P>Light rail has clear advantages for the old Harcourt Street line.  Much of the separated way still exists but if trams are to be brought into the centre they must be able to travel through to O'Connell Street.  The Financial Services Industry <Col N="1118" /> Association has made reasonable representations that the International Financial Services Centre should be connected to the light rail system.  There would be considerable merit in providing a connection from O'Connell Street via the central bus station and the IFC and terminating it at Connolly Station as it would integrate the different modes of transport.  However, this is not provided for in the present plans. Obviously the Harcourt Street line needs to extend to the Sandyford industrial estate and, eventually, the Carrickmines and the proposed Cherrywood development near Loughlinstown or, as it once did, perhaps link into the DART system at Shankill.  This should also be done on the basis of an integrated transport principle.</P>
    <P>CIE needs to work in consultation with the business community who have legitimate concerns about disruption to their business.  I have long accepted the argument that a modern high quality transport system will be of long-term benefit to Dublin city centre.  In addition, the chronic congestion at peak times on the Stillorgan dual carriageway and other radial routes on the south side could be significantly relieved by the Dundrum line.</P>
    <P>My main concerns relate to the proposed line to Tallaght about which I have received many representations.  I have been contacted by people from all walks of life and social classes &mdash; business people, at the unemployed, working people, commuters, cyclists and motorists &mdash; and they are all at one on this issue.  It has been stated that these people do not represent the same views but that is not my experience.  I have attended numerous meetings and I agree with the points made by Deputy Jim Mitchell, who has received more or less the same representations as I have.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that the construction of the line could result in the loss of 600 jobs in businesses.  This is based on a costly survey undertaken by some of the businesses in the area.  It has been stated outside the House that this is the view of one group who have spent their <Col N="1119" /> own money on this survey.  This is not the case as I have met these people, many of whom are not young and have been in business for a long time, and they are merely putting forward their case.  Concerns have also been expressed that construction work could damage house foundations and structures.  The proposed route through Kilmainham and Mount Brown will necessitate the demolition of seven houses in St. John's Terrace for the erection of a tram shop.  The proposed line past Arran Quay Terrace will also necessitate the demolition of eight or ten houses, involving the destruction of an old settled community.  Some of these people have lived in this area for the past 50 or 60 years and do not want to move to other areas. People living in the surrounding areas also have great reservations about the system. The Government and Irish Rail must look seriously at all the alternatives before deciding to proceed with these proposed lines.</P>
    <P>In 1979 I was ticked off by a former leader of my party for abstaining in a crucial vote in the city council on the route for the Eastern By-pass which would have involved the demolition of houses in Marino, at the Griffith Avenue intersection, Distillery Road, Susanville Road and part of the North Strand.  All the experts said that there was no other possible route for the by-pass. However, I was the Minister who signed the contract for the construction of the tunnel on a route which meant that no house had to be demolished. When it was first proposed to widen Clanbrassil Street it was stated that the road would have to run a certain way even though it would affect St. Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral. Dean Griffin and others lobbied for a change in the route and, of course, an alternative was found.  The same will happen in this case, and the people involved must recognise that objectives are not always right.</P>
    <P>It is not simply a matter of paying compensation as money does not mean everything, particularly to old people who have lived in a certain area all of <Col N="1120" /> their life.  These people have legitimate concerns and must be listened to.  For many years I have argued in favour of bringing people back into the city.  This will be a stupid argument if the people now living in the city are forced to move out.  I know it will be argued that only a few people are involved but that is not the point.  There are no people living at Mullaghmore but some of the people in that area felt aggrieved about the development and they got their way in the Supreme Court.  However, it is difficult for people who have lived in the heart of Dublin city all their life to pay the airfare to Brussels to lobby the relevant people, to commission reports etc. Based on these considerations, we have no alternative but to ensure that the interests of the so-called handful are protected and that their arguments are listened to.</P>
    <P>I have yet to see any senior engineers or other technical people live in any of these houses.  Whenever such proposal might affect their housing estate, though it may be only human nature, they would find a dramatic way around the problem, such as that the line be constructed underground or on some other road.  They might not choose the former alternative for fear that their houses would fall into the tunnel.</P>
    <P>To be fair in relation to this matter, there is a small number of people with legitimate reservations to whom those involved should pay urgent attention since there is not a hope in hell of this project being commenced in October next.  I can assure Members that we will be attending the 1996 or even 1997 Christmas party without a stone having being turned anywhere.  Anybody who believes there will be is living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>

      <P>They may be cutting many sods.  Sometimes a resolution can be found through discussion or dialogue but a broad public consensus on a light <Col N="1121" /> rail route to Tallaght is necessary if construction is to begin.  It is necessary and I want to see it happen in my lifetime.</P>
      <P>Objectors will not go away, nor will Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I and other Members of this House.</P>
      <P>While an underground system could be advanced as an overall resolution of the problem, on the basis of plans viewed during my term in office that option was much too expensive, so there is no point in my putting it forward. Nonetheless, there are at least two or three alternative routes which should be considered, on which Deputy Jim Mitchell has done the spade work.</P>
      <P>As far as passengers are concerned, it is healthier and safer, where possible, to have public transport above ground. The Dublin Transportation Initiative ruled out a comprehensive DART system on grounds of cost, which finding I accept.  The Government and CIE should re-examine the option of running a short extension off the main line along a reserve way to Tallaght town centre as was planned originally, so that a full DART service would be provided, with a limited DART extension, mainly on existing rail lines, to Tallaght being examined on its merits.  We must remember that Tallaght is a very large conurbation with a population of between 70,000 and 80,000, justifying a frequent, high volume, public transport system to the city centre.  Such a service could be used via the Phoenix Park tunnel and Cabra, to link up with the mainline rail system to the south west, and with other rail lines to the west, north and south east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a passenger point of view, our present rail system is not integrated, to enable those branch-line passengers wishing to travel by rail to the city centre to change at Clondalkin or Cherry Orchard.  The benefits of a completely integrated rail system should be seriously considered.  The link is in place but not in use.  In addition to a fast, frequent service from Tallaght to the city centre stops could be provided sensibly <Col N="1122" /> in Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Kilmainham, the Phoenix Park, the North Circular Road and Cabra, a large catchment area with a high social priority.  Passengers who would benefit from the convenience of a light rail system would have our mainline services almost equally accessible to them.  The disruption of residents and businesses in the construction process would be minimal if existing rail lines, with much spare capacity, were used to maximum extent.</P>
    <P>There is still some time before the beginning of next year to carefully consider alternative light rail plans for Dublin. While we do not want further delay, we should pause and reflect prudently, with the European Commission and local communities, on what constitutes the best way forward.  For example, if different phasing would produce better results, we should not be afraid to consider such changes now.  Fianna Fáil has proposed the establishment of Luas consultative councils.  There is need for a clear signal from this House that we wish to proceed by way of participation and consensus only.  If we take the right decisions now they will form the basis of further gradual extensions to our public transport system as they can be afforded.  We must remember that continuous, gradual extensions are being implemented in other capitals.  Dublin will need a rolling public transport improvements scheme for some time to come which is why the right decisions need to be taken now.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Dublin's transportation problems have yet again become a major source of concern, brought about largely by under-investment in its transport infrastructures over many years.  The long period of recession in the 1980s, accompanied <Col N="1123" /> by sharp increases in car prices and running costs, exacerbated the city's traffic congestion problems.  However, recent economic growth &mdash; ours being the highest within Europe over the past three years &mdash; has led to a huge increase in car ownership, once again highlighting Dublin's transport dilemma.</P>
      <P>As one who commutes by car daily to and from this House I can confirm that throughout the day there is no valley period during which one might expect a relatively clear run to or from the city centre.  The main problem in Dublin stems from its inadequate street network, particularly its inability to cope with the increasing volume of transport making for the city centre.  Notwithstanding recent major improvements by management and staff of Dublin Bus through the provision of bus lanes and traffic management, road-based public transport has deteriorated because of congestion, in turn forcing additional commuters to use private transport and causing the familiar spiral effect.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation undertakes a cordon account annually of all people entering the city centre in the morning peak period, providing a useful indication of the trends in private car and public transport usage.  The most recent statistics available to me show that the proportion of the public using public transport increased to 36 per cent in 1994 and the percentage using cars, motor cycles and bicycles increased to 56.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>What is the effect of these statistics on our environment?  Today, and rightly so, ever greater emphasis is being placed on our physical environment, on the problems of congestion, air pollution and its effect on our health.  Road transport is one of the major sources of atmospheric pollution, 56 per cent of which is estimated to be caused by road transport, including carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.  Research shows also that road transport is by far the most pollutant of all forms of transport while, in contrast, rail transport is a negligible contributor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> All these factors have a negative effect on our capital city, accompanied by a growing awareness that, unless these problems are addressed satisfactorily, there is the distinct possibility that retail and service employers may be forced to move to outer suburban shopping centres.  This, in my view, would defeat efforts to regenerate the city centre area.</P>
    <P>Recent tourist figures show that Dublin has become one of the most attractive European cities for short break holidays.  This is of great benefit to the economy of the city and county and the creation of real jobs.  A properly co-ordinated transport system, including light rail, would make Dublin even more attractive to foreign visitors in the future.</P>
    <P>A crucial question is how to restrict the number of private cars entering the city centre.  The alternatives would appear to be to physically restrict car traffic, through some form of space rationing or pricing system or, alternatively, attract car users to public transport. My preference is for the latter. The fact that this can be achieved by the provision of a modern, efficient, reliable public transport service is demonstrated by the numbers of people who leave their cars at home or park at railway stations along the DART route.  That system which commenced in 1984, at an estimated cost of £87 million, runs on 37 kilometres of electrified line between Howth and Bray and has been highly successful in attracting car passengers to public transport.  It is estimated that between 7,000 and 8,000 cars are left at home daily by DART users.  It is also estimated that along the narrow DART corridor, served by bus and DART, practically 55 per cent of morning peak journeys are undertaken by public transport, a significant improvement on the 36 per cent who use other modes of transport along the corridors to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>If the success along the DART corridor could be transferred to the projected corridors of the light rail system, such as the Tallaght, Dundrum and Ballymun routes, it would go a long way <Col N="1125" /> towards solving our traffic problems. That would have a major impact on the socio-economic life and the environment, which must be taken into consideration when assessing the light rail proposals provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1991 Labour Party councillors in Dublin city and county made a detailed submission to the EU for Structural Funds and I am delighted they are now available.  As a Labour Deputy, I am pleased about the impact our Ministers had in drawing up the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99, as a result of which the Government policy changed from one of ambivalence to one of commitment to public transport, particularly to our railways.  Apart from the EU-assisted light rail investment programme of £200 million, it is proposed that £273 million will be invested in the mainline railway network.  That investment programme covers all the major lines on the interurban network and includes expenditure on track renewal, new rolling stock, signalling equipment and other investments which cover station enhancement. I compare that to the previous programme from 1989-93 which was marked by a bias in the ratio of 17:1 in favour of roads over public transport, totally different from the trend in other European countries.  That decision has been reversed and our railways have been saved.</P>
    <P>The DTI recommended the extension of the DART to Greystones and Malahide on the basis that the conversion of our existing line was a worthwhile option.  Given that the Government approved the extention of the DART to Greystones during the recent by-election, I strongly recommend to the Minister that EU approval be sought as soon as possible for necessary funding to cover the extension of the DART to Portmarnock and Malahide.  That would open up another desirable option, the extension of the DART or Arrow service to the airport with a future rail link to one of the fastest growing towns in the Dublin region, Swords, which has a population of 25,000.  The cost of the <Col N="1126" /> extension of the rail link to Malahide with a rail link to Swords and the airport would be relatively cheap, given that 85 per cent financial aid could be secured under the EU Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>There is a cast iron case for a rail extension to the airport, given that Dublin is the only European capital without a direct rail link to and from its airport. Dublin Airport has witnessed a staggering growth in the number of passengers passing through it during the past ten years.  A total of 2.6 million passengers passed through the airport in 1985 compared to more than eight million in 1995 and it is projected the number of passengers will increase to 12.5 million by the years 2005.  Dublin Airport has become a commercial entity in its ownright with some 100 companies operating out of it employing approximately 8,000 people directly and some 40,000 people directly and indirectly. Surely those statistics justify a direct rail link or light rail connection to the city centre.  I would favour an extension of the Dublin-Belfast railway line.  In that context, I would like representatives of CIE.  Aer Rianta and Fingal County Council to join forces to put together a proposal for the extension of the rail link to Dublin Airport and Swords.</P>
    <P>I am not under any illusions that there will not be major disruptions during the construction of the light rail project. I would like the Ballymun rail route to proceed.  Under the Bill there is provision for a public inquiry to take place.  Before one is held I would like the representatives of CIE to meet representatives of communities and organisations in areas that will be affected by the light rail route to ensure in so far as is possible a compromise can be reached.  I welcome the Bill and the early commencement of the light rail project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The next four years will be decisive in determining the future of transportation in Dublin.  It is important that we rally <Col N="1127" /> behind this project to ensure it is implemented during the timeframe in which European funding will be available. Failure to do so will result in Dublin losing out once again.  We should encourage our constituents to participate in the process instead of creating alarm or making negative, unsubstantiated comments about the project. There is an onus on Deputies who represent Dublin constituencies to ensure that the transportation issue in Dublin is dealt with effectively in the next few years.</P>
      <P>There is traffic gridlock in Dublin at present.  It has resulted from policies pursued for years and has not arisen only in the past few years.  When people travel to other cities they become conscious of how bad traffic congestion is in Dublin.  While tourism expansion is welcome here, it is putting increasing pressure on the city.  We must ensure people who live in Dublin enjoy a good quality of life and ensure the provision of good facilities for our tourists.</P>
      <P>As a number of speakers said, it is important that the public consultation is meaningful and CIÉ and the Minister must ensure it will be.  The meetings addressed by CIÉ representatives in my constituency have been helpful.  Residents groups in my constituency have got together to form an umbrella group to respond to the proposals outlined, and I understand that changes have been made.  However, I understand that is not the position in other constituencies where it is considered more consultations are required.  This issue must be given serious attention.  It is important that people are aware this is a meaningful process and that their concerns are taken into account.  The public inquiry would be helpful in this regard.  The environmental impact study must be rigorous and the planners must take note of residents' concerns, including the location of stations, how traders and people's homes will be affected by the impact of the light rail system in their areas and many other issues which need to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> Dublin needs an efficient public transport system.  There is a catalogue of missed opportunities in tackling traffic congestion in Dublin.  There is a clear plan to improve public transport in Dublin and a commitment to funding from the European Commission, which has invested £3 million in this project. We must ensure everything necessary is in place to enable that funding to be drawn down to improve the position.</P>
    <P>Experience around the world has shown that if people are to be encouraged to change from using private cars to using public transport &mdash; we heard about the 36 per cent increase in private car sales this year &mdash; an attractive, reliable and comprehensive public transport system must be provided.  It is not easy to encourage people to give up the comfort of using their cars to use the public transport system, but it can be achieved if the system is of a required reliable standard and such a system would reduce traffic congestion in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is committed to providing financial assistance for light rail in Dublin and it would be a distortion to say otherwise.  Luas is needed to tackle the chronic traffic congestion which is threatening to destroy Dublin's environment.  Recent articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> made a number of important points which must be taken on board, and pointed to the unique opportunity to improve the environment and the strong role Dublin Corporation should play as partners on the various issues which will arise during the process of the building of Luas.  As my colleague said, it is clearly not an easy process.  There will be disruption as there was in other cities, but if Members examine the way public transport is developing in Europe, it is clear that light rail is now the most common way to upgrade public transport in cities around the world.  Throughout Europe there are many examples of light rail systems, such as those in Amsterdam, Strasbourg, Manchester and Sheffield. In many instances the light rail system has helped in the development of cities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> The Dublin city business group visited a number of cities to examine light rail systems and the impact of these systems on business in various cities.  They went to Strasbourg and Geneva, and concluded that this was the right direction in which to go.  Their analysis of the problems which those cities had faced during the building of the light rail system did not dissuade them from supporting the Luas project which is part of a much needed and urgent traffic management plan for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I welcome that there will be very good access for the disabled on Luas. That has been a huge issue as our current transport systems do not provide such access.  There is evidence that light rail is helping to reverse the decline in certain urban areas where it has been introduced.  Positive messages from experience elsewhere show that this system is worth developing and that it is a way to tackle Dublin's very serious traffic problems.</P>
    <P>The widest possible consultation is necessary during the development and implementation of Luas.  Where environmental changes are being made, consultation beforehand is very important.  Residents should be advised that work is about to be undertaken in their immediate area.  Concerns have been expressed to me in relation to that issue.  Fairly dramatic changes in relation to trees were made in a particular area and residents were not informed in advance; nor was the matter discussed.  That sort of thing has to be dealt with very carefully if we want to ensure the success of these projects.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the development of the three lines.  The Dundrum line is technically the most feasible because of the existence of the Harcourt line and the necessity to tackle the ever increasing traffic and parking problems currently overwhelming the whole of south Dublin.  It is important to give a timetable for the development of the Ballymun line if this is possible. Studies have shown that the development of light rail in this area will mean <Col N="1130" /> that more cars will be taken off the road.</P>
    <P>As a Dublin TD I want a fair deal for our city.  A fair deal for Dublin means jobs, a safe, pollution free environment and an efficient transport system.  We must ensure, as I already said, that Dublin is a place enjoyed by visitors and tourists but equally one where there is quality of life for Dublin residents.  The development of Luas is critical to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for setting this Bill in a wider context and for affording the House the opportunity of discussing the public transport requirements of the Dublin region generally.</P>
      <P>The first matter I wish to raise under this Bill relates to the traffic gridlock which it is suggested this Bill will address.  This Bill will lead to a considerable amount of traffic gridlock in Dublin city and I would like to hear how the Minister anticipates normal traffic will travel through the city centre in the event that this system is implemented.  It is very difficult to envisage how normal traffic will proceed after the Luas system has been installed in the city centre. I would like the Minister to address this issue because there is widespread apprehension throughout the Dublin region that the proposed light rail system overground in the centre city area will lead to considerable traffic gridlock of traffic in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to discuss the development of conventional rail routes around the city.  There are two conventional rail routes which enter the city from the western side of the city.  One is known as the Maynooth line and runs along the old Dublin to Mullingar line.  The other is known as the Arrow route and goes from Heuston Station on the Cork line. Both these conventional rail routes, which can move a number of passengers far in excess of the number which it is envisaged will use the new Luas system, are in need of investment.  The amount needed is small compared to the type of investment which it is proposed to draw <Col N="1131" /> down under this operational programme to develop the Luas system.</P>
    <P>At present the Maynooth lines is a single track railway used for commuter purposes along a line from Maynooth to Connolly Station.  At a cost of approximately £9.4 million the signalling on that line could be improved and double tracking could be installed, which would facilitate a greater number of vehicles and a greater use of this facility. However, it appears from the strategy which has been adopted &mdash; I accept that all sides of the House have to accept some responsibility for the strategy now being proceeded with &mdash; that development of this line will have to await the second phase of the Dublin Transport Initiative.</P>
    <P>If Members examine the various places alongside that route, they will note that there is outward and inward traffic at all times of the day.  The new industrial facility at Intel, the new industrial facility at Hewlett-Packard and the university at Maynooth all lie along this line, yet there is no concrete proposal to improve this line and ensure its greater use.</P>
    <P>Another matter in relation to the Maynooth line was raised by my colleague, Deputy Ahern, a few moments ago.  That is the development of the tunnel underneath the Phoenix Park which links that line with Heuston Station. The development of that tunnel, which would cost a relatively small amount of money compared to the type of money being invested in Luas, would enhance that part of our conventional rail network.</P>
    <P>The other line which approaches the city from the western side is the Arrow line from Clondalkin to Heuston Station.  There is considerable scope for development of this line as a result of recent housing developments.  Thousands of new houses have been built in very close proximity to this line and there is an obvious need for a new railway station in the south Lucan area. However, to date there has been very little sign of any activity on this front <Col N="1132" /> despite the fact that a relatively small investment would go a long way towards relieving traffic congestion in that part of the city through greater use of the rail link.</P>
    <P>This is a very ambitious programme yet it does not appear to be integrated with our existing rail network.  One of the reasons I found the unified proposal, submitted by Mr. Monaghan to a number of Deputies, of great interest was not so much its detail but the fact that what was proposed would provide an integrated transport system for Dublin. The Luas proposal does not appear to be integrated with the existing conventional rail network.  It is not related to the DART or to the lines that come in from the west of the city.  Under the Luas proposal we will have three dis-connected public transport systems in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the very-widespread public consultation which took place as part of the Dublin Transport Initiative.  On Second Stage he referred to the fact that there was overwhelming public support for the Luas proposal and that Government policy on light rail has the support of the people of the region.  That assertion is based on polls carried out by the Dublin Transportation Initiative, but if the public are asked in a pool if they would like light rail, they will say yes, just as they would like stricter enforcement of the traffic laws, just as the public in Dublin would like to see greater extensions of the DART system.  There are many desirable proposals.  On all sides of the House we wish to see greater emphasis on public transport to relieve the traffic congestion in the Dublin area. However, public transport has to become attractive to the consumer if that objective is to be secured.</P>
    <P>The various alternative proposals that have been put forward highlight one weakness in the existing proposals. They do not appear to integrate the existing conventional rail system with the proposed new system.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that when replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> I note that sections 9 and 10 contain the core provisions of this measures.  In these sections the Minister is given the crucial power to make a light railway order.  That is the central power given to him under this legislation.  It is clear that, as with many other powers of compulsory acquisition, the Minister has in effect decided on policy here, and the purpose of the statute is simply to see that the policy is implemented having regard to the convenience of the public generally.  There is no question of criteria being laid down in the legislation which would enable the Minister to refuse to make a light railway order.  There is a policy and that policy will be implemented by the making of an order under section 9 which will seek to contain the provisions set out in section 10 and, as far as possible, to accommodate the various representations made at the inquiry which is envisaged under the legislation.  That is the core provision of the Bill, but there are signs of hasty draughtsmanship in the measure.  One example can be found in section 12 where it is provided that a person cannot question the validity of a light railway order other than by way of an application for judicial review, and that application must be made within a period of two months.</P>
    <P>If one examines that provision one will see it is essentially a cog from the local government planning and development code.  In fact the correct cog for that type of provision should be in the compulsory purchase code, because the light railway order which the Minister is making is an order which is akin to a compulsory purchase procedure.  It is not akin in any way to a planning procedure and, if one looks at section 12, it is clear that the Bill is assuming the same scheme as the Planning Act. However, if a light railway order is made the legislation then provides in section 13 that the Minister can proceed to compulsorily acquire land.  Later sections of the Bill enable the Minister to take various other steps.  There is no provision in section 12 for putting a stay on the light railway order in the event <Col N="1134" /> of an application for a judicial review having been made.  That seems an extraordinary omission from the Bill until one realises that what has happened is that the section that has been transposed is the wrong section which has been taken from a Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, and that shows signs of hasty draughtsmanship. I do not want to get lost on Committee Stage points at this stage but section 26 states:</P>
    <P>The Regulation of Railways Acts, 1840 to 1889, and any other Act relating to railways shall, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, apply to a light railway constructed under the Act,.</P>
    <P>Considerable vagueness surrounds that type of provision where it is not spelled out to the householders of Dublin who will be affected by this legislation exactly what Acts will apply to these light railways when they are constructed. The least this House should expect is that it should be spelled out in the Bill and not as it is put in section 26 where it refers to various Acts relating to railways which shall apply &ldquo;in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act&rdquo;, all 30 sections of them.  That is some exercise in draughtsmanship for a poor citizen of Dublin who wants to contemplate what his or her rights are following this order.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out to the Deputy two sections of this Bill which contain complete mistakes and inaccuracies which suggest that the Bill is not thought out in any great detail.  It has been rushed before the House.</P>
      <P>There is another more fundamental aspect to this Bill.  That is the whole question of compensation.  Compensation under this Bill has been left to the land clauses legislation which is the normal type of compensation that is given for compulsory acquisition of land for, say, a motorway.  However, when a motorway is constructed and a business is no longer able to trade as a result of the construction, unless that business has actually lost land, unless it has had land acquired from it in the course of the construction of the motorway, that business is not entitled to compensation. That is an issue that will arise on the implementation of this Bill and lead to further challenges in the courts.</P>
      <P>These are a number of technical aspects of the Bill to which we on this side of the House will be returning on Committee Stage.  I draw attention to them to substantiate my more general point that I do not accept that the proposals of the Government on this subject have been fully thought through.  I realise the matter now rests with the European Commission in Brussels, and the speculation is that the Commission will insist that the Government proceed with three lines rather than two so that we will have a measure of integration at least within the Luas system.  Deputy Broughan will be happy to know, therefore, that there is still a possibility of a line going to the north side under this proposal.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Broughan.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill and congratulate the Minister for Transport Energy and Communications.  Deputy Lowry, and his departmental officials on producing the legislation.</P>
      <P>In common with most other Dubliners in recent decades I have become very frustrated at the virtual strangulation of the city by private and commercial vehicles.  For too long the official response to this chaos was lacking in vision and starved of funding.  The poverty of thought and resources has inflicted major scars on the city, many of which are still there today.  The road widening and the urban motorway schemes in the 1970s and 1980s, some of which were started and not finished, and some of which were never started, are the most obvious examples of the misguided strategies embarked upon by local and national government in those days.</P>
      <P>I am glad the days of addressing Dublin's transportation problems with shortsighted &ldquo;sticking plaster&rdquo; solutions are over.  It is, nonetheless, worth remembering the social, cultural and environmental destruction that was visited upon our city by well intentioned but fundamentally flawed projects.  Short-term solutions to structural problems have singularly failed to tackle Dublin's transport problems.  If anything they have made them worse.  There are serious lessons to be learned from this sorry experience that can apply to any other policy areas.  Dublin's transportation policy is now being formulated and implemented in a coherent and structured manner.  This approach owes much to the tremendous work undertaken for many years by the Dublin Transportation Initiative and I pay tribute to all involved who contributed to it. Without their work I very much doubt if we would be debating this Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTI produced a framework within which transport in Dublin can be <Col N="1137" /> successfully addressed.  However, this issue presents us with real challenges and opportunities.  Let there be no doubt that what we are talking about goes beyond railway lines, capital investment options and strategic interchange facilities.  This debate is about seizing the opportunity to fashion a vibrant environmentally conscious city.</P>
    <P>The political establishment must accept responsibility for the fact that, for decades, civic pride has been tragically eroded.  The old political establishment of the State, notional and local, presided over the erection of soulless housing estates.  They created places, not where people could live and communities thrive, but merely row upon row of bleak billets where people merely exist.  The components necessary to support real community life were dismissed as extravagant extras suitable only for the more affluent suburbs. Sports and recreational facilities, community centres and attractive green-spaces were, sadly, the preserve of the better off and were not provided in any structured way for the new, sprawling. working class suburbs.  Community life was undermined by the incompetent and parsimonious diktat of previous generations of officialdom and today we are living with the conequences of their short-sighted policy decisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a crucial element of our approach to transport in Dublin.  This approach is an integrated one where light rail, quality bus corridors and the extension of the existing DART line will provide our citizens with an efficient, dependable public transport service. One of its core objectives, which I strongly support, is to reduce the number of commercial and private vehicles which use the city centre and choke our streets.  Let there be no doubt that if this integrated project is not implemented successfully, the results will be disastrous and a great opportunity will have been lost.  Traffic chaos in the city is getting worse by the day, leading to more congestion, more pollution, greater fuel consumption and a greater incidence of road traffic accidents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> A living city must use its road space to move people, not vehicles.  We have to provide high quality public transport that encourages and rewards commuters for using it.  However, we appreciate that LRT is only one part of that solution. Even with the system up and running the majority of people travelling to and from the city will do so by bus.  The upgrading and extension by quality bus corridors are vital to the success of this overall strategy.  With LRT we will be creating a public transport project that has as its central feature a priority over private and commercial vehicles in terms of road space.</P>
    <P>The project we are currently undertaking will go a long way to providing our capital city with the transport system it deserves.  There are, however, points about its operation that are vital to its success.  The successful completion of the LRT network will provide Dublin with three modes of public transport and they must be integrated in a consumer friendly manner.  Consumers should not have to pay separate fares or use different prepaid tickets to avail of these services.  The zonal ticket system that operates in many European cities needs to be introduced to streamline the three public transport options.</P>
    <P>Park and ride facilities located at the outskirts of the core city area must be provided to cater for commuters from beyond the greater Dublin area and indeed for those who still wish to bring their cars part of the way into town. These park and ride facilities must be of the highest standard where customers will feel it is safe and economical to leave their cars outside the city centre. This will not only contribute to the overall reduction of traffic on our streets but will also reduce the need to erect more multistorey carparks that blight the streetscape of many parts of central Dublin.</P>
    <P>Luas must provide a regular late night service that operates at a greater frequency than the Nite-Link operated by Dublin Bus &mdash; however, the DART does not operate a late night service.  My colleagues in the House who serve on <Col N="1139" /> Dublin Corporation will be aware of the vocal representations made by taxi men and women in recent months on late night public transport.  It is in the interests of consumers and transport operators that we fashion a late night transport system in Dublin that accommodates the lifestyles of all the city's inhabitants, people who work late at night, younger people or others who want to avail of entertainment in the city centre.  In spite of recent improvements we are a long way from achieving this goal and Luas must have some role in addressing this flaw.</P>
    <P>The Luas project presents us with an excellent opportunity to accommodate what has become the Cinderella of transport in Dublin, the bicycle, which is the most environmentally friendly form of transport available.  In recent years some progress has been made in accommodating bicycles in the city centre but we have a long way to go.  The LRT network will provide the option of establishing parallel bicycle paths and I hope this will be examined.</P>
    <P>In the coming years we will make strides in addressing Dublin's transport requirements and in doing so, bring into play some of the most important and expensive engineering projects ever seen in this State.  The port tunnel project to which Deputy Bertie Ahern referred can proceed only with the support of the local communities most directly affected by their construction and that is why the public consultation process in these areas is so critical.  In my own constituency, Dublin North Central, the proposed port tunnel project is experiencing vocal resistance from communities in Marino, Whitehall and East Wall, pretty much all along its construction path.  I am sorry to report that the consultation process for this project has singularly failed to address the concerns and take account of these people.  Many people living in these areas regard the consultation that has taken place as merely PR and can see no effort to take on board their suggestions or concerns.  One of the reasons <Col N="1140" /> for this distrust is that local groups have not been offered help or assistance in carrying out or commissioning independent research on this issue.  I will return to this point on a different occasion.  It is critical that with all major engineering projects or developments of this kind, local interest groups and community groups are given an independent facility for research.  I refer in passing to a report in today's newspaper on the method being used for tunnelling in Marino called the New Austrian Tunnelling Method.  Following a collapse at Heathrow Airport the Health and Safety Executive in Britain suggests in its recent report that this particular method is anything but safe.  The report is damning and it seems that there is a long way to go before the process that Deputy Bertie Ahern so happily claimed to have initiated is brought to completion.</P>
    <P>I will refer only briefly to other aspects of Luas that have been referred to by other Deputies &mdash; I am conscious of time and wish to share mine with Deputy Broughan &mdash; principally the delay for Ballymun and Dublin Airport. Dublin Airport must be unique in being one of the few international airports, if not the only international airport in Europe, that does not have a rapid rail transport service to the city centre. There has been a massive increase in recent years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join my colleague as I did at the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy in congratulating the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, for progressing Luas so swiftly and introducing the Bill.  Fianna Fáil seems to have been hemming and hawing about aspects of the Bill when it is imperative that we make a start on the process.</P>
      <P>The development of Luas is a key element in the revitalisation of Dublin city centre.  I was a member of the Dublin Transportation Initiative and there were fairly extensive consultations with business and other interests over three or four years.  I and Deputy Lawlor are members of the special committee of Dublin Chamber of Commerce and I am astonished the Chamber of Commerce has now decided to make submissions about major problems in the building of the light rail system.  The city centre lost and continues to lose heavily to suburban malls and shopping centres. It is imperative that we proceed with a public transport system which will enable the one million plus people of Dublin to utilise all the city centre facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my membership of DTI, I made it clear I was not a Luas person, but a DART man.  The best submission we got was to build an integrated DART system for Dublin.  I am lucky half of my constituency has a DART network.  One has only to compare the traffic conditions in Dublin North-West to see what a huge difference DART makes to Dublin North-East.  Why did we not proceed with it?  The Minister <Col N="1142" /> said the fundamental reason was finance. The majority of Members of this House were not prepared to give Dublin £400 million to build a modern metro or DART system.  The most they would give was £200 million.  It was a harsh political reality that the rural Members of larger parties were not prepared to give Dublin this facility.  That is one of the reasons we are proceeding with Luas.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to show flexibility because Dublin business are <Col N="1144" /> behind the project.  Traffic situation in Dublin is almost gridlocked.  One has only to travel up and down the quays to realise how much we need an integrated public transport system as soon as possible to reduce the volume of traffic.  It is unfortunate that we have had to wait until 1996-97 to take the necessary steps.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right to proceed with the lines in question and then he should develop the public transport system on the north and west sides of Dublin which have been neglected by Fianna Fáil under the leadership of Mr. C.J. Haughey and Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea of improving the transport system.  Since I was first elected to Dublin City Council in 1985 the idea of a properly integrated public transport system needed to be addressed.  I am delighted it is finally being addressed.</P>
      <P>The problem of Dublin's transport system have been addressed in three different ways at local authority level. The first is to improve the road system. I am happy we changed what the road engineers proposed because it concentrated on cars which are detrimental to Dublin city in the long-term.  The second is traffic management, which is an essential part of this three pronged approach and which we are not pushing as hard as we should.  The third is public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> I agree with previous speakers who-mentioned the public transport system in Dublin and the row about taxis.</P>
    <P>A good point made by taxi drivers &mdash; is that they are expected to drive everybody home after 11.30 p.m. when the public transportation system closes down. We should ensure the system runs later to allow people get in and out of the city late at night.</P>
    <P>The Chamber of Commerce and others have raised the question of traffic flow during construction.  We will have to accept that there will be difficulties and try to minimise disruption as much as possible.  If properly managed, the damage to city centre businesses can be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The Government asked Dublin Corporation to ensure that as much work as possible was done in the first six months of the year so that the streets would not be dug up during the Presidency.  When we last held it the Democratic Left members of the city council &mdash; the party was then known as the Workers' Party &mdash; said it was outrageous that the streets were dug up to allow Ministers glide freely through the city.  The streets are being dug up to allow Democratic Left Ministers in their Mercedes glide comfortably through the city.  Times have changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>I never thought I would see that day.  I hope they appreciated the reasons many people are anxious that disruption is kept to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must accept some but not all of the responsibility for the delays in seeking funding for the project. These have been unfortunate.  It is ridiculous to suggest that he is not responsible.  He made the announcement, we saw maps and public meetings were held in my constituency to inform people what exactly would happen. There was no mention, however, of the Ballymun line in the wonderful colour brochures.  It is nonsense to suggest, <Col N="1146" /> therefore, that the matter is still under consideration.  It was never mentioned that we would not receive EU money for the three lines.  The matter is too important, however, for us to get bogged down in a discussion of that issue.  I welcome the fact that we are proceeding to the next stage as Dublin badly needs a proper public transport system.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Members who said there is a need for consultation with local communities who believe &mdash; the legislation shows this &mdash; the authorities, if they wish, can push this project through without listening to their concerns. For example, people in my constituency want to know exactly where the Ranelagh station will be located. Will the people living in Mander's Terrace be affected?  Business interests and residents in the area want to make an input and to be reassured that they will be listened to.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of cycleways which are another cog in the wheel of the transportation system, but a number of people have expressed concern that access to them may be gained through their back gardens.  Their properties have already been broken into and they are anxious there are proper security measures to ensure access cannot be gained from cycleways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that Deputy McDowell who lives in Ranelagh has heard something different, but nobody has told me local residents are against the project, most are enthusiastic.  Some have mentioned noise levels.  The DART passes by the side of my garden but with the passage of time I got used to it.  With modern systems, noise is kept to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather it will take up to two months to complete the study, but could it take longer?  If it comes down in favour of the Ballymun line, will the decision to provide the Harcourt Street line be affected?  It is essential that this line be <Col N="1147" /> extended from Dundrum to Sandyford Industrial Estate because of the huge number of people working within it. This would make the line more commercially viable.  It would be ludicrous not to do so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned mainly about the consultation process.  Many people believe they will not be listened to and, despite their objections, the project will be rammed through.  This matter will have to be addressed on Committee Stage.  If we fail to address it, more community groups will oppose the project and that would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  It is essential that our transportation system is improved.  In the long-term the project will benefit the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for substantial Government investment to meet our transport needs and alleviate the difficulties being experienced.  One has to come to the conclusion on the Minister's proposals that the financial cloth has been cut to measure.  As Deputy Broughan mentioned, the proposed system has been dictated by the available funding.  The extension of the Harcourt Street line to Sandyford Industrial Estate &mdash; this seems logical and reasonable &mdash; has been raised by many while the third line to Ballymun with a possible connection to the airport has been raised by the European Union. These are fundamental questions as we embark on a process to find a solution to the city's transportation problems and meet its needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party's spokesperson, Deputy Séamus Brennan, dealt at great length with the various sections about which concern has been expressed.  I would like to correct a comment about the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  All it has done to date is reflect the concerns of business people.  One of the main concerns has arisen in the Kilmainham area where the owner of a reasonably large business is of the opinion that the building of the Luas line is incompatible <Col N="1148" /> with normal transport requirements because the existing narrow street is not suitable for the loading and unloading of trucks.  The decision was made to launch the scheme and details of the route were announced but the people directly affected were not allowed to have their say.  The Minister went about this matter in the wrong way; he announced the proposal and then told the people affected that they must wait until the Bill is enacted and all the judicial procedures have been gone through before they can have their say.</P>
    <P>In responding to the Minister's contribution, Deputy Brennan drew the comparison with the Cork-Dublin gas line Bill which contained the major requirement to enter people's properties and under which a major public service would be provided in an efficient way. The terms and conditions of that Bill <i>vis-á-vis</i> the relationship developed with the Irish Farmers Association and other interested bodies provided the possibility of making a major achievement in a co-operative way.</P>
    <P>The fragmentation of responsibility for transport in Dublin is a matter of major concern.  At this late stage the National Roads Authority has decided to ask the Dublin Transportation Office, in the aftermath of the DTI study, to comment on the tolling scheme publicly advertised and on which submissions have been made.  In other words, one arm of the State which is responsible for construction on the national and primary motorway network is requesting a comment from another arm of the State.  It defies logic that that issue was not dealt with at the time of the DTI study, but that is the reality.</P>
    <P>The Cork Street and North King Street areas, and other areas for which road schemes have been planned over many years, are choked with traffic.  As a result of a plethora of problems involving CPOs, legal arguments, the rights of private property owners, judicial reviews, High Court actions, etc., the State and its agencies cannot <Col N="1149" /> get on with doing what is best for the common good.</P>
    <P>The roads departments of Dublin Corporation and Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire local authorities are linked to the road engineering section of the Department of the Environment which provides funding for various projects not in the national primary network. Dublin traffic has become choked due to excessive car use.</P>
    <P>I want to give credit for the limited rail service available to people living in the west side of Dublin for several years.  The provision of that service came about in a rather peculiar way. The Pope was arriving to say Mass in the Phoenix Park and it was decided to open the Ashtown railway station that morning to link up with various other rail networks &mdash; the station had been closed for the previous 20 years.  Following the opening of the station I and other people from that area of Dublin lobbied vigorously the then Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  We told him that the opening of this small station was proof that the railway network could act as a commuting as well as a national rail network.  Following that lobbying, CIE decided to provide a basic rail service.</P>
    <P>The people in that area are crying out for another line to serve Maynooth, which should have been built many years ago, but the arguments for and against it continue.  There was a proposal to reopen the line under the Phoenix Park and link it to Connolly and Pearse Street stations but that was not proceeded with.  A basic service was provided to and from north Kildare but that was merely a half-baked attempt to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that we have a State transport company, the National Roads Authority, Dublin Transportation, which is now a State organisation, and all the roads departments of the various local authorities, it appears that a cohesive, dynamic, pragmatic approach is not being taken to solving Dublin's rail and road transportation problems.  Perhaps it can be done under the umbrella of <Col N="1150" /> this Bill by way of amendments tabled by my party, but there is an urgent need for somebody to be given the overall responsibility for carrying out the type of work that is so essential to Dublin.</P>
    <P>If one stands at the roundabout outside the Red Cow Inn any morning between 7 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. one can see the tremendous inflow of traffic from Naas, north Kildare and beyond. The position is the same on the Galway road.  A huge number of people live substantial distances outside Dublin but work in Dublin and they will drive to work irrespective of the type of public transport system being provided within the environs of the city.  A similar problem exists in the sprawling urban areas and that tends to fragment the usage of the public transport systems provided. As the town of Tallaght comes of age, a great deal of industry is being located there and the percentage of the town's population travelling to the city on a daily basis is reducing.  As a result, the economics of these schemes are questionable.</P>
    <P>The proposal for an underground rail system between the canals is worthy of consideration because, due to financial limitations we do not appear to be tackling Dublin's transport problems.  The issue of transport bonds which could, over a 40 or 50 year period, raise the necessary funds to build an underground system &mdash; approximately £400 million &mdash; should be considered.</P>
    <P>One of the most unacceptable aspects of this proposal is that following the building of the new Luas system, we will continue to have excessive car usage on the roads and the problem will not have been solved because of the physical limitations of the city streets and the lack of outlying services.  People will continue to use their cars and the Luas system will serve a smaller population than is desirable to make it both effective and efficient in solving the city's transport problems.</P>
    <P>The Government intends to proceed with this proposal.  It may or may not accept amendments to the Bill but when the Bill comes into law Iarnród Éireann <Col N="1151" /> will be given the task of proceeding with the light rail option proposed.  There is a need, however, to bring all the other areas to which I have referred into play and to have some form of cohesion.  I do not see any reference in the Bill to the Dublin Transportation Office opened recently by the Minister for the Environment. I assume that office will have an overview of the solution to Dublin's transportation problems and I hope it will bring together the other arms of the State with responsibilities in this area which may result in substantial overhead savings being made.  It is not clear from the Bill as to whether it will be CIE, a new company or a subsidiary which will take on responsibility for the DART system also.  Will the company involved take on responsibility for the commuter dimension of the Arrow and the Maynooth single line commuter systems? I have been pressing CIE to consider opening the Lucan south railway station but so far it has not agreed to do so.  Yet in a sparsely populated area, such as Hazelhatch in County Kildare, there is a station serving some 300 to 500 people who live within a three or five mile radius of that station while in Lucan, where there are approximately 20,000 people, there is no station.  One wonders how the economics of the issue relate to the type of service being provided.</P>
    <P>This fragmentation is unfortunate because it does not serve effectively the population of Dublin, which exceeds one million people.  Although it is not within the brief of the Minister responsible for this Bill, the urgent Dublin Corporation road schemes, such as on Cork Street, with which Deputy Eric Byrne will be familiar, and North King Street, have being crying out for attention for years.  None of this, however, will change the fact that there are fish and fruit markets in the heart of the city, that 40 foot containers come and go, and will continue to do so.  We will not get the container traffic off the quays until there is access by tunnel to the port.  These road projects are all exciting <Col N="1152" /> and badly needed and will involve many hundreds of millions of pounds but I sincerely hope that a similar situation will not arise in their management to what occurred with the southern cross motorway scheme.  Due to prevailing cumbersome legalities, somebody can hold up the final loop of a motorway around the capital city, costing about £100 million, because they are unhappy with the compulsory purchasing orders. The people involved do not want their properties acquired at all.  I do not think the problem was one of money but of the ability of those people legally to cause such frustration in respect of something which was being provided for the greater good.  If the small project in Kilmainham follows that procedure, there will be the same legal potential to frustrate an important public facility according to my interpretation of the Bill.  I hope that will not be the case and that the Minister, his parliamentary draftsmen and the Attorney General have adequately thought that through.  I know Deputy Brennan asked the Minister to provide the Attorney General's briefing on how those issues have been addressed.</P>
    <P>I hope the scheme will be as successful as the Minister claims it will be.  I trust that the EU Commission will suggest that the third line and the extensions to the two existing lines be added to the project.  Whether it be by way of off balance sheet financing or some sort of Dublin transportation bond issue, the moneys should be found now so that as it is done, it is done correctly rather than doing 60, 70 or 80 per cent of the job. One can understand fully the limitations on the Department of Finance and the Minister's straitjacket under the national plan.  Transportation has attracted a substantial figure but if it falls short of tackling Dublin's real transport problems, it should be examined. We are talking of something that may be in place without change for 50 years or more so you really cannot afford to get it wrong.  It cannot be done in a piecemeal way and we cannot say we will look at the northern line and the <Col N="1153" /> extension to Sandyford, etc., later.  That would be backing off funding a proper solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept amendments on Committee Stage so that the Bill has a smooth passage.</P>

      <P>Light rail is not necessarily a new transportation system for Dublin as there was a comprehensive tram system in the city until a couple of decades ago when it was abolished in the name of progress.  Now, in the name of progress, an updated version of that system is being resurrected which we hope will be with us for good.</P>
      <P>Since 1960, the number of cars in daily use in Dublin has mushroomed as every community in the city is aware. More than 87,000 new cars were sold last year and there was an 8 per cent increase in car registration.  Despite the fact that the number of cars per head of population in Ireland is still half that of Germany, Dubliners still find themselves caught in what could be described as a permanent traffic jam unlike certain cities in the UK and on the Continent. Wartime bombing, which we were lucky to escape, did not provide our city planners with the opportunity to build new streets capable of taking 20th-century traffic as it did on mainland Europe.</P>
      <P>Dublin's inner city streets were conceived in the age of the horse and buggy.  Today they are required to cope not only with the occasional horse and buggy but also with cars, fuel tankers, articulated vehicles and the like.  In 1996, the short trip by car from Cork Street, which Deputy Lawlor mentioned, to Leinster House can take around three-quarters of an hour.  The sad reality of the cars on the road today is that most of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;contain only one occupant.  The current situation is clearly untenable, not only in terms of sheer inconvenience to Dublin's residents, visitors and workers but also in terms of pollution and the damage to the business environment of commercial inaccessibility.</P>
      <P>This problem has not arisen overnight and I understand several attempts have been made to address it over the years. Eighteen years ago the Transport Consultative Commission was established to examine transport in the greater Dublin area and it recommended the establishment of a Dublin transport authority with an integrated planning and development mandate.  I remember the commission well and applauded it at that time.  However, just 12 months after its establishment, Fianna Fáil in its wisdom, an attribute in which it was clearly lacking, dissolved the authority.  As with many matters this Government must pick up the pieces.</P>
      <P>Today there is the Dublin Transportation Initiative which was conceived as ongoing with permanent structures and which one hopes will be rather longer lived and more effective than its predecessors. The DTI's twin aims are to restore life to the centre of Dublin keeping the commercial life of the city alive while encouraging commuters to switch from private vehicles to public transport. Like the TCC, the DTI has emphasised the need to use existing resources and enforce traffic regulations, which, sadly, are not being enforced at present. I travel down Harold's Cross Road every morning during the hours in which traffic is prohibited from occupying the bus lane and I have never seen a Garda penalise motorists who enter that lane.  We can have all the plans and schemes in the world, such as light rail systems complemented by other forms of public transport, but without the proper enforcement of the law the whole system can be brought to a standstill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attempts to date which aimed at <Col N="1155" /> encouraging commuters to switch to public transport have fallen at the first hurdles because the quality of our existing public transport services and buses, in particular, is abysmal.  Lumbering double decker buses are outdated.  Like the first cuckoo of spring, spotting one on many of the routes to which they are assigned is an occasion for celebration and letters to <i>The Irish Times.</i> The Dublin Transportation Initiative's central recommendation for improving public transport in Dublin was the introduction of a light rail system with a core network of lines to Tallaght and Ballymun and a proposed expansion to Finglas and Swords once the core network was complete.  We are all aware that Ireland is not the only EU country opting for light rail in an effort to get commuters out of their cars and into public transport.</P>
    <P>I took time off, not by way of a junket but at my own expense, to visit Grenoble in France.  The experience of the two systems in Grenoble and Sheffield has been that light rail is not only efficient and user friendly but it has succeeded in restoring life to inner city areas.  If politicians are to be encouraged to take trips abroad I suggest they be sent to Grenoble to see a most magnificent light rail system which, I understand, is the system we are about to mimic here.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the plans for a light rail system I am anxious that communities affected &mdash; to which I think Deputy Gregory will refer &mdash; will be consulted as widely as possible and the impact on Dublin's built environment be taken into account.  In this regard I look forward to the environmental impact statement, the parameters of which are outlined in the Bill.  I welcome also the stipulation for a full public inquiry into the application for a light railway order and that it will <Col N="1156" /> be open to members of the public to appear and to be heard at this inquiry.</P>
      <P>I am slightly amused at the criticism from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and others at this, the eleventh hour. The Dublin Transportation Initiative, of which I was a member, praised the consultants who were given the task of providing information to the public on what was involved in the DTI.  I recall vividly their staff stopping traffic along the Grand Canal, huge traffic jams while interviews were taking place, and leaflets being distributed concerning what was going on.  The public meetings which were held, many in my constitutency, were not well attended but certainly there was an effort to inform the public as to what DTI was about.  Now at the eleventh hour Dublin Chamber of Commerce is out of line with the thinking at that time and their colleagues in the inner city.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone will seriously dispute the need for a light rail system irrespective of what the Dublin Chamber of Commerce may say.  At the same time we should not minimise the effect on our urban environment.  It is inevitable there will be so-called pinch points, areas where buildings will have to be demolished to make way for the rail system.  I am aware of the concerns voiced by residents in the Arran Quay Terrace area of the north inner city.  I hope those concerns will be taken on board and that any compensation payments which may be made will more than adequately reflected market values.  I am also aware of concerns in the Kilmainham area that businesses will be affected.  These concerns must be addressed in such a way as to ensure that the disruption is minimised and that the LRT, when complete, facilitates rather than impedes commercial activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years much of the urban decay affecting the Dublin inner city has been reversed, thanks largely to innovative urban renewal programmes.  I will press to ensure that where buildings have to be demolished Dublin Corporation will use its compulsory purchase <Col N="1157" /> powers to ensure there is surrounding redevelopment and not derelict sites.</P>
    <P>The light rail system is a welcome innovation and I look forward to its completion on target.  We should not kid ourselves that light rail, of itself, will solve all our transportation problems. Light rail is simply one component of the broader public transport network which must be made user friendly and accountable.  If commuters are to be persuaded to switch to public transport they must be assured of a service which is reliable, safe and accessible.  In that regard I would welcome the formation of a special traffic police unit which would, relieve hard pressed gardaí engaged in the fight against crime and ensure that traffic is properly regulated and provisions made for public transport, such as designated bus lanes, are respected.</P>
    <P>In the longer term we will have to examine the possibility of energy taxes and other measures which will provide effective disincentives to car use while providing parallel incentives for the use of public transport.  The light rail system is just the first step towards solving Dublin's traffic problems.  I hope we will build on the gains already made and that the city's transport needs will continue to receive ongoing priority attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for sharing with me the remaining minutes of his time and also Deputy Ahern who agreed to share some of his time, if I need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer briefly to a comment by Deputy Lawlor &mdash; who I hope I am not misinterpreting &mdash; to the effect that a small business in Kilmainham should have no rights good, bad or indifferent, that the Minister should amend the Bill to ensure that the light rail scheme can bulldoze small businesses out of the way as long as they happen to be in Kilmainham and not in Deputy Lawlor's constituency. If it was a major speculative business interest the ethos of this State and this democracy is that such an interest would dictate the development <Col N="1158" /> of the scheme, whatever it was, and not what is being suggested in relation to a small business in Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to listen to Deputy Byrne and previous speakers, all of whom referred to the LRT system in Dublin city as creating an environmentally conscious city and contributing to a living city.  If I recall correctly, Deputy Byrne referred to it as &ldquo;restoring life to the centre of Dublin&rdquo;.  My experience and that of the other elected representatives in Dublin Central is the opposite. This need not necessarily be the case. Instead of a consultative process whereby communities and business interests are consulted and a route is agreed, based on consultation and fulfilling other appropriate needs, so far as I can establish the routes have been decided down to the last detail and now a consultative process is under way.  In one instance, in Arran Quay Terrace, residents from the one remaining established 100 year old community in the Smithfield-Benburb Street area, behind the Four Courts, on the north side, face destruction because of the LRT preferred route, as it is now being described, following all the dereliction for road widening plans which did not get off the ground.  Residents were told by the public relations consultants promoting the LRT that although there would be an environmental impact study and a public inquiry they should not worry about it as it would not affect the route, their future or their position. That type of attitude and approach leads to confrontation, not consultation. The last thing needed at this juncture is confrontation.  That can be avoided at both flash points in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>Small businesses in the Kilmainham area face obliteration but, because they are small, Deputy Lawlor appears to believe they do not have rights.  They have the same democratic right as everybody else and it is my role to voice their concerns in this House.  Arran Quay Terrace and St. John's Terrace in Mount Brown face demolition, but the people of those areas have rights and <Col N="1159" /> their views should be considered.  In both cases straightforward alternative routes are available, but the LRT people, particularly the consultants, are not willing to examine them.  I am told the Minister wants agreement on a route arrived at by consultation and agreement and that he does not want communities forced into confrontation, but that is not the way the LRT people are approaching matters.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of this year I have been seeking the detailed LRT proposals for two parts of my constituency in Dublin Central.  The design team promised to submit them to me in March or April but I still have not received them.  I understand other public representatives have been treated in a similar fashion.  At its last general purposes committee meeting, Dublin Corporation's elected representatives were still waiting for the detailed proposals.  I do not know why this is the case, but there certainly has not been effective consultation on the LRT system.  Proper consultation and local knowledge &mdash; an essential ingredient in any consultation process &mdash; would have avoided the flashpoints that will arise.  If this attempt to streamroll through the proposals against the wishes of local communities continues, the light rail system is heading for disaster.</P>
    <P>I have been an elected representative since 1979, first to the city council and later to this House.  This is the first time I have known a public body to refuse to attend a meeting with local residents if their elected representatives were present.  CIE told residents that they would be happy to meet them, but not if their elected representatives were present.  It is ironic that as a result of a series of Dáil questions I tabled on this matter a joint meeting between the residents, their elected representatives and the LRT people will take place tonight in the Arran Quay Terrace district.</P>
    <P>From the replies I received to those questions it is obvious that not only are we being misled by the LRT people but the Minister is also being misled.  In <Col N="1160" /> reply to a Dáil question tabled on 21 May 1996 he stated that it would be misleading to suggest that CIE or its public relations consultants are pursuing a policy of excluding public representatives from meetings to discuss the proposed light rail network, but the facts contradict that.  The elected representatives did not ask to attend those meetings. The residents wanted us to represent them and we readily agreed.  The approach adopted by the LRT people will lead to disaster.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that the alternative routes proposed for the Old Kilmainham and the Arran Quay Terrace areas are given proper consideration? An alternative agreed route that would be equally effective for the transport needs of the city could be found without the destruction of those communities. A survey carried out by small businesses in the Kilmainham district showed that several hundred jobs will be lost if the present preferred route is proceeded with.  Will the Minister ensure that an agreed route is found in both those cases?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I was a CIE employee for a number of years and a member of the DTA in the mid-1980s. I am a member of the DTI steering committee and hope to be a member of the DTO.  Therefore, like all Dublin Members, I have a great interest in public transport.  I welcome the Government's decision to proceed with a light rail system.  Whether the matter has been handled correctly or fairly or whether this Bill has the necessary machinery to get the business done is another matter.  Our party spokesperson, Deputy Brennan, dealt with the Bill in great detail and outlined a number of flaws in the proposed system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had many reports on Dublin traffic, all of which are gathering dust. There was great goodwill in compiling those reports, but resources were not available to implement their proposals. The position looked good in the mid-1980s when the DTA was set up, but <Col N="1161" /> unfortunately, many harsh decisions were made in 1987.  The then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, established the DTA, but he will not be remembered for some of his other decisions relating to CIE.  Following the setbacks in 1987 it took a number of years for the Government to establish the DTI and it has received much attention in the past three or four years.  I am glad the Government is acting on its recommendations and I hope future Governments do not cherry pick parts of that strategy.</P>
    <P>While resources have been provided for the light rail system, they will not be sufficient.  The monthly reports received by members of the DTI committee showed that the cost of the three lines increased each month while resources decreased.  It was obvious this would lead to difficulties.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome other aspects of the DTI, particularly the appointment of a director of traffic.  I will not criticise the Garda &mdash; it has other matters on its mind &mdash; for its inattention to traffic in Dublin.  It is obviously well down its list of priorities.  Whenever there is a shortage of manpower for crime detection, resources are transferred to that area.  I look forward to the appointment of a director of traffic as progress in that area seems to be very slow.  Some months ago a consultant was appointed to devise functions for the director of traffic, to see whether that person could interlink with corporation departments, transport providers and so on, but I am concerned that he has not yet reported.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that trams have made a comeback.  When I did my institution of transport examinations 20 years ago the theory was that trams were a thing of the past; one had to go on a continental holiday to see a tram.  We were told at the time that they were inflexible, that if there was a traffic jam they could not operate properly and that the electric wires necessary for their operation were environmentally unfriendly.  It is extraordinary matters have come full circle and that we are now witnessing a return of the tram.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> It does not seem very long &mdash; perhaps I am giving away my age &mdash; since tram tracks were dug up on Drumcondra Road, although I do not remember the trams in operation there.  I do not know who is to blame for the short-sighted policy to remove those tracks, but we are now talking about rebuilding them and reopening the Harcourt Street line. Most countries have got rid of trams but they still exist in Holland, Belgium and Switzerland and in some German cities. Since those countries had the basic infrastructure it was easy for them to upgrade the system.</P>
    <P>I am totally committed to public transport but, to change its image, dramatic measures must be taken.  Very often the perception is that people take the bus because they have no alternative. When the DART line was established it was fashionable and correct to use that service, but generally there seems to be an image problem with public transport.  I am against spending £200 million on a new system when we could, for example, upgrade our bus service.  I have been involved in discussions at corporation level on extending bus lanes and clearways.  If we are to have quality bus corridors we must have 24-hour clearways, yet proposals to introduce them, even on very small strips, are met with great opposition from business people and those living nearby.  With the introduction of the light rail system, parking will be banned to make way for tracks.  Rather than spend £200 million on a light rail system we should introduce round-the-clock clearways.  I am not against a light rail system, but with a much improved bus service there would be no need to spend £200 million on such a system.  Tough decisions must be taken, even if it means preventing people from parking outside their doors.</P>
    <P>Since the light rail proposal was first put forward the estimates for the three lines have steadily increased.  In view of the rivalry between the north and south sides of Dublin, there is great disappointment on the north side about the Government decision to provide two <Col N="1163" /> lines on the south side in the first phase, with none on the north side.  I understand that recommendation was made by the engineers on the basis that it would be easier to construct lines on the south side and there is a greater possibility of persuading commuters to use the lines there.  However, the decision has led to much anger and bitterness on the north side.  People there expected the three Ministers in the area to look after them.  After the Government decision was made, leaks appeared in the paper, particularly from the Democratic Left Minister, about his unhappiness with the decision.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Lowry, is to be congratulated in that this was one decision where Fine Gael did not give in to the other parties.  If the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, was unhappy with the decision he should have expressed his point of view at the time.</P>
    <P>I would not label myself as a great European, but we on the north side are relying on Brussels to change the decision or at least get a definite commitment from the Government that the technical work on the Ballymun line will start in the first phase but if that is done it may be a hollow victory unless the EU provides increased resources to carry out the work.  Perhaps the obvious solution would be to try to find the money to construct all three lines in phase one.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider extending the present plan to include O'Connell Street and Parnell Square, linking the system with the DART line and other transport facilities such as Connolly station, Busáras and so on.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Tourism and Trade to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; take action to promote more even growth in tourist numbers and income in the regions and in the off-peak season;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to ensure that available finances and resources are no longer employed to further exacerbate regional imbalances;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to develop marketing strategies which place more emphasis on quality and income generation than on numbers;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to initiate and support integrated development at local level which will achieve sustained growth in tourism income;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to address the lack of co-ordination of State and other grant-aiding agencies involved in tourism. </P>
      <P>and urges the setting up of a national co-ordinated manpower development plan for training in the area of services to tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion because of the depth of feeling among its members at the failure of the Government to realise and develop the potential of the tourism industry.  It is fair to say that there is great frustration among those working in the industry and interest groups at the absence of progress on tourism initiatives.  The Government has adopted a back seat approach to tourism.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade is not driving change in this area; rather he is adopting a bystander approach, which is unacceptable.  The Minister needs to be at the cutting edge of this industry and to show leadership and vision.  Unfortunately, this has not happened and there is a great danger that his inaction will <Col N="1165" /> cool the white heat of the tourism revolution to a dull glow and slow down Ireland's development.</P>
    <P>The evidence of the lack of priority given by the Government to tourism is clear from the allocations in the Estimates. Since the Minister took office overall spending on tourism and trade has declined by 11.1 per cent in real terms.  This is a short-sighted view by the Government as tourism and trade present some of the greatest opportunities for the State.  This is an important time to keep the spending in this area up, particularly having regard to the ongoing uncertainty about Northern Ireland.  International audiences need to be reassured that matters are on an even keel; otherwise the progress made over the past 18 months could well be lost.</P>
    <P>Tourism now provides employment for more than 90,000 people and will soon, if it is not already, be the most important sector in the economy, contributing huge amounts of GNP.  Instead of nurturing and encouraging this sector the Government has adopted a negative approach to it.  For example, in this year's Estimates the grant for Bord Fáilte is down 10 per cent while the grant for tourism development works is down 46 per cent.  These cuts are being introduced at a time when costs in the Department for consultancy services are up 79 per cent.  Overhead costs in the Department have also risen rapidly for this period, yet Bord Fáilte has to take a serious reduction.</P>
    <P>Tourism can be the engine for employment and because it is labour intensive it can generate huge numbers of jobs.  However, if it is starved of international promotion, capital and development grants then it has little hope of surviving.  Bord Fáilte welcomed the 10 per cent cut in its budget. Do turkeys vote for Christmas?  During my time in the House I have never heard a major State company with serious work and plans in hand welcome a cut in its funding.  This smacks of ministerial interference or political pressure. There is strong reason to express <Col N="1166" /> concern at the Government's treatment of the tourism sector.  For example, the sector was not even mentioned once in the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement. Given the reduction in growth rates, this sector must be encouraged and not taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Another issue which gives rise to serious concern is the ongoing fiasco involving the national conference centre. There is no doubt that Dublin and the nation as a whole badly need this centre, yet the Government appears to be doing its best to undermine the plan rather than advance it.  Earlier this year the Government prematurely called a halt to the contest for the conference centre and 13 of the groups which had submitted proposals and spent large sums of money on plans were suddenly told that the competition had been cancelled. No adequate reason was given for this decision.  This was very unprofessional to say the least, if not downright bad manners.  The RDS was then selected over the other 13 groups and asked to make a pitch even though it was supposedly one of the groups who had not met the criteria set down by the Minister.  There has been much concern about the Minister's decision to single out the RDS.  The selection of a site in Ballsbridge, which is already choked with traffic, for a major centre makes little sense.</P>
    <P>As the EU clock for funding for a conference centre ticks quickly away the Minister has decided to bring another consortium back into the bidding, the Carlton Convention Centre group.  We believe this group approached the Minister and he asked to see their submission. This is an extraordinary way of doing business.  What is going on?  The other groups which entered the competition are astonished at the carry on. Will they be allowed re-enter the race and why is all this happening at the 59th minute of the eleventh hour?  The concerns about the RDS generally were known long ago but they wait until now to do something?  This picking and choosing of applicants will result in a major multi-million pound legal action <Col N="1167" /> against the State.  I call on the Minister to inject some clarity and reality into this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may have misled the Dáil and withheld information on this matter.  When he was sent into the House on 21 May to answer questions, to bat, he told us no final decision had been taken on the RDS and negotiations were continuing with Brussels. However, he then let it slip that planning permission had been applied for at the RDS but made no mention of the re-entry of the Carlton group.  Why is the RDS applying for planning permission if another group is now in the frame?  What do the Brussels negotiations relate to?  Do they relate to the RDS only or do they also relate to the Carlton group?  Is the Government for or against the Sonas proposal?</P>
    <P>If the Sonas development becomes a reality an outstanding conference centre will be located there and 3,000 valuable jobs could come on stream.  However, if two centres go ahead they will have to compete with one another, giving rise to great difficulty.  Will the Minister of State give us full information on the conference centre?  Has the Government taken a decision on the matter? Who will pay the costs of the groups which are back in the contest?</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the project will be botched and that a major opportunity for the State will be lost.  There has already been great delay in progressing the centre which will be worth £30 million in revenue to the State each year and will create 1,500 jobs.  It is estimated that between 12 and 14 international conferences would come here every year if the centre was available.  The conference centre forms an important part of the long-term planning for the tourism industry and I would like the Minister to say if he is satisfied that the centre will be ready by the end of 1999, the date when EU funds for the project run out.</P>
    <P>The conference centre is only one part of the long-term strategic planning required but it is not being delivered <Col N="1168" /> upon by the Government.  As the motion states, there is a need for more even growth in tourist numbers and income in the regions and for the co-ordination of agencies.  Fianna Fáil has always adopted a positive and direct line in the formulation of tourism policy.  It has been, and still remains, our policy to take whatever action is necessary to maintain growth in the tourism sector at a pace which will ensure its viability as a source of ever increasing sustainable employment.  This implies the need for sensitivity, not only in regard to the needs of the country.  We must never develop a level of dependency on low cost, low margin tourism like other countries associated with some sunshine package holidays.  In order to develop the tourism industry we must invest in those features which make Ireland so attractive to tourists, without sacrificing the quality of the tourism product for what might well be short-term and short-sighted economic gain.</P>
    <P>For these reasons Fianna Fáil is committed to creating a stand alone Department of Tourism with overall responsibility for the tourism industry and for the legislative and administrative support to harness all available and necessary resources to implement tourism policy.  Tourism has become so important in the overall context to economic development that the need for this concentration of effort is self-evident.  It is with regret, that I must condemn the failure of the Government to acknowledge this need in any real way.  The Minister has not troubled the House with a heavy burden of legislative reform.  It is incredible that the Government has not initiated any legislative reform in the tourism sector, and there is no sign that there will be any during its term.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will continue to review the legislative and administrative regime governing the tourism sector and introduce such legislative measures as are necessary to ensure that our tourism industry is ready to meet the challenges of increased competition from other <Col N="1169" /> countries and reduced reliance on European Union funding.  In addition, we will assign the Minister for Tourism and Trade specific responsibility for the co-ordination of legislation affecting the tourism sector with particular regard to ensuring the protection of the environment and the preservation of cultural and historic resources.</P>
    <P>The unequal development of the regions was highlighted in a recent report of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation which noted that Ireland has out-performed most other tourist destinations in recent years.  I do not want to go into the figures in detail because of time constraints but they are fully detailed in that very helpful report.  The confederation has made a number of recommendations which include investment in additional capacity and direct ferry services from mainland Europe; promotion of tourist traffic into airports other than Dublin; cheaper car rental and specific tourist-related public transport services; positive discrimination in product development in disadvantaged regions; better marketing of regions outside Dublin and the east.  Continued investment in the growth of Dublin as a tourist destination has been questioned several times in the past 18 months since it has become apparent that the distribution of tourists is so imbalanced but the concerns expressed have fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>In tabling this motion Fianna Fáil contends attention must now be paid to these issues and an integrated national plan drawn up.  One certain way is to ensure that low-cost carriers fly into airports on the western seaboard.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions with the Minister but nothing ever appears to happen.  In this year's Estimates, Shannon Free Airport Development Company's tourism allocation has not been increased.  When inflation is taken into account, effectively its allocation is reduced by 3 per cent, representing a further cut following on a reduction of 40 per cent in 1995.  How can there be regional balance if some <Col N="1170" /> areas are starved of badly needed funding?</P>
    <P>The Minister has been slow to chart a future for Ireland as an off-season tourist destination.  We have marvellous facilities for hang-gliding, abseiling, fishing, walking and a broad spectrum of outdoor activities, all of which must be marketed and used to increase the tourist spend in off-season.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the peace process, the Dublin and midlands east region have experienced a dramatic rise in its tourism industry while other regions have experienced moderate growth rates, with Shannon, the west and south-west regions experiencing a decline in some areas.  It is to be noted that the regions outside Dublin rely for a greater proportion of their local income on tourism.  This splitting of the industry into a two-speed sector is becoming a worrying, possibly dangerous, development.</P>
    <P>Despite many assurances and limited budgetary allocations to redress this imbalance in tourist numbers and income growth, there appears to be no ministerial action to tackle this problem. If this problem is not resolved the financial strength of the Dublin market will ensure that its marketing efforts will become ever more effective compared with other regions such as Shannon, thus perpetuating this regional imbalance. The allocation of marketing budgets, especially from the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, should give first call to areas showing lower levels of growth.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister could make greater efforts to tackle transport access, the main cause of the present regional imbalance in growth.  The arrival of Ryanair and the new Stena vessel to the Dublin region has allowed greater transport access to Dublin from the United Kingdom in particular.  The other ports across Ireland, with the exception of Rosslare, have experienced no such dramatic increase in access capacity, thus stifling possible growth.</P>
    <P>My party contends the Minister could persuade his colleague, the Minister for <Col N="1171" /> Transport, Energy and Communications, to persuade semi-State companies under his remit, such as Aer Rianta, to reduce the cost of landing at Shannon and Cork Airports.  He could initiate schemes, such as that implemented by my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, which paid a grant for onward flights from major United Kingdom and European airports to Ireland for travellers from Asia, leading to a trebling of Japanese tourists here within one year.</P>
    <P>Since the 1920s the issue of seasonality had dogged the development of a vibrant tourist industry.  The problems caused by seasonality, in particular a summer season-based industry, include lack of continual income to allow for realistic capital investment plans which, in turn, create the need for grant-aid backed investment; seasonality in the levels of the requisite workforce within the industry, thus creating periods within which the substantial workforce of in excess of 90,000 have shorter working hours, lower pay and lesser favourable working conditions.</P>
    <P>Many problems that had caused seasonality have been overcome.  In the past, workers were permitted to take holidays in the summer season only. Now most workers in Europe and America are entitled to longer holiday periods, work more flexible hours and take vacations throughout the year.  An example is the rise in winter skiing holidays.  The fact that access transport and accommodation were available only in the peak season have been resolved through ultra-modern air and seaport facilities across Ireland.  Providers of accommodation and transport operators can offer much cheaper tariffs in the off-peak period.</P>
    <P>The real reason for the continued existence of an off-peak season and an uneven development of tourism are the actions of the State agencies charged with developing tourism.  For example, Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations continue to pump the majority of their marketing budgets and efforts into promoting the peak season. <Col N="1172" /> While I should make it clear there is no harm in so doing, we advocate that they look at the whole question of seasonality and off-peak season which would be of tremendous advantage nationally and locally.</P>
    <P>Our State agencies persist in thinking that foreign visitors are less likely to travel to Ireland in winter than in summer. State facilities, such as the Office of Public Works' visitor centres, are often closed during the winter months.  The Minister could remedy this imbalance by persuading State agencies to adopt a co-ordinated, positive attitude to off-peak tourism, focusing adequate resources for this purpose, including financing facilities to remain open in winter and diverting high budget allocations to off-peak marketing.  Some people might contend there is no need to market Ireland for summer breaks since visitors will travel here anyway but it is balanced development that is really needed.  This can only be provided by a year-round tourist season without highs and lows.</P>
    <P>Another part of the Fianna Fáil motion relates to the need for a national co-ordinated manpower development plan of training in services for tourism. CERT is doing a great job but there has been much concern voiced by restaurateurs about staff shortages.  Is the Minister addressing that issue?  Will he devise co-ordinated plans, in conjunction with his ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Finance, Enterprise and Employment and Social Welfare?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is very concerned also at the lack of progress being made on the EU Operational Programme for Tourism. We are facing into a period when the medium-term review of EU funds will be due, yet little headway has been made on the allocation of such funds to tourism.  The Minister's inactivity in this area could lead to Ireland being penalised and losing up to 10 per cent of its allocation.</P>
    <P>One of the themes of our motion is the development of strategies placing emphasis on quality and income-generation. The World Equestrian Games fit <Col N="1173" /> into this category since, through them, an image of Ireland can be presented abroad to an affluent sector of tourists. Rather than exploit that opportunity, the Minister has tried to eliminate it, with no support whatever for the project forthcoming from him or his colleagues. It remains unclear if this event will be saved, although a new sponsor appears to have come forward.  That event offers a major opportunity to promote this country abroad.  We have the capability, infrastructure and personnel to host. Since Ireland is the country of the horse it is all the more extraordinary that this once-off opportunity, so hard fought by the Minister's predecessor, has been almost lost to this nation.  While, on the one hand, we proclaim the virtues of our horses, on the other we appear to throw away this opportunity to promote their interests.  I understand there may well be a sponsor for this event in the background and, if so, the Minister should engage in urgent discussions with this individual or organisation.</P>
    <P>The World Equestrian Games are a major opportunity for this country to promote itself abroad.  It is an event we have the capability and personnel to run.  With leadership and some input from the Minister, all the problems associated with the games could have been ironed out, but that interest was lacking.  There was inflexibility and a lack of vision.  That failure was not only on the part of the Minister, it was evident right across the board in the Government, even by Ministers with equestrian interests.  They stood by and did nothing.  Even the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, who wants to bring the Olympics to Dublin, was silent for once.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the position on the games and explain if Ireland will be liable for a £1.5 million bond if the event does not go ahead?  Will the Tour de France suffer from the same lack of interest?  What are the Minister's intentions in relation to the Tour de France starting in Ireland?</P>
    <P>The Eurovision is another of these major events that should be encouraged <Col N="1174" /> rather than criticised.  I hope the Minister will play an active part in ensuring that Ireland hosts that event next year.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil welcomes the publication by the Department of Tourism and Trade of <i>European Funding in Ireland.</i> That directory of the funding available to the tourism industry from the European Union is a useful tool for present and potential investors in that industry and it should be updated annually.</P>
    <P>The recent introduction of tax incentives in certain seaside resorts has given a substantial boost to the renovation and reconstruction of those towns.  That scheme is widely seen as a cast iron way of channelling investment into areas that have suffered from gradual decay and were at risk of serious and imminent infrastructural degeneration.  I do not see why its scope should not be broadened.  It is discouraging to learn from pronouncements that the tax reliefs incorporated in the pilot scheme were watered down by the Government before the pilot scheme has been implemented, which shows a distinct lack of conviction on the part of the Government.  Any step which it can take to encourage reinvestment of earnings or savings in the infrastructure of our towns must be taken.  If that results in tax advantages to those who decide to invest in such projects, common sense dictates that this is also in the national interest.  Under this project we must aim to achieve the retention of profits in Ireland by encouraging people not normally associated with or involved in the tourism industry as well as those directly involved in it to invest in it.</P>
    <P>We want proper regional development and co-ordination between the agencies promoting tourism and grant-aiding the sector.  We do not want limited tourist budgets to be spent on exacerbating regional imbalances.  We want co-ordinated marketing strategies where numbers alone are not the measure of success.  There must be integrated development at local level.  These steps must be taken urgently and we ask the Minister to heed our calls and to take action as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> I wish to refer to two obvious problems affecting tourism, litter and our appalling signposting.  It is time the Government took action under legislation dealing with litter to address the problem.  I refer particularly to the flurry of paper one notices on passing fast food outlets in our cities and towns which has been disposed of by their clients on footpaths directly outside those premises.  They should be obliged to clean up the litter outside those premises as a matter of social priority in the national interest.  Our attitude to litter is nothing short of disgraceful.  The sooner the Minister decides, if he has not already done so, to organise anti-litter competitions, the better.  If Martians landed in O'Connell Street and did not know where they were, on looking around and seeing the litter they would realise they must be in Ireland.  The litter problem is as bad as that.  On travelling up from the west the other day, I noticed a person in the car in front of me roll down the window to throw out a brown paper bag.  I almost crashed as I was overcome with road rage or litter rage, whichever is the appropriate term to describe one's anger in those circumstances. An empty box of matches and an empty cigarette packet were also thrown out the window.  I belw my horn and was given the usual salutation indicating that I should mind my own business, which, maybe, I should but people who try to stop others littering our country act in the interests of the community. Litter is a national priority and should be addressed in the interests of promoting tourism.  We should address the problem by teaching our young people, particularly those at school, that it is anti-social behaviour to throw litter in a public place.</P>
    <P>Our main roads, particularly our highways, are second to none; the signposting on those highways is clear and conforms with European Union standards. However, one becomes dizzy trying to find a location when reading the signposts on secondary and tertiary roads.  The signposts are nothing short <Col N="1176" /> of shameful.  I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to address this problem as a matter of urgency.  Defacing bilingual signposts, particularly in the west, where the English translation of the Irish location has been scribbled out and only the Irish version remains, does not do justice to the language I love deeply.  The yahoos who deface those signs should be asked to leave them alone in the national interest and in the interests of tourists from France, Germany and other countries who assist tourists in their countries by providing bilingual signposts.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to address the simple problems of litter and defacing bilingual road signs. In the main the local authorities are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, particularly in view of the economic constraints inflicted on them, but I urge them, or the road authority responsible for the maintenance of road signs, to address the problem of defacing those signs as a matter of urgency.  The road signs on byroads are a source of puzzlement, amazement and bemusement to tourists who try to find their way from A to B and inevitably end up in C and D, not knowing where they are.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for replying to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, particularly its recommendations to set up a national co-ordinated manpower development plan for training in the area of tourism services.  Despite high unemployment here, there is a scarcity of staff to manage hotels, bars and restaurants. Traders continually complain about finding it difficult to recruit well trained staff.  EU and State funding for tourism should be used in the most cost effective manner to maximise tourism growth.  Until the year 2000 and beyond, it is widely forecast that tourism will be the biggest growth industry world-wide. Tourism is our most decentralised industry.  It affects every city, town, village and parish and has great potential for job creation.  If the Government is <Col N="1177" /> interested in creating jobs for our educated young people, now being properly trained in the areas of tourism, catering and management, everything possible must be done to ensure that State and EU funding is spent wisely to maximise future growth.  I refer in particular to the marketing programme by Board Fáilte and the Department of Tourism and Trade under the operational programme.</P>
      <P>During the period from 1 October to 17 March each year, as many people as possible from Bord Fáilte and the Department of Tourism and Trade should be engaged in promotional work abroad to attract more tourists here. Marketing is the key to tourism promotion and I cannot over emphasise its importance.  From information given to me by those with vast experience in the tourism trade and in the hotel and catering businesses, I know Ireland is merely scratching at the surface of the huge market in the United States, Europe, Asia and throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Low interest loans should be made available to entrepreneurs who wish to become involved in tourism projects such as the extension of existing facilities and the provision of new facilities including buildings.  Low interest loans are far better than grants and the tourism trade prefers them.  We must spend a percentage of State and EU funding for tourism on the provision of all-weather leisure facilities including cinemas and conference centres.  This may be Ireland's last opportunity to spend the large amounts of money that will be made available by the European Commission between now and the year 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced, as is the tourism trade, that a greater sense of urgency is needed in planning authorities in deciding on applications for planning permission for tourism oriented projects which have great employment potential, such as all-weather leisure facilities, conference centres, extensions to hotels and guest houses or the construction of new projects.  Will the Minister consult his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, with a view to issuing a <Col N="1178" /> directive to planning authorities to give priority to applications for planning permission in respect of proposals which will ultimately create many jobs?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister and the Minister of State consult their colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, with a view to restoring the grants for the control of farmyard pollution?  We must protect and maintain our healthy environment for our own benefit, for the benefit of tourists and in the interests of job creation, regardless of the costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State knows I am anxious that coastal towns in the south and west Kerry areas, such as Killarney, Kenmare and Killorglin are given an equal opportunity to obtain grants under the operational programme for tourism.  It is important that south Kerry gets its fair share of State and EU funding, having regard to the huge sums which enterpreneurs have spent over the years out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Tourism and Trade is not here tonight because I want to ask him to ensure the available finances and resources are no longer employed to further exacerbate regional imbalances in County Kerry and in the south west region.  We have not received our market share of the increase in tourism in the past two years.  These imbalances are closely linked to undeveloped marketing strategies which place more emphasis on quality and income generation than on numbers.  I am firmly convinced that a good marketing strategy would help in a major way to spread the market share of the increase in tourism more evenly throughout the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the part of the Fianna Fáil motion regarding proposals to initiate and support an integrated development marketing plan at a local level which would achieve sustained growth in tourism income.  For example, I have for some years advocated one marketing unit for County Kerry.  I want the Minister to let this House know now how he views such a proposal which arose from an unanimous decision taken by Kerry <Col N="1179" /> County Council.  He was asked to meet a deputation from the county council on the matter.  Perhaps the Minister could let us know now when he will receive this deputation.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Tourism and Trade to state clearly what message he wanted to convey to tourism interests on a recent visit to Killarney, when he stated he wanted a cap placed on tourism development in the area.  I am disappointed he is not here tonight to answer that question.  I sincerely hope he will be here tomorrow night to answer it.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister wish the people of the Killarney area to stop building bed and breakfast houses, guest houses, hotels and to stop adding extensions to such buildings?  Does he wish to phase out or destroy the construction industry in Killarney?  I want him to come into this House and answer those questions fairly and squarely because he did not do so in Killarney when he was cross examined.  The people of Killarney and south Kerry are entitled to an explanation from the Minister on this important matter.</P>
    <P>Some 11,500 people are employed in tourism in Kerry and we have a very important regional airport which is vital to the development of tourism in the county.  The Government is not paying the airport the attention it should, particularly in relation to marketing.  I want to see more money coming to Kerry for the market tourism, particularly through Kerry county airport.  I also make a case here for a conference centre in Killarney.  The facility is badly needed.  The case made for it was rejected by the Department of Tourism and Trade and I would like to know why.  A better case could not have been made for the provision of a major conference centre in Killarney to which substantial grants should be allocated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade should consider the provision of an indoor public heated swimming pool in Killarney.  It has been on the agenda for almost ten years.  The question of the <Col N="1180" /> indoor heated swimming pool is a matter of great concern to those in the bed and breakfast business, the guest house business and indeed to many hoteliers in Killarney who do not have these facilities in their hotels.  I understand there are approximately 15 hotels in the eastern region at either the planning or construction stage.  This is one of the reasons neither I nor the people of Killarney and south Kerry can understand why the Minister wants a cap on the development of tourism and tourism facilities in Killarney.  I sincerely hope the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, will convey my views very precisely to the Minister if the Minister cannot come in here tomorrow night to answer these questions.</P>

      <P>I wish to apologise for the Minister's absence.  It will not be possible for him to be present tomorrow to respond to the issues raised by Deputies as he is in Finland on a tourism and trade promotion. I do not know what was said regarding the cap.  We will, therefore, have to await the Minister's return to provide an answer for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the exceptional performance of the tourism sector in 1995 in terms of foreign revenue earnings and visitor numbers and the substantial growth in tourism in all sub-regions of the country in recent years; and calls on the Minister for Tourism and Trade to continue to pursue, in association with the industry, a range of policy measures in the product development, marketing and training areas designed to assist in the achievement of the targets set for sustainable growth in the industry under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> I am grateful to the Deputies for tabling this motion and providing the House with an opportunity to debate issues which have been raised recently concerning the growth of tourism throughout the country.  I am thinking, in particular, of the recent study commissioned by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation on the regional distribution of tourism.  In order to put these issues in their proper context, however, I would like to touch briefly on overall national tourism policy and Government targets for the sector.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism sets out the Government's targets for the tourism industry for the period 1994 to 1999.  These are: to increase foreign exchange earnings to £2.25 billion per annum by 1999, thereby creating the equivalent of up to 35,000 additional jobs; to concentrate an increasing proportion of growth outside of the July-August peak; and to improve the quality of service in the Irish tourism product by the provision of high quality training programmes.</P>
    <P>Unlike the first Tourism Operational Programme, the current programme does not contain targets in relation to the number of visitors, reflecting a shift in emphasis from numbers to revenue yield which I am sure will be welcomed. The strategy to achieve these targets will focus on a large expansion in marketing activities; further product development to meet specific market deficiencies and, major improvements in the conference, angling and cultural tourism products and an expansion in the range and scale of training to cater for anticipated employment growth.</P>
    <P>Overall, investment totalling £652 million is envisaged during the lifetime of the programme.  A sum of £369 million of this will come from the EU with the public and private sectors contributing £84, million and £199 million respectively.  Programmes under the aegis of other Departments will also assist smaller tourism projects as part of their primary non-tourism objectives.  In addition, tourism projects in the Border counties may also qualify for assistance <Col N="1182" /> from the International Fund for Ireland, the EU INTERREG Programme or the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The targets I have outlined are national targets, but the Operational Programme for Tourism also contains an indicative breakdown of expenditure on a regional basis in order to achieve a balanced distribution of investment throughout the country.  Tourism has the important added value effect of energising and raising the morale of communities in regions which have been adversely affected by emigration and depopulation.  Apart from the grant aiding programmes I have outlined, tourism development also benefits from a number of schemes involving tax incentives and subsidised, fixed interest loans.</P>
    <P>Some of the programmes and schemes I have mentioned are by their nature confined to specific regions.  The overall tourism support framework could be seen therefore to provide a positive bias in favour of regional development.</P>
    <P>The targets we have set out for the tourism industry are ambitious but realistic.  Tourism performance over the past two years indicates that we are well on course toward achieving them.  Foreign earnings from tourism to Ireland in 1995 grew by 12 per cent over 1994 to almost £1.7 billion.  This rate of growth compares very favourably with the average European growth in tourism revenue of 2.3 per cent, making Ireland the top performing European destination in 1995.</P>
    <P>Overall visitor numbers in 1995 reached a record high of 4,256,000.  We experienced particularly strong growth in visitor numbers from Britain, up 13 per cent, North America, up 30 per cent and mainland Europe, up almost 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>The year 1995 also proved to be very successful for job creation with Bord Fáilte estimating employment supported by tourism at 102,000 &mdash; an increase of 4,000 on 1994 and representing a 50 per cent increase since 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> In April of this year the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation announced the findings of a study on the regional distribution of Ireland's tourism.  The study, which focused on overseas holiday visitors in the period 1993-95, showed that while nationally overseas bednights rose by 11 per cent in this period, there was a decline in bednights in the western regions with the result that their share of the national total dropped from 59 per cent in 1993 to 50 per cent in 1995. Interestingly, the report said that there was no single factor which could be said with any certainty to be the cause of this change.  It identified a number of possible factors which may have had an impact including the European-wide growth in the city tourism, the increasing international trend towards shorter holidays, seasonality, access and mobility within Ireland.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the ITIC study which is a useful addition to existing studies on the regional impact of tourism. However, there are a number of points which should be borne in mind in any discussion of this issue.</P>
    <P>The study focuses entirely on the overseas market and makes no mention of the regional impact of the domestic or Northern Ireland tourism.  Deputies will be aware that the domestic market, which Bord Fáilte estimates at £625 million or almost one-third of all tourism revenue in 1995, is particularly significant for the west and south-west which have always been the favourite destinations for Irish holidaymakers.</P>
    <P>I would also like to emphasise the point that the ITIC report deals solely with bednights or, in other words, the number of nights spent in a region by overseas holidaymakers.  There is no question of a decline in tourism revenue in western regions or anywhere else in the country for that matter.  All regions are enjoying tourism revenue far in excess of the levels achieved in the past. Indeed, tourism revenue in every region of the country has grown faster than the international or European averages over the period 1989 to 1995 and there <Col N="1184" /> would be many European countries which would happily trade places with any one of our regions.</P>
    <P>Dublin has enjoyed significantly higher growth in recent years, partly because of the increased international demand for city breaks and shorter stays.  As regards city breaks, the ITIC report points out that Dublin is not competing with other Irish regions but with cities such as Amsterdam and Edinburgh.  Indeed, the report recommends further development of Dublin campaigns to attract tourists who would not otherwise consider visiting Ireland. A point worth noting in this regard is that 40 per cent of all bookings made in the Dublin Tourism Centre are for accommodation and activities in the other regions which means that the growth in visitors to Dublin has important spin-off benefits for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In discussing city tourism, it may also be of interest to look at some international comparisons.  In Scotland, for example, Edinburgh and Glasgow account for 50 per cent of all overseas revenue, while London has an average 54 per cent share of British overseas revenue.  Here, we have a much more even distribution with Dublin's share averaging 27 per cent in the past seven years.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that any differential growth in the Dublin and eastern regions is not a function of development incentives, but can be attributed to many other factors including the special appeal of Dublin as a capital city.  There is no question of public or EU funds contributing to the imbalances in the regional growth rates. This is recognised in the ITIC report which also points out that 60 per cent of all European Regional Development Funds and BES investment in the 1989-95 period went to projects in the western regions.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the challenge for western regions is to achieve the same level of performance.  In this connection, a well known hotelier in the west has recently said that price is a key factor in the east's performance in recent years <Col N="1185" /> and has made the point that he sees further growth prospects for west of Ireland tourism in selling the off-season at the right price.</P>
    <P>The big expansion in access to Ireland in recent years has provided great opportunities for the regions with an increasing number of European tour operators undertaking direct charter services into airports outside Dublin including Cork, Kerry, Shannon and Knock.  Nearly 180,000 seats are now provided annually on inbound charter services &mdash; an increase of some 70 per cent on 1992.  Of these, 80 per cent go to airports other than Dublin.  The decision of tour operators from Germany to commence services to Knock for the first time in 1996 is a further positive development.</P>
    <P>Increased competition on the London-Shannon route has been facilitated by the commencement of services on that route by AB Shannon since December 1995.  In addition, Aer Rianta has announced that new carrier development at Cork and Shannon will be further facilitated by a package of landing charges rebates which exceed the incentives available in Dublin.  Combined passenger movements at all regional airports in 1995 were 20 per cent higher than in 1994, reaching over 350,000 and Cork and Shannon airports reported terminal traffic increases of 21 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>The issue of appropriate marketing strategies has been raised by Deputies. The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 provided for total programme related spending on marketing of almost £125 million over the period 1994 to 1999, with some £51 million of this funding coming from the EU.  The programme identifies specific marketing themes which focus on the key objectives of the programme, including the achievement of foreign exchange earnings of £2.25 billion in 1999.</P>
    <P>The five themes which underpin the marketing sub-programme of the operational programme are: improving seasonality; expanding sea and air access; <Col N="1186" /> developing new markets; developing products and niche markets and attracting more high-yield business.</P>
    <P>These themes have guided the work of the independent Management Board for Marketing which, up to 31 December 1995, had approved over £12 million in marketing grants under the operational programme.  A wide variety of projects have been supported ranging from brochure production to direct mail campaigns to mainstream consumer advertising.  Tourism enterprises of every type have been assisted, including carriers, tour operators, marketing cooperatives, individual suppliers and relevent public bodies.  I understand that in 1996 the Marketing Board, having reviewed its activities to date, will be seeking to focus more support towards projects which are strategic in direction as opposed to the more tactical nature of previous years.</P>
    <P>The major consumer advertising campaigns for Irish tourism in 1996 will, as in 1995, be undertaken under the aegis of the industry-led Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative (the OTMI), which is a marketing partnership involving Board Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the tourism industry, North and South.  A budget of £6.5 million will be available to the OTMI this year, comprising £1 million from the industry, £500,000 sources from Northern Ireland, £1 million from the Exchequer and a total of £4 million from the Marketing Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    <P>The renewed mandate for Bord Fáilte, in line with the Arthur D. Little Consultancy review, has been confirmed as international marketing and the organisation is refocusing its resources on this key task while divesting itself of other non core functions.  The new structure reflects a concentration on three core priorities of selling and promoting Ireland overseas, helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop its marketing and product development capabilities and providing <Col N="1187" /> information for enhanced decision making by marketeers, investors and managers in the industry as well as Government.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the importance of the domestic tourism market.  One of the significant achievements of the last Tourism Council &mdash; which is made up of representatives of the industry, the tourism State agencies and Government Departments under the chairmanship of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny &mdash; was its endorsement of the comprehensive report Domestic Tourism Marketing which was commissioned by the marketing sub-committee at my specific request.  This report outlined the value of domestic tourism in economic terms, the increased level of competition especially in the short break sector and the marketing opportunities which are emerging. It specifically recommended that a new and reorganised approach to support growth in the domestic market was opportune and put forward a number of suggestions for new marketing initiatives.</P>
    <P>Following from this, I am pleased to say that I secured Government agreement earlier this year to the allocation of £500,000 towards the cost of developing a new initiative to encourage greater marketing by the industry of home holidays, particularly in the off-peak and shoulder season.  This initiative will only succeed, however, if it has the co-operation and involvement both financially and actively of the tourism industry right across the board.  I can inform the House that, this morning, I chaired a meeting of the working group, representative of all sectors of the industry, which I established to plan and implement the initiative.  The meeting agreed a strategy which will be implemented in coming months, commencing in a few days time on a limited basis with targeted newspaper advertising.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of co-ordination of State and other grant aiding agencies involved in tourism.  Arising <Col N="1188" /> from concerns about possible inconsistency and duplication in tourism development efforts, the product development sub-committee of the last Tourism Council prepared a report on co-ordination of tourism in June 1994.  Essentially, this report recommended that the Operational Programme for Tourism should be seen as the starting point for all tourism-related initiatives and the Minister and Department of Tourism and Trade the final arbiter of tourism policy.  Other agencies and measures that assist tourism projects as part of their primary non-tourism objectives should complement rather than act in conflict with the incentives offered under the tourism operational programme.  The report made a number of specific recommendations to this end.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary addressed the issue of manpower policy which is an issue of vital importance to the future of Irish tourism.  By the end of the century we expect that five million people will visit us each year.  All of these tourists want and must be provided with an efficient and friendly service which they will remember and associate with their visit to this country.  This is acknowledged in the Operational Programme for Tourism where training is one of the four main sub-programmes.  A total of £110 million will be invested in tourism training between 1994 and 1999 and over 72,000 people will be trained.  This almost doubles the number trained under the last operational programme.</P>
    <P>In keeping with overall national tourism policy, CERT's role and function will be to provide training for new entrants and the existing workforce in tourism, in order to assist in the provision of a higher quality tourism product leading to the creation and enchancement of employment.  European language training will continue to be an integral part of the overall training strategy of CERT.</P>
    <P>The last Tourism Council, through a sub-committee chaired by Mr. Peter Malone of Jurys Hotel Group, produced a report on tourism manpower and <Col N="1189" /> training for the 21st century.  A number of key issues were highlighted by the report, but the two most important were the shortage of trained staff and the poor image of the industry.</P>
    <P>The perception of the tourism industry as an industry dogged by long hours and low pay is attractive to no one.  We all agree that poor image needs to be seriously addressed and this must be done sooner rather than later.  The Minister, Deputy Kenny, when addressing the annual conference of the Irish Hotels Federation in Cork in February raised this whole question and the industry itself is aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>Action must be taken now to face these problems.  The Government, through CERT, will train over 70,000 people for tourism by 1999.  This is a major commitment.  CERT has produced a draft corporate plan for the period up to 1999 which takes on board much of the recent analysis conducted and seeks to reposition the organisation to meet the future needs and requirements of the industry.</P>
    <P>However, the industry itself must address these critical issues if it is to continue to secure and retain a quality trained workforce.  The level of European Social Funds available for training and other related tourism initiatives will be uncertain after the current operational programme expires in 1999.  The industry must plan now to develop and take responsibility for its own training needs.  Manpower planning is also one of the strategic issues which will be discussed by the new Tourism Council.</P>
    <P>Understandable concerns have been expressed recently about the regional spread of tourism growth.  It is important, however, that we maintain a sense of proportion in what is an outstanding success story for all regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle would agree with me that Wicklow is arguably the most beautiful county in Ireland and indisputably the most beautiful county in Leinster and <Col N="1190" /> we agree there is need for greater promotion of the area.  The opening sentence of the Private Members' motion may have relevance for places such as Wicklow, Carlow and Kildare.  An impression is created in the motion that investment in tourism is going to the west, the south and the north but not the east.  However, we in the east outside the city and county of Dublin are making an effort to attract tourists.  I hope we will see many thousands in Wicklow for the Murphy's Irish Open Golf competition in Druids Glen during July.  It will be one of the biggest promotions ever in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>It is hard to understand how Deputy Andrews supports his criticism of tourism when one considers from that foreign earnings from tourism in 1995 grew by more than 12 per cent in 1994 figures to almost £1.7 billion.  It is predicted that 1996 will be even better.  Overall visitor numbers for 1995 reached a record 4,250,000 people.  There was a 13 per cent increase from Britain, 30 per cent from America and 12 per cent from Europe.  These figures show that the Department of Tourism and Trade is doing its job well.  I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State for their efforts since taking office.  These figures put paid to the argument that people do not visit this country.</P>
      <P>There is an argument for improving tourism promotion in certain areas.  I doubt if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree with me, but County Wicklow should not be in the midlands-east area. It should be in the south-east area because it has access to sea transport at Rosslare and Dún Laoghaire.  It should be in the same category as Wexford, Waterford and Kilkenny.  County Wicklow has got some benefits from being in the midlands-east area but somebody driving through Athlone is a long way from Arklow, which is in the same tourist area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should look at the dearth of accommodation in the eastern countries.  He mentioned higher growth in the east but he referred only to <Col N="1191" /> Dublin where we are aware the tourism industry is booming.  However, other counties do not have proper facilities. Mobile investments will always go to Dublin which is an all year round attraction for tourists.  A BES type investment, specifically for rural counties, would address the dearth of accommodation there.</P>
    <P>We must provide indoor facilities if we want to extend the tourist season beyond July and August and the shoulder periods of June and September. Swimming pools are an all year round tourist attraction.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to answer the demands of the people of Wicklow for a swimming pool in Arklow and in Wicklow town.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has a poor image as regards pay.  I am glad the Minister proposes to take action in this area because the problem has persisted for many years.  There has been a huge increase in the numbers visiting this country, which has led to the expansion of the industry.  However, we seem to have forgotten the need to promote better pay and conditions for those who work in it.  The Minister said the industry must do more to promote itself as being able to offer a worthwhile and rewarding career for young people.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment must also ensure that it has enough inspectors to check working environments and pay conditions in hotels, guesthouses and bars where young people work.  This area needs immediate attention.  I know that the Minister of State, a former trade unionist in Cork, will want to do something about the industry's image in this regard.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry can help this country.  Last year we reaped the benefits of the peace initiative and the hot summer.  We hope peace continues on our island because people will not visit it if there is violence.  The country should be promoted abroad.  Many television broadcasts on BBC, ITV or Sky include Ireland as a holiday destination. <Col N="1192" /> That is important for people who are deciding where to go on their holidays. We should accommodate television stations because such broadcasts have a beneficial effect on this country.</P>
    <P>We should not only concentrate on attracting people to this country, we should encourage Irish people to take their holidays here.  People will get good bargains throughout the year.  The tourism industry will always be at its height in July and August, not only because employees get holidays then but because children are off school.  Costs are highest during these two months, but we should encourage people to avail of long weekends and breaks at Easter, etc.  We welcome and encourage visitors to come here but approximately 40 per cent of our tourism industry is home based.  Something positive has been done in the past year and the Minister must take credit for that.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with our most successful industry.  There have been huge increases in the numbers of people coming here and I know the Minister will ensure that continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this motion.  The tourism industry, particularly since 1987, has become a key sector of the economy.  The positive decision of the then Fianna Fáil Government to identify tourism as a potential growth area has reaped beneficial rewards for the economy.  The growth in numbers employed directly in the industry and the growth in foreign earnings since 1987 are testimony to the success of that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a constituency which had severe difficulties in attracting visitors over a period of 25 years because of the political difficulties in the other part of the province.  Regardless of those difficulties, the people involved in tourism, particularly those involved in angling tourism, succeeded in attracting huge numbers of fishermen from Britain.  The numbers grew each year and there was substantial repeat business.  Those private tourist operators deserve lavish <Col N="1193" /> commendation for their work and the quality of the accommodation and fishing and product made available for anglers.</P>
    <P>Since the cessation of violence at the end of August 1994 the communities in the region, North and South, have looked to the future with great hope in the realisation that the major obstacles to tourism promotion have been removed.  We sincerely hope and are confident they have been removed for ever.  The communities I know on both sides of the Border recognise the strength of the thirty-two counties as a tourism product.  It is essential that we sell the island of Ireland as an attractive holiday destination.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, specific funding was provided to advance, consolidate and underpin the peace process under the European Union's operational programme to promote peace and reconciliation.  The communities in the region hoped and believed significant flagship projects would be assisted with this funding.  One could not identify better projects for assistance under the programme than cross-Border ones. particularly tourism projects.  There is serious discontent in the Border counties at the lack of action or progress made to date.  If investment is to be made to support the peace process, the best option would be to support worthwhile viable projects that will last and provide long-term jobs.  I have yet to meet anyone who knows of worthwhile projects which have been assisted under the programme.</P>
    <P>Tourism, with its potential to create jobs, should have been identified as the vehicle to generate employment in the Border economy.  Allied to its potential to create additional employment is the added opportunity to develop cross-Border projects and worthwhile social and economic links between North and South.  If tourism is to significantaly expand in Border areas and advantage is to be taken of the new climate created by the peace process, there is an urgent need to develop a strong and improved product attractive to the more general <Col N="1194" /> visitor and supported by a broad range of attractions.</P>
    <P>A number of key development requirements must be addressed if the region is to successfully exploit a wider tourism market.  These include the creation of a well defined tourism image and identity in the general tourism market and the provision of a number of quality attractions and facilities supported by an improved tourism infrastructure. A limited number of high profile flagship attractions would play an important role in creating an image and identity for the region in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I appealed to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to progress the Erne navigation project.  This project, the purpose of which is to make the Erne navigable southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra, would be complementary to the restored Erne-Shannon waterway which has been an outstanding success.  At a time when specific funding is available for the regeneration of the Border economy I could not mention a more suitable project.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Leonard, has appealed to Ministers during the past 12 months to make funding available under the tourism angling programme for projects in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  I support his request.</P>
    <P>I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputies Foley and Leonard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion which calls on the Minister for Tourism and Trade to take action to promote more even growth in tourist numbers and income in the regions and in the off-peak season.  The importance of tourism to the economy has increased beyond the expections of industry experts in the past ten years.  It is the fastest growing source of new sustainable jobs and, in many rural areas, exceeds agriculture and all other industries as a source of jobs and wealth.  It has become clear that the features which make Ireland unique as a tourist destination need to be nurtured and developed to meet the <Col N="1195" /> needs of the 21st century tourist and reap the proper rewards and for those engaged in the industry and for the Ireland we all hope to see prosper for present and future generations.</P>
      <P>It costs the State virtually nothing to create a sustainable job in tourism.  This fact alone is sufficient to warrant the intensive involvement of the Government in the business of shaping the industry.  Projections indicate steady growth in the immediate to long-term.</P>
      <P>Tourism contributed in excess of £160 million to the economy of County Kerry in 1994, more than agriculture which had been the principle earner.  It has a significant impact on employment generation and employment opportunities. It is estimated that more than 7,000 full-time jobs are generated directly as a result of tourism.  The projected growth and the preparedness of the county are, therefore, critical to the long-term economic well-being of many people.</P>
      <P>The county attracts well over one million visitors.  Recent research indicates the number of continental visitors has increased from 25 per cent of all overseas visitors in 1987 to 38 per cent. The number of United States visitors on the other hand has declined from 25 per cent of all overseas visitors to 15 per cent over the same period.</P>
      <P>The McNulty tourism development and marketing plan, commissioned by Kerry County Council, projects that tourist numbers will grow by 42 per cent to 1.65 million by 1998 and tourism revenue to £250 million if a cohesive and sensitive development and marketing strategy is followed.  This will require Government involvement and finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overseas visitors account for 48 per cent of all visitors to the county.  This figure is likely to increase to 52 per cent by 1998.  It is expected that the number of continental visitors will continue to grow.  While these figures are attractive there is need for Government funding. <Col N="1196" /> to pursue the marketing programme over the next five years.</P>
    <P>The features which make Ireland strong in the tourism market are well known: our countryside, heritage, cultural wealth and sense of fun.  These features cannot be sacrified for short-term economic gain and tourism must develop in harmony with the essential ingredients of the Irish experience.  We must aim to lengthen the tourist season, not, simply, to intensify it.  We must aim to attract tourists who will be impressed by the package on offer and sell Ireland to their friends on their return home.</P>
    <P>The industry is a major focus for those who aspire to a life of sustained employment and the job satisfaction and expectancy that derives from this. It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 long-term sustainable jobs in tourism and this number can be increased with Government involvement. These jobs provide an economic and social lifeline to a country facing the alarming prospect of rural decline.</P>
    <P>To develop the industry we must invest in the features which make Ireland so attractive to tourists without sacrificing the quality of the product for what might well be short-term and short-sighted economic gain.  We accept that the aim is easily articulated, but not so easily translated into a policy which can ensure its implementation.</P>
    <P>The sector has benefited from private investment in the past ten years, mainly through the BES.  The Government must introduce an attractive grants scheme for the industry.  The recent introduction of tax incentives in certain seaside resorts and towns has provided a substantial boost in terms of renovation and reconstruction.  The scheme is widely seen as a cast iron way of channelling investment into areas which have suffered from gradual decay and which are at risk of serious and imminent infrastructural degeneration.  There is no reason the scope of the scheme cannot be broadened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> Of major concern to Kerry County Council for some time is the division of the county between two separate regional tourism organisations, Cork-Kerry Tourism and Shannon Development. It is imperative that the county is marketed as a single unit.  If not, serious problems could arise in the future development of the industry within the county.  Kerry County Council has for some time requested a meeting with the Minister.  I urged him to accede to this request and agree to a meeting as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. There are five headings, the fifth of which is of relevance to the area which Deputy Smith and I represent.  It reads: &ldquo;to address the lack of co-ordination of State and other grant-aiding agencies involved in tourism&rdquo;.  There is a complete lack of co-ordination among those agencies and Government Departments. Currently 36 programmes are being funded in the Border region administered by eight Government Departments and four State agencies. Since the peace initiative there have been continuous calls to refocus funding with a view to supporting that initiative but since that time there has not been any re-examination of the funding for those projects.</P>
      <P>People such as myself, who represent non-traditional tourist regions, continually complain about the neglect of such regions.  The emphasis continues to be on seaside resorts and established tourism centres.  Following the ceasefire in 1994 those of us living in the Border regions had great expectations that funding would be provided for these areas.  We are disappointed that the Department and the State agencies, who talked so much about what they intended to do, did not deliver in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bord Fáilte attitude survey carried out last summer revealed that 10 per cent of those surveyed who were not <Col N="1198" /> Irish born would not have come to Ireland but for the peace initiative.  In 1994, the then Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, announced substantial INTERREG funding for fishery tourism.  The various local community groups in my area submitted requests for additional funding to develop the lakes, river etc.  This involved shrub clearance and the provision of permanent access to lakes, car parks, fishing platforms and so on.  Two years later we are still awaiting approval of these projects.  I understand a North-South committee has been established but I believe such committees can be very slow in taking action.  I am aware from replies to questions I tabled that these projects are being assessed but decisions have not been made on them.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister or the Government any commitment to that region?  On asking an official a question concerning cross-Border economic development, I was extremely disappointed at his reply that there was not a great deal of interest in it.  That brings me back to my points that if action is not taken at local level, nothing will be done.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil was in power in the late 1980s it put in place a strategy which provided for the building of &ldquo;pay-as-you-play&rdquo; golf courses.  That initiative proved to be extremely successful and recent figures show a 31 per cent increase in the number of tourists coming to Ireland to play golf.  The figure for 1994 was 170,000 while the 1995 figure was 228,000.  The figure for specialist golf tourists increased by 72 per cent from 57,000 to 98,000.  Those figures are welcome in the areas I represent because they will benefit from that increase in tourist numbers.</P>
    <P>When the county enterprise boards were established I believed they would have a useful role to play in supporting, through grant-aid, small tourism projects and providing funding to improve tourist accommodation.  Unfortunately, we get only £90,000 per quarter and we <Col N="1199" /> are now faced with a huge backlog of applications to provide tourist accommodation. The position is similar with regard to the Leader programme; we have applications from people wishing to provide tourist accommodation which cannot be processed.  The IFI has also exhausted its funding to tourist accommodation.  Funding must be provided for additional tourist accommodation, self-catering, guest-house or bed and breakfast facilities.  Funding should be co-ordinated at various levels so that the best value can be obtained from that region.</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed of our litter problem which has not improved.  Pressure from county councils has resulted in indiscriminate dumping being restricted to some extent.  I travel the Derry-Dublin road three or four days per week.  In the spring Monaghan County Council removed litter from the road and the ditches, much of which was made up of plastic items thrown out of passing cars. That behaviour is disgraceful when one thinks of the costs involved to local authorities in removing this litter.</P>
    <P>The outdoor pursuits education centre at Tannagh in Rockcorry attracts many school groups from Northern Ireland.  That is a successful cross-Border project but we are unable to obtain grant-aid for this centre which is viable and serves a wide spectrum of clients.  I ask the Minister to provide funding for the centre.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous upsurge in heritage tourism but more emphasis should be placed on developing this area at county and regional level.  The Kavanagh Centre, which is the leading heritage tourism centre in County Monaghan, attracts many tourists.  Our castles and historic buildings should be restored where possible to accommodate the 60 per cent of tourists interested in our heritage.  Deputy Smith mentioned the canals.  The Ulster <Col N="1200" /> Canal, the link from the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel Canal to Lough Neagh, is a substantial development, but it is holding up road works in Monaghan town by the fact that a decision must be made.  I ask for a decision as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me time to talk about helping the census enumerators. All our homes were recently visited by the helpful census enumerators who delivered and collected our census forms and assisted, where necessary, in the completion of the form. Members of the public constantly meet with requests from the public service for the completion of forms and requests for information.  Most of us call this bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this is another classic example of where the bureaucrats in their zeal to collect information let slip a unique public relations opportunity.  All that was required was a one or two page leaflet inserted with the census form stating:</P>
      <P>Thank you, householder for your help five years ago &mdash; we are here again looking for your assistance.  I know you are interested in the results of the last census and on the following two pages we set out a summary of the national results and of the count in respect of your county.</P>
      <P>We are sorry for asking for the exact address of your residence, your place of employment and previous residence.  We do not actually use this information and we will not request it in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we ask questions about the Irish language &mdash; and you will see the trend here from the summary of the last five census &mdash; and not about modern European languages is because we have not thought about it <Col N="1201" /> and did not think these matters were important enough up to now.</P>
    <P>I am sure you are curious about why we need to know the approximate mileage on the outward journey to your place of occupation.  The reason for this is simple: it is that we asked this question in the previous census also.  If we explained better the reasons behind the questions and how we make use of, and disseminate this information, would you mind if we added another ten questions to the next census in ten years' time?  Please let the enumerator have your comments.</P>
    <P>Finally, thank you for your continuing co-operation.</P>
    <P>The information to provide the foregoing is already available, the distribution system is in place and the cost of paper and ink for 700,000 households or so could not cost much more than £70,000. It would be a more than worthwhile exercise on behalf of the public service in their relations with the citizens of the nation, their employers.  I might add that it would not be beyond the with of men to put in some special questions for interested parties who would be willing to pay for the exact type of answers that the census can provide.  If this was approached properly and sensitively, the cost to the State of the whole census operation could be reduced to almost nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A census of population was held on 28 April 1996.  The legal basis for the census was the Statistics Act. 1993, and the Statistics (Census of Population) Order, 1996, which I signed into law on 1 April 1996.  The census is in effect a stocktaking of the country's most important asset &mdash; its people &mdash; and as such there are a myriad of uses for the results at all levels within and across society.  They are, of course, of particular importance to all of us within this House who are charged with ensuring that there is <Col N="1202" /> effective policy and decision making at national and governmental level.</P>
      <P>Before going on to detail some of the uses, it is necessary to assure ourselves that the data obtained are of a high quality from the points of view of coverage and accuracy.  In this regard, I would like to briefly review some of the main stages involved in the conduct of the census.</P>
      <P>The fieldwork for the census was carried out by a temporary field force consisting of 30 regional supervisors, 300 field supervisors and 3,400 enumerators. All positions were advertised in the press and in local FÁS offices.  Posters were displayed in the local employment office of the Department of Social Welfare to encourage persons on the live register to apply.  Under powers conferred on him by the Statistics Act, 1993, the Director General of the Central Statistics Office was the appointing authority for the temporary field force positions mentioned above.</P>
      <P>For the supervisory positions a short list of qualified candidates was drawn up by the Central Statistics Office.  These candidates were interviewed by boards which in all cases included senior staff of the office.  In relation to the enumerator positions all the candidates were interviewed by boards drawn from the supervisory field staff.</P>
      <P>Appointments were made strictly on the basis of order of merit as determined at interview, subject to location considerations.  Preference was given to persons who were not in paid employment at the time of their application.  In fact, of the 3,400 enumerators appointed over 900 were taken from the live register while a further 2,027 were not in paid employment.  While at a national level 86 per cent of those employed as enumerators were not in paid employment, the Deputy may be interested to know that in Cork the corresponding figure was even higher, at 94 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CSO agreed in advance with the Department of Social Welfare that <Col N="1203" /> unemployed persons appointed as enumerators would be allowed sign on the live register for a maximum of three days a week during their eight to ten week period of employment on the census.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy's point about making the census more user friendly, the issue of a leaflet is possibly a good suggestion but the Deputy will also recall that the census was the focus of attention many weeks in advance through advertising in the newspapers, radio and televison. Indeed, I recall hearing members of the CSO staff involved on several occasions in answering consumers' questions on several phone-in programmes.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples of the main uses to which the census results will be put by Government Departments, local authorities and other State agencies. Information on the young population will be used by the Department of Education, the universities and local school managements in the planning and provision of schools and other educational facilities.  The Department of Health and the health boards will make use of census data in assessing the current and likely future demand on the health services. For example, information on the location and family circumstances of the elderly can be derived at a detailed level from the census.  Local authorities are of course a major user of census data in assessing and responding to demands for a wide variety of local services.  Similarly, the Department of Social Welfare has an interest in the information provided on the unemployed, single parents and other population sub-groups in need of State assistance.  Finally, many other public authorities, such as the Garda, the fire service, FÁS and Teagasc make use of census data in determining the most efficient deployment of their resources at national, regional and local levels.  The above list is far from complete but goes to show that the census results are of relevance <Col N="1204" /> to us all.  One use which is perhaps common to all the above is planning and in this regard I can perhaps conclude by recalling the apt copyline from the 1996 census campaign &mdash; that the census is about planning for the Ireland of tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment as I feel there was a deliberate policy on the part of the Department of Education to frustrate this project.  It is laughable that three different sets of drawings had to be submitted to the Department within the past nine months.  The only person who can be happy with developments is the architect involved who is laughing all the way to the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dungarvan Technical College was built in 1938 to cater for approximately 100 pupils.  At that time it comprised a woodwork room, a metalwork room, a domestic science room and four general classrooms.  These seven classrooms have not been modernised.  The vocational education committee rents accommodation at the Presentation Convent primary school to house 56 VTOS students.  Rooms have been taken from the county council to house an adult learning centre.  This school which was built for 100 pupils now accommodates 370.  The school has had an addition of 11 prefabs in the meantime. First two prefabricated buildings were built and a mathematics room was provisionally adapted as a science room. In the 1970s a typewriting room was updated and in the 1970s and 1980s further prefabs were added.  Some of the prefabs are in a deplorable condition and evidence of this has already been supplied to the Department of Education. The teachers have refused to occupy two of them.  This will become a problem for the next school year.  I do not want the Minister to suggest we should waste additional money on new prefabs to get over this temporary crisis. <Col N="1205" /> Other leaking prefabs have buckets strategically placed around them and tend to be extremely cold.</P>
    <P>The Department's building unit is aware of the urgency of this project but it is obvious there is not the political will to deliver on promises made.  As regards costs incurred, approximately £200,000 has been spent on prefabs since 1985. It would be a total waste of money to continue to build them.  Approximately £100,000 has been spent on various fees and yet the initial first option of an extension to the present school was turned down because the Department would not pay £20,000 for a field beside the school to allow an orderly development there.</P>
    <P>In September 1995 a plan was submitted to the Department, at its request, for the proposed extension to the school.  When a problem arose about the purchase of the additional land the Department decided it would move to another area in the town at Rinnasellgue which was previously purchased by the vocational education committee. Approximately £40,000 was paid to acquire this site.</P>
    <P>Drawings were requested from the design team for a two storey school at this location.  Everyone assumed progress would be made but it was not.  Following this submission in February 1996 the Department, in March 1996 changed its mind and wanted a design for a single storey building.  These new plans should have arrived in the Department yesterday. The Minister is now spoilt for choice in that she has three plans from which to work.  I presume there is now enough information to make a decision or is a fourth set of drawings required?</P>
    <P>In 1985 the project was ready to go to tender but at that time an embargo was imposed by the Government.  We have now reached a stage where we have to tender for the fourth time.  Will the Minister give the go ahead for this project in order to proceed to planning permission?</P>
    <P>In regard to replies given to earlier parliamentary questions we were told <Col N="1206" /> the matter would be considered in the context of the 1995 Estimates, but it was not.  The vocational education committee persisted and hoped it would be included in the 1996 building programme but again it was omitted.  Hope has been renewed that provision will be made in the 1997 Estimates which should be finalised later in the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has messed around the people of Dungarvan for long enough and it is time for action.  I am not aware of the type of response I will get.  If a positive response is not forthcoming I ask the Government Chief Whip to pass on a request to the Minister that she meet a deputation comprised of the four TDs in Waterford and representatives of the vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this adjournment debate.  I will outline the background to this matter for the information of the House.  Originally, it was hoped the accommodation requirements of Dungarvan Vocational School could be met by providing additional accommodation on the existing school site.</P>
      <P>The school's design team was requested to carry out a feasibility study in respect of this option.  Their findings indicated the proposed extension was not a cost efficient option and concluded it would be more advantageous if a new school was built on a green field site.</P>
      <P>County Waterford vocational education committee accepted this and proposed that the new school should be sited at Rinnasellgue.  The new school will cater for 350 pupils and will have accommodation of 1,870 square metres. A physical education hall is not included in the schedule of accommodation as this facility will be available in the adjacent sports centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> At a planning and briefing meeting held in the building unit, the school's design team was instructed to proceed with the Stage 2 submission for the project as a full site report has already been made on the proposed Rinnasellgue site.  This submission was received by the Department and examined by the building unit's professional staff.  The Department has responded to this submission with a number of technical queries.  When the necessary revisions to this stage of the architectural planning have been made, County Waterford Vocational Education Committee will be authorised to proceed with the next stage of the planning process.</P>

Accordingly, the question of starting construction will not arise until planning has been completed and tenders have been invited and examined by the Department.  Further progress to the building stage will depend on the availability of funding at that time.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I assure Deputy Kenneally the Minister for Education is fully conscious of the accommodation requirements of the school.  I assure the House and the Deputy that ever effort will be made by the Department to expedite the planning of the project.</P>
      <P>It was a pity the Deputy did not apply a little of his political clout in 1992, 1993 or 1994 when Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Davern and Deputy Seamus Brennan were Ministers for Education and we would have much more progress to report tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  That I received a telephone call from the Department asking what I was getting at is a sad indictment and testimony to the lack of understanding of the impact which the loss of 320 jobs has had on a town such as Dundalk.  I was astounded last Thursday evening when I saw the &ldquo;Six-one&rdquo; news.  I do not for one minute begrudge the employees in Packard the excellent efforts which have been made on their behalf in regard to the Tallaght task force report.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, announced he has approved the Tallaght task force interim report and that it now awaited the Government's approval.  Perhaps the Minister would give an indication as to whether the Government has approved this report.</P>
      <P>It is a fine report in that £2.1 million has been allocated to assist the former employees of Packard in their plight. The loss of 320 jobs in the Dundalk area is equal to, if not more devastating than the loss of 800 jobs in Packard in Tallaght. I was surprised to see the chief executive officer of the IDA launch this interim report.  This is in stark contrast with what has happened in Keytronic in Dundalk, where we asked for a similar type task force &mdash; the Minister is aware of this request &mdash; for the Dundalk area and a trust fund for the former employees of Keytronic who are to be laid off in probably worse conditions given the redundancy and other issues relating to the Packard employees.  On the one hand we have a report asking for and securing £2.1 million from the Government to assist the former employees of Packard and we get nothing from the Government and the State agencies in respect of Keytronic. We are thankful for the EPC project in Dundalk but there is no connection between the two issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> I accept that we cannot dictate to EPC about the employees it should take on, but the Government is putting its shoulder to the wheel in retraining former Packard employees.  A new company is proposed for Dundalk but efforts are not being made to retrain former Keytronic employees so that they might have a chance of recruitment in the new facility.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will say we have enough in Dundalk and that we should be happy.  The employees of Keytronic are not happy and a trust fund, similar to that provided for the Packard employees, should be set up.  In the region of £550,000 in the form of grants, interest free loans, counselling, retraining and so on is being allocated to help soften the blow in the Tallaght area.  I ask for the same treatment for the town of Dundalk which has suffered greatly for many years.  In recent years efforts have been made to build it up from a very poor base.  In 1989 the then Government changed the rules from maximum grant status for IDA purposes which allowed business people in the area to invest in advance factories and Dundalk was held up as an example to other towns.  Local investors invested money in advance factories which ultimately led to new industries in the area. Dundalk was also designated under the area partnership scheme and this has proved successful.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the employees of Keytronic are treated in the same way as the employees of Packard.  IDA Ireland, FÁS and other State agencies, including the Minister's Department, should work together to assist the employees of Keytronic.</P>

      <P>In dealing with problems in Tallaght, Dundalk or elsewhere I want to provide employment opportunities, particularly when there is a factory closure of the nature which occurred in Keytronic.  I am pleased that through working with the agencies under my control I was able to respond positively to that closure and announce a replacement industry for Dundalk that will create 300 jobs when fully operational. It involves an investment of £21 million by Engineering Plastic Components Limited.  It was good planning on the part of my Department to be able to respond positively to the needs of the area and the new industry will deliver to people jobs and opportunities that really count.  That is equal treatment. I hope we can also do something constructive for the Tallaght area, but much work remains to be done there.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the new company in Dundalk will fit well with Keytronic.  It has commenced to recruit workers and there will be a certain skills match between the workers who lost their jobs in Keytronic and those who will be employed in EPC.  In addition, IDA Ireland and FÁS are working together on a skills survey to ascertain the level of staff retraining required and FÁS is working with Keytronic on the registration of workers.  Where necessary we will provide appropriate training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> I am pleased to have had an opportunity to meet all the agencies involved. Co-operation between the people of Dundalk and State agencies is impressive. Dundalk houses the regional headquarters for Forbairt and the county enterprise board and operates a successful local employment scheme.  An extremely good network of agencies operates in the town.  When I visited Dundalk I said I expected the people there to respond to the problem by working in a co-ordinated fashion with the various agencies, and I was pushing an open door in that regard.  There is great commitment among agencies in the town to work together to respond to this crisis.  In addition, I was in a position to announce that IDA Ireland, through private sector investment, is arranging for the construction of a new 25,000 square foot factory in Dundalk. This is a positive response to a crisis.</P>
    <P>The loss of jobs in Keytronic is regrettable, but the Government has responded constructively.  It planned with foresight and we are providing counselling and retraining and assisting new business through the county enterprise board.  A new replacement industry and a new advance factory will be set up in the area.  I am glad to have been able to respond in that fashion to the recent crisis.</P>

Other priorities include the availability of space to develop enterprise, which we have gladly been able to do in Dundalk.  We are responding on the key issues and will continue to do so.  I am surprised the Deputy is not aware that there is a great <Col N="1214" /> deal of commitment in this area.  There is co-ordination and co-operation between the groups involved.  They are working as a unit to tackle the problems. The prospects for Dundalk are good and they will deliver an effective response.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon is right in that this is the response we expect from a Government concerned about employment, and we will continue in that direction. I am glad of the continued support of Deputies McGahon and Dermot Ahern.  When I visited Dundalk the attitude of Deputies from all sides was much more constructive, co-operative and determined than seems to be displayed in this Chamber, which is a sad reflection on debate here.  We have dealt with the realities in this case.  We are delivering and will continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As you will know, a Cheann Comhairle, I have been trying for some time to raise on the Adjournment the veterinary inspection of meat. I was not available on a previous occasion and I am pleased to have the opportunity to do so this evening.  I welcome the Minister of State, although he is usually sent in to reply when there is bad news.  I will, therefore, progress with little optimism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years there has been a high standard of ante-mortem and post-mortem veterinary inspection of all meat intended for export.  However, throughout most of the country there was a rather haphazard spot check system in regard to meat for the home market. That system was operated by private practitioners who acted as part-time local veterinary inspectors for a nominal remuneration.  In the circumstances it was not economic for them to do anything other than visit butchers shops and private slaughterhouses on an infrequent basis.  Several butchers could <Col N="1215" /> have been slaughtering animals simultaneously, miles apart from each other, and it was obvious that ante-mortem examination was possible purely by chance.  Meat inspection was often possible only in the retail outlet.  Since proper meat inspection also involves the inspection of associated lymph glands, that system was, to say the least, unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>That system operated until the introduction of an excellent Act, the Abattoirs Act, 1988, which came into force on 1 September 1989.  A circular was sent to all relevant local authorities with a reference to section 35 of the Act which requires each authority to &ldquo;appoint one or more whole-time veterinary inspectors to carry out the functions conferred on a veterinary inspector under this Act&rdquo;.  It was later shown that there was a serious flaw in the system. It had been made clear to local authorities that the new system, which was designed to ensure first class meat inspection, was to be self-financing and that there would be no subvention from central funds.  It was intended that the money would come from a small fee to be paid by butchers for each animal.  It soon become obvious that the proceeds from this levy would fall far short of the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps understandable at the time that the Department of Finance was particularly strapped for cash in terms of extra funding since, with a current deficit of more than £2 billion, that was the greatest period of cost-cutting in the history of the State.  However, that excuse is no longer acceptable given the current position regarding meat inspection, which makes very sorry reading.  It is now more than six and a half years since the Abbatoirs Act came into force. Under that Act 32 local authorities were supposed to appoint a full-time veterinary inspector with responsibility for organising the system within his or her area, with the presupposition that the <Col N="1216" /> inspector would be supplied with the necessary resources.  However, to date ten authorities have not appointed veterinary inspectors.  Of those which have appointed full-time veterinary inspectors only five implement the Abattoirs Act, two or three partially implement it &mdash; for example, they meet most but not all the requirements for application of the traingular stamp, which is the vital last step in identifying meat that has undergone all the necessary procedures &mdash; and the remaining authorities operate as they did before the legislation was enacted.</P>
    <P>That legislation is one of the finest Acts ever put on our Statute Book.  Yet only five local authorities implement its provisions in full.  Those authorities deserve to be known as the famous five because they soldiered on regardless of the financial considerations.  I am proud to note, in this great week for my county, that Wexford is one of the five counties involved.  I am not happy, however, that we are bordered by areas that do not come into this category.  The implications for the ratepayers of Wexford are obvious, as they are for the other four areas that have complied in full.  For instance, there is nothing to prevent people from bordering areas selling meat in County Wexford.  As a member of Wexford County Council, I remember a heated debate about funding of the scheme, but we proceeded with it because we felt it was our responsibility to ensure that the Act was enforced in full.</P>
    <P>Donegal is the only Border county that implements the Act in full and, therefore, is the only county in the area which is in a position to know the origin of every animal entering its slaughterhouses. That ensures that meat from outside the jurisdiction cannot be stamped by veterinary inspectors in the county.  It does not ensure that such meat cannot come indirectly through another county and find it ways into a retail outlet there.  That is patently <Col N="1217" /> unfair to ratepayers whose local authorities have implemented these very necessary procedures in good faith.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take the necessary steps to have the Act implemented in full throughout the country and have the system standardised so that everyone will know what the triangular stamp signifies.  I am sure the Minister for Health would be interested in this issue because it is a health matter.  The Minister for Finance also has a role to play because it is vital that this system be financed by the Exchequer.  In overall budgetary terms the total cost would be minute.  When dealing with the health of the general population it is unfair to expect the shrinking minority who happen to be ratepayers to provide the funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hugh Byrne for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Abattoirs Act, 1988, was enacted to remedy a very unsatisfactory situation in regard to the veterinary inspection of domestic meat production, which was governed by antiquated legislation dating back to the last century and was operated very unevenly throughout the country by the local authorities.  In general only the major urban areas and adjoining counties operated a satisfactory service from a public health point of view.</P>
      <P>The solution to the problem adopted in the Act was to divide the responsibility for abattoirs between central and local government.  My Department took on the responsibility of ensuring that the abattoir premises were brought up to a satisfactory structural standard, suitable for the slaughter of animals and production of meat.  The local authorities were given statutory responsibility for carrying out the day-to-day supervision of abattoirs and inspection and certification of the meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has performed its <Col N="1218" /> role under the Act very successfully and has raised the standard of abattoirs to a considerable degree.  Of the original 760 local abattoirs, some 330 have ceased operations because they could not reach the standard required, while a further 80 are subject to review or under notice to cease operations.  In effect the number of operating premises has been halved and only the best of them are still operating.  In that respect the Act has been a success and has benefited the consumer considerably.</P>
    <P>Where the Act has not been entirely a success relates to the local authority responsibilities in a number of cases. Section 35 of the Act requires each local authority to appoint at least one full time veterinary inspector to carry out the functions prescribed by the Act. Additional inspectors may be appointed as required.  Each local authority was required to make the first full time appointment within six months of the Act coming into force and two local authorities may enter into a sharing arrangement regarding the appointment of a full time veterinary inspector subject to the prior consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>At present ten local authorities have not appointed veterinary inspectors. These are Cavan, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, and Tipperary N.R.  I have continually urged defaulting local authorities to fulfil their statutory duties.</P>
    <P>Some claim lack of financial resources as the reason for not appointing veterinary inspectors.  The Department does not make a financial contribution towards the cost involved.  Slaughter fees are payable by abattoir operators and these go some way towards meeting the expenses of the local authorities. The original expectation was that fee income from veterinary inspections would finance the service and there would be no net cost to the local authorities. This has not been the case because of the fact that there are large numbers of small abattoirs scattered throughout the counties where the small throughput does not meet the actual <Col N="1219" /> cost of inspections.  Some counties have a number of large premises and the excess of income over costs at these premises helps to subsidise the smaller uneconomic units.  If local authorities were to charge the true cost of veterinary inspections many small abattoirs would possibly be put out of business.</P>
    <P>The situation is very unsatisfactory and I have been concerned about it for some time.  Clearly extra resources are needed to achieve the full objective of the Act, but it must be emphasised that the actions of my Department and of the local authorities which have <Col N="1220" /> implemented the Act fully, have improved the situation considerably compared with the position which prevailed before the Act.  I accept that more needs to be done and I am urgently reviewing the position with a view to devising appropriate arrangements to remedy the situation.  I assure the Deputy that all abattoirs, including those in the functional areas of local authorities which have not appointed wholetime veterinary inspectors, are subject to inspection for licensing purposes by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 June 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development clearly identifies and addresses the long-term issues affecting the communities on our offshore islands.  For the first time, the report establishes a coherent and comprehensive basis for Government policy in relation to the islands.  It <Col N="898" /> sets out a strategic framework within which future actions in relation to the economic and social development of island communities will be considered and pursued.  As chairman of the co-ordinating committee, I am responsible for co-ordinating the Government's response to the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the report covers a number of issues which are of priority importance to our offshore island communities.  Many of these issues are inter-related.  Two such issues, which are highlighted in the report, are education and access services.  The provision of educational services is of crucial importance to maintaining vibrant island communities.  I believe that initiatives which aim to maintain and strengthen the vital link between young islanders and their communities, are important to reversing the cycle of decline and tackling the depopulation issue.  The provision of access services to facilitate island children travelling to and from schools on the mainland is of primary importance in this regard.</P>
      <P>With regard to education, the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee made three particular recommendations in its report.  First, the Government has agreed to the accommodation of the interests of island communities in the proposed education boards structure. This is consistent with the aspirations of local empowerment outlined in the White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting Our Education Future&rdquo; and will involve islanders more centrally in the provision of educational services to their communities.</P>
      <P>Second, the Government has also agreed to changes regarding the Department of Education's remote area boarding grant, which facilitates a child's attendance at school on the mainland. The means test limit for the remote area boarding grant, which has been a source of dissatisfaction among islanders, will now be substantially increased to a level in line with third level education grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, in accordance with recommendations in the report concerning the <Col N="899" /> use of information technology as an educational resource, I hope to be in a position shortly to announce a distance learning pilot project for the islands. This innovative project aims to use the latest technology whereby islanders can participate fully in training and education which previously could only be provided on the mainland.</P>
    <P>I should remind the Deputy that, while I am responsible for the co-ordination of the Government's response to the recommendations within the report, individual Ministers continue to retain responsibility for their respective areas of policy.</P>

      <P>The Action Plan for Western Development, recently launched by the Western Development Partnership Board, provides a strategic focus for the economic and social development of the western region.  In welcoming the board's plan, the Government announced a number of important initiatives including the establishment of a western investment fund.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> It is proposed that the fund, which is to be set up and managed on a professional and commercial basis, would draw on resources progressively from the Exchequer the EU, the European Investment Bank and private depositors. The Government is prepared to make available up to £25 million to the fund over the next six years.  This is further concrete evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to the development of the west.</P>
    <P>As the detailed arrangements of the fund remain to be worked out over the coming months, questions relating to precise funding sources are premature. I intend making a statement shortly in the House on the Government's response to the Action Plan for Western Development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has indeed experienced sustained solid growth in recent years.  It is estimated that GNP expanded by over 7 per cent in 1995, and growth of 5 per cent is forecast this year.  This growth has been reflected in strong employment growth.  In the last six years the numbers at work rose by 146,000, or over 13 per cent.  This is more than the number of jobs created in the previous 30 years! In 1995 alone, employment grew by a record 52,000.</P>
      <P>This year, employment growth is expected to remain strong.  My Department forecasts an increase of around 30,000 in the numbers at work this year. The available indicators to date support this view that employment will continue to increase.  For example, building and construction employment increased by over 8 per cent in the year to March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is therefore clear that the myth of &ldquo;jobless growth&rdquo; has been well and truly exploded and that the increase in employments is impacting on unemployment. The 1995 labour force survey shows that there has been a fall of 17 per cent in unemployment in the two <Col N="902" /> years from mid-April 1993.  This is a fall of 40,000 in the numbers of people unemployed.  My Department forecasts that unemployment will fall further in 1996 by about 10,000.</P>
    <P>Ireland's unemployment rate, which averaged 12.9 per cent in 1995, is now converging towards the European average. The OECD¹ estimates that in 1996 Ireland's unemployment rate will average 12.5 per cent within 2 per cent of the European average, estimated at 10.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The progress made in reducing unemployment has been achieved despite the continuing high rate of natural increase in the labour force, increased participation rates as job prospects improve and lower levels of emigration.</P>
    <P>This is evidence that the Government policies of sound macroeconomic management and fiscal restraint are working to create growth and sustainable employment and that the scourge of unemployment is being effectively tackled.  Furthermore, the measures taken to improve training and employment opportunities for the unemployed, and particularly the long-term unemployed, in the last budget are also an important part of this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, last year I established an interdepartmental committee to thoroughly investigate the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers.  I would like to remind the House of the main finding of this committee.  This committee found that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax is fair and reasonable <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers. Consequently, the committee felt that there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers.  The committee did, however, make other recommendations, most notably, to exempt cross-Border workers from the health and employment and training levies.  As the Deputies are no doubt aware, I announced such an exemption in this year's budget and this was introduced in this year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of tax equity for cross-Border workers, we must be clear as to whom we are comparing ourselves with.  It is not appropriate for an Irish resident worker to compare his-her income with the income of a Northern Irish resident or other non-resident workers.  We are all too aware that the income tax liabilities in this country are high but it is not true to say that cross-Border workers do not have tax equity, they do.  They are treated the same for income tax purposes as any other resident taxpayer.  Comparisons with nonresidents is neither appropriate nor valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its work the interdepartmental committee examined the application of the relevant provisions of the 1976 Irish-British double taxation agreement.  It recommended that consideration should be given to the renegotiation of this treaty with a view to <Col N="904" /> resolving differences of interpretation which exist at present.</P>
    <P>Since the committee reported, the Revenue Commissioners have been in negotiations with their UK counterparts with a view to resolving the differences of interpretation which exist in the present treaty.  However, at this stage no decision has been taken as to the final outcome of these negotiations and therefore it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said many times before, the issues involved in cross-Border taxation are complex, involving two jurisdictions, and the examination of these issues takes time.  There are no easy solutions which will cater directly for the individuals affected while being fair to all the taxpayers involved i.e. both the cross-Border workers and all other Irish resident taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the International Financial Services Centre is very much at the centre of this Government's policy on financial matters, as it was for previous Governments.  This is reflected in the fact that since the IFSC was established in 1987, successive Finance Acts, including this year's, have included provisions which directly related to the IFSC.  The inclusion of these measures in every Finance Act since 1987 clearly demonstrates the importance of the IFSC and highlights the commitment of successive Governments to facilitating the on-going development of the centre with a view to creating further sustainable employment and strengthening the financial services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> Also, in order to ensure that the public and private sectors work together in this area, there is a special IFSC clearing house group.  This is a high level working group comprising representatives of all the relevant State agencies as well as representatives of the industry.  The group is chaired by the Taoiseach's Department, and meets regularly with a view to identifying and dealing expeditiously with any issues of concern which arise in this area.</P>
    <P>I think that all of the above indicate very clearly that the IFSC is at the centre of our policies in relation to the financial services industry, and will remain so in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 38 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under European Union legislation and other international obligations, the <Col N="906" /> employment of national preference provisions in the State's public procurement activities are legally precluded. While the State cannot, therefore, discriminate in favour of Irish companies, these companies would most certainly be afforded a fair and equal opportunity to compete for public contracts.  Such a fair and equal opportunity is indeed afforded for all public contracts, whether in connection with the Presidency of the EU or otherwise.  This has been the position under successive administrations and will continue to be so.</P>
    <P>As regards a code of conduct, there is a publication entitled &ldquo;Public Procurement&rdquo;, issued by my Department, which sets out the guidelines for the award of public contracts in Ireland.  Its purpose is to ensure that fair, competitive and non-discriminatory procedures apply in the tendering, assessment and award of public sector contracts.  I am not aware of any significant level of public disquiet in respect of the procedures for awarding Government contracts.  Naturally, the implementation of the national guidelines and relevant EU Directives, in respect of individual contracts, would be a matter for the Minister within whose functional area the particular works, supplies or services are commissioned. Accordingly, if the Deputy has a particular contract in mind, he should put down a question to the Minister concerned.  I should say that any tendering procedure will by definition have as its outcome one successful candidate and a number of unsuccessful ones.  This can give rise to understandable feelings of disappointment and frustration on the part of the unsuccessful candidates which are occasionaly voiced in the public domain.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 50 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that these questions refer to an article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 19 May 1996.  I am aware of the report in question and am familiar with the thrust of the findings which it describes.  The article relates to the impact of the interaction of aspects of the taxation and welfare codes as they have evolved over a long period and, as a consequence of which, certain individuals can face a reduction in their net income as their earnings increase.  This phenomenon is known as the poverty trap and the case described in the article is an extreme example of the phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people who potentially lose disposable income as gross pay increases is small.  The main factors contributing to the decline in net income as the gross income increases are the 60 per cent withdrawal rate of family income supplement &mdash; FIS &mdash; combined with the operation of marginal relief system for income tax involving a 40 per cent marginal tax rate.  In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax are the main elements of the trap, the number of people affected is a <Col N="908" /> direct function of the numbers who receive FIS and pay tax.  The estimated numbers of people in this situation is in the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this situation potentially &ldquo;applied to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;.  While not attempting to minimise the problem for those affected, it is necessary to put it into overall perspective and not to seek to represent as a general problem what is in fact, an unusual and limited situation. While the newspaper article in question highlighted the acute problem faced by those with large families, such as eight children, the actual number of families with eight or more children who were in receipt of FIS in April 1996 was 89.</P>
    <P>In interpreting the article in question, it is also important that the mechanism for reviewing FIS is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12-monthly basis.  Once awarded, it will not be reduced or withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any interim upward movement in pay.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.  The Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems has pointed out in its interim report that FIS withdrawal does not generally occur at the same time as a gross pay increase.</P>
    <P>The Government fully accepts the need to create the incentive to work among the unemployed and to ensure that this incentive is maintained for those in employment.  The various actions required to achieve these aims may produce aberrations and anomalies at points along the income schedule; this is not to say that these actions, being entirely valid in themselves, should be abandoned because of these unintended results affecting a small segment of the population.  It has to be recognised that it takes both resources and time to eliminate the undesirable side affects which can arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> It was to address the various complexities involved in this whole area that the Expert Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare Systems was established.  The group has concluded a detailed examination of the issues and will be publishing its analysis and recommended approach in the very near future.  This report will be examined carefully.  I do not expect a simple solution to the poverty trap problem; indeed, I know there is not one. However, I am ever mindful of the necessity to minimise any adverse impact which future changes to the tax and social welfare systems have on the more vulnerable in the labour force and I can assure this House that steps will continue to be taken to remove such consequences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 41, 44, 61 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland covers the following sub-programmes: urban and rural regeneration; employment; cross-Border development; social inclusion and productive investment and industrial development.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, following widespread consultation with local interests, required the major emphasis of the programme to be on social inclusion.  While there is provision for capital spending under the programme such expenditure must support the objectives in general and this emphasis in particular.  Significant additional funding for capital infrastructure has been made available to the Border counties under the INTERREG programme, as well as the main operational programmes.</P>
      <P>Most of the measures are being managed by intermediary funding bodies which are independent of Government Departments and funded under global grants agreements concluded between the intermediaries and the Commission. In addition, sub-programme 2 &mdash; Urban and Rural Regeneration &mdash; involves the participation of county council-led task forces across a wide range of actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programmes was approved by the <Col N="911" /> Commission at the end of July 1995 and the global grant agreements between the Commission and the intermediary funding bodies were signed on 8 December last.</P>
    <P>The innovative implementing mechanisms adopted for the peace programme were required by the European Commission to ensure the greatest possible participation and involvement of the local communities.  It has been the case that the intermediary bodies, drawn from the community and voluntary sector, took somewhat longer to get organised to carry out the functions required of them than I would have wished but we must accept the particular constraints, including public accountability, under which the programme is required to operate.</P>
    <P>Definitive progress reports are being prepared by the various implementing bodies for a meeting of the monitoring committee of the programme at end June, and I will arrange to have a full report circulated to interested Deputies.</P>
    <P>The total EU funding available to the initiative is 300 million ECU over three years.  At least 20 per cent of this funding is committed to the six Border counties, but the actual figure remains to be determined.  Progress will be a relevant determinant.  The programme is a five year old one, ending 31 December 1999. Commitments of existing funding may be made up to that date so the question of extending the programme from 1997 does not arise.</P>
    <P>My Department has no substantive role in relation to the implementation of measures and awarding of grants.  As far as payments out of the programme are concerned, it is responsible only for the technical assistance measure which provides funding for the actions necessary for monitoring the programme and facilitating delivery.  For example, the setting-up costs of the intermediary bodies are being met out of this measure.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to make the details of allocations to the Border counties under each measure available in the form of a written addendum to this answer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> TABLE SHOWING ALLOCATIONS PER MEASURE TO THE SIX BORDER COUNTIES.</P>
    <P>This table details the delivery mechanisms and responsible departments, together with the public funding element, in mECU, for each of the measure.  Those measures outlined in italics are the ones being administered by the intermediary bodies, where ADM or Combat Poverty are shown as the intermediary body the other agency is shown in brackets; this reflects the agreement between the two bodies to effect mutual liaison through means of a joint steering group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 36, 43, 53 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the programme for renewal indicated that the future of RPT would be considered in the context of a professional study of local government financing which is at present being undertaken by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment. I understand that phase 1 of <Col N="924" /> the review has been completed and that the report is with the Minister for the Environment at present.  He has undertaken to publish this document and make it widely available in due course. As I have said on many occasions previously, I will evaluate all aspects of residential property tax in light of the findings of both phases of the study when completed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the location of residential property taxpayers, Deputies McDowell and Clohessy asked whether more than 50 per cent live in three Dáil Éireann constituencies.  Statistics are not available by reference to constituency boundaries.  However, I have provided Deputies on several occasions with a table of RPT taxpayers broken down by county and Dublin postal district.  I can make this available to the Deputies again, if they wish.</P>
    <P>The aggregation of household income to determine exemption on income grounds has always been a feature of residential property tax since its introduction in 1983.  Although the tax is levied on the owner(s) of the property, it is essentially a tax on the enjoyment and use of that property.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the total income of all persons normally resident in the house should be taken into account for this purpose.  Any other approach would be inequitable.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to Deputies McDowell and Quill's question regarding no right of contribution, the Supreme Court found in the Gallagher Constitutional case in 1984 that the aggregation of household income for the income exemption test was neither unreasonable nor unjust, regardless of the right of the owner(s) to recover a contribution.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest published figures for outstanding taxes were included in the 1994 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts and show the position regarding uncollected taxes at 31 May 1995.  The 1994 report showed a total of £2,057 million in outstanding taxes.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of this amount is as follows: income tax, excluding PAYE £684 million; VAT, £529 million; PAYE, £260 million; PRSI, £253 million; corporation tax, £268 million; capital gains tax, £54 million; residential property tax, £4 million; capital acquisitions tax, £3 million and abolished taxes £2 million.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the £2,057 million contains a high level of unreal debt due to the presence of estimated tax liabilities from the pre self-assessment era, as well as tax liabilities for cases in liquidation and for cases that have ceased to trade.  These factors are taken into account when forecasting the amount of tax likely to be collected.  The amount likely to be collected at 31 May 1995 is just over £500 million.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that the Revenue Commissioners have undertaken a number of successful measures in the last few years to improve their administration of the taxation system.  Among those measures were steps to improve the collection of current taxes as well as a concerted effort to address the issue of arrears of taxes due to the Exchequer.  This action has resulted in a reduction of the stated amount of outstanding taxes from £2,984 million at 31 May 1990 to £2,057 million at 31 May 1995.</P>

      <P>Action to deal with criminals is of course primarily a matter for the Garda. The Revenue Commissioners do, however, have an important part to play in relation to taxation.  Where it can be established that a person resident in the State has generated profits from illegal <Col N="927" /> or unknown activities the Revenue may use section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, to bring some or all of the profits into assessment.  These profits are assessed under the description of miscellaneous income.  Revenue have been researching cases of this type and have liaised with the Garda in this regard.  I understand that they have in two recent cases gathered information which has enabled them to process assessments.  Revenue advise me that they are continuing their efforts in this regard and expect over the coming months to have advanced more cases of the type to the stage of entering assessments.</P>
      <P>Where evidence is available that would support a criminal prosecution for tax evasion.  Revenue will also do everything possible to advance such a prosecution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax burden on people in employment is of particular concern to the Government.  Consequently in my two budgets I have focused relief towards lowering the tax burden, particularly of those in low paid employment.  This has been achieved through significant improvements in the income tax and <Col N="928" /> PRSI areas.  Such measures included increasing personal allowances and exemption limits, widening the standard band and introducing a new weekly PRSI-free allowance which currently stands at £80 per week for full rate PRSI contributors.</P>
    <P>The improvements I have introduced mean that a single full rate PRSI contributor, having only basic personal allowances, will not be liable to pay tax at the 48 per cent rate until their gross income exceeds £12,850 this year as compared to £11,636 in 1994-95.  In the case of a married couple, one earner, the threshold for the higher rate of tax has been increased to £24,900 as compared to £22,186 in 1994-95.  This represents increases in the thresholds for the higher rate of 10.4 per cent and 12.2 per cent, respectively, which are more than twice the expected rate of inflation. Furthermore, the total tax and PRSI take for a single worker on the average industrial wage has fallen by slightly over 1.5 percentage points of gross income as compared to two years ago.</P>
    <P>The improvements made over the last two budgets are significant.  The measures introduced have been aimed primarily towards reducing the average tax take and increasing the threshold for the 48 per cent tax rate rather than cutting tax rates.  Clearly, however, further progress is needed in reducing the tax and PRSI burden, thereby improving the competitiveness of the economy. There are, of course, different views as to the form further reductions in taxation should take, and the groups towards whom relief should be targeted. I would hope, within responsible budgetary parameters, to consolidate and built upon the type of measures introduced over the past two years in the 1997 budget.</P>

      <P>I have no direct information on the progress of the living over the business initiative which is monitored by the Department of the Environment.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with responsibility for Housing and Urban Renewal, Deputy McManus, replied to a similar question on this issue in the House on 9 May last.  From her reply and from my own knowledge of and experience in this area, I am aware that, while there has been some development generated by the initiative, the overall progress on the scheme has been disappointing so far.  The Department of the Environment has end 1995 figures reporting that three living over the business projects has been completed and eight were in progress at that stage with a further 21 projects in planning.  The estimated value of these projects at that time was about £6 million.</P>
      <P>A consultancy study on the impact of the tax based urban renewal scheme which has operated since 1986 is at present being carried out.  This study is examining the economic, social and architectural impacts of the scheme.  In this context, the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, has specifically asked that the study examine the living over the business initiative.  The results of the study will influence future policy in the area of urban renewal including the living over the business scheme.</P>

      <P>In last year's budget I announced a new scheme of relief for traditional seaside resorts.  This pilot scheme came into effect last July for a three year period. The scheme is in operation in 15 seaside towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this scheme is of a pilot nature, it will be important that we learn from the experiences of the 15 designated pilot resort areas.  At present both officials from my Department and the Department of the Tourism and Trade are monitoring the progress of the scheme and I understand that the Department of Tourism and Trade has written to the regional tourism organisations and <Col N="931" /> Shannon Development requesting a report on developments under the scheme and its impact on the designated areas.  However, given the tax based nature of the scheme and the normal lead in time for capital projects it is difficult to assess the level of activity which is currently under way.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to what the Minister for Tourism and Trade had to say when questioned recently on this subject in the Dáil.  He indicated that he would be positively disposed towards giving the Government a progress report on the scheme at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, since the passing of the 1995 Finance Act, there have been numerous requests to extend the scheme to additional towns and, in certain cases, to enlarge areas where the incentives already apply.  However, as I have said on many occasions in the past until the experience from this pilot scheme can be thoroughly assessed, I have no plans to broaden in any way the current scheme.  Requests for inclusion in the scheme on behalf of other towns will be considered, if and when the scheme is being extended beyond the present three year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Business and Employers Confederation &mdash; IBEC &mdash; publication <i>Economic Trends</i>&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review,</i> dated May 1996, contains estimates of growth for 1995 and forecasts for 1996 and 1997 as follows: GDP: 1995, +9 per cent; 1996, +6.3 per cent; 1997, +4.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the estimated 1995 outturn, the text states that &ldquo;this is really a massive increase that can hardly be maintained over the medium-term&rdquo;. It also states that &ldquo;looking further out to 1997, our own cycle of growth is likely to decelerate from the recent boom and we expect growth to fall to nearer the long-term trend of around 4 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> The broad picture presented by IBEC, of exceptionally strong growth last year slowing towards a more sustainable rate of growth this year, was already well known.  It was outlined in my Department's post-budget macroeconomic forecast, contained in the <i>Economic Background to the Budget,</i> published on budget day.  This showed GDP growth slowing from an estimated 7.75 per cent in 1995 to a projected 5.75 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the performance of the Irish economy in recent years has been outstanding &mdash; GDP growth now estimated to have been about 8 per cent in 1995 followed growth of 6.7 per cent in 1994.  During this time, Ireland has been the fastest growing economy not just in the EU but also in the wider OECD area.  The economy will again be the fastest growing in the OECD area in 1996 when GDP growth is projected by my Department to be around 5.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>By way of comparison, it is worth noting that the European Commission's spring economic forecasts, published recently, estimated that growth in the EU as a whole was 2.5 per cent in 1995, and forecast growth of 1.5 per cent in 1996 and 2.5 per cent in 1997.  In this context, a slowdown in our rate of economic growth, as projected by IBEC, from 9 per cent last year, to 6.3 per cent this year and to a rate of 4.5 per cent next year can be considered to be more than satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Our economic performance reflects the success of the fiscal, monetary and incomes policies now in place.  The benefits are seen in historically low interest rates &mdash; which support growth, strong increases in employment &mdash; nearly 10 per cent between 1994 and 1996, low inflation, improved standards of living and continued improvements in the public finances.</P>

      <P>There have been no ministerial visits to Libya in the last five years.

In nine of these cases the main purpose of the visit was to discuss the importation by Libya of Irish cattle and beef.  The purpose of one visit was to discuss trade and technical co-operation between Ireland and Libya, including beef and cattle imports. The purpose of the remaining visit was to attend the inauguration of a infrastructure project.  In the course of the last visit, meetings took place with relevant officials on beef and cattle imports.</P>

The Minister of State with responsibility <Col N="939" /> for European Affairs Deputy Gay Mitchell, took part in a Ministerial Troika visit to Cairo concerning the Middle East peace process in May this year and availed of the opportunity to raise the beef issue in bilateral discussions.

      <P>I am informed that, under the provisions of the US Federal Social Security Act, 1982, persons in receipt of US social security pensions are liable to US tax where their income exceeds a certain threshold.  The rate of tax applicable, starting at 15 per cent and rising to 39.6 per cent will depend on the amount by which that threshold is exceeded.  This is the case for all recipients of US Social security pensions, resident in the US, irrespective of their nationality.  While the Deputy raises the question of a disparity in the US authorities' taxation treatment of US-resident recipients of social security pensions.  I have been informed that no such disparity on the basis of the recipient's country of origin applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following position applies in the case of recipients of such pensions resident in Ireland.  Generally, non-US resident recipients of US social security pensions are subject to a withholding tax at an effective rate of 25.5 per cent &mdash; being 30 per cent of 85 per cent of the pension payable.  This is the present position for Irish-resident recipients of US social security pensions and is something which has caused concern to the pensioners in question.  These concerns arise in part from the fact that UK-resident recipients of US social security pensions are not liable to the US withholding tax as a result of the provisions of the US-UK Double Taxation Agreement. A similar exemption for Irish-resident recipients is not provided for <Col N="943" /> under the current Ireland-US Agreement. However, this issue is being discussed with the US tax authorities as part of the current renegotiation of the Ireland-US Double Taxation Agreement.</P>

      <P>The new renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts commenced on 1 July last for a three-year period.  The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in a certain limited number of seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>I would stress that this new initiative is a pilot scheme and is of an experimental nature.  It must therefore be applied on a limited basis in order to evaluate its efficacy.</P>
      <P>The selection of the 15 towns was made in order to give an even spread around the coast of designated resort areas.  Until this pilot scheme is firmaly established it would be inappropriate to consider the designation of any further towns.  Consequently, I have no plans to extend the scheme.</P>

      <P>Because of the enormous body of legislation for which my Department and the agencies under the aegis of my Department have responsibility or which are policed by them, it is not possible to give a fully comprehensive reply.  I have set out the primary pieces of pre-1921 legislation which are still operated by my Department and the various agencies under the aegis of my Department. There may be other Acts not repealed, in full or in part, by post-1921 legislation but it would take an inordinate amount of time and require the services of a legal expert to establish the existence or otherwise of such Acts.  The Index to the Statutes 1922 to 1982 and supplement <Col N="945" /> for 1983 to 1985 should be consulted for more information.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they consider that their existing powers are adequate to enable them to discharge their responsibilities. These powers include the right to tax the profits or gains from illegal or unknown sources, including those from dealing in drugs.  The Commissioners are committed to taxing such profits <Col N="948" /> whenever it is possible to secure the necessary information for that purpose.</P>
      <P>As regards the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking, the necessary provisions for this purpose are contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The war against drug trafficking will continue to be funded as required in the normal way.  At this stage there are no plans to plough funds that may be confiscated directly back into combating drug traffickers.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners and the Garda have undertaken a joint review of certain recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to co-operation between the two bodies in its report on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.

The allowance was granted in recognition of the fact that local charges are regarded by some persons as constituting double taxation.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has a narrow function in relation to charities, that is the consideration of applications from bodies of persons or trusts claiming exemption from tax on the basis that they are established for charitable purposes only.  It has no wider regulatory function.  General regulation of charitable bodies is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  In this regard the Deputy will be aware that there is a commitment in the Government policy agreement to reform the law relating to the administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the Committee on Fund-raising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes.  That report included recommendation that organisations raising funds for charitable and other purposes be required to register with a registration authority.  I understand from the Minister that substantial progress is being made on the preparations of proposals for reform and that these will be placed before Government in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of specific statutory provisions that place confidentiality obligations on the Revenue Commissioners. In addition, it is a fundamental principle of Revenue's Charter of Taxpayer Rights, which has been so important in promoting voluntary compliance with tax obligations, that each taxpayer is entitled to confidentiality in dealing with Revenue.  These restrictions which bind the Office of the Revenue Commissioners regarding confidentiality do not bind the person involved &mdash; it is purely a matter for them to divulge to third parties information about their own tax affairs if they so wish.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they do not require, oblige or advise persons <Col N="953" /> who have been granted charitable exemption for tax purposes not to disclose that fact to the public.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners determines whether a body of persons or trust is established for charitable purposes only having regard to the relevant legislation and judicial decisions.  There is a comprehensive application process which must be gone through and stringent conditions apply to any exemptions granted.  The considerations which are taken into account in deciding cases and the requirements which must be fulfilled by applicants are set out in Information Note CHY 1 entitled Reliefs from Tax on Income and Property of Charities, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I am satisfied with the assurances of the Revenue Commissioners that the current arrangements are operating fairly, and that they are applied to all applicants equally.  Where an application for exemption is refused by the office, there is a statutory right of appeal against the refusal to the independent appeal commissioners and ultimately, to the courts.  At this point, there are three such cases at different stages within the appeal process.</P>
    <P>During my term as Minister for Finance, 539 applications for exemption from tax were received by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and 348 such exemptions were granted.</P>
    <P>I would have no objection in principle to the introduction of a statutory provision that would authorise the Revenue Commissioners to publish a list of persons to whom they had accorded the relevant tax exemption.  It would be important, however, that the limitations of such a listing were clearly understood. This matter is, therefore, only one aspect of the wider question of registration of charities to which I referred.  I will keep the tax aspect under review in that context.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works was involved in a wide variety of projects in 1995 funded both from its own Vote and from the Votes of other Government Departments. These projects range from minor maintenance to major refurbishment and new building works.  Information on these projects is not routinely maintained in the format sought.</P>
      <P>The main Subhead for capital expenditure on building construction projects in the Vote of the Office of Public Works is Subhead E entitled &ldquo;new works, alterations and additions&rdquo;.  Some £31.6 million was expended under this Subhead in 1995.  Such expenditure was covered by either delegated or, upon making requests to the Department of Finance, specific sanctions and included: refurbishment of existing properties within the State portfolio (£9.2 million), Department of Justice programme of works (£8.5 million), Dublin Castle Complex (£6.6 million), National Cultural Institutions (National Museum, National Gallery etc.) (£5.5 million) and restoration of the Curvilinear Range in the Botanic Gardens (£1.06 million). The balance of the expenditure was incurred on a number of smaller works. Expenditure on the capital element of the implementation of the Development Plan for Dublin Zoo which was sanctioned in 1994 amounted to £.96 million in 1995 (Subhead M).  Expenditure on major projects can extend over a number of years and there are no decisions outstanding on requests submitted to the Minister for Finance in 1995.</P>

    <P>The Office of Public Works through its engineering services division was also responsible for, <i>inter alia,</i> the design of flood relief schemes (including the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis) <Col N="955" /> for Cappamore, Carlow, Duleek, Dunmanway, Gort, Kilkenny, Newport, Six-milebridge and Williamstown.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure arose on Heritage Services Subheads also in 1995. These services were transferred to the Vote of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in 1996.</P>

      <P>General Government debt, which includes the debt of local authorities, health boards and other non commercial semi-State bodies is the most appropriate measure of calculating the total debt of the Irish State.  The latest date for which figures are available is 31 December 1995.  As at that date the General Government debt stood at £32,709 million of which £21,794 million or 67 per cent was denominated in Irish pounds with the remaining £10,915 million denominated in a range of foreign currencies.</P>
      <P>The total debt of the commercial semi-State companies at 31 December 1995 amounted to IR£5,801 million.  Of this £4,790 million or 83 per cent was denominated in Irish currency with the residual, amounting to £1,012 million, denominated in foreign currencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that these figures are not additive because there is some overlap between the debt of the general Government sector and the debt of the commercial semi-State bodies.  For example, borrowings of the Housing Finance Agency which are counted as <Col N="957" /> part of the commercial semi-State debt become part of the general Government debt when drawn by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available of taxpayers who pay tax in circumstances where application of the correct allowances would have exempted them from such payments.</P>
      <P>The tax-free allowances granted to taxpayers are based on the information furnished by the taxpayer to his-her inspector of taxes.  If the net income shown on a return furnished by a taxpayer is less than the appropriate exemption threshold, that taxpayer will be exempted from paying tax.</P>
      <P>Every taxpayer, whether exempt or not, receives a certificate of tax-free allowances each year.  If the information on the certificate is not correct, for example, as a result of a return of income not being lodged every year, the taxpayer should complete the form enclosed with the certificate to advise the inspector of the correct position.</P>

      <Quest>whether an agreement can be made with the authorities in Northern Ireland to have the families of cross-Border workers treated in the same manner as workers in the North in respect of health care for their entire family, that is cross-Border workers who pay the same health contributions should have their family included in the care that is provided or else their contributions should be reduced.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Within the European Union reciprocal arrangements regarding the health care entitlements of workers and their families living in one country and working in another are governed by the provisions of EU Regulation 1408/71.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons resident in one country have entitlement to benefits under legislation in a second country by virtue of being employed there.  Such persons are given equivalent benefits in the country in which they are resident on behalf of the country in which they are employed. The latter country is responsible for the costs involved.  Where health services are provided in respect of a person <Col N="962" /> working in Northern Ireland the equivalent benefit results, in effect, in entitlement to a medical card without means testing.</P>
    <P>Members of the workers' family are also entitled to services which are equivalent to that of the country on whose behalf the services are provided unless the spouse or the person looking after the children pursues a professional or trade activity in the territory of residence. In such cases, their eligibility for a medical card would be subject to means testing and it would not be considered appropriate to provide them with a medical card irrespective of their means.</P>
    <P>Any person who is not eligible for a medical card under EU regulations may apply for a medical card under Irish legislation on a the basis of need.  I am satisfied that the chief executive officers of the health boards, who have statutory responsibility in this area, give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>In the 1996 financial statement the Minister for Finance announced an exemption from the health contribution and the employment and training levy on their Northern Ireland earnings for cross-Border workers.  This measure has addressed the problem regarding health contributions raised by the Deputy in her question.</P>

      <P>This programme was introduced in the Western Health Board in October 1994.  By this autumn it will be available in 12 general and two psychiatric schools of nursing.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have had inquiries made of all the health boards and the voluntary hospitals and the following is the position.  First, in all cases, details of the patient's occupation are sought on his-her admission to hospital.  This information is sought for demographic planning and statistical purposes.  It is also required by the Central Statistics Office in the event of having to register a death.  The particulars to be recorded in the Register of Deaths are set out in the Births and Deaths Act, 1863-1994, and in regulations made under those Acts.</P>
      <P>Second, in most cases, information is sought from both men and women in relation to their respective spouses' occupations.  Health agencies request this information primarily for epidemiological and demographic planning purposes. It is also important for medical staff to obtain as much social history information as possible to assist in clinical diagnosis.  For example, where both partners have high pressure occupations, in addition to family commitments, this may be an underlying cause of stress in whichever partner presents at hospital.</P>
      <P>Third, in maternity hospitals, details of the husband's occupation are always sought, as the 1863 Registration of Births and Deaths Act requires that the rank and profession of the father be recorded but makes no provision for the recording of the mother's occupation.  In practice, however, most maternity hospitals seek details of the mother's occupation for demographic planning and epidemiological purposes.  The Deputy will wish to know that the recent legislation governing the registration of stillbirths, the Stillbirths Registration Act, 1994, requires that details of the occupation of the mother and of the father be recorded.</P>
      <P>In the case of VHI patients, the VHI requires that details of the subscriber's occupation be given.  It should be noted that the whole area of registration law is under review and this is a matter for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Work on the amendment of the Medical Practioners Act, 1978 including consideration of its provisions relating to registration is at an advanced stage.  I expect that this work will be completed shortly and that I will be in a position to bring forward amending legislation by the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>On 30 June, 1994, the text of an adoption agreement between the Minister for Health and the Romanian Committee for Adoptions was approved by Dáil Éireann.  The agreement was then signed in Bucharest on 7 July, 1994.</P>
      <P>The agreement sets out the procedures for the adoption of Romanian children by Irish residents.  Under its terms, only applications from persons whose suitability and eligibility to adopt has been determined by the Adoption Board in accordance with the provisions of the Adoption Act, 1991, are to be considered by the Romanian Committee for Adoptions.  That Committee has responsibility for selecting the child to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the agreement was being negotiated, the Romanian Committee indicated that for administrative reasons it would only be in a position to process five applications at a time from any one country.  The first five applications from Irish residents wishing to adopt in Romania were duly forwarded to the Romanian Committee by the Adoption <Col N="973" /> Board.  These applications have not been processed by the Romanian Committee in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Since the agreement was signed, it has emerged that a number of Romanian children have been adopted by Irish residents outside the terms of the agreement. The Adoption Board is aware that at least 22 such adoptions have been effected.</P>
    <P>In the light of this development, we have been endeavouring to establish the precise arrangements for processing adoption applications involving Irish residents.  There are ongoing contacts with the Romanian Committee with a view to clarifying the position and the current status of the agreement itself.</P>
    <P>Romania is the only country with which an adoption agreement has been signed to date.  The possibility of negotiating similar accords with Peru, Ecuador and the People's Republic of China is currently being explored.  In view of the intergovernmental nature of such agreements, my Department has the lead role in negotiating them, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The role of the Adoption Board would relate to the actual operation of the agreement on behalf of the Minister for Health, as in the case of the agreement with Romania.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Eastern Health Board to provide information on the number of children provided with emergency accommodation in hospitals and duration of stay in each case for the period 1 January to 30 May <Col N="974" /> 1996 and I will forward the details to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in general, I do not favour the use of hospital accommodation for social admissions.  When small children are referred in emergency or crisis situations and no alternative placement is available either in a residential centre or with foster parents, it has sometimes been found necessary to place them in hospital.  The Eastern Health Board is taking all possible steps to provide alternative accommodation.  In particular an expanded crisis intervention service is being developed for children who need emergency placement out of hours.  A residential unit for children under 12 years of age and two additional emergency units for older children are being provided.</P>
      <P>A major recruitment campaign for additional foster parents was launched in May and it is hoped to assign a number of newly recruited foster parents to provide emergency short-term places.</P>

      <P>This study, which was completed earlier this year, was commissioned independently by my Department on foot of the Advisory Group on Personal Assistance Services for People with Physical Disabilities consideration that such a study should be carried out to help establish the total costs of personal assistance services and to assess their total benefits.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> My Department has received a copy of the Coroner's Record of Verdict on the case referred to by the Deputy and I have noted its contents.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for the safe running of events such as that referred to by the Deputy rests with the promoters and venue owners.  In January this year the Department of Education published a code of practice for safety at outdoor pop concerts and other events.  While the code was designed for outdoor events, it states clearly that the parameters for the good organisation of an indoor event are basically similar to the arrangements required at outdoor occasions.</P>
      <P>The code of practice, issued by the Department of Education, clearly outlines the detailed requirements in relation to the provision of medical facilities, first-aid and ambulances at major events and I would expect that promoters and venue owners would have regard to these guidelines.  As I have recently indicated to the Deputy, investigations are ongoing into a similar tragic occurrence and should these investigations show any deficiency in the present arrangements, the Government will move quickly to remedy the situation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> During 1995 the Southern Health Board decided that a working party, comprising representatives of each of the city hospitals, general practitioners and the ambulance service, should be established to review the organisation and management of the accident and emergency services in Cork.</P>
      <P>The group met on a number of occasions under the chairmanship of Mr. Stephen Cusack, A and E consultand at the Cork University Hospital.  I understand that the report has recently been completed and is under consideration by the Southern Health Board.  On receipt of the report within my Department, the recommendations will be examined in detail and the question of funding will be considered at that stage.</P>
      <P>On the question of the appointment of an additional A and E consultant to Cork, the Deputy will be aware that the recent Comhairle na nOspideal report on consultant manpower needs for Cork recommended the establishment of a pan-hospital structure.  This structure is designed to act as a vehicle for achieving consensus between the agencies in Cork with regard to priority consultant posts and the location of those posts within the Cork hospital system.</P>

    <P>I would expect that the question of the appointment of an additional A and E consultant post for Cork would be <Col N="978" /> subject, in the first instance, to discussion through the consultation process set up under that structure, in association with the management of the agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>The two main incentives available for film production in Ireland are: Section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, which provides tax relief to persons or companies investing in the production of a <Col N="982" /> qualifying film, the main features of which are: &mdash; for productions commencing principal photography in the off-peak production period covering the months of October to January inclusive, up to 66 per cent of the cost of production of projects under £4 million and 55 per cent of the cost of production of projects over £5 million can be raised under Section 35, subject to a maximum of £8.25 million; in peak production periods covering the months February to September inclusive, the amount of investments which can be raised under Section 35 is 60 per cent of the cost of production of projects under £4 million and 50 per cent of projects over £5 million, subject to a maximum of £7.5 million; tax relief on individual and company investments is 80 per cent of the amount invested, but both individual and corporate investors may now dispose of their shares at the end of one year instead of every three years; the annual limit for investments by corporate investors is £6 million; Section 35 tax relief is triggered at the first day of principal photography; and development and production loans awarded by Bórd Scannán na hÉireann, the Irish Film Board, for the development of projects and the production of films.</P>
      <P>Some funding for films is made available by RTÉ under the provisions of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, and An Comhairle Ealaíon operates a film and video awards, scheme which includes short dramas, animated shorts and experimental productions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other factors which should be mentioned for the sake of completeness but do not come directly under the aegis of my Department (apart from the role of Údarás na Gaeltachta as an industrial development agency) are the following: assistance, including capital grants, is available from the State industrial development agencies for companies wishing to establish permanent production facilities in Ireland; a 10 per cent manufacturing rate of company tax is applicable to companies involved in <Col N="983" /> manufacturing, including film production; the master negative of a film is regarded as plant and can be written off for tax purposes over seven years; and incentives are available to Irish producers from European-wide initiative such as the EU Media II Programme 1996-2000 and EURIMAGES &mdash; the Council of Europe's film co-production fund which has an annual budget of over £18 million and has to date assisted 12 Irish films co-produced in each case with two other European partners.</P>

      <P>I believe that the canals have considerable potential for further development in respect of cruising, fishing, wildlife appreciation, walking and industrial archaeology.  They are a unique feature of Dublin and have the potential to boost the tourist industry with consequent spinoff in terms of job creation.</P>
      <P>My Department has published corridor studies in respect of both canals in the Dublin area which point the way forward in terms of development.  The recommendations of these studies are being actively pursued by my Department. I am satisfied that with co-operation between my Department, the local authorities, the private sector, the local communities along the corridors, and the general public, both canals will be able to achieve their considerable potential.</P>

Effect is given to the provisions of section 3 by Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, under which local authorities are obliged to give public notice of, <i>inter alia,</i> any housing development proposed by them.  Submissions or observations dealing with the proper planning and development of the area concerned must be sought in regard to the proposed development and the plans must be available for inspection by the public during a period of not less than one month.  Following the period allowed for submissions or observations, a report must be prepared regarding the details of the proposal and this must include details of any submissions or observations received in relation to it. The report must be submitted to the elected members of the local authority who have the discretion, under section 3 of the Local Government Act, 1995, to direct that the proposed development is not to proceed.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the provision of road traffic signs on the national road network is a matter for the National Roads Authority. Responsibility for signposting on non-national roads is a matter for each local road authority; funding of such signs falls to be met from road authorities' own resources, which are supplemented by the annual discretionary grants provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>To assist in improving directional signage for the airport and the ferry-ports in Dublin, a special grant of £150,000 was allocated in 1995 under the DTI traffic management grants scheme.  I understand that the first phase of the scheme is now being implemented.  The question of providing additional funding under this scheme in 1996 and future years is a matter for the Dublin Transportation Office to which the administration of the scheme has been devolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more general note, a comprehensive traffic signs manual, setting out standards required for all types of road signs is being prepared at present by my Department for use by road authorities. This will help to ensure that there is good practice in the provision of signs on all classes of roads.  I intend to launch <Col N="996" /> the manual as soon as possible and I am confident that it will lead to significant improvements in traffic signage throughout the country.</P>

      <P>In response to the report from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the report, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to contact these schools and invite applications for consideration for support under the new initiative.  The process of contacting these schools is now under way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 172, 173, 174 and 189 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to primary schools.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  In the specific case of County Donegal, 106 of the 178 primary schools in the county now have the services of a remedial teacher.  A detailed breakdown of remedial teachers per county follows.</P>
    <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil-teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I have adopted particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage. As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The letter in question was sent to the secretary of my Department prior to my appointment as Minister for Education. However, I have since been made generally aware of the subject matter of this and other related correspondence.</P>
      <P>I understand that the phone calls referred to in the letter were made to the person referred to by the Deputy. An examination of the files relating to the period has failed to show any record of the phonecalls in question other than the reference in the letter.  However, the subject matter of the phonecalls and subsequent developments in relation to these matters are recorded in my Department.</P>
      <P>I understand a copy of the letter to which the Deputy refers was also sent to the secretary of the Department of Finance at that time.  In February 1993 I received a letter from the person in question enclosing copies of correspondence which she had with the then Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  No representations or inquiries in relation to these matters have been received in my Department from the current Minister for Finance.  However, as the matters in question were the subject of consideration by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Finance would have been briefed on developments taking place in relation to these matters.</P>

      <P>The measures set out in the White Paper in relation to special needs children are intended to refine and develop the current range of responses to take on board the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee. A key objective is to ensure that all children with special needs, including those who are integrated into mainstream schools, will have access to the necessary range of supports in their own areas.  It is my intention that these measures will be implemented as speedily as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The staffing schedule for the 1996-97 school year has been published. The schedule was circulated to all principal teachers and boards of management over two weeks ago.  This matter was discussed with representatives of management and teacher organisations at a meeting on 7 May 1996.</P>
      <P>There is no threat to the job security of teachers whose posts will be suppressed at the end of the current school year because of declining enrolments. This is because permanent teachers holding posts which will be suppressed will be placed on panels for redeployment. Panels exist to ensure continued permanent employment of teachers who find themselves in this situation.</P>

      <P>To assist primary teachers secure permanent employment, I have this year concluded an <Col N="1020" /> agreement with the education partners which will allow temporary teachers who have completed a minimum of three years' temporary service to gain access to redeployment panels.  Permanent teaching vacancies must be filled, in the first instance, from these panels. This measure will prove to be of immense value to teachers seeking permanent employment.</P>
      <P>At second-level, the number of teaching posts has increased steadily over the past number of years due to increased enrolments and the introduction of new programmes.  In addition, further vacancies have arisen as a result of the allocation of additional remedial, guidance, home schools links, resource and special vice-principal posts.  The expansion of the job-sharing scheme has also contributed to the number of posts available for unemployed teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.  A comprehensive list of all schools which are due to lose posts at the end of the current school year is being finalised within my Department.  The list will identify the number of posts to be lost in each school.  I expect to be in a position to <Col N="1022" /> circulate this list to the Deputy within the next few days.</P>
      <P>The names of existing one teacher primary schools in Galway are included in appendix A.</P>
      <P>The staffing schedule for 1996-97 is unchanged from that for 1995-96. However, I have already indicated that no two teacher school which would have lost a teacher under the staffing schedule will do so.  These schools will, therefore, continue to be two teacher schools for the 1996-97 school year.  The names of the schools in Galway affected by my favourable decision in this matter are given in appendix B.</P>
      <P>In order for an existing one teacher primary school to qualify for an additional teacher in September 1996 it must have achieved a minimum valid enrolment of 28 pupils in September 1995.  Alternatively, an existing one teacher primary school may qualify for an assistant teacher if it is in breach of the maximum class size guideline, or achieves developing school status.  Generally, developing school status is achieved if a school increases its enrolment in one year relative to the previous year by a minimum of 25 pupils.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio is 22.9:1.  In the absence of primary school enrolment figures for September 1996 at this stage, it is not possible to ascertain the pupil-teacher ratio for the 1996-97 school year.  However, I am confident that measures which I recently announced will assist in reducing the pupil-teacher ratio for the 1996-97 school year.  Specifically, the Deputy is probably aware that I have committed myself to implementing the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre report on new measures to break the cycle of education disadvantage. One very substantial recommendation which I will be implementing is the allocation of additional teaching resources to the most disadvantaged schools in the primary system, both urban and rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, I am extending the substitute supply panel scheme by an additional 20 teachers from September <Col N="1023" /> next.  This scheme, which I initiated in 1993, provides cover for teachers on absences of short duration.</P>

      <P>The site at Scholarstown Road was purchased by my Department in 1982 for the purpose of providing a post-primary school in the Knocklyon area.  The price paid at the time was £385,000.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, following an extremely detailed and lengthy examination of all relevant factors, it has been established that a post-primary school is not required in the Knocklyon area.  It was decided instead that the demand for school places could be met by providing additional accommodation at Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan, and Templeogue College.</P>
      <P>With regard to Coláiste Éanna, the first phase of the extension project comprising of 743 square meters and costing approximately £470,000 is now completed. The accommodation provided in this phase consists of seven general classrooms, a commerce room, a staff-room, a social studies room and a language laboratory.  The schedule of accommodation for the second phase provides for 2,000 square meters of accommodation costing approximately £2 million. Architectural planning is under way for this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning of a 1,050 square metres extension for Templeogue College is also under way.  The accommodation to be provided consists of four general classrooms, a language laboratory, a science laboratory and preparation area, <Col N="1029" /> a demonstration room, an art and craft room and a technology room.</P>
    <P>The proposed works are intended to cater for the projected long-term enrolments in both schools, including pupils from the Knocklyon area.  The site is, therefore, no longer required by my Department for school building purposes. At this stage, it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on its current value.  South Dublin County Council is not now and never has been a leaseholder of the site.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, officials of my Department met the manager of South Dublin County Council in order to discuss a possible exchange involving a site in another part of County Dublin which the Department needed for school building purposes and the Knocklyon site.  In the event this matter was not pursued.  The question of the rezoning of the site did not arise.  No further meetings have since taken place with officials of my Department.</P>

      <P>With regard to existing delays in the courts generally, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 provided for an increase in the maximum number of judges who may be appointed to the courts.  I obtained Government approval for the appointment of 15 additional judges: three Supreme Court judges; two High Court judges, seven Circuit Court judges and three District Court judges.  Three judges were appointed to the Supreme Court on 15 April 1996 and three judges were appointed to the resulting vacancies in the High Court on the same date.  The remaining additional appointments will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>While the assignment of judges to particular areas of work such as family law is entirely a matter for the President of the relevant court, I am confident that the appointment of these additional judges will provide the courts with the resources necessary to deal effectively with existing delays and arrears, including family law cases, and assist in the prompt disposal of cases in the future.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this time to say if further additional judges would be required in the future following the introduction of legislation permitting divorce.  The situation will, however, be kept under review.</P>

      <P>On 24 May 1996 there were 633 men in custody in Mountjoy Prison 102 of whom were on remand.  On the same date there were 39 women in custody ten of whom were on remand.  Many other prisoners in custody in Mountjoy are under sentence but are also remanded facing further charges.  This is a very significant factor in sentence management, especially in the women's prison.</P>
      <P>The further statistical data requested by the Deputy about Mountjoy prisoners could only be obtained through the manual examination in detail of the files of each of the 672 prisoners in question.  This would not be an appropriate use of staff time in Mountjoy at this juncture.</P>

      <P>The position in the case referred to by the Deputy appears to have arisen not in the context of Rules of Court but in the light of statutory provisions relating to the sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court.  The limitations on the sentencing jurisdiction of the District Court reflect the fact that the court is one of summary jurisdiction and constitutional constraints arise as to the extent of penalties which may be imposed by that court.  While I have no proposals for changes in the law at present in relation to the issue referred to by the Deputy, I might mention that the question of sentencing policy generally is one on which a report from the Law Reform Commissioner is awaited.</P>

      <P>The question of the establishment of a reserve police force has been considered from time to time.  However, it is not clear that any possible advantage arising from the establishment of such a force would outweigh potential difficulties which could arise from it.  For example, one would have to be concerned with the rights of individuals faced with a new law enforcement group who would initially lack the expertise and training of full-time police.  Given the potential difficulties I have mentioned, and the problems of acceptability of such a force because of the resonances associated in this country with the idea of law enforcement by &ldquo;reserves&rdquo;, I am in no doubt that the money would be better spent in providing extra capacity for the Garda Síochána.  I am recruiting 350 gardaí this year and a further 350 in 1997.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to maximise the number of gardaí engaged on operational duties which can only be performed by members of the Garda Síochána. One of the principal ways of achieving this economically is through a programme of civilianisation of certain work within the force.  At present there are approximately 680 civilians in clerical-administrative positions attached to the Garda Síochána and in addition there are over 200 full-time and 700 part-time civilian employees attached to the Garda Síochána in the cleaning, operative, medical and other support services.</P>
      <P>The Information Technology Plan for the Force which is currently being implemented should allow for a significant number of gardaí to be released from administrative tasks to perform policing duties on the streets.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, I understand that those EU member states which have an auxiliary or a part-time police force are the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>However, I can say that of the 327 gardaí (all ranks) currently assigned from non-Border Divisions to Border duty arising from the BSE situation, 165 are from the Dublin Metropolitan Area. No members attached to specialist Garda units are among those transferred from Dublin.</P>
      <P>A careful assessment of the operational implications was made by the Garda authorities before deciding on the numbers to be assigned from DMA and non-DMA divisions.  The Garda authorities will, of course, be making such arrangements as are necessary to minimise the effects of reductions in strength in particular areas as the need arises.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are in regular contact with the business community in Tallaght and they have informed me that the establishment of a business watch scheme in the greater Tallaght area is currently being initiated.

      <P>The Garda authorities are not in favour of opening a substation in Tallaght west and I am in agreement with this view.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities point out that the drawback in opening a new Garda station, apart from the capital cost involved, is that it would divert personnel who could be better used in outdoor patrol duties.  The essential point they make is that it is far better to maximise the number of gardaí available for outdoor patrol and crime duties rather than tie up personnel indoors in staffing a new Garda station.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that foot and mobile patrols, both uniform and plain clothes, are performed in the west Tallaght area.  These patrols are augmented, when necessary, by the drugs unit based in Tallaght and by the Divisional Task Force based in Crumlin.  The west Tallaght area is also patrolled by the community policing unit based at Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> The Garda authorities are satisfied that no area of the Tallaght sub-district is so far removed from the Tallaght station that it cannot be reached within a reasonable time by the local gardaí when responding to calls for assistance. They are satisfied with the present policing arrangements for the Tallaght area and for the reasons mentioned above would not favour the setting up of a sub-station in west Tallaght.</P>

      <Quest>whether the rules for assessing disabled person's maintenance allowance will change when the responsibility for paying this allowance is transferred from the health boards to his Department, for example, whether payment will be limited to the total income of a household.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative basis for the transfer of responsibility for the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the health boards to this Department is contained in the Social Welfare Act, 1996. It is intended that the transfer will take place later this year and the scheme will be known as disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Social Welfare Act include a number of important improvements in the scheme.  First, in relation to the means assessment, the present arrangement which applies in the unemployment assistance scheme, whereby, when the spouse of a person claiming the allowance is employed, a disregard of £45 per week plus travel expenses is allowed, will also apply to disability allowance.  There will also be an improvement in the assessment of capital, including a disregard of the first £2,000.  Furthermore, in determining means, the present arrangement under which no assessment is made in respect of benefit and privilege will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the more favourable means assessment, persons in receipt of disability allowance may also benefit from the following improvements in the conditions of the scheme.  Two full rates of payment will be made where a couple are both eligible for the allowance &mdash; this is currently restricted to a personal and adult dependant rate.  Where a person is admitted to hospital, payment of disability allowance will continue for 13 weeks instead of the current eight weeks in a calendar year.  If a dependent child remains in full-time education, an increase will be made in respect of him or her until she/he reaches the age of 22 &mdash; the increase is currently payable up to 21 years of age.  A child increase will no longer be terminated if a dependent child is in hospital for more than eight <Col N="1050" /> weeks.  Persons who are dissatisfied with a decision on their claim for disability allowance may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>The question of further changes in the scheme will be considered following the transfer and in the light of any recommendations emerging from the work of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to an anomaly in the regulations for the students' summer job scheme which affects, in particular, students in regional technical colleges who have just completed a second year leading to a certificate with a view to proceeding to a third year leading to a diploma, but are deemed ineligible to qualify under the scheme because they are technically deemed to have finished their particular education course in spite of the fact that they would be fully eligible if they were doing a three year course in a university or other institution; if he will examine this situation in view of the fact that these students will have to apply for unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The underlying purpose of the students' summer job scheme is to provide income support for the less well-off third level students who are debarred from qualifying for unemployment assistance during the summer months by virtue of the provisions of section 126 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  Priority therefore is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students who have no other means of support to participate within the overall financial allocation for the 1996 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students in regional technical colleges who have finished a certificate course are, under social welfare legislation, no longer attending a course of study and are thus eligible to apply for unemployment assistance during the summer if they cannot obtain employment.  Such <Col N="1052" /> students are therefore ineligible for the students' summer job scheme.</P>

      <P>The provision of tourist accommodation is a matter for the tourism industry and depends primarily on individual operator's commercial judgement as to the manner in which to respond to levels of demand.  The industry has responded well to market forces and there has been a steady expansion in tourist accommodation, especially in recent years.</P>
      <P>All registered and approved tourist accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The sum of £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties, including of course Inishowen, was recently introduced under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  Investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax relief under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism provides assistance for accommodation in very specific circumstances, that is, for specialist accommodation at recognised outdoor pursuit centres, branded walking routes and approved residential equestrian centres.</P>

      <P>As regards the Deputy's earlier reference to Údarás na Gaeltachta, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D.

      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993, which were intended to prevent employers using fixed term contracts to avoid liability under the unfair dismissals legislation.  Under those provisions, where an employee's second or subsequent fixed-term contract &mdash; with no more than a three months break between contracts &mdash; is not renewed, the employee shall have the opportunity to have his employer's justification of the fixed term nature of the contract tested before a Rights Commissioner &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Following such a test, if it emerges that the fixed term nature of the contract was designed to avoid obligations under the unfair dismissals legislation, then the Act will apply and the employee's service under the successive fixed term contracts will be deemed to be continuous. Where, however, the fixed term nature of the contract is shown to be justified by the employer, the employee's case fails and there is no entitlement to any redress.</P>

      <P>While the major potential for new industrial development to emerge from the Washington Conference is in the area of linkage, partnership and joint venture type agreements, IDA Ireland has been following up on all potential leads and opportunities for new inward US investment projects.</P>
      <P>After the Washington Conference, Forbairt was involved with my Department, the Department of Tourism and Trade, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, An Bord Tráchtála, An Bord Bía and Bord Fáilte in assisting the US Embassy to arrange a programme for the Business Matchmaker Mission of 16 US companies which visited Northern Ireland and the Border region in October 1995.  The US Embassy arranged 78 appointments for companies in the Border counties and other parts of Ireland.  A number of negotiations on new business partnership agreements took place as a result. Such negotiations are still ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the peace process a number of pan-Atlantic partnership programmes have been funded through the US Department of Commerce, the <Col N="1060" /> International Fund for Ireland and Forbairt with the objective of helping Irish firms, particularly in the Border counties, to grow through technology acquisition and-or strategic alliance with US partners.</P>
    <P>The programmes, which include the Forbairt-IFI North American Partnership Programme, the Forbairt-Small Business Administration (US) Partnership Programme and the American Management and Business Intership Programme were all launched during 1995 and I anticipate that they will contribute to the growth of participating companies from the Border counties in the medium to long-term.  Under the North American Partnership Programme, the first phase of which was launched in April 1995, it is expected that 900 new high tech jobs will be created from the nine partnerships already formed.  Under the AMBIT Programme it is anticipated that ten companies per annum from the Border counties will participate in the programme over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I should also add that 26 Irish companies from the software electronics, engineering, healthcare and food sectors went to the US last November meeting with 100 American companies on a trade mission which I led.  The visit was organised by Forbairt and co-ordinated by the US Small Business Administration. Each of the Irish companies met with a number of US companies which had been pre-selected, pre-screened and contacted by Forbairt and the SBA over preceding months.  During the visit, three companies from Border counties established strategic alliances with US companies involving five separate deals in all.</P>
    <P>Details of these were given in the newspapers at the time.  I should add that subsequent to this initial visit, both Forbairt and the SBA will support the companies on both sides of the Atlantic to finalise negotiations and implement business deals which will, I have no doubt, prove mutually beneficial.  Staff from the Forbairt north-east regional office have been working in the US over <Col N="1061" /> the past two months seeking potential partners for Irish companies, including Forbairt client companies from the Border counties, in an initiative to further stimulate trade and alliances between Irish and US firms in a co-operative programme between Forbairt and the Small Business Association of the US.  I will shortly lead a delegation of selected Irish firms to the US to meet with their potential US partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU has traditionally focused market support measures in the beef sector through the intervention system on male cattle.  This approach is based on the view that the removal of steers from the market through intervention purchasing will help support prices for all categories, including heifers.  The European Commission has rejected recent requests for the system to be extended to female cattle and decided instead to extend the scope to include male cattle which are not normally eligible for intervention. This was achieved by the temporary waiving of the 340kg weight limit on carcases, its subsequent replacement by a higher weight limit 420kg, and the inclusion of grade 04 steers in the intervention system.</P>
      <P>Under the emergency intervention measures, some 10,500 tonnes of steer beef have been purchased into intervention since early April with a further 3,381 tonnes to be purchased over the next two weeks.  These intervention measures were supplemented by an increase in export refunds of 9 per cent and 12 per cent on beef from female and male animals respectively from 9 May.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Commission imposes an overall ceiling on sales into intervention each month, the extension of intervention to include heifers would be of very limited value because any sales of heifer beef would be at the expense of steer beef.</P>

      <P>The areas of the country which will be proposed for reclassification as extremely severely handicapped are being examined.  The criteria by which these areas will be selected include the presence of a high proportion of extermely poor land which could be described as rough grazing land, and also the presence of excessive climatic conditions such as higher levels of rainfall and wind speed than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The selection of the specific areas is being facilitated by the use of satellite imagery, which helps to clearly define the boundaries of rough grazing land.  It is expected that this exercise will be completed and a proposal sent to the EU Commission by mid-summer.  Given the necessity for the Commission to examine the proposal, I expect that the new areas will be approved and announced in time for the 1997 headage schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department took a number of steps in an effort to minimise the impact of the recent CPSU industrial action on farmers intending to submit area aid applications in 1996.</P>
      <P>The first step was to extend the closing date for receipt of area aid applications. The normal closing date for submission of area aid applications in any year is 31 March and EU Commission approval is required by any member state wishing to extend beyond that date.  Ireland had already received EU approval for a closing date of 30 April to assist farmers in dealing with the new land parcel identification system which EU regulations required be in place for 1996.  The latest date for which approval can be given is 15 May. Therefore, to facilitate farmers who experienced difficulties due to the industrial action in my Department, Ireland obtained EU Commission approval for a closing date of 15 May 1996 for receipt of 1996 area aid applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, and with particular reference to farmers who had difficulty obtaining maps to accompany their 1996 area aid applications, my Department offered farmers the facility to submit their area aid applications by 15 May 1996 without the necessary maps, provided that whatever maps were required were forwarded at the earliest possible opportunity after the closing date.  This facility, which was widely advertised in <Col N="1071" /> the farming press, allowed farmers to submit their application forms on time and avoid incurring penalties for being late.  Given that the industrial action ended on 21 May last, I would be anxious that any farmer who still needs to submit maps in support of his 1996 area aid application should do so before 21 June 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 281 together.</P>
      <P>Between 1981 and November 1988, a number of private air carriers &mdash; Avair, Aer Arann, Shannon Executive Aviation and Iona National Airways &mdash; operated scheduled air services on the Dublin-Derry route, using small aircraft, and on the basis of an Exchequer subsidy.  Despite the subsidy each of the companies involved reported losses on the route.  The then Government decided in July 1988 to terminate the subsidy when the then existing contract with Iona National Airways was due to expire in May 1989.  However, Iona withdrew from the services in November 1988 due to mounting losses.</P>
      <P>In October 1989 Aer Lingus commenced a daily service on the Derry-Dublin route without a subsidy.  Aer Lingus subsequently reduced its operations on the route to twice weekly in November 1991 and the service was completely withdrawn in April 1992 due to poor performance.</P>
      <P>Most recently, services on the Dublin-Derry route were provided by Jersey European Airways as part of a triangular service linking Derry with Belfast and Dublin.  These services operated twice daily between the three cities from May 1995 to October 1995 when the company withdrew the services operating to and from Dublin for commercial reasons.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under Single Market rules all licensed EU air carriers are free to provide services on any international route within the Union without Government control. The question as to whether an airline wishes to inaugurate services or to withdraw services on a particular route is entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its commercial judgment.</P>

      <Quest>whether congestion is the potential problem in relation to the building of the port tunnel and the third line of the three core light rail transist system; and whether this problem equally applies to the south side of Dublin, particularly on the Dundrum Road, Ranelagh Road, Naas Road, M50, Old Kilmainham Road, the Quays and Heuston Station.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction of an LRT system in Dublin will inevitably mean a certain level of disruption due to the necessity to divert essential services away from the path of light rail vehicles and the laying of rails along the routes.  Construction disruption will apply to all routes to varying degrees depending on the characteristics of the alignment in particular locations.</P>
      <P>For example, a substantial proportion of the Dundrum option would be off-street on the Harcourt Street railway alignment and disruption and congestion would, therefore, be relatively lower.  In contrast, all the Ballymun option would be on-street with a consequent higher level of disruption during construction.  There is also a question about the wisdom of closing Drumcondra Road, the main artery to the North, to build the light railway line, before the port tunnel has been built and could act as a relief road during construction.</P>
      <P>The disruption-congestion issue is one of a number of matters being addressed in the independent comparative socio-economic evaluation.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the tourism industry in County Mayo can be further developed, particularly in the Westport-Louisburgh area, in view of proposals to carry out prospecting for gold and, if proven viable, mining in that area; and would he have any concerns in light of the above.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason prospecting for any mineral should impact, either positively or negatively, on the tourism industry.  The Deputy will be aware, from replies to previous questions on this subject, that there has been prospecting in the area of south west Mayo continuously for the last ten years.  I have no indication that there has been any effect on the tourism industry because of this and, if prospecting is carried out in accordance with the licence conditions and guidelines issued by my Department, there is no reason why there should be any impact.  The licences issued cover all minerals and not just gold as implied by the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>In the event that commercial quantities of minerals of any kind are discovered, it will then be a matter for the licence holders to make application for planning permission and a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency after having first carried out an environmental impact study.  In the event that planning permission and the necessary licence from the Environmental Protection Agency are granted I would then have to issue a State mining facility before mining could commence.</P>
      <P>Mining, if allowed, would certainly impact on both the tourism industry and the general environment, including habitats.  These impacts could be of a positive nature.  The impacts would also be short-term in that the standard terms of a modern State mining facility require full rehabilitation of the site when mining is completed.  Financial conditions to ensure that this obligation is met usually from part of the conditions attached to planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While mining, if carried out in an inappropriate manner, can be harmful, there is evidence from near and far of <Col N="1077" /> positive impacts of mining on both the tourism industry and the environment.  I will mention but two instances here but, if the Deputy wishes, I will furnish him with details of others.</P>
    <P>In the first instance I will draw on the experience from the worked out Que River mine in Tasmania which borders on the Cradle Mountain &mdash; Lake St. Clair National Park.  This mine was a 3 million tonne outcropping polymetalic sulphide ore body which was mined in the period 1980 to 1990 and produced mainly lead and zine.  Mining was mostly underground.  The outcropping sulphides had oxidised and previously leached naturally to a sufficient extent to make the river uninhabitable for some fish.  When rehabilitation is complete the river water quality will be better than it has been for millennia.  Total rehabilitation will be required prior to lease surrender being accepted by Mineral Resources Tasmania.</P>
    <P>The second instance is closer to home, in the Dolgellau region of north Wales, where a small mine is continuing to produce rare Welsh gold which is historically associated with the Celtic tradition. The mining company supports a total of four interrelated but individual profit centres comprising the Gwynfynydd mine, a jewellery manufacturing division, a retailing centre in Dolgellau where the Welsh gold jewellery is sold and a tourism operation within the Snowdonia National Park which offers organised tours of the mine.  Before the mine was reopened in August 1992, settling tanks were constructed to ensure that the quality of the water discharged into the river Mawddach was to a standard acceptable to the National Rivers Authority.  For environmental and security reasons, the mill attached to the mine is sited underground.  Nearly 9,000 tourists visited the mine in the year to August 1994 and that number is expected to double by the end of the current year.  The state receives a mineral royalty of 4 per cent of gross sales from this development plus a tourist royalty which is dependent on the number of visitors to the mine.  In addition <Col N="1078" /> to those directly employed in the mine there is the benefit of value added in the local fabrication workshops and tourism industries.</P>
    <P>I mention these two examples to show that different types of mineralisation have different effects but that they need not necessarily be harmful effects.  Both examples exist within or adjacent to national park areas, both have either maintained or improved the environment and both have increased the tourist potential of the area.  The examples could also be the case in Ireland but the point to be taken from them is that each proposed mining development must be considered on its merits having regard to the minerals to be extracted, the method of extraction required in the light of geological and other considerations, as well as the potential for impact, harmful or otherwise, on the environment and the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>It is unreal and unacceptable to take a rigid anti-mining stance without having first considered all the implications of each proposed development.  The country cannot afford a blanket &ldquo;either-or&rdquo; approach to mining and other interests and the regions cannot afford such an approach.  We must not have mining at any price but we must have responsible mining.</P>

In summary, they are the areas immediately surrounding and including Croagh Patrick as well as the State owned national parks.  It is current policy to exclude national parks from prospecting licence areas and Croagh Patrick and its environs are excluded because of the unique importance of this pilgrimage site which is part of our national, cultural and religious heritage.</P>

      <P>The licensing of pilots and the prescribing, by way of order, of the technical requirements in this regard is a statutory day to day function of the Irish Aviation Authority under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>The order to which the Deputy refers was made by the Irish Aviation Authority on 19 February 1996 and, in accordance with section 6 of the 1993 Act, was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 26 April 1996.  Under section 6 of the 1993 Act, the order can be annulled if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House of the Oirechtas within 21 sitting days from the date the order was laid.</P>
      <P>The Authority informs me that the order includes some features of the draft joint aviation requirements &mdash; flight crew licensing, or JAR-FCL for short.  These JAR-FCL requirements were prepared by the member authorities of the Joint Aviation Authorities, JAA, of Europe, including Ireland, with a view to harmonising the requirements for flight crew licensing in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the JAR-FCL document is still in draft form, it has been finalised for adoption by the JAA member states, <Col N="1088" /> and adoption, I understand, is scheduled to occur in June 1996.  Ireland will have to comply with the JAR-FCL standards by 1998.  It is the policy of the Irish Aviation Authority that, where possible, Irish flight crew licencing standards should be aligned with the JAR-FCL in advance of mandatory implementation deadlines.  The Authority, therefore, deemed it prudent to phase in some of the changes foreseen by the JAR-FCL.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Authority that the avaition industry and interested bodies were consulted in advance of the making of the order.  As I have mentioned above, the Authority has full responsibility, under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, for the making of orders governing the licensing of pilots, and such orders may only be annulled by a resolution of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Since 1987 members of the Defence Forces who died on United Nations service, and Irishmen who died in Foreign wars, are honoured at a commemorative ceremony held annually in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, on the Sunday nearest to 11 July.  In the course of this cermony the president lays a wreath at a specially commissioned commemorative plaque which serves as the national memorial.  It is considered that the Irish United Nations Veterans' Association should be encouraged to use this memorial as the focus for any commemorative ceremonies which they would wish to organise.</P>

      <P>The funding available to the Department of the Marine under the Environmental Services Operational Programme 1994-99 to address the erosion problem around the coast is £5.2 million. This funding will only be made available for works designed primarily to protect publicly owned property. Unfortunately, no funding is available for the direct protection of private property.</P>

Both I and officials of the Department have met with representatives of the museum on a number of occasions in this regard and I have spoken to my colleagues, Deputy Higgins, Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, about the involvement of his Department in the project.  I understand that Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has put forward a draft proposal for the museum for funding under the Tourism Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>I am deeply conscious of the important and valued role which the museum has played and continues to play in fostering an awareness of the nation's maritime heritage.  I would hope that it will continue to fulfil this role in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>I have been in contact with the UK authorities in this matter who advise me that after the Second World War 116 German U-boats were sunk in compliance with a tripartite treaty between the UK, the US and the former USSR. Although the general areas in which the submarines were intended to be sunk are known, there was exceptionally bad weather at the time.  A number of the vessels foundered under tow and exact locations were impossible to determine. A map will be forwarded to the Deputy giving the approximate locations and numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> According to UK records the following are the approximate locations at which the U-boats were sunk: (1) seven submarines located within an area extending approximately four to 12 miles off Malin Head: (2) four submarines located at approximately 15 miles off the Antrim coast; (3) 15 submarines located within an area extending approximately 12 to 27 miles off Malin Head; (4)  35 submarines located within an area extending approximately 30 to 60 miles off Malin Head; (5) 55 submarines located at approximately 100 miles off Bloody Foreland.</P>
    <P>The locations of all known U-boats are mapped on British Admiralty charts.  A map showing these locations will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There were numerous other vessels sunk off the coast of Ireland over the last hundred years.  Many of these have now broken up.  All known wrecks of navigational significance are charted on British Admiralty charts.  The marine survey office of the Department, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and Bord Iascaigh Mhara keep the British Admiralty updated with information regarding new wrecks which occur or have been discovered.  The best available information on locations of wrecks sunk within and outside our territorial waters is available to the public through British Admiratly Charts.  I would suggest that the information requested by Deputy Keaveney with regard to numbers of vessels sunk may best be found through that source.</P>
