Members of the Irish community who have been in touch with Fianna Fáil, and I am sure with the Government, have made representations about a number of important areas in regard to which they consider sensible amendments could be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A predominant number of the provisions are being introduced for the first time in Britain, although they have applied in Northern Ireland for some time, and experience of the exercise of those powers in Northern Ireland will be part of the subject matter of representations that will be made.  We must recognise this is a matter for another jurisdiction, but that there are concerns about how the exercise of this power will affect people in the common travel area and Irish residents in Britain rather than concerns solely related to the powers.  These are the subject matter of representations already made and will be the subject of discussions today between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>With due respect to Members, including the Chair, the subject matter of the Order of Business is promised legislation.  I have given fairly extensive replies on this matter to the Deputy and I suggest that any further supplementary information he wishes to obtain should be the subject of separate questions or direct discussions between the Deputy and the relevant Ministers.

      <P>I am sorry to be unhelpful to the Deputy, but I am obliged to answer questions about the date of introduction of promised legislation. Supplementary questions of the kind the Deputy has in mind relate to operational matters, such as the technical and engineering aspects of the project, as distinct from the legislative aspects and are not appropriate to the Order of Business.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In February, the Government stated publicly there was an urgent need to introduce legislation to cover foreign adoptions but it subsequently voted down an Opposition Bill.  When will the legislation be taken in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We expect the legislation will be available before the end of July.  The matter is not simple.  Adoption legislation between states has to be based on the principle of reciprocity. Similar provisions must be applied in various countries.  As the Deputy is aware, the position in China is that adoptions can be cancelled subsequently. That is not a provision which applies in our legislation.  There is a difficulty in achieving the level of reciprocity that is normal in international arrangements in regard to adoptions from China because of the particular provisions of Chinese law.  This is not a matter which can be easily or quickly sorted out and one does not wish, in the natural concern to deal with the matter quickly, to make legislative provisions which will cause difficulty afterwards for families.  The Government is dealing with the matter with every degree of expedition consistent with the drafting of proper legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of representatives of IBEC and the ICTU to the National Pensions Board.  This is a welcome addition.  The Minister should also consider appointing a representative of the pensioners' organisation to the board as many pensioners are eminently and suitably qualified.</P>
      <P>This Bill strengthens the provisions dealing with pensions, a matter of great importance.  On Committee Stage the queries which have been raised can be dealt with in more detail when I am sure the Minister will be willing to accept any amendments which would strengthen the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which extends, amends, clarifies and strengthens the main provisions of the 1990 Act.  Great credit is due to the Pensions Board which, after a period of five years, reviewed its work and the practical implementation of the 1990 Act.  The sub-committee's comprehensive report to the Minister led to the introduction of the legislation before us.  Very often reports and committees are used as an excuse for delay and inaction but in this case the board is to be complimented on its efficiency and the effectiveness of its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions Board was established by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods.  It is a representative board comprising a chairperson and 12 ordinary members.  They are appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare but, under the provisions of the Act, the board must comprise representatives nominated by the trade unions, employers, the Government, the pensions industry and professional groups involved in occupational pension schemes.  Members are appointed for a term of five years and casual vacancies <Col N="1837" /> are filled by the Minister or the nominating body, as appropriate.  A person who fills a vacancy holds office until what would have been the normal expiry date of the term of office of the person he or she replaced.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board was established under the 1990 Act and it behoves us all to join the Minister for Social Welfare in giving credit to his predecessor, Deputy Woods, who introduced the 1990 Act.  It is important legislation and provided much needed safeguards, regulations and minimum standards as well as greater access to preserved benefits and transfer from one employment to another, providing greater efficiency and flexibility.  It ensured that if employees wished to change employment or be promoted they were not hindered by their commitment to a particular pension scheme.  The Act also covered occupational benefits schemes, access to schemes, benefit rights and contribution levels.  The Pensions Board was established, with a wide remit, to monitor and supervise the schemes.  It has comprehensive powers to carry out inspections of the various occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods faced a most difficult task in bringing forward and concluding that legislation.  There were over 25,000 different occupational pension schemes. It was important to ensure the security of people's pension rights and provide for the development of pension schemes without placing it at risk with over-regulation. The Act has been successful.  It established an important balance between control on the one hand and regulation on the other.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Act a study of the 12 member states did not show Ireland in a great light as far as the provision of pensions was concerned.  Our pensioners were worse off than those in other member states in terms of what their pension could buy.  Their reduction in income on retirement was the worst in the EC, with the exception of the UK.  In the Netherlands an employee who retires can expect his or her pension to represent 93 per cent of <Col N="1838" /> previous earnings.  That is different from the position of most Irish pensioners.  In terms or purchasing power, Dutch pensioners are more than twice as well off as their Irish counterparts.</P>
    <P>In our deliberations on pensions, we must look at age structure and life expectancy levels.  The indications are that people can expect to live for 15 or 20 years following their retirement.  It is important that people prepare for retirement through proper financial planning.  The modern trend of early retirement at 55 years must also be taken into consideration.  Ongoing legislation in this area must take account of changing norms and the move from the position which existed in the 1970s when pensions were drafted on the basis of a 40 year working life.  Consideration must be given to altering the tax incentives available at present which are calculated on that basis.</P>
    <P>While many employees receive a pension from their employers we are all aware of many self-employed people and farmers who have not made provision for their retirement.  I know people in poor financial circumstances as a result of bad planning in their earlier years.  We should emphasise the importance of preparing for retirement.  Many business people and farmers reinvested their money in their business or farm and failed to provide for their retirement.  The tragedy is they provided employment and service in their local community and paid social insurance contributions for their employees but failed to provide for themselves.  They could not avail of a State pension.  However, in 1988 the then Minister, Deputy Woods, introduced a scheme of PRSI contributions for the self-employed and farmers.  Just as with other schemes he introduced it was an innovative and positive step.  The scheme has been in operation for eight years and all retiring contributors will qualify for a pension.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his stance in the case of a small group of people who were over 56 years of age in 1988 and <Col N="1839" /> pay them a <i>pro rata</i> pension as they were allowed to contribute to the scheme but do not benefit from it.  Some of these people may have paid contributions for nine years and nine months but when they reach retirement age the State will tell them they do not qualify for a pension since they do not meet the ten year requirement.  While we talk positively about pension schemes, private pensions and the Pensions Board and work hard in terms of coordination and regulation, we should also consider that flaw on the part of the State.  This matter can be considered in a much different light now than was the case in 1988&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Deputy has spoken at length about a matter which directly relates to social welfare pensions, but this Bill deals with occupational pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that many self-employed people and farmers are at a disadvantage in terms of making contributions to pensions because of having to reinvest in their enterprises and therefore it is relevant to speak about them in the context of pensions.  The Minister has a problem with our raising this issue, whether in a Bill such as this or at Question Time, but we will continue to make the point because it is a very serious matter for the people concerned who are reaching retirement age.  There is no point waiting for a change in Government and some other Minister for Social Welfare to sort out the problem.  It arises today for the many people who have eight and a half years' contributions, therefore it should be solved now rather than leave it to the year 2000.</P>

      <P>There are many positive features in the Bill, which is a tidying up of the Pensions Act, 1990. There is reference in the Minister's speech and the Bill to the words &ldquo;extend&rdquo;, &ldquo;amend&rdquo;, &ldquo;strengthen&rdquo; and &ldquo;clarify&rdquo;, and that is the purpose of the Bill.  It extends, amends, strengthens and clarifies the 1990 Act, which is welcome. I look forward to debating the details on Committee Stage when we will put forward amendments to the Bill.</P>

I would never dream of dictating to the Chair on procedures, but I always understood that on Second Stage of legislation it is entirely appropriate to discuss the principle not only of the Bill involved but the matter under discussion and to make wide reference to legislation.</P>

I compliment the Minister, Deputy De Rossa on it and the former Minister, Deputy Woods, for the work he put into it.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the question of pensions in a general sense as it affects the semi-State sector.  That sector will be affected by the pension scheme as it now exists.  While I referred to one company, the scheme applies to all semi-State companies.  This matter is urgent in view of the proposed legislation from another Department.  I previously asked the Minister to make available to Opposition Deputies the Attorney General's advice on the pensions issue as it applies to semi-State companies.  For example, section 12 of the Social Welfare Bill provides that in the event of change of ownership in semi-State companies the lower rate of PRSI would apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but this Bill should provide, in the event of the sale of shares in State companies, for amendments to PRSI to allow for the transferability of pensions of people who leave semi-State companies.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this matter. I have asked a number of times why, <Col N="1842" /> in the event of shares being sold in State companies, as is about to happen in Telecom Éireann, the State should give a PRSI bonus to the incoming purchaser. If, for example, a company in Denmark or Norway buys a one-third share of Telecom Éireann the reduced rate of PRSI will apply.  In an article by Matt Cooper in the <i>Irish Independent</i> recently he calculates that the cost to the State of the purchase by an outsider of a share in Telecom Éireann, paying the reduced rate of PRSI, is £35 million. The State should not fund employers' PRSI private purchasers of shares in State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would appreciate if the Deputy would refer to more relevant matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that shortly. I would ask the Minister to examine in particular the constitutionality of such a move and the EU law aspect.  I would also ask him to consider where it fits into our membership of the Union.  Will the Minister also closely examine the PRSI changes brought about by the purchase of shares in our semi-State companies? It would be unconstitutional, against competition law and unfair to other companies operating in the business, if the Government allowed incoming purchasers the benefit of reduced social welfare PRSI payments. Neither would it be fair to the workers. I have discussed this matter with many workers in the various State companies. Commercial State companies pay the full PRSI rate and non-commercial companies do not.  Many of them make the point that to get the benefits they would like to consider the possibility of paying the full rate of PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Chair and the Minister for allowing me to digress a little from the Bill but this is a serious matter which requires urgent attention.  I would be amazed if the Minister allowed incoming foreign companies a £35 million or £40 million bonus in year one by automatically giving them a reduced rate of PRSI.  That would cost the Irish <Col N="1843" /> taxpayer £40 million which would go straight from the Exchequer to the incoming purchaser in that company.  I want to ensure the Minister understands my concern about this matter and I ask him to give serious consideration to it. This is not appropriate use of public money.  If foreign companies want to locate here they should be asked to compensate the Irish workers and the Exchequer.  It was not necessary to provide in legislation, as the Minister did recently with regard to another Bill, that people who buy shares are given a reduced rate of PRSI.  That decision is worth £35 million or £40 million and it is a blow to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the general principle of the Bill, particularly the transferability, additional flexibility, general control regulation and more sensible regime governing pensions.  I am sure the Minister has also given some thought to how we will meet the increased costs associated with the significant increase in the number of people who will become eligible for pensions in the next ten or 20 years. That is probably a matter for the Minister for Finance but I wanted to mention it to the Minister for Social Welfare also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on Second Stage.  The Bill reinforces the safeguards already in place for occupational pensions and will make it certain that when individual members of schemes reach retirement age, their pensions will be there for them to ensure their continued prosperity in retirement.</P>
      <P>I will comment briefly on a number of the issues raised by Deputies, whom I thank for welcoming the Bill.  I agree with them on the importance of pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his contribution, <Col N="1844" /> Deputy Walsh raised the mobility of workers issue.  The preservation provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990 ensure that those who move from job to job will have their benefits preserved in each job until pension age.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the ageing of the population, referred to by Deputy Brennan, the House should be aware that on a number of occasions I have drawn attention to the demographic patterns which, as Deputies said, indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population in the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions which are set to increase by some 100 per cent by the year 2035. At the same time, the ratio of persons in the economically active age group to those over age 65 is projected to fall. This would result, in the absence of any policy change, in an increasing burden of the cost of pensions falling on future generations of PRSI contributors and taxpayers.  These are important factors in any consideration of the development of future pension arrangements and the Social Insurance Fund and require us to consider the capacity of the present financing arrangements to meet these emerging costs.</P>
    <P>The pensions industry is also placing considerable emphasis on this issue. One aspect which needs to be examined further in this regard is the effect of long-term growth in the economy.  If this is maintained it should increase the resources available to pay for pensions in the future although, as the House will appreciate, there will be many competing claims for any resources freed up as a result of this growth.</P>
    <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board, Developing the National Pension System, raised and considered these issues.  This report is being considered in my Department and it is intended to bring forward proposals based on the recommendations of the report in the context of next year's budget.  In this context, a major survey of occupational pensions schemes, <Col N="1845" /> recommended by the National Pensions Board, has been commissioned jointly by the Department of Social Welfare and the Pensions Board.  That report will be available in the middle of this year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of this new survey will give essential up to date information on occupational cover which will be of considerable assistance when proposals on pensions are being formulated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh also alluded to the issue of equal treatment.  As I stated in my contribution, clarification of a number of European Court cases and directives on equal treatment as regards pensions are being considered and the outcome of these may necessitate further changes in our pensions legislation. These matters will be considered by the Department in conjunction with the Pensions Board in due course and, if necessary, amendments will be made through a further pensions amendment Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the wording of section 34 which reads &ldquo;or is being contemplated&rdquo; regarding compulsory and voluntary reporting to the Pensions Board.  The intent of this wording is to cover the future &mdash; in effect, to shut the stable doors before the horse has bolted.  I am aware there is some concern in the pensions industry about this wording and the position is being reviewed in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Pensions Board.  The bottom line, however, is that the future has to be covered in this section and, bearing that in mind, I will seek to find a suitable form of words to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to section 36 which relates to the replacement of a chairperson and is simply to remove a problem that might arise.  If a chairperson resigned or died while in office, there is not any mechanism in the legislation for his or her replacement.  I want to reassure Deputy Woods with regard to the new board members that the basic principle underlying the appointment of all members to the Pensions <Col N="1846" /> Board is that all of these people will represent and protect the interests of pension scheme members.  The mechanism for providing two new members to specifically cover trustee issues is <i>via</i> nominations by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC.  This is the best manner in which to provide trustee representation on the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the necessity for a pensions ombudsman. Other Deputies also raised the issue of information, which is important.  The question of an ombudsman is one of the issues facing the new Pensions Board over its term of office and is one of the areas on which it will be asked to report. On the issue of information generally, under the disclosure provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990 information must be made available to pension scheme members <i>via</i> both the annual report of the scheme and requests to the trustees of the scheme.  There may be a lack of knowledge among individual members about where to get information and that will need to be addressed.  In this regard, the Pensions Board has set up a subcommittee on information and one of the areas it will address is how to disseminate information so that members will be aware of what information is available to them and how to get access to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question of Telecom Éireann and the modified PRSI rates.  I do not propose to go into that issue in detail because it does not relate specifically to the Bill.  I dealt with the matter on the Social Welfare Bill and my response to the queries the Deputy again raised this morning is on the record.  Because the Deputy has again asked questions I should say that the steps we took in relation to maintaining the modified rate of PRSI for workers in Telecom Éireann covered by the 1993 legislation were fully assessed by the Attorney General.  What we have done is regarded by him as constitutional and in line with EU requirements. It would be grossly improper of me as a Minister or the Government of the day to introduce matters which <Col N="1847" /> would be considered otherwise.  The Deputy can be assured that what we have done is not unconstitutional or in breach of EU requirements.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the workers concerned &mdash; those who were employees in 1983 when the modified status was maintained when Telecom Éireann and An Post became State companies and were removed from the direct control of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; have guaranteed status as employees and are concerned to maintain that status.  I understand they would view seriously any move from the status they have at this time as covered by the 1983 legislation. The Government and I are satisfied on the basis of advice from the Attorney General that everything is in order.  The modified rate of PRSI does not cover old age pensions, it covers orphans, widows and occupational injuries of a limited kind.  Old age pensions are covered by way of State guaranteed pensions.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Quill, raised the question of the taxation limits and increased pension fund investments.  In relation to the 15 per cent limit and the general tax limits for pensions this is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the comments will be forwarded to him for his consideration.</P>
    <P>Regarding increased pension fund investment in the Irish economy, as Deputies are aware the Minister for Finance announced a joint study to be undertaken in conjunction with the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the Irish Association of Investment Managers aimed at identifying commercially viable opportunities in the domestic economy for the Irish pensions sector in the context of increasing the overall level of pension fund investment in the Irish economy.  The study should be completed by mid-year.  However, I take issue with Deputy Quill when she says there is a lack of investment opportunities in Ireland.  The Deputy is confusing the opportunity for high return, <Col N="1848" /> risk-free investments and that of normal risky investments, which may or may not give a return.</P>
    <P>This Government sees itself as the guardian of public assets.  We want assets to grow and add value and to expand abroad, using the wealth of Government talent.  The Government is committed to building up State companies, making them more competitive to serve the needs of consumers and adding value.  Already Aer Lingus has made a dramatic recovery, turning losses of £129 million in the last period to profits of £17 million in 1995.  This was after a pay-out of £3.3 million in shares to its workers who played such a crucial role in turning the company around.</P>
    <P>Privatisation does not add one job to the economy.  It does not add one pound in value added.  What Ireland needs is more entrepreneurs to invest money in new enterprises.  The transfer of ownership is not enterprise.  If the Irish Stock Exchange has not enough quoted companies, as indicated by Deputy Quill, this is also a factor of the nature of Irish private enterprise, which is too private and not enterprising enough.  Some of the largest companies operating in Ireland are private.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should recognise that a high proportion of investment in private and public companies comes from the State by way of grants and tax breaks. It amounts to hundreds of millions of pounds each year and the State does not get a financial return.  We invest in these companies for the jobs and the value added.  This State investment lessens the risk considerably.</P>
    <P>Pension funds should look to new risk ventures which create value and jobs in Ireland.  Transferring the ownership of State assets to privatisation would be the lazy way out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace and others raised the question of self-employed who were over the age of 56 in 1988.  I do not intend to deal with that matter in any detail.  It is a social welfare pensions matter and not an occupational pensions matter.  However, I would point <Col N="1849" /> out, as I did at length on the Social Welfare Bill, that this issue of people being over the age of 56 in 1988 when they were obliged to enter the social welfare system was known in 1988 and it is wrong for Deputies opposite to imply that this has suddenly become an issue. It was an issue in 1988 when the scheme was introduced as I recall when we debated it in the Dáil.  It was decided by the then Minister that despite the fact that, in some cases, a person would not have the ten years' contributions required in 1988 they would still be obliged to contribute.  In those cases where a person did not have any contributions prior to 1988 and where they did not qualify for a contributory or a non-contributory pension, the contributions they had made to the fund would be refunded to them and that money would be indexed so that there would be no loss to the person concerned in terms of the investments they had made.  I am examining the issue as indicated during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  Whatever I do in that area &mdash; I intend to bring forward amendments of various kinds in the pensions area &mdash; it is essential that we maintain the requirement that there must be a minimum of ten years' contributions to qualify for a pension.  If we were to breach that requirement it would have serious funding problems for our social welfare pensions system. The matter is not closed but I am making the point that, as far as I am concerned, there will be a requirement for a ten year contribution period to qualify for a pension.  How we might assist those who are not likely to have the ten year contribution at the age of 66 has yet to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh hoped there would be sufficient time to debate this Bill.  I reassure him there will be sufficient time.  The Bill was published in mid-December with the specific intention of allowing Members, those in the pensions industry generally and all contributors to and beneficiaries of occupational pensions schemes sufficient time to examine its provisions.  I realise <Col N="1850" /> it is a technical Bill and we need time to see how it may impact.  As Deputy Walsh indicated, it is all the more important to allow a reasonable time scale as the Bill is technical.  In this regard I assure the House there is ongoing discussion with the Pensions Board on this Bill.  In addition, the Department is currently meeting all those who have made representations on the Bill.  This Bill will significantly help to further safeguard the pensions of individual members of pension schemes.  I, therefore, commend it to Deputies and ask them to support it.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Seanad passed the Irish Steel Limited Bill, 1996.  I now look forward to its smooth passage in the Dáil and I am grateful to the House for agreeing to take the Second Stage of the Bill today.  The passage of the Irish Steel legislation is a precondition to the finalisation of the agreement for the sale of the shares of Irish Steel Limited to <Col N="1851" /> ISPAT International and the deadline for completion of all the preconditions, including the legislation, is now 30 April.  There are still a number of matters to be finalised by the State negotiators and by representatives of ISPAT International before the sale of the Irish Steel shares to ISPAT can be concluded. On completion of these matters, a momentous milestone in the history of Irish Steel Limited will have been reached and we will see ownership of the company pass from State ownership to private ownership.</P>
    <P>I would now like to recall some of the recent history of Irish Steel Limited.  As the House will be well aware, Irish Steel's troubles have been going on for decades.  Successive Governments have invested substantial amounts of taxpayers' money in the company with no return on the taxpayers' funding.  Irish Steel has made profits in only three years out of the past 20 and these profits were never of a sufficiently large amount to protect the company in its years of poorer performance.  Its consolidated profit and loss account to the end of June 1995 shows an accumulated loss of some £145 million.  The experience over the years has demonstrated that the State was far from the ideal partner of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>We have seen employment levels in Irish Steel drop from over 1,000 two decades ago to 561 in recent years and to a current level of approximately 400. In the trading year 1993-94, Irish Steel was losing well over £1 million a month and total losses for the year amounted to more than £20 million.  Figures for the years to the end of June 1995 show further losses, although on a scale considerably less than the previous year, with losses approaching £6 million.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel is a small stand-alone company within a much bigger European and worldwide steel industry.  The international steel market that the company serves is cyclical and in the early 1990s the steel industry experienced a downturn in both price and sales volumes. Selling prices were lower than they had <Col N="1852" /> been for 20 years and raw material prices were high, leading to immense pressure on margins.  Most steel companies in Europe found the going tough and as a result, with the support of the European Commission, a massive restructuring of the steel industry in Europe was undertaken.</P>
    <P>Following the lead taken in Europe and in the light of the huge losses being made by Irish Steel &mdash; £13 million on a turnover of £58 million in the year ended June 1993 &mdash; it was imperative for Irish Steel to implement cost reductions and restructuring measures.</P>
    <P>During 1993, the company unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a cost reduction package with its workforce.  A new viability plan was drawn up in early 1994.  This was an absolute precondition to the very survival of the company. This plan provided for, <i>inter alia</i>, a reduction of 205 workers, the introduction of new totally flexible work practices, the achievement of efficiencies and a pay freeze.  There were extreme difficulties in reaching agreement with the unions on the implementation of the plan.  Industrial relations difficulties beset the company throughout the summer of 1994.  Following difficult negotiation that saw the company on the verge of closure on a number of occasions, each of the trade unions and all employees in Irish Steel indicated their acceptance of the company's survival plan.  The plan allowed for cost improvements and savings of £8.8 million per year.  I am pleased to acknowledge once again the tremendous sacrifices and efforts made by the workers of Irish Steel in the implementation of the viability plan.</P>
    <P>This viability plan has been vital in securing a prospect of achieving a viable future for Irish Steel.  Without the achievement of cost savings under the plan, it is unlikely that any company would have been interested in Irish Steel, and there were considerable doubts that the company could achieve and sustain viability on its own.  For example, the European Commission <Col N="1853" /> and others expressed considerable reservations about the ability of Irish Steel to provide adequately for the next downturn in the steel markets.</P>
    <P>Faced with the high losses that had occurred in 1993-94 and notwithstanding the implementation of the viability plan, Irish Steel was still not in a break-even situation as a stand-alone enterprise.  The board of Irish Steel submitted, on 28 November 1994, a final viability plan to return the company to profitability within three years.  This plan included a request for £50 million, including £40 million in equity and £10 million in guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Government, following discussions with the European Commission, was faced with three options: to seek EU approval for the £50 million State aid package; to close Irish Steel, at a conservative cost of more than £40 million; or to find a suitable strategic partner who, with experience in the wider international market place, would be able to bring their knowledge, marketing and production resources to bear on Irish Steel and turn the company's fortunes around, so that it would have the strength to prosper in the market.</P>
    <P>In the event, the Government decided in February 1995 that negotiations with the European Commission for approval of State aid to Irish Steel should be on the basis of the £50 million envisaged in the viability plan and that at the same time negotiations could be opened for the possible sale of shares in, and control of, the company.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision, an application for State aid approval was lodged with the European Commission and at the same time I appointed Investment Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance Limited to act as advisers to the State on the sale of Irish Steel.  Five parties were quickly identified as being interested in purchasing part or all of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>Applications were made by each of these five companies in the first round of offers.  It is common knowledge that these five companies were ISPAT International, Riva, Max-Aicher, Nippon <Col N="1854" /> Denro and Nucor-Yamato.  Each of the offers was weighed up on its respective merits.  In some cases companies were even invited to improve on their offers. All the offers, save one, were for the purchase of 100 per cent of the shares in Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>A short list of companies was drawn up after the final first round offers were received and a number of companies were invited to submit further more detailed offers.  Following receipt of these further offers, the Cabinet subcommittee, comprising myself, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State with responsibility for science, commerce and technology, which had been formed to oversee the sale process, selected ISPAT International, following recommendations from my Department and the State advisers, as the company which should be granted exclusivity of negotiations to purchase 100 per cent of Irish Steel.  It was considered that ISPAT International had the necessary experience in turning around steel companies. The financial commitments they were proposing were the strongest of the bidders involved.</P>
    <P>During the summer of 1995 ISPAT concluded detailed due diligence with their own professional team, in co-operation with IBI Corporate Finance Limited, Irish Steel Limited, my Department and the Department of Finance. The due diligence process was conducted on the basis of the normal process of disclosures and representations made by Irish Steel, in the main, but also by the State, on foot of which ISPAT decided to purchase Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>Negotiations with the company continued during and after this process and led to the conclusion of a sale and purchase agreement with ISPAT International on 6 September, 1995 which was signed by me and the Minister for Finance for the sale of all of the shares of Irish Steel Limited to ISPAT International.</P>
    <P>As the agreement with ISPAT International involved State aid from the Irish Government amounting to approximately £27.5 million which <Col N="1855" /> included the writing off of an old Government loan to Irish Steel of £17 million an application was submitted to the EU Commission for approval of the State aid involved under Article 95 of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty.  The EU Commission accepted the case made by the Irish Government on behalf of Irish Steel and recommended to the EU Council that the State aid for Irish Steel Limited should be authorised exceptionally under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, subject to certain conditions. The Commission's recommendations was considered at the EU Industry Council on 6 and 7 November 1995 and while 14 of the 15 member states were in general prepared to approve the State aid involved, the UK refused to give its support.  Unanimity among all member states of the EU was essential for approval of the State aid for Irish Steel under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.  In view of the UK opposition the Council of Ministers agreed on 6-7 November 1995, at the suggestion of the Spanish Presidency and the EU Commission, that the Irish and UK delegations should continue to search for an agreement on the matter which could be approved at a later Council meeting.</P>
    <P>Following the intensive negotiations I had with the UK Minister for Industry and Energy, Timothy Eggar, and with the President of the UK Board of Trade, Ian Lang, during the months of November and December 1995, the UK Government withdrew its reservations to the State aid involved in the Irish Steel restructuring plan.  This enabled the EU Council of Industry Ministers unanimously to approve the State aid package on 20 December 1995 under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.  To overcome the UK objections, production caps on finished steel and billets together with limits on the sale of finished steel products in the EU market &mdash; including Norway and Switzerland &mdash; had to be agreed by me in consultation with Irish Steel &mdash; ISPAT to secure the <Col N="1856" /> unanimous approval of all the EU member states and, in particular, the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the owners of ISPAT, to the management of Irish Steel and ISPAT and to the workers of Irish Steel for being so patient and supportive during the Irish Government's difficult and intensive negotiations, especially with the UK Government, to secure Article 95 approval.</P>
    <P>I would like to give again to the Dáil details of the deal which was agreed with ISPAT International on 6 September 1995 and the changes that have been agreed with ISPAT International following the EU approval secured on 20 December 1995.  ISPAT International is to buy Irish Steel for a nominal sum of £1.  The sale should be finalised within the next few weeks.  The agreement will involve a certain level of expenditure by the State and by ISPAT International.</P>
    <P>In addition to writing off an old Government loan to Irish Steel Limited of £17 million, the State has agreed to pay £20,273,500 to Irish Steel Ltd/ISPAT International.  The State's contribution of over £20 million includes: provisions for charges and expenses identified by ISPAT in the due diligence process which should have been in the balance sheet of Irish Steel Limited for the 12 month period ended 30 June 1995 &mdash; the amount of the Exchequer's contribution here is £2.831 million; to fund necessary environmental and other remedial works &mdash; the amount of the Exchequer's contribution here is £2.360 million; to provide a matching contribution towards an ECSC staff training grant &mdash; the State's contribution here is £192.500; to compensate the company for the restrictions on production and sales imposed on the Irish Steel/ISPAT project to overcome UK objections at European level &mdash; the amount of the Exchequer's contribution here is £7.2 million; to provide an up-front cash payment in lieu of indemnities in respect to possible residual taxation and other costs and financial claims arising from the past &mdash; the <Col N="1857" /> State's contribution here is £2.445 million; to compensate the company for interest charges on existing debts &mdash; the Exchequer's contribution here is £4.617 million and to fund a deficit in the staff pension fund &mdash; the State's contribution here is £628,000.</P>
    <P>ISPAT International will invest £5 million of working capital in Irish Steel immediately on completion of the deal. ISPAT is also committed to a significant level of capital expenditure.  This will see investment of £20 million over the next six years, allowing Irish Steel to produce products more efficiently and thus more profitably than at present. These funds will be spent on the re-equipment of the mill and the melt shop.  It is planned that approximately half of the capital spend will be devoted to enabling Irish Steel to make higher grade, added-value raw steel.  Ultimately, under ISPAT, Irish Steel will produce a more extensive range of finished steel products, which will, because of the higher grades of steel it will be able to make, add to the value of output. In addition, ISPAT has agreed to maintain production at least at present levels.  Furthermore, the deal provides undertakings from ISPAT to take over all loans, debts and liabilities of Irish Steel with the exception of an old Government loan of £17 million made in the mid-1980s which will be extinguished by the Government as part of the sale.</P>
    <P>Among the issues at the forefront of negotiations has been the Government's concern for the workers of Irish Steel and the protection of their jobs and rights in the new Irish Steel operation. Under the deal, ISPAT International has entered a contractual commitment to employ a minimum of 300 full-time workers in Irish Steel for the first five years of its ownership of the company. It has also agreed to honour in full all commitments of Irish Steel with regard to labour contracts and pension plans.</P>
    <P>I am confident Members will agree that this situation contrasts very favourably with the situation 18 months ago <Col N="1858" /> when the plant was on the verge of closure with the likely loss of all employment in the company.  The contractual commitment with ISPAT International also provides that it will pay to the State specified liquidated damages in the event of the number of full-time workers falling below 300.  There was understandable concern among the workforce of Irish Steel and its trade unions that the sale of the company could be prejudicial to their interests and that the job guarantees were not real.  I have assured the unions that the guarantees given by ISPAT are real and substantial.  I am satisfied that the trade unions are now fully committed to a new Irish Steel in the full ownership of ISPAT International.  I have been impressed with the management style of the new owners since their involvement in Irish Steel Limited last September and am confident that this augurs well for good, professional relations between the new management, the employees and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief pen picture of ISPAT International.  This multinational corporation which was founded in India has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Germany, the USA, the UK, Indonesia and Kazakstan for the production of steel and related items.  The group is the world's largest producer and consumer of direct reduced iron, that is iron produced from iron ore.  It is also one of the world's largest producers of liquid steel. Prior to its very large acquisition in Kazakstan the group had a total workforce of 6,500 and produced more than 6.5 million tonnes worldwide.  The total assets of the group exceed US $3 billion and annual revenues exceed US $2 billion.  Most of ISPAT's acquisitions have been former State-owned steel-works in the process of privatisation and it has a proven track record of turning around all its major acquisitions, usually within a year of purchase.  This is rapid by steel industry standards.  The Kazakstan acquisition by ISPAT International <Col N="1859" /> from State ownership is enormous and involves some 30,000 employees.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that with the sale of Irish Steel to ISPAT International it has achieved the best possible deal for the State, the company and the workers of Irish Steel.  The finalisation of the agreement for the sale of the Irish Steel shares to ISPAT offers a wonderful opportunity for the development of Irish Steel into the next century under private ownership.  The Government's investment is considerable but this investment has been readily agreed because of the Government's confidence that ISPAT is an excellent strategic company to take over Irish Steel and because of the Government's confidence in the Irish Steel workforce.  Selling the shares of Irish Steel to a company of the calibre of ISPAT is a great achievement and is just recompense for the Irish Steel workers who have made sacrifices in recent years.</P>
    <P>The major investments being undertaken by ISPAT shows the commitment which ISPAT is prepared to make to ensure the success of Irish Steel and displays ISPAT's confidence that with the continued assistance of the Irish Steel workforce the project can be profitable and successful.  Under the leadership of a major international steel company, with the managerial expertise of ISPAT, in partnership with the Irish Steel workers and their unions, the future for the Irish Steel/ISPAT project should be bright.  However, future success cannot be taken for granted and it will have to be worked for.  The international steel industry is extremely competitive and the Irish Steel/ISPAT project will have to compete vigorously in that environment. A solid base is now being established to enable the new company to take on all competitors.</P>
    <P>ISPAT has the necessary expertise and commercial contacts to ensure the success of the project.  Irish Steel will benefit from the experience the new owners will bring to bear and the economies of scale that also derive from a <Col N="1860" /> group of the size of ISPAT.  Based on my contacts to date with the owners of ISPAT, the new management of Irish Steel, the workers in the company and their trade union representatives, all involved understand the importance of good industrial relations for the success of the project.  There will be difficult years ahead mainly because of the cyclical nature of the steel industry but, if all elements of Irish Steel pull together towards established objectives, the probability of success will be increased.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel has always been important for the workforce and their families and to the local economy.  The restructured Irish Steel will be equally important and its contribution to all concerned has been guaranteed for the foreseeable future.  It is now up to the ISPAT organisation, the new management of Irish Steel, the workforce and their unions to ensure that Irish Steel continues to play an important part in the economy of the local area.  From now on Irish Steel will have to survive by itself and develop outside the State sector.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary to enable the sale of the shares of Irish Steel Limited to ISPAT to be finalised.  This is a short Bill with only 10 sections and its main purpose is to repeal the legislation on Irish Steel passed by the Oireachtas during the period 1960-85 when the company was in the ownership of the State and when it required Exchequer funding to survive.  That legislation will no longer be necessary when the shares of Irish Steel Limited are sold to ISPAT.  This Bill also contains provision to enable me, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment to fulfil the financial commitments agreed with Irish Steel/ISPAT under the agreement for the sale of the shares of Irish Steel Limited. I look forward to discussing the individual sections of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the workers in the company, ISPAT, those who assisted in the deal and, in particular, Pat Dineen and the former members of the board, <Col N="1861" /> who steered Irish Steel through a difficult period.  There has been great cooperation and understanding among the unions, workers and management and in this House where there has been an all-party constructive approach to try to achieve the best for Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>I thank the Opposition Deputies as well as my colleagues in Government for the very constructive way in which this has been handled throughout what has been a very difficult number of months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the Irish Steel Limited Bill and I praise the Seanad on its detailed examination of the proposed legislation during the recent debates there.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel plays a vital part in the State's economic fabric and has done so for nearly 60 years.  This legislation marks the opening of a new and, I hope, happier phase for the company.  As it marks a watershed, the Bill must be subjected to detailed scrutiny.  Later, I will pose questions to the Minister to ensure that what is proposed is in keeping with the best interests of the State and the Irish Steel workforce.</P>
      <P>This Bill has come about after several years of difficulties at the plant.  Fianna Fáil, while in Government, played its part in maintaining the plant and I pay tribute to all those trade union and Department officials, politicians, community activists and workers at Irish Steel who played their part in getting Irish Steel to this stage.</P>
      <P>There have been many in the media who have argued that it would have been better if Irish Steel had been closed during the last rationalisation. The argument is that the State might have saved itself £37 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the cost to the State would have been much higher than just £37 million.  As well as the monetary cost, there would have been a vast human cost.  Many thousands in Cobh and in the Cork region are dependent on Irish Steel.  At one stage, the plant had a workforce of 1,000.  Up to two years ago, <Col N="1862" /> it was nearly 560 and it remains at nearly 400 today.</P>
    <P>As many as 1,500 other jobs may be dependent on Irish Steel for indirect employment.  These workers are in freight, CIE, ESB and many other service areas.  Behind all these workers are many thousands of others with families and extended families.  This represents a vast human dimension to Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The State would have been throwing away an opportunity to develop a niche in the world steel market because there is no doubt that with good management and capital investment, Irish Steel can carve out its corner in the world market.</P>
    <P>To shut Irish Steel would also have been to close a major chapter in Irish economic history.  There was a long tradition of the manufacture of iron in Ireland for many years until diminished natural resources and economic pressure from Britain practically extinguished iron smelting in the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, most major towns had an iron foundry.</P>
    <P>The first major venture of the 20th century came when Irish Steel was established as a private concern in 1937 and the mill went into production at Haulbowline in late August 1939. However, its existence was short-lived and it went into receivership in 1941.  It again went into production in October 1942 until another receiver went in in 1946.</P>
    <P>In 1947, Seán Lemass, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, announced the establishment of a State-financed company to acquire the assets of Irish Steel.  It was a brave step on the State's road to industrialisation.  At the time of the establishment, the hope was that Ireland would take its place among the steel nations of the world.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Irish Steel in 1947 as a State-sponsored company represented an intervention by the then Government in the commercial affairs of the nation.  Irish Steel's role was to supply the domestic and export markets and it quickly became a major employer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> The State had identified the opportunity and in the absence of other steel investors, the Government decided to fill the gap.  It enjoyed success in the 1950s and 1960s.  In 1960, when Mr. Jack Lynch, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced the first Irish Steel legislation, the Irish Steel Holdings Limited Bill, 1960, to the Dáil, he said the successful industry needed to be fostered.  His proposals met with broad support in the Oireachtas.  The last paragraph of his speech, Official Report, Volume 184, column 289, states:</P>
    <P>I think that there will be general agreement that this successful industry should be fostered and encouraged to expand.  Its importance from the point of view of providing employment is apparent from the figures I have already quoted.  Quite apart from questions of employment, however, the steel mill at Haulbowline fills a gap which would otherwise exist in our industrial capacity.  It produces a basic product, principally from indigenous raw materials, and represents a valuable insurance against our being deprived of essential supplies of steel should we be unable to obtain supplies from foreign sources at any future time of international difficulties.  Furthermore, we may hope that the existence in this country of this basic stage of the steel industry with its special skills and technologies will be a favourable factor in the development here of the engineering and other steel-using industries.  For all these reasons, I confidently recommend the Bill to the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>Another former Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, also spoke in support of it.  I come from the constituency of Martin J. Corry who spoke favourably about the development of Irish Steel in the Cobh area on that day.  Today we are defending Irish Steel and supporting its continuity.</P>
    <P>However, these halcyon days did not last, there was trouble in the 1970s <Col N="1864" /> which continued into the following decades. Vast sums of taxpayers' money were invested between 1980 and 1993 but Irish Steel still recorded huge losses.</P>
    <P>If one were solely to measure the investment against IDA yardsticks, the figures would be very out of line with its cost for job creation.  However, the State could not just turn its back on Cobh or on an industry it had established.</P>
    <P>This was recognised even by Fine Gael as the biggest single investment ever made by a Government was in 1985-86 when £24 million was invested, £18 million of it in loan form by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel fills a unique role in Irish industrial and economic history.  It was a classic example of the State's determination to be at the forefront of development. The newly-founded State was courageous in its endeavour and, for many years, the investment proved wise.</P>
    <P>I also believe that if Irish Steel had been closed, it would have been a serious body blow to the Cork region. Over the years, the region had been denuded of major industries.  There has been a catalogue of closures, Dunlop, Ford, Verlome, Sunbeam.  Irish Steel was on the threatened closure list for many years but I hope this legislation will ensure that it will never again be in jeopardy.  Irish Steel is the last heavy industry left in the Cork Harbour area following the closure of Dunlop, Ford and Verolme.  Dunlop and Ford, the flagship industries in the Cork area for many years were closed in the 1970s. That was a retrograde step.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to restore political confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, damaged by the recent revelations of political party fund-raising by relieving the current chairman of his responsibilities; requests the Government to immediately review the system of programme managers so as to properly define their role, in view of the substantial State funding incurred in this regard; and calls on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in view of the adverse implications for the principle of ethics in public office to resign, particularly in view of his inability or unwillingness to fully understand the consequences of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>In the run-up to the last general election the Labour Party insisted that the whole issue of arts, culture and heritage should be given proper recognition by Government.  Since he was first elected, my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has campaigned for a planned strategic approach to the development of the arts.  In essence, the political decision to establish a Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the decision to appoint a full member of the Cabinet to speak for the area was recognition of the importance of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and our language and heritage as fundamental parts of our life. These areas were also recognised as an integral part of the policy strategies necessary to create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of a Socialist of the calibre of Deputy Higgins as the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht revolutionised this country's <Col N="1866" /> whole approach to this area.  His passionate and energetic commitment to the arts, culture and Gaelic Ireland is universally recognised and admired by people of all political persuasions and from all sections of society throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Following his appointment the Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, set about ridding this country of the view that arts and culture should be the preserve of an exclusive and elitist minority. He recognised that culture and the arts belonged to all of us and was part of all of us.  The momentum achieved in the cultural and artistic sector over the past three years under the direction of the Minister, Deputy Higgins, has been phenomenal.  It is recognised, even by those who attempted to pour cold water on his ideas, that support and encouragement for the arts, the development of our film industry, improving our broadcasting system and fostering our language, culture and heritage have not only been significant in terms of culture and the arts but also in terms of assisting the high economic growth and creation of employment in our country.</P>
    <P>For many years, both in Government and in Opposition, Deputy Higgins personified all that is good, honest and decent in Irish political life.  He has championed many causes, stood shoulder to shoulder with the poor and the weak, the minorities and the persecuted.  He has worked through his political life to change the political culture of this country.</P>
    <P>Of course, much of what Deputy Higgins stands for is anathema to Fianna Fáil and its Progressive Democrats colleagues. Deputy Higgins has always opposed the type of stroke politics that was part and parcel of Fianna Fáil over the years and of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats coalition &mdash; the gombeen politics of the wink and the nod, of the brown parcel, of the secret donations.</P>
    <P>Unlike Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party does <Col N="1867" /> not accept cheques of £50,000 or £20,000 from the beef barons.  We raise the bulk of our funds from our members and supporters through collections, usually outside churches, from constituency events, race nights and raffle draws.  All our funds are honestly raised, accounted for and audited professionally.</P>
    <P>I understand that Fianna Fáil has raised approximately £3 million since 1993.  It would take many church gate collections and race nights to raise that amount of cash.</P>
    <P>Although the Progressive Democrats might sneer at the modest sums of money Labour collects at church gates, or through raffle draws, we can at least hold our heads high and say that our funds are raised honestly and openly from our members and from our supporters. He who pays the piper calls the tune.  The great bulk of our funds come from the men and women of no property and from PAYE workers.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats depend on the beef barons and their fellow travellers.</P>
    <P>We have always made it clear that it is our policy to restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability and trust and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.  Already much legislation has been introduced to copperfasten this approach, including the ethics Bill and the electoral Bill.</P>
    <P>We intend to continue implementing our programme despite the attempts by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to divert us from our task.  This is a pledge that we gave to the electorate and labour always sticks by its commitments.</P>
    <P>In terms of the sensitivity of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, it was unwise and an error of judgment to place Niall Stokes in a position where he could be accused of favouritism, and his name should not have been used on the correspondence promoting the infamous race night.  This has been recognised by all involved. <Col N="1868" /> However, this is hardly the stuff of major scandal.  A local county council would not waste more than ten minutes discussing such a matter, yet Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats waste the time of this House because they are unable to criticise us on the real and substantive issues, on the reform of our institutions, the completion of progress towards peace and reconciliation, the continued commitment to the employment needs of our people, the further development of our economy, the provision of funding for new roads, health, education, housing and so on.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that parties like Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would attempt to question the integrity of Deputy Higgins or of the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  I well recollect the period after I was elected to Sligo Corporation in the 1970s when I learned in no uncertain terms how Fianna Fáil did its business. Following complaints from constituents, I discovered that a local Fianna Fáil hotelier had carried out unauthorised development and, despite numerous reports and warnings from the fire authorities to the planning authority in Sligo, no action was taken. When I exposed this matter, Fianna Fáil called for the sacking of the person or persons who had provided me with the evidence.  Shortly after I raised the issue publicly RTE sent down a crew from their current affairs unit to investigate the scandal in Sligo.  Fianna Fáil knew that the scandal would greatly undermine them, and on the evening on which the programme was to be broadcast, the Fianna Fáil Government of the day succeeded in having the broadcast taken off the air.  That is the way Fianna Fáil did its business and protected its supporters.</P>
    <P>More recently, the people of Sligo and Leitrim learned of yet another scandal, of an attempt to sell off a significant development site on public property to certain developers for less than one quarter of its real value.</P>
    <P>In 1992, when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition was in power, the Office of Public Works <Col N="1869" /> received sanction to sell the property in Lower Quay Street, Sligo, to Sligo Corporation on condition that the corporation sold it in turn to two named developers. The land was not advertised for sale or put on the open market to allow all citizens and developers an opportunity to make a bid for it.  When I objected to the sale I said that any attempt to sell off public property for less than half its value in a private deal behind closed doors could only be described as outrageous and appalling. It would not only be unethical, it would be bad business practice and an affront to the people of Sligo.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, due to my objections, this matter became public knowledge. Other people expressed interest in purchasing the site and the corporation indicated that it would not become involved in any sale of the property.  The fact that a Fianna Fáil Minister in a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government sanctioned the sale of this site to two developers in Sligo for less than one quarter of its value speaks volumes about the philosophy of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">

      <P>The motion calls for the resignations of Mr. Niall Stokes, chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and of Deputy Higgins, Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I wish to say a few words about Deputy Higgins.  For me, and many like me, Deputy Higgins has been and is more than just an ordinary politician.  For years, indeed, decades, he has been a passionate advocate of social change here.  He has spoken up time and again for those people whose voice is often not otherwise heard.  He has fearlessly challenged privilege and injustice to the discomfort of many who rejoice in the cosy conservatism which still dominaties so much of what we do in this country.  He has instilled in others a belief that change &mdash; slow, halting but meaningful change &mdash; can be brought about by the political system.  In that he <Col N="1870" /> has done a service not just to this country but also to this House and to the political system.  In brief, he has been a powerful antidote to the politics of cynicism.</P>
      <P>By contrast this motion is all about cynicism.  It is, first and foremost, a grubby and cynical effort by the Opposition parties to grab a few extra preferences in the by-elections of Dublin West and Donegal North East.  It is a cynical and unworthy effort to indirectly impugn the integrity of two fine public servants.  A mistake was made.  Niall Stokes and the Independent Radio and Television Commission should not have been put in the position where their integrity could be questioned, however wrongly or obliquely.  However, this was an innocent error of no consequence.  It in no way justifies the torrent of abuse and hypocrisy that has poured forth from the Opposition benches in recent days.  No crime has been committed. Nothing dishonest or unfair has been done.  There was nothing in Mr. Stokes's contract which requires him to divest himself of his known political views, nor is he or anyone like him, required to disavow a friendship which everyone knows extends back over many years.</P>
      <P>What happened here is very simple. A few friends of Deputy Higgins met privately, but not secretly, in order to raise a few hundred pounds to discharge a debt.  To suggest that the operation of the Independent Radio and Television Commission is compromised or affected in any way by such an innocent gathering is ludicrous and laughable.  Is it being suggested that the purchase of a £20 horse at a race night would somehow improve one's chances of getting a radio or television licence?  Nobody is suggesting anything of the sort.  Nobody has suggested that Niall Stokes has been anything other than scrupulously fair and proper in the discharge of his functions. Nobody has suggested impropriety or dishonesty of any kind. Nobody seriously believes that this race night will have any effect on the operation of our independent broadcasting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> This was an innocent mistake of no consequence.  The same cannot be said of the hysterical and exaggerated response of the Opposition parties in recent days.  By over-reacting in such a way, the Opposition has done a major disservice to this House.  By concentrating on what is, in effect, a trivial incident, the Opposition has, deliberately or otherwise, obscured the important distinction between real abuse and corruption on the one hand and innocent mistake on the other.  For years our political parties, more particularly the political parties of the right, have relied on donations from individuals and corporations who proffered money, many in the expectation that favours would follow. The beef and construction industries are two examples, as are rezoning scandals in many local authorities.</P>
    <P>There has been abuse and corruption, but not on a large scale and not involving many people.  However, it rightly gives cause for public concern.  By their actions, some politicians &mdash; a very small number &mdash; have put themselves in the position where the public interest has come into conflict with their own interests and the interests of their friends.</P>
    <P>However, nobody has suggested anything of that kind in this instance.  This is not a case of abuse or corruption. There has been no genuine conflict of interest.  Nevertheless, it is possible for a genuine conflict of interest to arise in innocent circumstances.  We had just such a case in 1994 when the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications discovered that he owned shares in a mining company that had applied to his Department.  The matter was dealt with properly and quickly, the conflict was resolved, the matter was put to rest, no resignations were demanded by my party and none were given.  It is important that we maintain a sense of perspective; we do no favours to anybody if we lose it.</P>
    <P>We have been well served by the majority of political appointees on State boards.  There is nothing wrong with <Col N="1872" /> members of political parties or people of known political views being members of such boards.  In 99 per cent of cases they have done their job without favour to anybody and in a fair and scrupulous fashion.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that the system is entirely right.  We would benefit if people on State boards or in other professions such as the law, journalism and the Civil Service, were more open about their political beliefs as it would be so much the better for the public to be able to judge whether their discharge of their statutory duty was affected in a way that would be improper.  A genuine debate is needed on this.  This motion is specious. It is motivated entirely by party political opportunism and deserves to be defeated.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I wish to address a number of points raised by Deputy O'Donoghue in the debate last night and by Deputy Michael McDowell in the media over recent days.  In his colourful and entertaining speech, Deputy O'Donoghue referred to Members on the Government side behaving like political poodles and political cannibals.  One of the finest examples I have ever seen of any party being led around on its hind legs in a posture of abject submission was the performance of the Deputy's own party in the Government of 1989-92 when, to build on his canine analogy, the Progressive Democrats' tail wagged the Fianna Fáil dog at every opportunity.  The pain of such a poodle like performance exacted a terrible and telling cost in human, policy and political terms on the major party in that Government and it involved the Taoiseach of the day being subject to a perpetual power of veto of two of his Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's reference to political cannibalism alludes to politicians eating their own.  It is a charge he has levelled at my party, but in seeking to examine the veracity of that charge I cannot but be struck by the glaring examples of eating one's own prevalent <Col N="1873" /> in his party over the years.  What about Jack Lynch, Deputy McDaid, the late Brian Lenihan, Charles Haughey, Harry Whelehan or Deputy Reynolds?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> If the cap fits, let the Deputy and his party wear it.  With regard to the huffing and puffing by Deputy Michael McDowell over recent days, I accept that in his professional capacity he is well able to draw a line and exercise independence of thought and judgment between the role he plays here as a Member and the role he plays in defending all kinds of people, some very unsavoury, in the Four Courts.  Is he seriously trying to imply that, although he can be professional and independent, Mr. Stokes cannot?  The Deputy is trying to apply a double standard even when he is so trenchantly arguing against double standards.</P>
      <P>Mr. Stokes's independence and professionalism are attested to not alone by the success of his magazine and other ventures in the area of music, entertainment and culture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i>&mdash;&mdash;but also by the success of the Independent Radio and Television Commission which he chairs, and the majority of whose members are Fianna Fáil supporters.  The listenership of local radio stations has been steadily improving, questions of quality in news and current affairs are being seriously addressed at last, community broadcasting in the truest sense of the word has been set up and running and the national independent radio licence has been allocated.  This record speaks for itself and is above reproach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is Deputy Michael McDowell and his <Col N="1874" /> party willing to make full and open disclosure of their own funding and fund-raising record, as the Tánaiste did in respect of the Labour Party last night?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is pathetic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Is he prepared to admit that his party sought and received funds on a number of occasions from State or semi-State bodies?  Will he tell the House what funds were raised by his party when Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Molloy was Minister for Energy?  Will he assure the House that none of his party's benefactors during that period received grants, State aid or any other form of State assistance or favouritism while his party was in Government?</P>
      <P>What has the Deputy to say regarding contributions and communications between his party and a number of beef companies, specifically, a donation of £5,000 on 3 March 1987 and £20,000 given to Deputy O'Malley by Mr. Goodman and Deputy O'Malley's subsequent Mae West style invitation to Mr. Goodman to visit him sometime?</P>
      <P>As a first time Deputy listening to this debate it has struck me how odd it is that the timeframe and subject matter of this House is so often out of sync with what is happening outside, that we can be seized with great fits of indignation which allows us to see the speck in our opponent's eye while failing to see the log in our own and that how little in debate in this House the desire for vengeance and expression of fury is tempered by ordinary human qualities such as understanding, sympathy or mercy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's recognition that the matter was not handled as it should have been.  Perhaps it is because, as the Tánaiste illustrated here last night, we are not as cute in this party at fund-raising as our colleagues in some other parties.  However, it is not a hanging offence.  The old saying that anybody who never made a mistake made nothing is true.  If the Minister has made a minor mistake in this case it is nothing <Col N="1875" /> compared to his achievements as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. I cannot imagine a Minister who is better qualified for this brief than Deputy Michael Higgins.  The Minister should pick up his baton again and continue his good work with the renewed support of this House.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste's favourite theme is to declare himself to be an innocent man who can do no wrong.  On this basis, he proceeded to give a dissertation on the disclosure of a few pounds and pence he had legitimately raised over the years.  He knows that all political parties and politicians could not survive or fight elections if it was not for the generosity of the public.  There is nothing new in what the Tánaiste said. He was consistent in that he did little to defend Niall Stokes or his Minister; he was more concerned, as always when he speaks in the House, with his own image.  What happened between the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission was wrong and unacceptable.  It broke standards and all of the new barriers and regulations that have been legislated for.</P>

The Taoiseach stated in the <i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday there was no evidence that Mr. Stokes had acted &ldquo;without integrity&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it changes according to who is transgressing.  The truth is the Taoiseach applies a different set of standards to Labour Party transgressions. He is doing so because he is afraid.  The Taoiseach obviously believes &mdash; and looking at some of the recent manoeuvrings in Limerick he has good reason for fear &mdash; that on the day he ceases to be Taoiseach he will be consigned to political oblivion.  Where Labour Party transgressions are concerned, the Taoiseach has consistently behaved like a leaning tower of putty and demonstrated the most appalling, selective cowardice.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that Deputy Dukes, a former leader of Fine Gael and distinguished member of the party, does not agree with the Taoiseach.  I call on Deputy Dukes to join us in the division lobbies at 1.30 p.m. and not allow himself be bullied into being one of the weak and feeble minded crowd who are easily persuaded &mdash; unlike his colleagues on the Fine Gael and Labour backbenches.</P>
      <P>This selective blindness of the Taoiseach is not confined to the Labour Party.  Recently, a blind eye was turned to the linguistic revisionism of the incurably semantic and bilingual Marxist who currently holds the portfolio of Social Welfare.  Basically, Fine Gael is out of it, as far as the Government is concerned.  Deputy Carey may laugh, but a once proud party has been reduced to a pawn in a power battle between Deputy Spring and Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, a contest between an egomaniac and a megalomaniac.</P>

      <P>There is undoubtedly a belief in some quarters that the Minister, Deputy Higging, is unfortunate to be the Labour Minister finally named for censure in the long list of his colleagues caught with a finger in the pie.  I note that no less than eight current Ministers, more than half the Government, have been in trouble during the life of this Dáil, another has been forced to resign, as has a Minister of State, and two others, both Labour members among the junior ranks, have seriously compromised themselves.  That is an extraordinary score.</P>

      <P>Under the rainbow flag there has been an avalanche of unsavoury incidents involving Ministers.  None other than the brother of the Minister for Finance was charged with putting a proGovernment spin on the divorce issue and pocketed £250,000 for his trouble. Apparently his campaign was considerably assisted by a directive of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, chaired by Mr. Stokes, which the anti-divorce lobby claim effectively censored it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, has stored up a campaign fund of which we are extremely envious.  This handsomely exceeds what he may legally expend on the next election if he chooses to obey the ethics directives.</P>

    <P>The Lowry saga became so farcical <Col N="1884" /> that it is difficult to recollect how the Minister managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, who allegedly wanted a slice of the contract action for his family firm, was sacked from a Department which disburses relatively few contracts and ended up with responsibility for the Office of Public Works which handles a great many of them.  That decision, among others, defies all logic, as does the demotion of the former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, to the position of chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.

    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, referred to the gleeful reaction of this side of the House to <Col N="1885" /> Labour's catalogue of misdemeanours. Why does he believe his Fine Gael colleagues were absent?  Does he not realise that they could hardly be reasonably expected to hide their delight in the Chamber when they could not hide it all week outside and inside the House.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, concluded that the gleeful response to which he referred was indicative of unhappiness at Labour's insistence on addressing a fundamental malaise in standards in public life by establishing particular principles in legislation.  The Minister appears to have missed the joke that the legislation fails to address the serious malpractices engaged in by various Ministers in this Government.  It is so fundamentally flawed that if it addressed them, the decision-makers who have been compromised could, as in this instance, plead to the lesser crime of poor judgment and ignore the principle which Labour so vociferously sought to enshrine in legislation.  The ethics Bill and its related public relations campaign is a cheap con job which has been truly exposed by a succession of Labour Ministers, including its author.  Is it any wonder that Members on all sides of the House have difficulty hiding their amusement?</P>
    <P>Despite the Tánaiste's pleadings last night and some nasty personal jibes, Fianna Fáil had to take some action and call a halt.  This matter had to be put on the Order Paper and I commend my colleague, Deputy de Valera, for doing so.  This matter had to be debated in the Chamber.  It was the straw which broke the camel's back and it should be pursued to its logical conclusion by a substantive motion which would include all previous incidents in a confidence motion if the gravity of the present situation is not recognised and acted on by the Minister and Mr. Stokes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <P>Nobody in this House has suggested that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, or Mr. Niall Stokes is corrupt or have been found to be so.  For my part and my party I say that the <Col N="1886" /> Minister is a decent man who is trying to do his best.  I am not acquainted with Mr. Stokes but I am ready to assume the same of him.  We are not dealing here with the charge of corruption and nobody has claimed there is a shred of evidence that either of these gentlemen has behaved corruptly.  Since that charge was never made the heated rebuttals we have heard last night and today are wide of the mark and redundant. We are dealing here with evidence that both of these men acted improperly, a case of serious impropriety, nothing more and nothing less. Not every impropriety is corrupt or dishonest.</P>
      <P>The Radio and Television Act, 1988, created a new body, the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  It provided that none of the members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission could be removed from office except for stated reasons and if, but only if, resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for their removal.  That unusual degree of security of tenure is reserved in our system for judges and the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Constitution and by statute for members of An Bord Pléanala, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Ombudsman and members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
      <P>It is a feature of important offices where judicial or quasi-judicial power is given to the office holder and where the nature of the office requires demonstrable impartiality.  In the case of the Independent Radio and Television Commission it is easy to understand why that body is described in <i>Administrative Law</i> by Hogan and Morgan as a tribunal and one which bears the responsibility of allocating the franchises to private broadcasting and thereafter policing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To understand the grave implications of the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission engaging publicly in party political fund-raising, it is necessary to remember but a few of the provisions of the 1988 Act. <Col N="1887" /> Section 9.1 of that Act requires every broadcaster to abide by a code of strict political impartiality in matters of news and current affairs.  Section 4.7 makes it &ldquo;the duty of the commission to ensure that every sound broadcasting contractor and the television programme service contractor complies with section 9&rdquo;. Section 14 of the Act provides that the Independent Radio and Television Commission at its discretion may terminate a broadcaster's contract and thereby close a radio station if the broadcaster has in the opinion of the commission committed serious or repeated breaches of the obligation of political impartiality.</P>
    <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission, its members and chairman are charged by statute with upholding political impartiality in the independent broadcasting sector and with forfeiting the licence of any broadcaster who is seriously in breach of that obligation.  These functions lie at the heart of our democratic system.  As soon as I received a copy of the circular last Thursday, it was and still is apparent to me that the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, Mr. Stokes, could not possibly hope to combine in future that role with public participation as a committee officer raising funds for one party and one candidate, irrespective of whether that candidate was the Minister who appointed him and who held the responsibility for deciding the State's broadcasting policy. How could anyone think, justice could be seen to be done if the Independent Radio and Television Commission dismissed or upheld a claim to revoke a licence on the grounds that a broadcaster was being politically partisan if the chairman of that body was publicly fund-raising and supporting the re-election of one political party or a candidate thereof?</P>
    <P>A moment's reflection shows that the very nature of the Independent Radio and Television Commission's jurisidction as a tribunal with the power to revoke a licence on these grounds <Col N="1888" /> requires demonstrable political impartiality by the Independent Radio and Television Commission's chairman.  It is for this reason that Mr. Stokes's behaviour is gravely improper.  He has effectively disqualified himself from being involved in any valid decision by the Independent Radio and Television Commission to revoke a radio licence on the grounds of political partiality.  As chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, Mr. Stokes, is in short a broken reed.  He has publicly acted in a manner which would expose any decision by him to revoke a licence on the basis of political partiality to a valid legal challenge.  He has cast off the mantle of impartiality which his position required him to wear.  For that reason alone he must resign as he can no longer discharge one of his central functions with the required degree of demonstrated impartiality, no more than a judge found publicly fundraising for a particular party after his appointment could possibly sit in judgment over an election petition.  The principle is the same.</P>
    <P>The impropriety of what happened is clear and irrevocable.  The damage cannot be undone and even if it could, by an act of contrition and a firm purpose of amendment, we are, unfortunately, confronted by Mr. Stokes's public assertions that what he did was not improper and that he feels free to repeat and continue his behaviour. What he did was not dishonest, but gravely improper.  If his behaviour is acceptable as chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, then, in logic, it must be acceptable for the chairman of the RTE Authority, the DPP, the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and any other senior office holder.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I express amazement and disquiet at the wrong assertion made in the House yesterday by the Taoiseach that any office holder is free to behave in the same way as Mr. Stokes unless expressly prohibited from doing so by the terms of a Statute or his or her appointment. If the Taoiseach calmly reflects on <Col N="1889" /> that proposition for a while, he will see that misbehavior meriting dismissal could not possibly be confined to a breach of the letter of a Statute or contract of service.  I hope he will come back to the House to set out the true position about the standards that he and we, as members of a democratic society, can expect from office holders.</P>
    <P>This grave impropriety has been described yet again today as an innocent error of judgment.  In one sense, that it was not overtly corrupt, some people might fairly describe it as innocent, but we are faced with a deliberate decision by a senior office holder in a tribunal to compromise his functions in the future by agreeing to become publicly identifiable as a committee officer of a party political fundraising group which intended &mdash; some figures were mentioned last night &mdash; to run not just one, but a series of such fundraising event's this year.</P>
    <P>Common sense tells us that this gravely improper decision was not that of a volunteer.  Mr. Stokes did not volunteer for the position, he was asked to engage in that activity by a Minister who knew the radio and television Act and its requirements like the back of his hand. He knew precisely Mr. Stoke's functions as chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, how he could be compromised if he engaged in party political fundraising and knew, more than any other Minister, that the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission was one of the potential judges of any serious charge of political partisanship by any broadcaster and one of the people who might have to revoke a licence on that account.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with one or two dishonest or corrupt men.  I have acknowledged the decency of one and assumed the decency of the other, but neither are we dealing with two political naives, two occupants of an ethereal intellectual other world who are thereby somehow excused from normal responsibility or awareness of the obligations of their office.  Each in their own <Col N="1890" /> honourable way has spent many years analysing and criticising Ireland's political culture of clientelism.  Neither could be unaware of the significance of overtly politicising the membership of the tribunal, which the Independent Radio and Television Commission is, which is primarily charged with ensuring an impartial, apolitical, independent broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>If, as is now obvious, Mr. Stokes's decision was gravely improper, it follows, as night follows day, that the person who invited him to make that decision also acted in a gravely improper way.  Perhaps the public would be satisfied if Mr. Stokes were to resign and the Minister acknowledged that he had wrongly invited Mr. Stokes into impropriety.  Perhaps the public would forgive the Minister for his grave impropriety on the grounds that he, as his supporters pointed out yesterday, has been a capable and energetic achiever in his office, but, by the same token, nobody said anything less of Deputies Coveney and Hogan who were dismissed from their offices for offences far less grave than this.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing that up to yesterday the Minister insisted he had done nothing wrong and this remains the stated position of Mr. Stokes.  It is one thing to embarrass the Labour Party and apologise to his colleagues in the parliamentary party, but it is a different thing to acknowledge that what he did was profoundly wrong and accept the personal responsibility for that grave transgression.  Such an attitude, if demonstrated today, might radically alter our attitude because it would be clear that no precedent had been created by the behaviour of the Minister.  For this reason we must support the motion. There has been no indication of an acceptance of the gravity of what happened.</P>
    <P>I have tried to deal with this matter dispassionately and without rancour in the face of considerable personal abuse, in the House last night and on the airwaves, from the Minister, the Tánaiste and Mr. Stokes.  I will not descend to <Col N="1891" /> what I describe as the bilious level of invective demonstrated last night by the Tánaiste's script writer because this issue is too serious to become an exercise in political mud wrestling, but I recommend that the Tánaiste should change his script writer.</P>
    <P>A defence of what has transpired by reference to the behaviour of others is not acceptable.  That <i>tu quoque</i> defence is the same as that offered by the Nazis at Nuremberg.  It was rightly rejected there and ought to be rejected here.  The particular set of circumstances with which we are dealing is unprecedented. A grave impropriety has occurred, we are not dealing with an instance of party activism by, say, a director of a semi-State company of which, doubtless, there have been and will be in the future many instances, but with an instance of proven and admitted public party political activism by a member of a tribunal, one of whose functions is to detect, prevent and disqualify others from partisan behaviour in the crucially important area of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This is no mere error of judgement, but a grave impropriety committed by one man at the express request of another, neither of whom has thus far recognised or acknowledged it for what it is.  This impropriety, if uncorrected, strikes at the heart of democracy and fairness in the media; opens the door to the worst forms of clientelism and invites a permanent degradation of standards in public life.  From what transpired in the House yesterday evening and on the airwaves in recent days, it would appear that some people here think that it is more important to shoot the messenger than exact responsibility, personally and politically, for this grave impropriety on the part of these two men.</P>
    <P>In short, Mr. Stokes has demolished his own capacity to serve as chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and must go because he cannot preside over any hearing that a radio station is impartial.  Any effort by him to discharge that function would be challenged successfully in the courts. <Col N="1892" /> The Minister, who cannot be involuntarily removed except by both Houses of the Oireachtas and who invited Mr. Stokes to engage in this impropriety, is now in a dilemma.  What course is now open to him, but to promise a vacancy in the chairmanship of the Independent Radio and Television Commission or deliver a vacancy in his own office or both?</P>

      <P>It would not be much of a challenge to come into the House today and articulate a verbal balance sheet comparing the depredations of Fianna Fáil in office with the combined efforts of the other parties.  A former Taoiseach was fond of saying, with a magisterial wave of the hand, that by comparison to Japan and Australia our scandals did not amount to a hill of beans.  Everything, I suppose, is relative.</P>
      <P>I will resist the tempatation of taking the House through an itemised balance sheet for a number of reasons.  First, I cannot take this bout of by-election induced righteousness from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats seriously.  The proposer of the motion, Deputy de Valera, regards the debate so seriously that she used up only half her allotted time.  If Deputy de Valera runs out of steam half way like the west Clare train in the time of Percy French, how can she expect the rest of the House to treat her motion seriously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I regard with some disbelief the fact that the man described as the &ldquo;craftiest most cunning, most devious politician of them all&rdquo;.  Deputy Ahern, has permitted this debate to take place on a Fianna Fáil motion because he surely knows, and in more ways than one, that it will return to haunt him. <Col N="1893" /> When it comes to breaking conventions, party fundraising or appointing one's friends to quasi-judicial or semi-lucrative positions the other parties in this House are floundering in the wake of Fianna Fáil.  That Fianna Fáil should set itself up by sponsoring a debate on such issues can only mean that it has lost its legendary touch or is suffering from total policy bankruptcy.  Private Members' Business is normally jealously protected by the Opposition of the day and used to highlight policy initiatives or ventilate topical issues of interest to the electorate.  It is a remarkable comment on the combined Opposition that this motion founded on the twin pillars of humbug and hypocrisy is the best they can do.</P>
    <P>Mr. Niall Stokes was wrong to lend his name to even a once-off low key fund-raising event for his friend, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  It seems unlikely that Mr. Stokes ever contemplated the construction now capable of being put on his actions and, for all I know, he does not see his action as partisan in the party political sense. Nonetheless it was an error and he should appropriately acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>That said, to take up the time of the House arguing for the resignation of a man who has by common consent been our most creative and imaginative Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is a mind-boggling leap of hypocrisy, so much so that it is difficult to take this debate seriously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor do I take very seriously yesterday's tight-assed sermonising by some prissy leader writer in <i>The Irish Times.</i> I am no less and, I hope, no more venal <Col N="1894" /> than the next Member of this House but language has lost all meaning if the absurd claim that &ldquo;there is a preception of sleaziness in the way the constituent parties of the Government conduct their business&rdquo; is allowed stand unchallenged. If Members of this House were appointed in the same fashion as some would like to make senior appointments at <i>The Irish Times</i> then the Dáil would be an hereditary chamber.  Of course, the proposer of the motion, Deputy de Valera, only has to look into history, if not her own heart, to teach us all a lesson about fund-raising and the hereditary principle.</P>
    <P>Sermonising has also badly affected Deputy O'Donoghue, the &ldquo;Bull McCabe&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil.  Day after day since he was given his head the Bull rages about death, rape, pillage and robbery in apocalyptic terms like King Lear on the heath.  No hyperbole is adequate to do justice to the sights that greet this man every day on his way from Cahirciveen &mdash; bandits running wild with guns, bodies strewn everywhere in hedges, children fleeing certain molestation, women skulking behind shuttered doors and punative criminals everywhere jumping bail.</P>

      <P>Nobody in this House seriously believed that this is a resigning issue for the Minister concerned.  I have refrained from retracing the legacy of abuses of public office by Fianna Fáil <Col N="1897" /> since it returned to office in 1987. However, I would remind Deputies that it is only a short time ago since I accepted on the floor of the House that Deputy Cowen was guilty of no more than a lapse of memory on the Arcon shares controversy.  On the matter of quasi-judicial appointments I remind the Leader of Fianna Fáil that no one now on this side of the House objected when he appointed his brother-in-law to an important quasi-judicial position.  I do not know if Fianna Fáil is saying that no one appointed to a quasi-judicial function by any of its Ministers, for example, to An Bord Pleanála, has ever raised money for the party.</P>
      <P>I have known Deputy Michael D. Higgins all my adult life.  He is an honest politician and a creative Minister.  I, for one, am glad that he will continue after today to add to the gaiety of public affairs and generally adorn and enhance public life.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that my constituency colleague, Deputy de Valera, saw fit to put down this motion asking for the resignation of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. <Col N="1898" /> I have worked with him in the Department and Deputy de Valera has worked opposite him as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on this area.  I have found Deputy Higgins to be a man of integrity, without malice or badness.</P>
      <P>The motion implies that he deliberately set out to mislead.  Deputy McDowell's argument rests on his interpretation of a section of the Act.  Other speakers have explained the section that he is relying on.  I refer to the so-called quasi-judicial role of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. Deputy de Valera also made that claim. The Deputies refered to the role of the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and quoted paragraph 3 of the Schedule to the Radio and Television Act, 1988, in support of their view.  The provision in question deals with the removal of a member of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and provides that the Government may remove a member for stated reasons if, and only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for the member's removal.  While this is an unusual provision it is a mirror of section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, which provides for exactly the same procedure in terms of the removal of a member of the RTE Authority.  A reasonable person could not claim that the chairman or members of the RTE Authority exercise a quasi-judicial function.  The reason for the provisions in both Acts is to preserve the autonomy and independence from the Government of the day of the institutions concerned with the provision of broadcasting services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On each occasion we have debated behaviour or misbehaviour Deputy McDowell has gone for the jugular.  He talked about the grave mistake made by the Minister and criticised people on this side of the House who said what happened was an innocent mistake.  I accept it was an innocent mistake. Deputy McDowell supported the <Col N="1899" /> Fianna Fáil view that there is party political opportunism at all times.  There is a by-election in progress and Deputies feel there must be hype about it.  Similarly, there is baseless media hype in the case of a young garda, and the Minister for Defence has been pilloried wrongly by the other side of the House in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the scale of appointments by Fianna Fáil.  I wish to quote from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 13 February 1993 in which Gerald Barry, political correspondent, stated: &ldquo;More than 600 appointments were made by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government in the period between the general election and the formation of a new Government.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an deis seo agam an freagra a thabhairt ar a lán atá ráite agus mo thuairimí féin a nochtadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise to the Dáil that the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on arts, culture and heritage has felt it necessary to table this motion which alleges a lack of public confidence in the Independent Radio and Television Commission, assails the integrity of the chairperson of the commission, and accuses me of failing to understand the proper and ethical behaviour required of a person who holds high public office.  As Deputy Sargent said last night, the public are entitled to wonder at the judgement of <Col N="1900" /> those who have required that the Dáil spends three hours discussing this matter when there are so many other important issues queuing up for consideration in Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>I have complete confidence in the way the Independent Radio and Television Commission is discharging its statutory duties with Niall Stokes as chairperson and nine others men and women of diverse views and backgrounds. The Independent Radio and Television Commission is not a one man band.  The role of the current chairperson, unlike that of his predecessor, does not involve executive functions.  His task is to facilitate and guide the deliberations of his colleagues in order to arrive at a collective decision on issues concerning the commercial broadcasting sector.</P>
    <P>Last night a number of Fianna Fáil speakers unjustify and incorrectly accused the Independent Radio and Television Commission of being politically motivated in its decisions; issues such as the composition of the board of Highland Radio and guidelines for local radio during the divorce referendum were given as examples.  Advantage was taken of this debate to make unfair innuendos in that regard.  The clear inference intended by the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on broadcasting was that decisions of the Independent Radio and Television Commission are driven exclusively by the political views of its chairperson.</P>
    <P>However, Niall Stokes has no executive functions and decisions of the Independent Radio and Television Commission are not his alone.  Of the other nine members three were nominated by me for appointment.  They are: Jude Bowles, community arts programme, Combat Poverty Agency and freelance radio producer; Aiden Meade, the independent audio visual producer from Dublin and Mary Ruddy, Station Manager of Connemara Community Radio.</P>
    <P>The other six members were nominated by Deputy Albert Reynolds.  They are: Gerard Danaher, barrister and former chairperson of the Employment <Col N="1901" /> Appeals Tribunal; Gillian Bowler, managing director of Budget Travel; Eileen Brophy, journalist, formerly a reporter with Radio Limerick; Jack Davis, chairman of the Meath Chronicle; Kieran Mulvey, chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission and Christy Cooney, FÁS manager and chairman of GAA Cork County Board, all of whom have political associations of one kind or another, as they are entitled.  They were appointed for their competence, fairmindedness and representativeness.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my complete confidence in the way the Independent Radio and Television Commission is carrying out its statutory duties.  In alleging that there is a shadow on the impartiality and Independence of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, as she did last night, let Deputy de Valera ponder the disservice she is doing to Fianna Fáil and its six nominees who comprise a majority of the commission.</P>
    <P>The mantra like repetition by Deputy Michael McDowell in recent days that the Independent Radio and Television Commission is a quasi-judicial body will not make it so.  It is neither &ldquo;in a certain sense&rdquo; nor &ldquo;in appearance&rdquo;, which the term means, a body of judges.  The continued use of this pseudo legalism by Deputy McDowell, who is a senior counsel &mdash; is a piece of jargon deliberately used to cause confusion.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission is unlike the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Valuation Tribunal, which the Tánaiste referred to last night, both of which indeed can be described as quasi-judicial bodies.</P>
    <P>A body which hands down judgements in the field of broadcasting is the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  Are Deputies de Valera and McDowell inferring that the public can have no confidence in the independence and impartiality of that commission because its chairperson is an active member of Fianna Fáil and one of the members of the commission is a Progressive Democrats member who has stood for election?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> The Independent Radio and Television Commission was set up to ensure the creation, development and monitoring of independent broadcasting in Ireland.  Niall Stokes is to be admired for the vision and leadership, qualities he brings to the position of chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  He is a person who discharges his responsibilities without fear or favour, with intelligence and integrity, with commitment and conviction. As far as I am concerned he must, and will, continue to serve as chairperson of the commission for the full term for which he has been appointed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy for Galway West I accept full responsibility for the circumstances which have unfortunately prompted this motion.  The Labour Party in Galway is not dissimilar to party organisations elsewhere.  We need funds for the election and referendum campaigns which occur from time to time, and we have fought all referenda.  We seem always to be in debt and almost never to have the resources in place for the next campaign. We have fund-raising events where we call on the members and the same group of supporters to make the contributions necessary to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>On this occasion a number of friends offered to help with the organisational arrangements necessary to put such events in place.  It was entirely inappropriate that their names, including those of Niall Stokes and Dorothea Melvin, should have appeared on the booking form for a single event in March.  I accept that and I regret it.</P>
    <P>This oversight occured in my constituency office and the booking form was sent out from there to about 120 Labour Party members and supporters in Dublin.  I greatly regret the embarrassment and the difficulties which have been caused to Niall Stokes and Dorothea Melvin by the adverse public comment and the several political criticism to which they have been exposed in the media and in this House.  This was as a direct result of my failure to prevent <Col N="1903" /> their names from being appended to the booking form in the way it occurred.</P>
    <P>I accept too there is a line between the personal sphere and the public sphere which should not be crossed if the people we serve are to have trust and confidence in the impartiality of the institutions of the State.  I regret that my actions may have blurred that line in the perceptions of some people over the last week or so.  I also apologise if by inadvertence any of the persons named have been caused concern or embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I believe that in many of his radio interviews Deputy McDowell of the Progressive Democrats, unlike today, totally disregarded the principle of proportionality in his political opportunism and that the damage done by him to individual citizens was disproportionate to the mistake he sought to highlight and which I now acknowledge.  Nevertheless, in the context of this debate, I wish to reassert the fundamental right and the central importance of talented men and women committed to our democracy being politically active and giving public service, and I say this irrespective of party affiliation or sympathy.</P>
    <P>There are many commendable individuals, representative of all the parties in this House, whose skills are contributing to the quality of leadership in the public sector.  It is the willingness of such people to give their time and energy in public service which has assisted, and continues to assist, many aspects of the economic, social and cultural life of this country.</P>
    <P>In the course of making appointments to State boards I have recognised those individuals who have made a vital contributions to the work of their organisations and have reappointed them in the full knowledge that their party political sympathies are not shared by me.  I could give many examples.  Their contribution was and is valued by me and I do not ask them to deny friendship with anybody as a condition of service.  That is an important point.  Should I have said I am not a friend of Naill Stockes? <Col N="1904" /> Should Naill Stokes have said he was not a friend of Michael D. Higgins?</P>

      <P>The world knew it, and that is the point.  I emphasise that I accept full responsibility for the mistakes I have listed and which I accept. In the short time remaining to me I cannot deal with other aspects of criticism of me as Minister for which this motion seeks to have me resign.  For example, I did not create a climate of fear here in trying to do my work at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, as was suggested last night.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has spoken of the invaluable contribution programme managers make to the Programme for Government and the work of their respective Ministers.  I reject all the allegations and imputations made about the participation of my programme manager, Kevin O'Driscoll, in the organisation of this modest fund raising event. His work on this event in his own time involved full consultation with me and my approval of all the arrangements made.  I wish to express my personal gratitude to him for his assistance to me in my work as Minister and for his energetic contribution to the work of my Department.  In addition, I am most appreciative of his voluntary work in the service of the Labour Party in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed that in their pursuit of this debate in the media, the language of members of the Progressive Democrats has been colourful.  I suppose that is to be expected in light of the by-election. There are three examples, however, of their over-excited language on which I would like to comment.  They used the word &ldquo;gombeenism&rdquo; to describe Dorothea Melvin's honest, open and legitimate involvement in political activity.  In any fair thinking person's opinion they have maligned a <Col N="1905" /> private citizen and done a serious disservice to the practise and image of politicians.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell had been particularly partial to the words &ldquo;peddling influence&rdquo; to describe the Labour Party's efforts to raise modest funds.</P>

I agree with the Tánaiste that unfounded attacks should not be made and I ask him to instruct the general secretary of his party to retract the unfounded statement he made on RTE radio last Sunday that a former Member of this House, Éamon de Valera, who is no longer with us, had become a milionaire during his lifetime.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available I wish to raise a couple of points as <Col N="1908" /> our spokesperson wishes to conclude this debate.  The motion is: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to restore political confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Independent Radio and Television Commission...&rdquo; This matter has come to a head because concern has been expressed within the independent radio industry about the behaviour, activities and opinions of the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and whether there is public confidence in his chairmanship.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste referred to consistency and accountability.  In his words &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; is the right of the public to secure adequate explanations.  He always claimed in his speeches that the Labour Party was interested in fair and true accounting.  We have an independent radio sector which has a statutory basis.  The legislative measures were introduced because of the problem with pirate radio stations, the unregulated activity and the need in the public interest to bring it under a legislative framework.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission was established under the Radio and Television Act, 1988, with the specific function of entering contracts for the provision of sound broadcasting services and to amend the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that Mr. Stokes in his private capacity is a good editor of a rock journal, <i>Hot Press,</i> which I have often read.  I recall reading the columns for many years when the Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, was involved.  In the interests of consistency and impartiality and being seen to be independent, as an editor of a rock journal, Mr. Stokes had an editorial line promoting pirate radio stations.  For example, on 24 March 1993, under the heading &ldquo;Outlaw Radio&rdquo; it said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the problems besetting Irish commercial radio and an increasing dissatisfaction with the output of Dublin Independents, the way has been opened for a resurgence of <Col N="1909" /> private radio stations.  We profile the major players.</P>
    <P>On 5 May 1993 under the heading &ldquo;Going Underground&rdquo; he states:</P>
    <P>The Fight Back Begins!  Legally sanctioned Irish radio may continue to go from bland to worse, but in recent months a whole plethora of pirates have begun to waive the rules and may eventually rule the waves. We go behind the scenes of the most exciting and anarchic pirates to yet emerge.</P>
    <P>Even this week's edition, despite the controversy, of 3 April 1996 under the heading &ldquo;Turning The Tables&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>While Dublin's licensed stations continue, for the most part, to feed the mainstream, stations like Club FM are offering one kind of alternative. Journalist visits what is currently the capital's leading dance pirate.</P>
    <P>If the Independent Radio and Television Commission is to be independent and the Chairman, who has the statutory functions of maintaining a regulated independent sector on one hand, and on the other, in a separate capacity, is promoting unregulated radio broadcasting here, that is unacceptable to this House which set out the statutory framework within which people in the Independent Radio and Television Commission have to operate.  We have imposed legal duties on the members of the commission to uphold the standards that we as legislators have set down. Yet, the chairman, in a separate capacity &mdash; as he is entitled to do &mdash; in a separate operation in a private area, is involved in promoting policies which are the negation of his own Minister.  He is promoting policies which are totally inconsistent with a properly regulated independent commercial sector.  That is the reason I say public confidence is ebbing.  That is why I say it was not only the specific issue that occurred in Cumann na Múinteoirí, it is only one of a series of editorial judgments which he is entitled to make as rock journalist but <Col N="1910" /> they are editorial judgments which impinge on his perceived independence as chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  Those are issues which should be brought to book by the Minister who is responsible for ensuring that we have consistency and accountability.  I submit that is the most serious charge that can be made against the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>Responsibility and accountability are not only about decisions taken, it is about the failure by the Minister to take decisions to ensure that the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission is actually propagating publicly and privately the policies he espouses.  If he wishes to pursue policies in a different capacity, his time as chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission must come to an end.</P>

      <P>I was rather amused this morning to listen to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte and his use of verbal camouflage.  That is the only reference I could make to his speech.  Having looked over eight pages there is not one single reference to the Independent Radio and Television Commission which indicates he had very weak arguments. It was a supercilious approach to what we on this side of the House consider an important and serious matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, referred to the fact that a certain person in this House once looked into his heart.  I ask the Minister of State to look into his heart and see whether he can genuinely accept the position and vote with the rest of the Government at 1.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the use of Dáil time, I was interested to note that only ten minutes, out of 25 minutes Government time, was allocated to the Minister. Deputy Michael D. Higgins, to whom this motion is specifically related.  The Minister did not have the opportunity to speak for 25 minutes because Democratic Left muscled in to make sure it had its say, although it was not really <Col N="1911" /> worth it, considering the speech given by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and Minister of State, Deputy Carey, felt Fine Gael had better be seen to make some comment on this occasion.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about this question we are referring specifically to the chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, and not to any other members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission is not just any old statutory body.  It is a tribunal which grants broadcasting licences to people who wish to set up radio and television stations.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission is similar to An Bord Pleanála.  Can one imagine what would be said if a chairman of An Bord Pleanála got involved in political fund-raising for the Minister for the Environment? The Independent Radio and Television Commission has to be fair and has to be seen to be fair.  The Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, was perfectly correct in saying that people will obviously have their own friendships with Ministers or their own political points of view and will have their own right to fund-raise for a political party.  He forgets, and this is the important distinction, that when one takes on the responsibility of such a quasi-judicial position &mdash; perhaps the Minister would read the Act which refers to this and get advice on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a person in such a sensitive position is obliged to ensure he does not at any stage take the opportunity of making any political statements or fund-raise for any political party or Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen referred to the fact that the editor and owner of <i>Hot Press,</i> who happens to be the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, had an article in the last publication which referred to two illegal radio stations.  To say the least that is inappropriate when he is supposed to be chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission for the legal licensing of our radio and television stations.</P>
      <P>Last night the Tánaiste, if he was to be perfectly honest, felt rather embarrassed about the position.  He detailed at length what a race night entailed and talked about only small amounts of money.  The situation does not hinge on the amount of money raised but on the principle.  It is difficult to believe that a person of his legal training and his general intelligence does not appreciate the principle involved here and the logical action that should follow from that principle. I urge the House to support the motion which the Fianna Fáil Party has tabled regarding the resignation of Mr. Niall Stokes and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>It is to be hoped that the underpinning of the future of Irish Steel will be a major boost to the Cork region and help it to rebuild its industrial base.  If the company had been closed the Cork region might have been irreparably damaged and might have found it difficult to overcome the gloom.  In discussing the industrial future of Cork and my area I wish all the best to Apple Computers which has been experiencing difficulties internationally. I am sure I echo the sentiments of all Members when I express my hope that the latest optimism for the company holds and that it has a bright future in Cork.</P>
      <P>This is a very important debate as the sale of a State company is a major issue. Privatisation brings change and it means the staff no longer enjoy the security of knowing that the State and the Oireachtas are there to fight their corner. The privatisation of Irish Steel is different from other privatisations involving State companies.  The State did not sell all its stake in Irish Sugar in one go as it is doing in the case of Irish Steel; rather it sold it gradually.  I look forward to hearing Deputy Mulvihill's response to this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The privatisation of Irish Steel is taking place against the background of the commitments in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, which states that State assets will not be sold except where it protects employment and is in the long-term strategic <Col N="1916" /> interests of the company and its stake-holders. It also states that the Government will retain majority State ownership in these companies and that change in State companies will be managed in the best interests of the employees.</P>
      <P>The work on this legislation was initiated by the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Government which considered how the plant could be modernised and concluded there had to be sweeping changes in work practices and there was a need for the establishment of a strategic partnership between Irish Steel and other steel finance companies.  The rationalisation programme was successful, the workforce accepted major changes and Irish Steel managed to move from a position where it reduced its losses from £20.7 million in 1993-94 to £5.8 million in 1994-95.  It is expected that Irish Steel will make a small profit of £1 million in the 1995-96 financial year.</P>
      <P>The plans for a strategic alliance arose out of the rationalisation programme. Much of the detailed work on this was carried out by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I praise him and his officials for progressing the matter. However, I wish to ask a number of questions about the legislation.  We have read and heard much about Ispat International which appears to have a strong track record and to have enjoyed good commercial success.  However, no reference is made in the Bill to &ldquo;ISPAT International&rdquo; while the explanatory memorandum refers to &ldquo;ISPAT Mexicana&rdquo;. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is required as part of the transaction for the sale of the shares in Irish Steel Limited, held by the Minister for Finance, to ISPAT Mexicana S.A. DE C.V.  The legislation provides for the repeal of the previous legislation passed by the Oireachtas on Irish Steel Limited, which will no longer apply when the company is sold to ISPAT, and to enable the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to fulfil his financial commitments to Irish Steel <Col N="1917" /> Limited/ISPAT Mexicana under the agreement for the sale of the shares of Irish Steel Limited.</P>
    <P>During previous debates on Irish Steel reference was made to ISPAT International only and I would like to know why ISPAT Mexicana is being brought into the equation at this stage. Have the unions and the workforce in Irish Steel been informed that the company is ISPAT Mexicana?  I am not aware that they have been made so aware.  Is the company a subsidiary of the group and who are its directors? Does it share common directors with the parent company?  What is its track record?  Are all its tax affairs and documentation in order, its capital requirements and its borrowings?  Why is Irish Steel not being handed over to ISPAT International rather than to a single company within the group?  Is is not very dangerous for the Irish Steel workforce to be employed by a subsidiary rather than the main company?  What is the link between Cobh and Mexicana?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In reduced numbers. How will the reporting relationships operate between ISPAT International, ISPAT Mexicana and Irish Steel?  Were there negotiations with Mexicana or ISPAT International? Who has met the people from Mexicana? Has the Minister met them? Have all the photocalls not shown people from ISPAT International and not from ISPAT Mexicana?</P>
      <P>It is unhelpful for the Minister to introduce change of this sort at such a late stage.  It appears to have just been slipped into the Bill.  I have yet to meet or speak with anyone who was aware that a deal was being done with a Mexican company rather than with a giant steel multinational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate in the Seanad, the Minister conceded that the steel industry is cyclical.  I wish to pose some questions in this regard.  In the Bill the only guarantee given by ISPAT is for five <Col N="1918" /> years.  Why is it for such a definite period? Will it not continue beyond that, and what guarantees are there that when the five years are up ISPAT Mexicana will not disappear with the £37 million of taxpayers' money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have read the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  I accept Ispat's intentions are good but the detail of this deal must be queried.  I understand that a penalty clause applies if Ispat decides to shed staff before the five years have expired.  The Minister has declined to give any detail of this penalty clause even in response to parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>A newspaper report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> dated 10 September stated that the penalty was just £10,000 per job.  Is this accurate?  Who will pick up the tab for the remainder if there are redundancies?  Will it be the State? What might be the liability if the Irish Steel workforce were to fall to, say, 250?</P>
      <P>When a strategic alliance was proposed for Irish Steel, many expected that the State might keep some stake or that at least the workforce might get a share, as happened at Aer Lingus and the ESB, and as is planned for Telecom Éireann.  Why was this not explored by the Government?  Is it in keeping with the spirit of social partnership to ignore the staff's contribution to the turnaround at Irish Steel?  In the Seanad, the Minister said that of the companies bidding for Irish Steel all proposed 100 per cent ownership.  Did the State try to negotiate with them?</P>
      <P>Another unclear element relates to how change at Irish Steel will be monitored once the legislation is passed.  Will the State have any input or will it be left to chance?  What if major changes in work practices are planned?  The original commitment to employment by ISPAT for 331 staff for five years has been reduced to 300.  How did this drop occur and what are its implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to raise some questions <Col N="1919" /> about events last November regarding British Steel's objections.  In the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said that the argument made by the British Government was not well founded.  I too do not accept the British argument put forward at that time.  The British Government was acting in bad faith in the Irish Steel talks.  The fact that the deal was acceptable to 14 other EU countries shows that it was not contrary to the rules of competition.  Irish Steel has a tiny share of the EU market and its production capacity could not possibly lead to the direct closure of a British plant.  British Steel's output is more than 40 times that of Irish Steel. For British Steel to try to close Irish Steel was indefensible and bad competitive practice.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel is of important and vital-national interest and should have been defended as such.  However, even though the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has admitted that the Government did not accept British Steel's objections to be well founded, the British managed to set the running and the Irish Government was very poor at defending its corner.  There were great delays and reluctance to raise the matter at ministerial and prime ministerial level.</P>
    <P>Also, considerable concessions were made to the British.  As a considerable price had to be paid to ISPAT to compensate them for these restrictions, the cost of the deal went up from £27.5 million to £37.2 million, with £7 million of the increase going to Ispat as compensation for production and sales caps.</P>
    <P>ISPAT appears to have driven a good bargain.  Did the Minister consider at any stage consulting any of the other players who expressed an interest in Irish Steel?  ISPAT must have known it had the Government in a corner.  This is not necessarily a good way to negotiate.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise a question about PRSI provisions for Irish Steel workers. In the Social Welfare Bill there is a proposal that the Telecom Éireann workforce will pay the low rate of PRSI even <Col N="1920" /> if the company is part privatised.  What is the situation at Irish Steel, and will there be any change in PRSI?</P>
    <P>In relation to Telecom Éireann, I wonder why the new company is not being made liable for the higher PRSI rate.  That will result in a loss to the State of between £35 million and £50 million a year.  The workers would benefit considerably with the higher rate, and it should be obligatory on the incoming company to compensate the workers for the lack of better benefits.</P>
    <P>A number of questions remain to be answered in respect of the Irish Steel deal.  In a reply to a recent parliamentary question the Minister told me that about £2.5 million of the £37 million might be recoverable for the State.  This amount related to residual costs and financial claims which arose in the past.</P>
    <P>On January 25 last, the Minister said that the matter was under discussion between Irish Steel and ISPAT but he made no mention of this in the Seanad and painted the deal as costing a straight £37 million.  Have these talks concluded, and what was the outcome?</P>
    <P>There is also a provision in the final settlement for environmental work costing £2.36 million.  Who will be carrying out these works and what do they entail?  Would it not be better if the State carried out these works?</P>
    <P>I wish all the best to Irish Steel and to ISPAT.  I hope Irish Steel blossoms under its new management.  I plan to continue to keep an interest in Irish Steel, coming from the constituency of East Cork, even though I am from the northern area.  I hope I will have Deputy Bradford's support.</P>

      <P>I wish also to compliment Deputies Ruairí Quinn and Mary O'Rourke who were then Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment for their efforts on behalf of the company.  Were it not for their initiative in spearheading this matter Irish Steel would have been lost to Cork Harbour and the greater Cork area.  The Cork area suffered greatly under national coalition governments in the past, losing much of its heavy industry. Were it not for the Fianna Fáil influence Irish Steel would not have been saved.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy for East Cork and a former Irish Steel worker, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  It marks not only an historic milestone in the history of Irish Steel but also a milestone for the people of East Cork.</P>
      <P>In recent times the East Cork region suffered high levels of unemployment. Had Irish Steel closed, it would, I have no doubt, have signalled the final nail in the coffin for East Cork.</P>
      <P>As the House will be well aware, Irish Steel's troubles have been ongoing for decades.  In fact, the company made profits in only three of the past 20 years.  In the trading year 1993-94, Irish Steel lost well over £1 million a month and total losses for the year amounted to over £20 million.  Experience has shown that the State has not been the ideal partner for Irish Steel.  Acceptance of this fact led to the crisis in Irish Steel in the summer of 1994.  The survival plan drawn up to deal with the problems besetting the company was an absolute precondition to its very survival.  It provided for a reduction of 205 workers, the introduction of flexible work practices, the achievement of efficiencies and a pay freeze.</P>
      <P>The difficulties experienced in reaching agreement with the unions on the implementation of the plan were well documented and the industrial relations problems surrounding these negotiations brought the company to the brink of closure on a number of occasions.  It is with great pleasure, therefore, that I debate this Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This survival plan was instrumental in securing a viable future for Irish Steel.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the sacrifices and efforts made by the workers of Irish Steel in its implementation. That it was difficult to accept is beyond doubt but it was a precondition to survival.  The change accepted by the workers represents a transformation of <Col N="1923" /> the culture that prevailed in the company. The survival of the company is, to a large extent, due to the conviction and mettle of the workers involved.  Another workforce of lesser conviction would have refused to accept such a watershed plan.</P>
    <P>Credit must also be given to Mr. Pat Dineen for his vision and leadership throughout the crisis.  When he became chairman of Irish Steel the future of the company was, to say the least, very bleak.  However, with characteristic commitment and skill he steered the company through those troubled times and transformed it to the extent that ISPAT International agreed to purchase 100 per cent of the shares in Irish Steel and thus ensure its future.  The management must also be commended for its commitment to securing a viable future for the company.</P>
    <P>During the summer of 1994 it seemed Irish Steel was about to close and many people took great pleasure in saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  However, thanks to the efforts of the Tánaiste, Deputy Dick Spring, and the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, the negotiations proved fruitful.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly the Progressive Democrats called for the closure of Irish Steel as the only sensible solution.  This, however, was more a reflection of their short-sightedness than a realistic assessment of the situation at the time.  Left to the Progresive Democrats we would not have any semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Quill who took a very sensible stand during the crisis.  She contacted everybody and was very concerned for the workers although her party was opposed to supporting Irish Steel and wanted to close it down.</P>
    <P>This debate, however, proves what can be achieved when there is commitment. I did not doubt that Irish Steel could survive.  What was in doubt was whether those directly involved would receive the support needed to ensure survival.  They received this from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> Those dark clouds which for so long hung over Haulbowline have thankfully become a thing of the past and the problems which seemed to be the defining characteristic of Irish Steel have been resolved once and for all.  Irish Steel today is an example to all Irish industry of how change, no matter how painful, can be managed.</P>
    <P>The cultural change witnessed in Irish Steel is almost unbelievable.  Its shortcomings have been well documented by its critics.  However, the majority of its detractors are from outside the East Cork region and are unable to appreciate just what the closure of the company would have meant for the region.</P>
    <P>Not only is it a traditional employer in the region but it is one of the main sources of revenue for many support industries.  At the time of the crisis confidence was already at a low ebb in the region.  However, the closure of Irish Steel could have been the final death blow to a region already suffering more than most.  It was in these harrowing circumstances we in the Labour Party committed ourselves to ensuring that Irish Steel survived.  The success of the change made is reflected in that Irish Steel is now on course to break-even this year and the new owners have already taken on more workers.</P>
    <P>Today, Irish Steel is an example to Irish industry of what can be achieved by adopting a consensus approach to the management of change.  Change is not an easy pill to swallow at the best of times and the terms of the survival plan put to the workers made that pill all the harder to swallow.</P>
    <P>The workers and management alike had to deal with complete change of company culture and structure.  The problems which beset the company were mainly grounded in the low trust level between management and the workforce.  However, the transformation from a company based on outmoded perceptions of &ldquo;good industrial relations&rdquo; to a world class manufacturing organisation is a vindication of our faith in the workers and management of Irish Steel in those dark days of 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> I congratulate the trade unions involved on the contribution they made to the success story that is Irish Steel today.  It took a great deal of courage to embrace work practices which not so long ago were considered to be outside the remit of &ldquo;good industrial relations&rdquo;. However, in doing so the unions representing the workers of Irish Steel signalled a new departure in industrial relations and helped the trade union movement in general to face the challenge facing them as we enter the 21st century.</P>
    <P>With regard to the readaptation fund, money is still due to those workers who were made redundant as a result of the implementation of the survival plan. This needs to be addressed as soon as possible and I call on the Minister to ensure that it is.</P>
    <P>I also call on the Minister to publish the report of the Cobh and Harbour Task Force which was set by the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn at the time of the crisis in Irish Steel.  East Cork remains a region of high unemployment and this task force report would help in formulating a strategy to address this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>This short Bill is of huge importance to Cobh, East Cork, Irish Steel and the steel industry in Ireland.  As Deputy Mulvihill said, the Bill will herald a new beginning for Irish Steel and for the East Cork area.  The steel industry in Cork is small by international standards but it is hugely important in the Cork area and in the wider Irish context.  It is one of the very major employers in the Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People were concerned about Irish Steel down through the years particularly during 1993-94 when the future of the industry appeared to be at risk. Many people must get credit for bringing through those parlous days.  I hope this Bill will underpin the future of the steel industry in Ireland.  Various Ministers played a leading role.  The then Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the <Col N="1926" /> present Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, committed themselves wholeheartedly to securing the future of industry.</P>
    <P>The workers in the firm, many of whom had to take the redundancy option, can at least be satisfied that their sacrifice resulted in the securing of the long-term future of the industry.  The management, especially the chairman, Mr. Pat Dineen, also played a major role in turning what had been an ailing industry into one that can thrive in the years ahead.  All these people must be congratulated for acting in a mature and courageous manner over the years when many saw closure as the only option.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a buyer such a ISPAT International has been found for Irish Steel.  The industry could only be secured by the take-over by such a significant player.  We are fortunate to be dealing with one of the major steel companies in the world.  It will not only stabilise the situation in Cobh but will help the firm to expand.  This is important because if jobs are to be maintained and if the company is to be developed it cannot be a question of standing still but of further investment, new initiatives, new markets and so on. I am confident that the investment by ISPAT International will ensure that the steel industry in Cobh and in Ireland goes from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Mulvihill's comments on the need to publish the task force report.  Irish Steel is of major importance to Cork and to Cobh. However, one industry cannot keep a town, a region or a province alive.  In conjunction with the development and expansion of the steel industry, there is a need for more infrastructure and development in the area to generate employment in east Cork.  I look forward to the early publication of the task force report and an early debate so that we can look at the different problems facing people in the area and consider how best to solve them.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recent decision by Eastman Kodak to invest in a factory in the Youghal area.  This is a significant <Col N="1927" /> development for the east Cork region.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to make more announcements regarding it over the next few months.  It will be important to build up a wide economic and industrial infrastructure in the region if we are to tackle its unemployment problem.  I commend the Minister for his efforts to date.</P>
    <P>A significant programme of job creation was recently announced for the dockyard, which may lead to approximately 120 new jobs for Cobh.  It is far short of what was promised by Deputy Reynolds when, allowing for the sale of the dockyard some years ago, he declared that at least 400 jobs would be created.  Regrettably his promises did not come to pass.  I hope that in today's more stable economic and political atmosphere more jobs and industries will be attracted to the Cobh area.</P>
    <P>The Bill has already been passed by the Seanad.  I hope it will become law in the near future.  We will then be able to proceed with the fomalities and ISPAT International will become a major industrial player in Cork.  The workers of Cobh have endured some dark days. I hope a new dawn approaches.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe characteristically ranged far and wide in his contribution.  He provided a historical gallop through the role of his party in terms of industrial development, mentioning the ESB, An Post, Telecom Éireann, the Irish Sugar Company, Bord na Móna and other flagship companies which his party was partly responsible for creating.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised some questions to which he is entitled to answers.  I also have some questions on this issue. Deputy O'Keeffe muddied the water by his begrudging attitude.  It appeared he was sorry it was not his party that was introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy did not offer an alternative approach.  I would be happy if somebody from the Fianna Fáil Party were to offer one.  There is no point in cursing the darkness, as the Deputy did, <Col N="1928" /> if one cannot produce a light.  I support the Bill because there is no alternative to it.</P>
    <P>All the companies cited by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe were good in their day. They were all built up behind tariff walls.  However, the world has changed and we must survive.  The ideology of Sinn Féin &mdash;&ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo;&mdash; was good at the time of independence, but it would not serve us well in the world today.  Sinn Féin would make a bad breakfast of this ideology now.  Politics must be relevant to the world as it is. Good intentions will not save companies, nor will they ensure their survival to compete internationally and guarantee jobs for their workers.</P>
    <P>Ideology, whether it be in respect of Sisn Féin, nationalims or socialism, must serve people, not the other way around. Deputy Ned O'Keefe's listing of companies as a kind of mantra will not save the jobs in them.</P>
    <P>There is a battle for survival here.  We are lucky we have got a partner as good as ISPAT International to take over this company.  A fly-by-night or flash in the pan company could not have been allowed to become involved, rather a company with a good track record in competence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister will doubtless deal <Col N="1929" /> with the questions raised by the Deputy. However, he has raised doubts which are not genuine and stirred up the waters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Our deliberations resulted in a change of heart on the part of both Labour Party and Conservative Party members.  We put our point of view that we were a small player in a big field.  It had not been mentioned that ours is a small steel industry.</P>
      <P>There are no guarantees.  Unless the company is viable it will not survive, regardless of its name.  The reality was the Government had one option &mdash; to negotiate the best possible agreement for our people which would ensure the survival of the plant and maintain as many jobs as possible, and also to ensure we had a steel industry in Ireland.  The company was taken over by the Government almost 50 years ago so that we would have our own steel making plant.  It was very laudable and commendable but that is not good enough unless the company can survive the harsh economic realities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke as if he were living in a world where reality does not matter and the issue was a simple black and white one.  It was a very complex situation and we are lucky we had the capacity and flexibility to do a deal, which has my best wishes.  I hope I will have a chance to reply to some of the points raised by the Deputy later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I was elected to this House in February 1982 I have participated in innumerable discussions on Irish Steel.  It was a crisis on each occasion.  Each Government since 1982 has worked to ensure that Irish Steel <Col N="1930" /> stayed in existence.  The position became effectively untenable in recent years and the whole question of its future came to the wire.  As we are all aware, something had to happen.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Industry and Commerce he saw that Irish Steel did not have a future as a semi-State body and he pursued strategic alliances with different companies around the world.  If he had continued in that post he would have negotiated a strategic alliance.  However, he became Minister for Finance and Deputy O'Malley took over as Minister for Industry and Commerce and scuttled everything.  As time went on, the losses increased.  When Deputy Quinn became Minister for Employment and Enterprise he had to face the problem. A viability plan was drawn up in 1994, which was met with trepidation by the workforce in Irish Steel because they felt it was not possible to reduce the workforce and continue in existence.</P>
      <P>During the crisis which followed in September 1994, it looked as if Irish Steel was going to be closed down.  I remember there was a meeting of the three unions involved and the question of whether they were going to vote for the plan rested on the payment of redundancies.  The clear message from the Minister for Employment and Enterprise, Deputy Quinn, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, was that redundancy payments would not be paid forthwith.  The word I got back from speaking to all the workers there was that if that was how it was going to be they were going to vote against the viability plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I met with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who assured me, as the shareholder in Irish Steel, that the redundancy payments would be made <Col N="1931" /> immediately.  That message went back to the workers and the plan was passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Quinn had been Minister for Finance at that time Irish Steel would have been closed down lock, stock and barrel.  It is lucky that did not happen because of the vital importance of Irish Steel to the Cobh region and the east Cork area in general. It is not only the 300 people working directly in the factory who are affected but also the 1,000 people supplying materials and services to Irish Steel.  It is vitally important for it to be kept in existence.</P>
      <P>I thank the unions for their very responsible approach to the problem. The workers showed a very responsible attitude as they realised they would have to make great sacrifices.  Some of them had to take redundancy and many others had to accept a complete change in their work practices and a reduction in wages.  They accepted all those changes in order to ensure Irish Steel would continue in existence.  All the political parties in the Cork area also approached the problem very responsibly. It was of great importance to the company to see such political cohesion in regard to the industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bradford made a slightly petty point in relation to Deputy Reynold's announcement about the Verolme Cork dockyard.  That must be put in context.  There was a completely different scenario at that stage in European history as the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain were still in existence.  Not long after Deputy Reynold's announcement, the Berlin Wall came down.  Shipyards throughout western Europe were devastated.</P>

Will the Taoiseach make available to the Opposition the latest consultation paper on the elections issued by the British Government and make every effort to ensure that as a matter of course the Opposition is given important public Government documents on the peace process?  I do not have great sympathy for the INLA or the activities engaged in by its political group, the IRSP.  Will the Taoiseach give his view on the British Government's decision to rule that party out of the 15 parties that may take part in the electoral process?  Does he consider that advisable given that the party is unlikely to secure a mandate based on the minimum figure set down?</P>

      <P>As I outlined to Deputy Harney, the detailed arrangements concerning discussions on the working operations of the forum, its relationship to the negotiations and the discussions about the electoral process were and continue to be handled by the Tánaiste in discussion with the Secretary of State.  That function is being pursued at that level.  The Deputy's two questions concerning the consultation paper and the position of the IRSP would be better addressed to the Tánaiste.  As Deputy Ahern raised them I will ask the Tánaiste to consider them and to get in touch with him.</P>

      <P>The detailed discussion on this matter has been delegated to the Tánaiste.  He is responsible for this area and represents us at Anglo-Irish conferences.  It is not my function, nor has it been one of previous Taoisigh, to represent the country at Anglo-Irish conferences.  If those questions had been tabled by the Deputy as ordinary questions, they would have been referred to the Tánaiste for answer.  It is better to deal with the matter in that way.  As I indicated to the Deputy, the Tánaiste is having a meeting with the Secretary of State this afternoon.  I will convey the Deputy's views to the Tánaiste and I hope a satisfactory communication will take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from the terms of reference of the Taoiseach's special adviser and programme manager published in a newspaper that extraordinary and unprecedented restrictions appear to have been placed on use of his diplomatic skills to try to move forward the peace process.  Those type of restrictions did not apply to his predecessor who dealt with Northern Ireland matters in the Taoiseach's office.  Why are those restrictions so rigorous?  Did the Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs insist on them?  It appears unhelpful to the Taoiseach that his programme manager should be prevented from doing a job which I am sure he is more than capable of doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks which I am sure Mr. Donlon will be pleased to hear.  The roles of the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs in these matters are well established by precedent which is being followed in this Administration, as it was in the past in terms of respective responsibilities.  My responsibility is to deal with other Governments at prime ministerial level.  That is necessary frequently in regard to Northern Ireland <Col N="1937" /> and I must engage in the necessary preparatory work to ensure that I can do that.  I have done that on every occasion with the full assistance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as did previous Taoisigh. However, day to day matters concerning Northern Ireland and representations about particular incidents, representation at Anglo-Irish conferences and the detailed working out of procedures in regard to, for example, the political track of the twin track process, are being pursued by the Tánaiste. There are well understood divisions of responsibility between those working in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Much as I would like to oblige the Deputy by answering questions about contracts and other matters, these questions are about a meeting of the churches and a summit meeting with the Prime Minister.  With due respect to the Chair, the Deputy's question is not entirely in order.</P>

      <P>I agree with what was said about the Taoiseach's programme manager.  He has enormous skills in this area and used them very effectively before for the benefit of this country, particularly in the United States.</P>

      <P>Yes, I agree and they should be used as fully as possible.  We are privileged that he has put his service at the disposal of the Government in regard to Northern Ireland.  In the context of the Taoiseach's meeting with the churches, did he raise the issue of the proposed marches which will begin in Northern Ireland next Monday?  Does he share my concern that if those marches are not rerouted and pass through areas where they are not wanted they will have a very damaging effect on the peace process at a sensitive time in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting with all the Churches took place on 23 February <Col N="1938" /> at which the main topics of discussion were the ceasefire and the broad political situation.  There was no substantive discussion of the question of marches, but there was one on the peace rallies, then current, and their implications.</P>
      <P>I endorse the point made by the Deputy that the marching season has much potential for bad and, regrettably, all too little for good as far as the peace process is concerned.  I urge all concerned, either in marching, observing marching or dealing with marches, to exercise the maximum degree of restraint and not feel that provocation, if offered, must be returned in kind. One must recognise that restraint should be exercised by all concerned and that this is a personal responsibility as well as a community responsibility.</P>
      <P>There is far too much triumphalism, which is out of date and inconsistent with the process of reconciliation.  I would like it to be removed from the demonstrations which have been dignified with the term &ldquo;tradition&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What efforts have the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made with the British authorities to do something about the matter?  Recently, I met the representatives of the residents of the Lower Ormeau Road where, beginning next week, there will be a number of marches each month until late October. They informed Fianna Fáil, and I am sure other parties in this House, that, despite the difficulties encountered last year, they have tried to enter into dialogue with the Secretary of State, the Northern Ireland Office and the RUC. Taken at face value, they seem to be peace loving.  They indicated that while they were representing the views of Catholics they share the attitude of Protestants in the area that they do not want these marches which are comprised mainly of outsiders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer they always receive is that this is a public order issue and that unless a riot or a march is prohibited or blocked by force nothing can be done. That seems to be extraordinary and could be seen as a statement inciting <Col N="1939" /> people to do so.  What is the Government doing to convince the Northern Ireland Office to change its attitude on this important matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware &mdash; I am sorry if I did not mention this in response to Deputy Harney &mdash; that in the past ten days to two weeks there has been a detailed discussion between the secretariat representing the Government and the Northern Ireland authorities on the question of marches covering such issues as who should take the decision to reroute a march, whether this is a police matter or whether wider political sensitivities need to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Government has urged the view that while the police force is to the forefront and has a major responsibility it should not have sole responsibility, that there are wider political implications, if matters go astray.  It has conveyed its views both in respect of flashpoints, such as the Garvaghy Road, and generally to the British authorities.  The issue is being pursued intensively.</P>
      <P>There was a formal discussion, I think in the past two weeks, of which I have read a report, but there are, probably, daily discussions between the secretariat and the Northern Ireland Office on matters which touch on this.  It is, as I said to Deputy Harney, a serious matter which is taken seriously by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the great majority of marches at this time of year are church parades which end up in churches.  On the next occasion the Taoiseach meets the Church authorities he should avail of the opportunity to say to them that they cannot wash their hands of a parade which ends up in a church, how it is conducted, where it goes, comes from and passes by.  If the authorities in each of the relevant Churches took a constructive view about basic Christian principles in the context of putting them into effect, there is little to be said for <Col N="1940" /> prayer in a church at the end of a parade which is the subject of deep division and inflammatory activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise that charity is the primary virtue to which expression is given by organised Christian religions and that activities which involve triumphalism do not constitute an expression of charity. The Deputy has done us a service by recalling the nature and origin of many of the parades which have as their ultimate destination a church and church service in the same way as traditional St. Patrick's Day parades and parades all over the world.  There is nothing exceptional about them, but it is important that the original Christian ethos, their declared purpose, should also be evident both in their planning and conduct and the way in which objections are dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that of the 2,500 marches which take place during the marching season across Northern Ireland &mdash; I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; approximately 30 cause problems?  The residents of the Lower Ormeau Road whom I met with my party leader indicated that a political decision is needed rather than a policing one.  Is the Taoiseach aware that when a political decision was made in the past by the Secretary of State to ban marches on either side of the political divide no problems were encountered?  However, if it is seen as a policing decision to be made within hours of the time of the march, tension is heightened within the areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a related matter, has the Government made any representations &mdash; I am aware the Taoiseach got into trouble when he delved into matters in the House of Commons &mdash; about the forthcoming legislation which will provide for the holding of elections and the establishment of the proposed forum to ensure that participation in the forum will not be seen as a condition in respect <Col N="1941" /> of the all-party talks due to begin on 10 June?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thesis advanced by the Deputy in the first part of his question on the need for political decisions as distinct from policing decisions and to take an overall view.  I have more or less said this in response to Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
      <P>I will not involve myself in any discussion of the assumptions upon which the second part of the Deputy's question was initially founded.  However, the Tánaiste is due to have a meeting this afternoon with the Secretary of State at which the matter raised by the Deputy will be discussed.  As he will recollect, I gave categoric assurances on the Government's position on this matter both to Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy Harney last week.</P>

It is almost in the category of: &ldquo;have you stopped beating your wife?&rdquo; I do not want to go into detail on the discussions we had, the <Col N="1942" /> main focus of which was not on the marches but on the talks process and their expectations of the results of that process.

Will he also join with me in expressing our gratitude for his wise, constructive and forward looking leadership on the peace process in matters of church and State, including education, and thank him for his deep commitment over 50 years to the Irish language?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>An action plan for the western region has been completed by the Western Development Partnership Board.  The objective of the plan is to achieve, by the end of the decade, population stability on a county by county basis at 1991 census levels.  The plan has already received initial consideration from Government Departments. Further detailed responses are being prepared and I expect to put a comprehensive response to the plan before Government shortly.  Following Cabinet approval, the plan will be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the population of the west has decreased by 200,000 in the past three decades and the Minister's commitment to stabilise <Col N="1946" /> the population at 1991 levels, has he plans to devolve a Government Department to the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Taoiseach.  It is my job to publish the plan and persuade the Cabinet to support the worthy measures in it.  The report published by the western bishops did not recommend that a Department be devolved to the west, it requested that a Minister or Minister of State be appointed with responsibility for co-ordinating development in the west, and my appointment has gone some way towards meeting that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the bishops may have their own view on stabilising the population. People are leaving the west each year because there are no job opportunities there.  Unless such opportunities are made available we will not be successful in stabilising the population.  As Minister with responsibility for the west does Deputy Carey not favour devolvement of power to the regions, particularly the west, and the transfer of a Government office from Dublin to the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I support that idea but there would be a problem persuading the people on this part of the island to agree to it.  Every time reference is made to transferring a Department to the west people in Dublin are critical of the idea.  We have taken our eye off the ball.  There are sufficient funds available through Departments to vastly improve development in the west and it is a matter of organising western groups and communities to get value for that money.</P>

Will the Minister guarantee that an equitable amount of State funding will be available for western development and that the present policy of concentrating major expenditure in urban areas will not continue? Has he made representations to the Minister for the Environment to ensure <Col N="1947" /> the money promised for the Mutton Island project will not be lost because of bad planning and arrogance on his part?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>That is far removed from the question I was asked.  I am aware that Deputy Ó Cuív has vast knowledge of western problems, but I do not have the detailed answer he requires on the Mutton Island project.

      <P>We all have a problem with the Minister for the west because when we get down to specific tasks he always says that another Department has responsibility, but the west is dealt with by all Departments. If a report on development of the west <Col N="1948" /> recommended reform of the social welfare code to enable small farmers and fishermen to develop their enterprises, would the Minister press his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, to make the necessary changes, which have been sought for years and which are necessary, as those of us involved in development of the west are aware?  Does the Minister consider it fair that 40 per cent of the money allocated to roads will be spent on 8 per cent of national roads in urban areas while only 60 per cent will be allocated to the remaining 92 per cent of roads in rural areas?  If he does not think that is a fair allocation what powers has he to ensure a more equitable distribution of funds?</P>

I have spoken to the Minister for Social Welfare about matters affecting agriculture and small holdings in the west and I am satisfied he is up-to-date on the problems in that area.  I said in this House previously that if Deputies have a reasonable solution to social welfare problems I would be glad to make representations to the Minister for Social Welfare on their behalf.  I will gladly assist Deputy Ó Cuív if he puts forward a reasonable proposal.</P>

      <P>The first point of contact with Government for each State company is through its parent Department and Minister.  Each Minister is responsible for the bodies under his/her aegis, and for ensuring the delivery of efficient, minimum cost services to the public.  Individual Ministers are also responsible for pursuing the commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the Government's programme A Government of Renewal in relation to using the expertise of State companies to develop new business opportunities, products and services which will lead to commercially sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister for Finance has general responsibilities for the semi-State sector as a whole in relation to issues such as public service pay, borrowings and related matters.  I have, of course, ongoing informal contacts with the chief executives of State companies in my work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Taoiseach's predecessors engaged in a practice from time to time whereby he would meet the chief executives of semi-State companies to discuss various employment aspects as well as their potential.  It could be argued whether that practice was successful but it was useful and, having attended a number of those meetings, I can honestly say there was a feeling that at least something was being done.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that such meetings are useful from an employment aspect &mdash; I am not really concerned with the remit of a particular Minister &mdash; because many chairmen and chief executives of semi-State companies do not keep in contact with the relevant Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The philosophy in regard to the best practice in the development of the State sector has changed since the time to which the Deputy is referring.  For example, in the immediate aftermath of the 1977 general election an instruction was given by the then Government to State companies to employ more people, almost regardless of whether there was work for them.  That type of centralised direction to State companies is entirely wrong.  State companies should be allowed to get on with the job.  They should act, as near as possible, in a similar way to commercial companies with their board of directors making the decisions with the chief executive with the minimum degree of ministerial interference and certainly without interference from the Taoiseach.  If I, with the approval of the Dáil, appoint a Minister in charge of a particular Department with responsibility for a particular group of State companies, I would much prefer to let him or her do the job and not to become involved myself.  While I appreciate the reasonable way in which Deputy Ahern is urging his case, I do not agree it would be a useful practice.  I am concerned that such meetings could easily degenerate into photo opportunities and that is not what we need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was actually talking about the 1987 period.  As a result of those meetings Teagasc, Coillte and the developmental aspects of the semi-State companies moved forward.  The Taoiseach may hold the view that these companies have reached their full potential but there was a move away from the time when they were seen merely as agencies.  The document on the jobs crisis published in 1986 by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions urged the semi-State companies to become developmental agencies and suggested the Taoiseach should play a role in moving that forward.  If the Taoiseach believes these companies are now commercially sensitive and that there are no further <Col N="1951" /> developmental aspects to be put forward, I will accept his view but much good came from those meetings which were rare but useful.</P>

      <P>The idea of having the Taoiseach meet the chairmen and chief executives of all the State companies would have two disadvantages.

The Taoiseach is the leader of the Government and the semi-State companies, whose competitiveness is crucial to job creation within those companies and, more importantly, to the maintenance of jobs in the private sector, which occupy the high ground of our economy.  Does he agree it would be a positive move if he were to meet the chairmen and chief executives of these companies on an infrequent but timely basis to discuss their future and to ensure they are working in tandem within the overall budgetary and economic framework the Government is operating?  These are not private companies. They occupy the high ground of our economy in terms of energy, telecommunications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The State bodies were established by statute precisely so that they would not be the subject of day-to-day parliamentary questions.  That is why they were established as semi-State bodies most of which were set up by the Deputy's party.  I presume he understands the philosophy underlying this separation of State bodies, because of their commercial remit, from day-to-day supervision of the Dáil.  A Government of which I was a member in the 1970s established a Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored bodies which continues to do its work.  To my mind that body strikes the right balance between accountability and commercial freedom.  I see no need to change the arrangements in regard to that matter.</P>

    <P>This Minister of State does not have a private or constituency office based in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that with the extra Minister of <Col N="1958" /> State and the extra advisers and programme managers the whole State apparatus is top heavy with all these political appointments?  Has the Taoiseach any plans to reduce or streamline it because it is seen as a totally cynical exercise regardless of whether he accepts it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree with the Deputy.  If one looks historically over the past 30 year period at the rate of growth in other categories of State employment and the rate of growth in the political category one will find that the rate of growth in almost every other category of State employment has been faster and more considerable than the rate of growth in the political category of employment.  I further take the view that if there is to be accountability &mdash; and this is a matter to which Deputies refer frequently here &mdash; there must be people in the political area, either Ministers, Ministers of State or programme managers, who are in a position to ask the appropriate questions and to prepare the appropriate answers for Ministers to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of political input to Government is about right at this time.  I would not favour any increase in the present level of employment of Ministers' advisers or programme managers.  It is not unusual when one looks at administrations on the continent.  The Cabinet system which we have here has operated well in those countries for years.  As one who was a critic of the programme manager system when it was first introduced I have found it works extremely well in ensuring that papers are well prepared for Government, that matters of dispute or argument between Ministers are, to the maximum degree possible, settled before it goes to Cabinet and that the Cabinet discussions are not taken up with arguments about facts.  The facts have been settled beforehand by appropriate advisers or programme managers and the Cabinet is able to concentrate efficiently on taking the relevant political decisions promptly.  The system of <Col N="1959" /> programme managers and special advisers, which existed under the previous administration and which I criticised at the time, has proved to be a very good one.  I would not favour any further increase in the employment of them.</P>
    <P>So far as the Ministers of State are concerned, Minister of State, Deputy Carey, is a good example of somebody who is doing a very relevant job.  He would not be doing it had we not increased the number of Ministers of State to allow him to be appointed.  His role as Minister of State with responsibility for western development, the Border areas and offshore islands has delivered specific measurable improvements since his appointment.  That is something the House might reflect on as indicating the value of the much criticised decision to appoint two extra Ministers of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the Taoiseach's praise for the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, in one respect at least. Of the three Ministers of State at the Department of the Taoiseach he runs the neatest ship and has the smallest expenditure.  On the size of delegations that go abroad with Ministers of State from the Taoiseach's office, a huge number of people travel on these occasions.  Is this a practical implementation of the principle the Taoiseach has just enunciated of maximum delegation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking the delegations going with Ministers of State are small.  To my knowledge there are not any particularly large delegations going abroad with Ministers of State but there may be some examples of it.  It is desirable to reduce the size of <Col N="1960" /> official delegations going abroad.  There is a tendency to require internal representation, in terms of various Departments all having to be on a delegation, when in fact the information could be more readily pooled and a relatively smaller group could do the job.  It is necessary for someone in my position to keep an eye on this matter.  Sometimes delegations will be over-large due to lack of vigilance but I would like to ensure that delegations are as small as efficiently prudent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to probably his most loyal colleague in glowing terms on the excellent work he is doing and would like to see that loyalty reciprocated.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that having set out the importance of the job being done by the Minister of State that were he to be appointed as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, maybe there would have been no need for that job in the first place?</P>

I understand Deputies are only allowed about £2,000 for phone calls.  Has the Taoiseach any plans for the designation of the whole country as a local area? This would be helpful to people in the offshore islands and in the west for whom the cost of trunk calls is exorbitant. It would be helpful to the Minister of State if the country could be so designated.</P>

      <Quest>the current status of discussions regarding the EU Poverty 4 programme; the plans, if any, he has to meet with EU Social Affairs Ministers during the Italian Presidency of the EU to discuss the major poverty programme; and the further plans, if any, he has to achieve the commencement of the Poverty 4 programme prior to, or during, the forthcoming Irish Presidency.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the proposed Poverty 4 programme remains largely unchanged since my reply to the Deputy's previous question on 23 January 1996, question No. 22, reported at columns 262 to 265 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The present position is that, while technically still blocked at Council, the Poverty 4 programme is effectively dead, politically, with little if any prospect of resurrection.  Unanimous support for the programme simply does not exist and, as matters stand, there is no reasonable prospect of progress being made on this issue.  The German and UK Governments have, as the Deputy knows, objected to the programme and have maintained this objection.</P>
      <P>All efforts by other member states, including personal interventions by me on behalf of the Irish Government, together with the best efforts of the Commission, have not succeeded in changing their opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now a question of new approaches being developed, approaches which we can push for, but which can become a reality without the unanimous support <Col N="1962" /> of the other EU Social Affairs Ministers being obtained.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Social Affairs Council last Friday, I indicated the need for action in relation to social exclusion both at national and EU level and indicated that it is an issue I intend raising during Ireland's Presidency later this year.  I was supported by a number of other Ministers at the meeting on the need to find ways of ensuring that social exclusion remains a central concern of EU policy and programmes.</P>
    <P>At the same meeting, in responding to the presentations by Ministers on the preparation of a communication from the Commission in relation to social protection.  Commissioner Flynn indicated that he would be giving consideration to upgrading the social exclusion element of that document.  Thus, I have placed on the record with the other Ministers in Europe, my intention of raising the issue of social exclusion during Ireland's Presidency.</P>
    <P>In relation to other specific measures to be taken during Ireland's Presidency, I will seek to further the debate regarding social exclusion through discussion wherever possible, including at such conferences as the New Directions in Social Welfare Conference which will take place in Dublin Castle in November.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that the EU Commission launched, during the final months of 1995, a European Funding Initiative for Projects seeking to overcome Social Exclusion.  Under the programme, groups were offered once-off grants in support of innovative projects against social exclusion.  Invitations to apply for funding were sent directly from the Commission to interested groups.  I understand that a total of nine Irish projects have now received funding under this initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's defeatist attitude is disappointing.  I have tabled many Dáil questions on this matter in <Col N="1963" /> an effort to get him to make a comprehensive case for us under the Poverty 4 programme, valued at approximately £100 million with some £10 million earmarked for Ireland.  Under previous programmes, particularly Poverty 3, a number of exciting and worthwhile projects were developed.  I impressed on the Minister the importance of holding bilateral meetings with his colleagues, particularly the German and UK Ministers with responsibility for social welfare matters.  Will he hold such meetings during our Presidency?  Surely on a matter of such importance it would be worthwhile for him to travel to the capitals concerned and negotiate professionally with his colleagues on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong to imply that I have adopted a defeatist attitude on this matter.  The Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and I made strenuous efforts last year to unblock the Poverty 4 programme at Council level and to seek to overcome the German and British objections.  The German Government has two basic and fundamental objections.  It objects to money being spent on a further pilot poverty project and argues that, constitutionally, the Poverty 4 programme is outside the remit and competence of the European Union.  Germany considers that Article 235 of the Treaty cannot be used to spend money on a programme of action to alleviate poverty which, under the principle of subsidiarity, is regarded as a matter for national governments.  There is no question of the Government having a defeatist attitude on this issue.  Despite the many steps taken to overcome the objections to the programme, that has not proved possible.  We should now seek other ways to ensure that the European Union accepts responsibility for dealing with poverty in Europe, including Ireland.  The extent of its responsibility will depend on our success in convincing <Col N="1964" /> those who currently object to the Poverty 4 Programme that the European Unions has a responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>I intend to have the matter discussed during the Irish Presidency.  I have the support of Commissioner Flynn and Stephen Hughes, the chairperson of the European Parliament's Social Affairs Committee, both of whom I met last week in Brussels, in seeking to put this matter firmly on the agenda.  Many members of the Social Affairs Council supported me when I raised the matter at meetings.  I also received the support of the high level technical group &mdash; on which my Department is represented &mdash; which the Commission established to examine the question of social exclusion directly as a result of proposals I made at Council meetings.  The only two member states opposed to putting poverty on the agenda as a European Union issue are the British and German Governments.  As our diplomatic and negotiating efforts failed to overcome those objections, it makes sense to find another way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to bring his colleagues to the parts of Dublin city where there is abject poverty and people living in despair?  Perhaps such a visit would be helpful in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My British and German colleagues &mdash; to whom I presume the Deputy is referring &mdash; are well aware of the poverty that exists in Europe.  Approximately 52 million Europeans are judged to be living below the poverty line.  They are aware of the statistics and of the problems that exist in their countries.  Unemployment in Germany is at a level which it has not experienced since the end of the Second World War.  It is not a question of them not recognising the problem; they object to the European Union having a direct role in dealing with it.  The British objection relates primarily to the expenditure of the money.  Late last year Commissioner Flynn introduced an initiative which has resulted in nine projects in <Col N="1965" /> Ireland dealing with social exclusion receiving money.  It is important to remember that while we have not been able to overcome the objections of the German and British Governments about the Poverty 4 Programme we have ensured that the question of poverty in Europe is maintained on the agenda and that action is taken.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to remedy the inflexible eligibility requirements which result in many tens of thousands of self-employed people being excluded from qualifying for State old age contributory pensions.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7199/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the situation of a self employed contributor who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who was then over 56 years of age.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least 10 years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self employed people, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course, covered for survivor's and orphan's pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with <Col N="1966" /> insurance as a self &mdash; employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period. Allowing self employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years' contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self &mdash; employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributors of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; puts forward, <i>inter alia,</i> a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.  However, it also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156 for three years to 520 for ten years contributions.  The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present.</P>
    <P>While I favour, in principle, a <i>pro-rata</i><Col N="1967" /> pensions approach, I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

      <P>The Government approved last month my proposals in relation to the recommendations of the Task Force on Security for the Elderly and work is already under way in implementing the recommendations.  The extension of the income tax relief to persons who install security systems in the homes of their elderly relatives living alone is provided for in the recently published Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £2 million has been made available to provide funding for voluntary and community organisations in respect of initiatives relating to the security of the elderly.  The Department is in the process of establishing an advisory committee to advise on the administration of a grant scheme, including drafting guidelines.  I hope to be in a position shortly to announce details of this scheme, which will be advertised in the news media.  Application forms and further details will be available shortly from the Department's regional offices. I understand that six applications have <Col N="1968" /> already been received from local voluntary organisations for funding.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been held with Telecom Éireann, which has agreed, to reduce the cost of telephone installations from £145 to £75 for a period of six months for elderly pensioners in receipt of a living alone allowance from the Department.  These pensioners will not have to pay the normal telephone rental as this will be covered under the free telephone rental allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Statutory agencies and voluntary and community groups were specifically asked to consider developing projects for improving security for the elderly which could be undertaken as part of this year's student summer jobs scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendations concerning the provision of better information and advice to elderly persons on how to improve personal security both inside and outside their homes, this matter is being pursued by my Department in conjunction with the Garda and the Department of Justice.  The other recommendations of the task force are being pursued by the relevant agency and Government Departments.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think that this scheme should be taken seriously?  Would it not have been better to provide grant aid for security systems rather than a tax free allowance for which many pensioners do not qualify as they do not come within the tax system?  Does the Minister believe this scheme, which was initially put forward as a stand alone scheme, warranted the spin put on it at the time and that six applications is an adequate response to it?</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be confusing two issues.  The proposal announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day gave a tax free allowance to elderly people living alone.  He said he expected this scheme to cost approximately £1.5 million.  The tax force report recommended that the scheme should be extended so that the relatives of elderly people living alone who do not <Col N="1969" /> have a tax liability could avail of the tax allowance and thereby assist their elderly relatives.  The extension of the scheme and the expected increase in the number of elderly people living on their own who will avail of it will cost approximately £5 million in the 1996-97 tax year.</P>
      <P>The task force also recommended that a grant scheme should be put in place and I have got Government agreement to allocate £2 million to this scheme.  We are currently consulting voluntary organisations on the guidelines for the grant scheme, for which six applications have been received.  These applications have been submitted even though application forms and guidelines have not yet been published.  I am not in a position to indicate the number of inquiries made or applications received by the Department of Finance in regard to the tax allowance arrangement and I presume that information will become available only after the implementation date of 6 April.  The task force was set up in late January.  It met for the first time on 2 February.  It had its report and recommendations concluded within four weeks, and I had a Government decision on those recommendations within a further week.  I imagine this has probably been the fastest ever task force and I congratulate all of the people who participated in it.</P>
      <P>The period between now and winter is a window of opportunity for us to take up on the tax allowance, to get a take-up of the grants on offer, and to encourage the 23,000 people who are living alone who are entitled to a free telephone allowance and who are not connected for one reason or another to avail of the special cheap rate that Telecom Éireann is offering for connection. It is a worthwhile report and I am sure it has already done much to reassure the elderly in urban and rural areas who feel at risk as a result of not having some form of security alarm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is that the initial scheme giving an £800 tax free allowance turned out to be <Col N="1970" /> a bit of a joke.  Allocating grants is a far better option, particularly for pensioners and people living alone.  I would welcome it if such people were able to link up to the system operated by Telecom Phonewatch or a similar system. The Minister must agree that the initial tax free allowance was basically a joke.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  The Minister for Finance introduced an important tax allowance for elderly people living alone.  At the time there was much newspaper hysteria about attacks on the elderly.  The Minister was seeking to reassure the elderly that the Government was concerned about their safety. When the task force looked at the issue &mdash; the Department of Finance had a representative on the task force &mdash; it came up with a recommendation that that allowance be extended to include relatives who might be able to avail of it.  It makes sense to take that approach because it will enable the £2 million worth of grants to be spread much more widely among people who do not have a tax allowance and whose relatives are not in a position to provide for them.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare expenditure <Col N="1971" /> in 1995 amounted to £4.2 billion.  Savings attributed to the various control activities undertaken by my Department were some £124.5 million of which £11.6 million is identifiable as fraud.</P>
      <P>The overall cost of the various control measures in 1995 amounted to some £8 million, including salaries, overtime, travel and subsistence costs.</P>
      <P>The detection of fraud and abuse of social welfare payments is an integral part of the day to day work of my Department, which has a programme of ongoing specialist control activities under way as part of its drive against fraud, abuse and unwarranted recourse to social welfare.  There are some 570 staff whose work at local, regional and national level is either entirely or partly related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>These units, one of which works in conjunction with staff of the Revenue Commissioners, carry out inspections of employers, investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare payments, review customers' means for assistance payments and monitor their on-going entitlements to social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>A total of 60 social welfare prosecutions were finalised by the courts in 1995.  Of these, 35 were people who fraudulently obtained payments, while 25 were employers.  Convictions were obtained in 54 cases &mdash; 30 claimants and 24 employers.</P>
      <P>The value of the overpayments involved in the cases prosecuted amounted to £121,298, while employers were prosecuted for failure to remit PRSI amounting to £62,486.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 22 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A weekly payment of £5 is made to eligible households for 26 weeks of each year.  An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 is paid to qualified householders in Dublin and Cork cities and adjacent areas where a ban on the sale of bituminous coal applies.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment has responsibility for air quality and deciding where a ban on bituminous coal should apply.  Neither a review of the urban air quality by that Department or the Environmental Protection Agency's review of national air quality generally, have revealed recent excesses of statutory air quality standards.  The Department of the Environment has no immediate plans to extend the ban on bituminous coal and consequently I have no plans to extend the smokeless fuel allowance to areas where the ban does not presently apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of extending the fuel scheme over the full year even at the reduced rate of £3 per week would be in the region of £58 million.  The cost of increasing the smokeless fuel allowance by £1 per week would be approximately £2.4 million.  Any extension to the rate of the smokeless fuel allowance or to the duration of the national fuel scheme would have cost implications and could <Col N="1973" /> only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>
    <P>Last year I increased the income limit for the national fuel scheme from £5 to £10 per week.  In this year's budget I announced a further £5 increase in the income limit which will take effect from October 1996.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum contributory pension rate or savings-investments of £8,000 and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 20 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme was a major success last year and has proved to be of significant benefit both to the local communities and to the students themselves.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the scheme which was introduced in 1993, is to provide an alternative source of income for the less well off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify for the scheme, third level students must also satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to <Col N="1974" /> that which is applied for entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Students who retain a right to unemployment assistance during the summer period, such as mature students and those PLC students who have completed their courses, are not deprived of income and are not therefore eligible for the students' summer job scheme.</P>
    <P>Many complimentary letters were received praising both the scheme and the quality of work carried out by the students.  Just under 19,000 students were approved to work under the 1995 scheme and over 15,800 worked.  The focus of the scheme is on the less well off students and therefore I do not intend to alter the requirement that they satisfy a means test as the levels of participation do not justify such a change. Some 84 per cent of the students who applied for the 1995 scheme were approved to participate.  Post leaving certificate (PLC) students are, in general, not eligible for the scheme as the vast majority of them will have their courses completed this summer and are entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer period if they fail to obtain employment.  However, a small proportion of PLC students may be disqualified from unemployment assistance.  These are students who have not completed their courses and it is not my intention that any of these who satisfy the normal means test would be excluded from this year's scheme.  On the basis of available information, it is estimated that a few hundred PLC students will participate in the 1996 scheme.  Over 3,330 sponsors registered in last year's scheme offering 21,761 jobs which covered a huge range of activities.  A mailshot inviting applications has recently been issued to these sponsors and it is expected that the jobs available this year will be broadly similar to the wide range of opportunities offered in previous years.</P>

      <P>The task force on long-term unemployment noted in its final report the need for the various positive discrimination measures for employers, employees and the self-employed to be streamlined to ensure that they complement one another effectively.  It recommended that the range of measures be further examined when the evaluation of the back to work allowance and the area allowance scheme had been completed and the report of the expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems became available.  It also noted that the interdepartmental strategy group on employment and unemployment would provide an appropriate forum to address those issues.</P>
      <P>The independent evaluation of the back to work allowance which has recently been completed is now being examined in the Department.  I understand that the evaluation of the area allowance scheme will be completed by the middle of the year.  The final report of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare will also be finalised by the middle of the year.  The examination recommended by the task force can then be undertaken in the light of the findings contained in those reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms, the thrust of the recommendations of the task force on long-term unemployment is to provide opportunities for the long-term unemployed to get back into employment.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that the Social Welfare Bill, 1996 gives <Col N="1976" /> effect to a number of pro-employment measures which were announced in the budget earlier this year and which are designed to provide incentives to the unemployed, and particularly the long-term unemployed, to re-enter the labour force.</P>
    <P>Amongst the measures provided for in the 1996 budget are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;an increase in the PRSI-free allowance from £50 per week to £80 per week together with reductions in the employer PRSI rates from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent in the case of the lower incentive rate and from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent in the case of the main rate;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an increase of £10 in the income limits applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, which will mean that most current recipients will get an increase of £6 a week;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continued payment of increases for dependent children for up to 13 weeks to people in receipt of such increases at the full rate who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the reform of unemployment assistance which is designed to simplify the arrangements for claiming unemployment assistance and to make it more attractive for recipients to take up part-time or casual work opportunities;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an increase of 5,000 in the number of back to work allowances from 10,000 to 15,000 places during 1996 &mdash; at present over 11,000 are in payment.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures, allied to the range of other pro-employment measures announced in the budget, will prove to be effective in tackling the long-standing problem of long-term unemployment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 25, 27 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on means testing.  The number of means tests which exist at present is a matter of serious concern, both from the point of view of the inconvenience to claimants and of efficiency.  This has been an issue for successive Ministers for Social Welfare but only a limited amount of progress has been made in simplifying the present arrangements.</P>
      <P>Means testing criteria are broadly similar for all social assistance schemes but there are significant variations in the manner in which some of the components are assessed.  These relate mainly to the treatment of capital and of income from employment where different levels of disregards and rates of assessment are applied across the various schemes.</P>
      <P>I intend, over time, to standardise the method of assessing capital across the various social assistance schemes so as to improve the equality of the system.  I have commenced this process in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996 which provides for a new method of assessing capital in the case of the new disability allowance and the new one-parent family payment. The Bill provides that the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000 will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to extend these provisions to all other social assistance schemes over time.  In view of the large number of cases involved, this will have <Col N="1979" /> significant administrative implications and can only be achieved on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>A number of issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General such as sharing of information and the possible establishment of a single means testing agency will require interdepartmental discussion.  These issues are already being examined by an interdepartmental working group on an integrated social service system.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the matters raised in the report under review to see what further progress can be made in this area during the coming year.</P>

      <P>The urban school meals scheme allows county borough councils, urban district councils, and town commissioners to provide school meals free of charge, if they are satisfied that any of the children attending a national school are unable, due to lack of food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them.</P>
      <P>Where school meals are provided on this basis the local authority must have ascertained that funds other than public funds are not available, or are insufficient, to defray the cost of food provided.</P>
      <P>Local authorities must seek my approval to provide school meals free of charge.  Once such authority is received, the local authority may recoup 50 per cent of their expenditure on the provision of meals for eligible children from my Department.  The remaining 50 per cent of expenditure, along with any administration costs, are met by the local authority.</P>

    <P>In 1995, my Department paid out <Col N="1980" /> £733,263 to local authorities as part of the school meals scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 43 together.  The expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was established in July 1993 by the former Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  The terms of reference of the group are:</P>
      <P>To identify the problems arising from the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and to identify the steps necessary to achieve greater co-ordination/integration of the two systems, with particular attention to the impact on people's incomes, and to the tax code, social welfare system, budgetary and administrative implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group was asked to furnish an interim report on measures which could be undertaken in the 1994 budget to reduce poverty traps and increase incentives to work.  They presented this report in late 1993.  In this interim report, the working group made two specific recommendations for the 1994 budget.  These were the easing of the means test for lone parents allowance in order to make it more attractive for lone parents to take up work, and abolition of the arrangement whereby employers of medical card holders had <Col N="1981" /> to pay the health contribution and employment and training levy on behalf of these employees.  Both of these recommendations were acted on in the 1994 budget.</P>
    <P>The group also submitted proposals for this year's budget.  These included the retention of child dependent allowances for up to thirteen weeks when an unemployed person takes up employment, the retention of the medical card on taking up employment, and simplification of the means test for casual workers on unemployment assistance. These measures were included in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>The group is now completing its final report, and I understand that this report is likely to be finished shortly.  When I receive the report, I will then consider the best way of making further progress on integration of the tax and social welfare systems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>At the end of December, 1995 a total of 7,189 people were in receipt of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the scheme has come <Col N="1982" /> in for much criticism since it was introduced in 1990 mainly due to the operation of the means test.  Nonetheless, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years. For example, in 1995 the weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse was increased to £150 a week and the scheme was further expanded with the inclusion of carers who look after the recipients of occupational pensions.  In last January's budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 which is an 8 per cent increase on the current rate.</P>
    <P>The question of the further development of the carer's allowance, is currently being examined in conjunction with the Department of Health in the wider context of health care provision generally in the home.  Any proposals arising from that review would, of course, also have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Since May 1993, the Department has been offering a facility to contributory old age pension and retirement pension clients to have their pension payments credited directly into their bank, building society or post office accounts.  This alternative to the pension book method of payment is offered on an optional basis.  It is part of an ongoing departmental programme to improve service to the public and to introduce additional convenient payment options for social welfare customers.</P>
      <P>This electronic funds transfer facility has now been extended to recipients of old age non-contributory pensions with effect from 29 March 1996.  All new applicants for pension are offered this payment option.  Any existing pensioners who wish to transfer to this payment method will be facilitated.</P>
      <P>Pensioners also have an option to appoint an agent, either on a temporary or permanent basis, to encash their pension for them at their normal post office. Any pensioner wishing to appoint an agent for this purpose should contact the Department in advance in order to make the appropriate arrangements.</P>
      <P>In addition, pension payable orders remain valid for up to three months after the due encashment date.  This provides some flexibility without any payment loss, to pensioners who are unable to encash their pension at their post office in any particular week.</P>

      <P>Section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as substituted by paragraph three of the Sixth Schedule to the Act, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement, including rent and mortgage interest supplements, in the case of a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The legislation also enables the Minister to make regulations prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which a supplement may be paid, the class or classes of persons to whom a supplement may be paid and the amount of supplement that may be paid, and this has been done in S.I. 382 of 1995.  The legislative provisions of the S.I. commenced in January 1996.  Prior to that, the same principles applied to applications for such supplements but on an administrative basis in the form of guidance and direction issued under section 175 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The provisional outturn for expenditure on rent and mortgage interest supplements for 1995 is £64.5 million, of which £54.7 million is in respect of rent supplements and £9.8 million is in respect of mortgage interest supplements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to school clothing and foot-war scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health <Col N="1985" /> boards, is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
    <P>For the 1996 scheme, I have increased the rates of allowance from £40 to £43 for a child between the ages of two and 11 inclusive on 1 October 1996 and from £55 to £58 for a child between the ages of 12 and 21 inclusive on 1 October 1996.  It is expected that some 280,000 pupils will benefit under the scheme this year at a cost of approximately £13.8 million.  I have also extended the scheme to recipients of unemployability supplement who satisfy the means assessment.  The scheme opens for applications in all health boards from 1 June each year.  This is to allow adequate time to process the large number of applications expected.</P>
    <P>My Department's annual circular to health boards on the operation of the 1995 scheme, requested boards to ensure that the majority of payments were made by 31 July 1995 to enable parents to make the necessary purchases in the traditional back to school shopping month of August.  The health boards have advised that the scheme operated satisfactorily in all boards in 1995 with the vast majority of families throughout the country receiving their payments in good time to make provision for their children's needs.</P>
    <P>As the purpose of the scheme is to assist with the clothing needs of schoolchildren in the forthcoming school year, a balance needs to be struck between paying the allowance too early or too late.  I believe the present arrangements are satisfactory and I have no plans to advise health boards to make earlier payments.  This year's scheme circular will issue to health boards in the coming weeks to ensure the health boards can make the necessary arrangements to make the majority of payments by the end of July 1995.  I would urge parents to assist the boards by making applications as early as possible once the scheme commences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will know, the Social Welfare Bill which was passed recently in the House provides the legislative basis for the transfer of responsibility for the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from health boards to my Department. The transfer of the scheme is a major undertaking and it is my intention that the transfer will take place in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Bill the scheme will in future be known as disability allowance.  The Bill also contains provision for a number of important improvements in the conditions of the scheme.  It is my intention to carry out a review of the scheme following the transfer and taking account of any recommendations emerging from the work of the Commission of the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
      <P>The administration of the new scheme by my Department will have cost and staffing implications.  These have not been finally determined but are under discussion with staff interests at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as meeting my primary objective of providing greater consistency in the operation of the scheme and a better service to the people concerned, the transfer of the scheme and its administration by a single Department will enable us to achieve additional <Col N="1987" /> efficiencies in the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the context of the transfer process consultations have taken place with organisations representing people with disabilities.  The response from the organisations has been very positive and I hope to be able to avail further of their advice and assistance in ensuring a smooth transfer of the scheme.  I will also be consulting with the organisations concerned in relation to future developments in the scheme.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations UK nationals may qualify for Irish social insurance benefits on their UK national insurance provided they satisfy the statutory conditions for entitlement.  In the case of unemployment benefit it would be necessary, as a first step, for the person to become insured in Ireland and to have paid at least one PRSI contribution.</P>
      <P>Under Irish social welfare legislation, they may also claim social assistance payments such as unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance on the same basis as Irish nationals provided they satisfy the same statutory conditions.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, if British nationals in Ireland claim unemployment assistance, their entitlement will be determined having regard to whether or not they are capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work and to the amount of means assessed.  A disqualification from receipt of social security benefits in the United Kingdom would not, <i>per se,</i> preclude entitlement to unemployment assistance in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The two budgets introduced by this Government have been imaginative, reforming and balanced.  In the area of social welfare policy, as in all other areas, they have reflected the principles set out in the Programme for a Government of Renewal agreed between the three Government partners.</P>
      <P>No Minister for Social Welfare is able to do all he or she would wish to do. Prudent and effective management of the national finances is essential to ensuring that we can maintain a vibrant growing economy, with a stable currency, low interest and inflation rates, and a capacity to generate new and sustainable employment.  This Government has demonstrated its commitment to keeping expenditure under control while providing additional resources to raise the standard of living of those living on low incomes.</P>
      <P>This is demonstrated, in the 1995 and 1996 budgets with a strong commitment to rewarding work, promoting enterprise and, notably, to strengthening social solidarity, in the interests of all our citizens.  The 1995 budget provided for the largest ever shift of resources to the social welfare area amounting to £212 million in a full year. The additional resources provided for social welfare improvements in the 1996 budget amount to some £160 million in a full year.  That adds up to £372 million in two years.</P>

      <P>My Department contacted the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in relation to the points raised by Deputy Bell in the House on 22 February last regarding the question of solicitors charging fees in addition to the legal costs they are entitled to recover against the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief State Solicitor's office has advised that the costs which solicitors are entitled to recover from my Department are those which are known as party and party costs.  In addition, there may be separate solicitor and client costs which are directed at the client. Where a solicitor presents such a client bill of costs, the client can refer the matter for taxation by signing a requisition to tax, which the solicitor lodges in the Taxing Master's Court with a copy of the solicitor client bill of costs.  When taxing the solicitor client bill of costs, the Taxing Master takes into account the amount agreed or taxed in the party and party bill of costs.  As these costs are entirely a matter between the solicitor and the client, neither my Department nor the Chief State Solicitor's office are <Col N="1990" /> informed of whether such costs are being charged in individual cases. Women who approach my Department regarding solicitor client costs are being advised of their right to have such costs adjudicated by the Taxing Master. Where any woman is of the opinion that she has been overcharged by her solicitor, she can also make a complaint to the Law Society which will investigate the complaint in accordance with the provisions of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>

    <P>Grants and payments totalling, approximately, £706,872 for 1994 and £585,880 for 1995 were made to the north-eastern and north-western (social welfare) regions, which approximate to the Border counties.  A sum of £110,000 of the 1994 figure was to fund respite care services.  This scheme was transferred to the Department of Health in <Col N="1991" /> 1995 and therefore does not appear in the 1995 total.  It is anticipated that expenditure under these grant schemes will be approximately £800,000 in 1996.</P>

      <P>The strength and integrity of the PRSI system depends on the appropriate contributions being paid to the social insurance fund on time by employers, employees and the self employed as laid down in social welfare legislation.  Contributions due to the social insurance fund are collected in the main by the Revenue Commissioners, together with income tax due.</P>
      <P>PRSI is an important part of our social welfare system.  It provides a range of benefits to employees and their dependants and to self employed contributors at certain specified times in their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department makes a determined effort to detect employers who fail to honour their obligations under the PRSI system.  This effort is undertaken to ensure that all employers comply with their PRSI obligations and to prevent people in employment from fraudulently claiming social welfare payments. A programme of employer inspections is carried out each year bringing the total number of employers visited to 56,500 in the five year period to the end of 1995.  A total of £75 million in unpaid PAYE-PRSI has been detected as a result of these inspections.  The programme of inspections includes a number of revisits to employers to ensure that they continue to comply with their legal obligations.  All indicators show that there is now an increased level of <Col N="1992" /> employer awareness of, and compliance with, PRSI legislation.</P>
    <P>As part of the programme of employer inspections 48 of my inspectors form part of a nation-wide joint inspection unit with inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners.  This unit uses the combined legal powers and expertise of both organisations to tackle abuses in both the social welfare and tax systems.  Special units have also been set up to focus on specific industrial sectors.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department also now employs professional accountants who are available to assist in the inspection of larger companies.  The approach taken by these inspections is to investigate the main employer and any other company which has a relationship with that employer such as subsidiaries and those providing ancillary services.</P>
    <P>Information technology now plays a key role in targeting employers for inspection.  Investigators use laptop computers to get immediate access to data held on central databases during the course of inspections.  In addition, through analysis of data held on the Department's central records database employers are selected for inspection.</P>
    <P>The Department's administrative and legislative procedures are continually reviewed and updated and all necessary measures taken to detect employers who fail to comply with their PRSI obligations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 82 together.  Death grant is a social insurance benefit which is payable, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or of their spouse or child under 18.  The amount of the grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the grant, which was introduced with effect from 1 October 1970, was to help with funeral and other post-bereavement costs.  While I accept that the value of the grant has fallen having regard to average funeral costs, there are other measures in place which are designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement.</P>
      <P>For example, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for six weeks.  In addition, payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
      <P>The rate of death grant is reviewed in the context of the budget each year in common with all other social welfare rates of payment.  I am currently reviewing the present arrangements with a view to developing improved provision for income support for bereaved persons generally.</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions certain social insurance benefits are taken into account in assessing damages in personal injuries actions.  Section 75 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) <Col N="1994" /> Act, 1993 provides that disablement benefit or injury benefit payable in the five year period from the date of accrual of the cause of the action, be taken into account in assessing such damages.</P>
      <P>Section 237 of the 1993 Act contains a similar provision in respect of disability benefit and invalidity pension.  These arrangements are designed to ensure that people are not compensated twice for loss or earnings.</P>
      <P>People who are involved in accidents and who have no entitlement to social welfare benefits can claim supplementary welfare allowance while they are unfit for work and pursing compensation claims.  There are no provisions in legislation which would allow supplementary welfare allowance paid in these circumstances to be taken into account in assessing compensation.  In 1990, an interministerial study group on the question of reducing the costs of motor insurance concluded that changing the present arrangements to enable social welfare payments to be recovered from awards would increase insurance costs which would be likely to be passed on to the public.  In addition, it was considered that the savings achieved by recovering the cost of any pension or assistance paid whilst awaiting the award of compensation could be outweighed by the cost of recovery from individual clients.</P>
      <P>From the data available from the CARA statistical system in respect of seven health boards, it is estimated that approximately £0.5 million in basic payments of SWA was paid out to some 550 clients awaiting the outcome of their compensation claims in 1994.  In 1995 approximately £0.37 million was paid in basic payments to some 480 clients. Additional amounts would arise in other SWA payments, especially rent and mortgage supplements.</P>

      <P>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant has an entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance (SWA).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Executive functions in relation to the administration of the SWA scheme lie with the chief executive officers of the eight regional health boards.

    <P>Section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as substituted by paragraph 3 of the sixth Schedule to the Act, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement, including rent and mortgage interest supplements, in the case of a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The legislation also enables the Minister to make regulations prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which a supplement may be paid, the class or classes of persons to whom a supplement may be paid and the amount of supplement that may be paid, and this has been done in S. I. 382 of 1995.</P>

      <P>The first report of the Joint Committee on the Family entitled <i>The Impact of State Tax and Social Welfare Schemes on the Family</i> was published in February 1996 and its recommendations of relevance to my Department are currently under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report makes an important contribution to raising awareness of the issues which need to be addressed to improve the responsiveness of State services to families in different circumstances. In identifying areas such as child income support, the problems encountered by young people living outside the family home, and the concept of &ldquo;adult dependency&rdquo;, the report raises complex issues for my Department in its <Col N="1998" /> efforts to provide a more responsive service aimed at meeting different needs.</P>
    <P>The expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems has also been considering ways of improving the interaction between the tax and social welfare systems with particular reference to the impact on people's incomes and administrative and budgetary implications.  In its work, it has examined issues such as income support for children, methods for reducing unemployment and poverty traps, family income supplement and adult dependant payments, and the treatment of cohabiting couples under both the tax and social welfare systems.  The report of the expert group is expected to be available by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Commission on the Family established by the Government last October has a mandate to examine the needs and priorities of the family in a rapidly changing social and economic environment.  The commission is due to complete its final report by June 1997 and in that report to recommend how best families can be facilitated in the support and development of individual members.  The recommendations of the commission will form the basis for the development of an integrated policy to support families for the future.  The work of the joint committee and the expert group will also be very important in the development of that policy.</P>
    <P>This year's budget had a clear pro-family focus with many improvements affecting families, as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Child benefit increased by £2 per month per child i.e. to £29 for the first two children and £34 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>&mdash;New grant of £500 for twins at birth at age 4 and at age 12.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Back to school clothing and footwear allowance increased by £3 to £43 for primary and £58 for secondary schoolchildren.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Visually impaired children to be given free travel companion pass.</P>
    <P>&mdash;New one-parent family payment to be introduced which will replace <Col N="1999" /> the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Major improvements in family income supplement resulting in a £6 a week increase to most recipients, qualifying period of employment reduced from six to three months, qualifying hours of employment reduced from 20 and 19 and job-sharers now included.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Child dependants' allowance to be retained for 13 weeks if an unemployed parents parent takes up a job.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Medical cards to be retained for three years where a person unemployed for more than one year takes up a job &mdash; this is particularly important for families.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The substantial increase in the number of places on various schemes available to those who are long-term unemployed is especially beneficial to families including lone parents.  An additional 5,000 back to work allowances are being made available to the long-term unemployed in 1996 while priority is being given to the long-term unemployed on community employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;PRSI adjustments are work-friendly and, in common with all supports for work, help to counter the cycle of unemployment which affects many families.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&lsquo;Ending Long-Term Unemployment&rsquo;&mdash; Forum report No. 4, published in June 1994;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&lsquo;Quality Delivery of Social Services&rsquo;&mdash; Forum Report No. 6, published in February 1995.</P>
      <P>The recommendations contained in these reports continue to be addressed on an ongoing basis by my Department in the context of the development and enhancement of social welfare schemes and services generally and, more specifically, in the context of the allocation of limited resources to social welfare improvements at budget time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of forum report No. 3, which examined the outstanding recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, substantial progress has now been achieved in meeting the forum's recommendations in the areas, for example, of achieving adequate rates of payment; the introduction of a substantial means disregard for the carer's <Col N="2002" /> allowance; and the extension of the child dependant allowance for children up to age 22 in full-time education in the case of long-term payments.  The Deputy will be aware that I have commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to review the minimum adequate rates that were recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986.</P>
    <P>Forum Report No. 4 sought to examine the dimensions and causes of the long-term unemployment problem and its recommendations related to the development of training, employment services and taxation and PRSI reform aimed at increasing the opportunities for the long-term unemployed to gain access to the workforce.  This year's budget provided an integrated package of pro-employment measures designed to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment.  In so far as my Department is concerned, the measures included a substantial increase in the PRSI-free allowance, reductions in the employer PRSI rates, increases in the thresholds governing entitlement to family income supplement, provision for the retention of child dependent allowances for 13 weeks after taking up employment and reform of the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>The fifth report of the forum set out its views on the values, objectives, principles and strategic issues which it believes should underpin income maintenance policies.  In this regard, I am awaiting the final report of the expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems which will provide a sound basis for the development of policies in this area.  That report is expected to be available by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>Forum report No. 6 is focused on quality improvements in the delivery of a range of social services.  The recommendations made by the forum in this regard are very much in line with action already taken by my Department over the years aimed at improving the quality and delivery of social welfare services to our citizens.

      <P>Following proposals I put forward to the Government, the Commission on the Family was established with the following terms of reference;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to raise public awareness and improve understanding of issues affecting families;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; to examine the effects of legislation and policies on families and make recommendations to the Government on proposals which would strengthen the capacity of families to carry out their functions in a changing economic and social environment.  The Commission would also be expected to make proposals to the proposed all-party committee on the constitution on any changes which it believes might be necessary in the constitutional provisions in relation to the family. Proposals involving expenditure <Col N="2004" /> should be as far as practicable costed;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to analyse recent economic and social changes affecting the position of families, taking account of relevant research already carried out including reports of commissions (e.g. social welfare, taxation, status of women) and relevant working groups (e.g. expert working group on integration of taxation and social welfare, current anti-poverty strategy policy committee); and carry out limited research as necessary.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference also provide that the commission will liaise with the Joint Committee on the Family.</P>
    <P>I understand that the matter of liaison arrangements between the commission and the joint committee is high on the agendas of both groups at their regular meetings.</P>
    <P>The commission has held five meetings to date since it was appointed in October 1995 with more frequent meetings of working groups.  The joint committee is well advanced in its work having been established in March 1995.  The committee's recent report, on the &ldquo;Impact of State Tax and Social Welfare schemes on the Family&rdquo; will make an important contribution to raising awareness about the issues which need to be addressed to improve the responsiveness of the State services for families in different circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand that the chairman of the Commission on the Family and the chairman of the joint committee have met and have had discussions regularly over the past few months about progress with the work of their respective groups.</P>
    <P>At secretariat level, the chairmen have established practical working arrangements to ensure that the commission members and the joint committee members are kept informed about the issues being considered and progress made in each others work programme, and any proposals in relation to undertaking research projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> Commission members and the secretary have been welcomed to open sessions of meetings of the joint committee. Members of the joint committee were invited to attend the official launch of the commission's programme to encourage submissions from the public.</P>
    <P>I understand that close liaison arrangements between the commission and the joint committee will continue to be an important priority for both groups in pursuing their tasks in the interests of strengthening and supporting families.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Family has been asked to make its final report to Government by June 1997 and in that report to make recommendations on how families can best be facilitated in the support and development of individual members.  The commission has been asked to provide an interim report by October 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the percentage of women in the main occupational groups in the Civil Service as at 31 December 1995 are contained in Table 1.</P>
      <P>Reliable data in respect of male/female breakdown is not available in respect of periods prior to 31 October 1987 when the annual report on Equality of Opportunity in the Civil Service was first produced.  I have, therefore, provided a male/female percentage breakdown of general service grades in the Civil Service, by grade, for 31 October 1987, 31 December 1990 and 31 December 1993 in Table 2.</P>
      <P>Table 3 provides details of numbers serving in each of the general service grades as at 31 December 1995, broken down between male and female along with a percentage breakdown.</P>

    <P>These allowances are revised in line with general round increases for nurses. The rates apply nationally with the exception of the Dublin area of the Eastern Health Board where by agreement the method of compensation is time off in lieu in respect of planned essential services.  Claims for improvements in the pay and conditions of health services staff must be processed through the industrial relations procedures.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> unions representing nurses have processed a major claim for improvements in conditions of employment of nurses.  A claim for increases on general pay scales for all grades, including public health nurses, formed part of the recent negotiations.  Unions are currently in the process of balloting their members on an offer made in response to this claim.  Given the balloting process is not yet complete, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>In March 1995, I approved Clonmel Corporation's proposals to seek tenders for a pilot phase of work to this estate involving both the refurbishment of existing dwellings and the construction of new houses.  On receipt of the tenders last November, it emerged that the authority had sought tenders for work relating to the entire estate rather than the pilot phase approved.  The authority was accordingly requested to negotiate a contract with the lowest valid tenderer for the pilot phase, as approved, and their proposals were received in my Department recently.  I will convey a decision to the authority as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his annual report for 1993, the Ombudsman criticised the statutory provisions whereby a person is required to apply for a social welfare payment within a specified time, as being inequitable in the context of social insurance payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these statutory provisions, where a person fails to apply within the prescribed time, he or she can be disqualified from receiving payment prior to the date of application.  However, there are provisions for backdating applications where the person shows that there was a good cause for the <Col N="2021" /> delay in making the application.  In general, applications for social welfare payments can be backdated for six months.</P>
    <P>My Department has undertaken a review of the statutory provisions. However, as I indicated to the Deputy in reply to an earlier question, the issues involved in the review have turned out to be more difficult than was originally anticipated.  In particular it appears that relaxation of the current legislative requirements could have significant cost implications and would have to be considered, therefore, in the light of other priorities.</P>
    <P>The primary reason for late applications in the case of pensions is that people claim not to be fully aware of their entitlements.  In this regard, my Department is continuously examining options for improved targeting of information which will ensure that people are aware in time of their social welfare entitlements.</P>

      <P>The funding required by my Department is mainly determined by the rates of social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of the current rates of payment on the quality of life of social welfare recipients and the extent to which these rates may not be adequate cannot be properly assessed in the absence of up to date research in this area.  For this reason, the Government's policy agreement of December 1994, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, included a <Col N="2022" /> commitment to commission the Economic and Social Research Institute to review the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1985.</P>
    <P>The review is under way and will put forward new rates in the light of improvements in social welfare programmes and other changes since the report of the commission was published, taking into account changes set out in the policy agreement.  It will provide an objective basis for assessing the adequacy or otherwise of the current rates of social welfare entitlements.  The review is expected to be completed by mid-1996 and, along with other reviews of the social welfare systems, such as that of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare, will form the basis for the formulation of proposals for improvements in the social welfare system in the years ahead and for assessing my Department's funding requirements.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, further progress is being made this year towards implementing the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. The commission estimated that the minimum adequate income required by a single adult was £50 per week.  This was termed the main rate and is equivalent to £68.10 in 1996 terms.</P>
    <P>In 1985, the only social welfare schemes that provided rates of payment at or above the main rate were the old age contributory pension, retirement pension and some occupational injury schemes.  The increases in this year's budget will bring the survivor's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit to the main rate in June 1996. The increases will bring all the remaining social welfare payments to at least 92 per cent of the main rate, after compensating for inflation, and most of them will be at least 95 per cent of the main rate, details of which are set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, contains a commitment to work towards a basic income system for children.  This issue is currently being examined by the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare.  I understand that the group is due to report shortly and I look forward to receiving its proposals on this issue which I am confident will advise on the optimal approach to achieving a basic income system for children.</P>
      <P>The strategy which I have adopted pending receipt of the group's report has involved systematic improvements in child benefit.  As a universal payment, child benefit is very well targeted to middle and low income families and cannot constitute an unemployment or poverty trap.  Over the 1995 and 1996 budgets, we have provided increases in child benefit of 45 per cent for the first two children and 36 per cent in respect of other children.  From September next, the monthly payment will amount to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>The total number of families who were in receipt of a child benefit payment for at least one child on 31 December 1995 was 491,520.  The total <Col N="2025" /> number of children in respect of whom child benefit was payable at that time was 1,065,471.  Expenditure on child benefit in 1995 is estimated at £301 million and is expected to rise to £375 million in 1996, reflecting a full year of the 35 per cent increase in the rate of child benefit which I introduced with effect from September 1995.</P>
      <P>Payment of child benefit is not subject to a means test or to pay related social insurance contribution criteria.  Child benefit is normally paid in respect of a qualified child up to 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>Where the child continues in full-time education or the child is physically or mentally handicapped, the payment may continue up to their 19th birthday. Information to this effect is included with the child benefit book itself and is included with other communications to recipients, including those who have opted to have their payments lodged directly to a bank, building society or post office savings account, instead of via a child benefit book.</P>
      <P>Arrears are paid in cases where people fail to claim on time in respect of eligible children who have reached 16 years of age, provided they have been in receipt of child benefit in respect of that child prior to the child's sixteenth birthday.</P>
      <P>Because the scheme is universal and straightforward, it is very widely understood in the community.  An analysis of the latest available data suggests that child benefit is paid in respect of more than 99 per cent of eligible children.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are <Col N="2026" /> in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Currently, about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an estimated annual cost this year of some £32.7 million.</P>
      <P>People who qualify for a pension from my Department on reaching the age of 66 receive their free travel passes automatically.  A similar arrangement applies in the case of other eligible categories such as recipients of invalidity pension and disabled person's maintenance allowance.  However, statistics are not maintained by my Department as to the number of people who have an entitlement to free travel but choose not to apply for it or who, having a free travel pass, choose not to avail of it.</P>

Because of the large number of applications already on hands for consideration by the tribunal, this particular application is unlikely to be reached at the next meeting of the tribunal on 4 April 1996.  If an allocation is made to the person named during the 1996-97 milk quota year, it will be applicable in that quota year.  The person named shall be notified directly of the outcome of his application in due course.</P>

      <P>The person in question applied for and has been found eligible for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts. He has also received compensation in settlement of a civil action against this Department in respect of one of his pensionable disablements.  In this regard, the Army Pensions Acts provide that alternative compensation received may be taken into consideration in fixing the level of disability pension.</P>
      <P>The question of whether all or some of the compensation received by him should be taken into account is under consideration and his solicitors have, at the Department's invitation, recently furnished representations on his behalf in this context.  The matter will be decided as quickly as possible at which stage the Department will notify his solicitors of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The recent problems on EU fresh whitefish markets were the result of seasonal oversupply.  High levels of landings due to favourable weather and plentiful stocks of fish resulted in a temporary collapse in prices and the withdrawal of large quantities of fish from the markets. In recent weeks the balance between supply and demand has begun to be restored and prices are recovering.</P>
      <P>During the market difficulties, the Department oversaw the operation of EU market support schemes which allow for financial compensation for fish withdrawals and financial support for the producers organisations to enable temporary withdrawals and storage for future sale.  During the period BIM worked to prime domestic demand for fish through advertising campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU is a net importer of fish in order to meet high consumer and processing industry demand which outstrips ability to supply from within the EU.  As a result these seasonal difficulties have been a recurring problem over many years.  While third country fish imports <Col N="2035" /> are mostly frozen and destined for the EU processing sector, the seasonal problems of the EU whitefish sector are not helped when quantities of imported fresh fish suddenly appear on the market.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the underlying fragile balance of the EU market for fisheries.  Solutions are not easy to find since we must ensure continuity of supply to meet consumer and processing demand while protecting the interests of the EU catching sector.  Nonetheless the <Col N="2036" /> fundamental structural problems must be addressed for the longer term.  In the meantime I am particularly concerned to ensure that the Commission's current proposals to set the 1996 levels of tariff quotas for fish imports fully reflect what is happening on the EU whitefish market. We are pressing for the interests of EU producers to be fully taken into account in these proposals and I will be keeping up that pressure when the issue is discussed at Council on 22 April.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 April 1996.</P>
