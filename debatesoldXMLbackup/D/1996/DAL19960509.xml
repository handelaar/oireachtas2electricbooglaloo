      <P>I am sure Members would wish to join me in welcoming to Leinster House Sir Dudley Smith, MP, President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Western European Union.  We hope his visit to Ireland will be successful and enjoyable. I also welcome the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Lena Hjelm Wallen, and, on behalf of the Taoiseach and Members, extend her a céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1, Waste Management Bill, 1995, amendmends from the Seanad, and No. 14, National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill, 1996, Second Stage <i>(Resumed).</i> It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 1, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair <Col N="334" /> and which shall, in relation to amendments thereto, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 25, motion concerning the establishment of regional boards of education.</P>

      <P>The Order Paper states that there are three hours remaining of the time allocated for the motion on Private Members' Business concerning the establishment of regional boards of education.  I understand that is a mistake and that a Supplementary Order Paper has been circulated.  The motion will also be taken next week.  May I take it that the Order of Business as proposed will not affect this?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will be glad to know that his constituency is in good hands today.  Deputy Bertie Ahern is paying it a visit which I am sure will prove very fruitful.  On a more serious note, despite any reservations we may have about the electoral process in the North &mdash; the campaigns will be officially launched today &mdash; we wish all those involved well.  In that context, will the Taoiseach inform the House of the content of his conversation with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major?  There is a need to take a benign view to bring people from all sides to the negotiating table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a useful conversation with the British Prime Minister yesterday, but it would not be appropriate to establish the precedent of giving details of conversations of that nature. Obviously we both have a common objective; to make the talks which will commence on 10 June as inclusive and successful as possible.  We recognise <Col N="335" /> that, as Governments, we have responsibilities to give as many assurances as we can to assist the parties, but we equally recognise that all the parties have a responsibility, individually and together, to make the talks a success.  We recognise in particular that the IRA has a responsibility to reinstate the ceasefire so that Sinn Féin may take part in the talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, the deliberations are not concluded on that matter which is the subject of widespread discussion.  There are concerns that changes in the law could needlessly put individuals' reputations at risk.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach intervene, even at this late stage, to save the equestrian games, the loss of which in terms of tourism and revenue can be quantified in millions of pounds?  Given that we are talking about holding the Olympic Games in Ireland, is it not a farce that the equestrian games may be lost to Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach take steps to ensure that in the deliberations and preparations for the education Bill there will be consultation with the Select Committee on Social Affairs?  We recently learned about proposals pertaining to that legislation regarding the religious aspect of hiring and firing teachers and a back door deal that was done with the Churches about which nobody was aware.  Last week we heard about a private seminar that was held in March on school inspections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is in the process of preparation and will be available later in the year.  It is perfectly normal for a Minister to enter into consultation with various parties about the content of legislation before it is presented here, and that is what the Minister has been doing.  When the proposals eventually emerge Members of the House will have the opportunity to put forward their contrary or supportive views, but the Minister in the meantime is perfectly entitled to enter into extensive consultation.  The Minister for Education has been exemplary in the way in which she has consulted widely in regard to matters of this nature.</P>

      <P>On the freedom of information legislation and the commitment to repeal the Official Secrets Act, how can the Government's commitment to openness be reconciled with the decision of the Department of Justice to censor and possibly not publish at all the recent report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is in the course of preparation and will be ready in the second half of the year. One of the responsibilities of Government is to protect the reputation of individuals from statements that may libel them.  In any publication authorised by Government such a responsibility must be respected and must be balanced against other just public concerns.  In making any such balanced judgment the Government naturally has to take the best advice available.  It is necessary to <Col N="338" /> balance, in a fair way, the rights of individuals to their reputation against the right of the public to know that the Government is taking this advice.  It is important that Deputies appreciate the balancing of responsibilities that is necessary in any procedure of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 4: In page 9, lines 28 to 38, subsection (2) (a) deleted and the following substituted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> "(2) (a) In this Act, `hazardous waste' means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  hazardous waste for the time being mentioned in the list prepared pursuant to Article 1 (4) of Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December, 1991, being either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  Category I waste that has any of the properties specified in Part III of the Second Schedule, or</P>
    <P>(II)  Category II waste that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(A)  contains any of the constituents specified in Part II of the Second Schedule, and</P>
    <P>(B)  has any of the properties specified in Part III of the said Schedule,</P>
    <P>(ii)  such other waste, having any of the properties specified in Part III of the Second Schedule, as may be prescribed for the purposes of this definition.".</P>
    <P>I am glad to be on what I hope is the final lap of this long debate on one of the most important items of environmental legislation introduced into these Houses; I am glad to have steered it for many months.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for a revised definition of &ldquo;hazardous waste&rdquo; to bring it more fully in line with the European Union definition of &ldquo;hazardous waste&rdquo;.  It was brought forward in response to views submitted by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation which expressed concern that the existing definition was significantly broader in its scope than the definition provided for under European law.</P>
    <P>The European definition is intended to serve as a common basic definition for "hazardous waste" for all member states of the European Union.  The proposed new definition provides essentially that &ldquo;hazardous waste&rdquo; under the Bill means hazardous waste for the time being mentioned in the hazardous waste list adopted by the European Union under Article 1 (4) of Council Directive <Col N="342" /> 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste, and any other such hazardous waste having any of the hazardous properties specified in Part III of the Second Schedule which may be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a requirement now to harmonise definitions across the European Union so that both business, the consumer and the general public know exactly what we mean when we use phrases like "hazardous waste".  I am anxious that this amendment, which would reflect a common European view, be represented in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am delighted we are on the final lap of this comprehensive legislation which is long overdue but very welcome.  I congratulate the officials in the Department for all the work they put into it in the past few years.  Listening to a radio programme yesterday, I heard a gentleman complaining about the lack of policy on waste management; he said Ireland did not have any comprehensive waste management policy.  That person is obviously not aware of the work and effort politicians and officials have put into the preparation of this legislation. Our message does not seem to be getting across to the general public but I have no doubt this Bill will be a landmark in environmental legislation.  We support this amendment and thank IBEC for the comprehensive briefing documents it provided since this legislation was first proposed.  IBEC has been very balanced in much of the detail it put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I support this practical amendment.  It is important that we be specific in our definitions.  When we debated the Bill in Committee a number of Members tried to put forward amendments that would help to make these matters more specific, but clearly the input from IBEC finally convinced the Minister of the need to be more specific in our definitions.  I, too, thank IBEC for the time and expertise it put into studying the <Col N="343" /> provisions of the Bill and for its recommendations in regard to how it can be improved and made more suited to Irish conditions.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law and when we seek to enforce its provisions, it will be helpful for us to have the support of IBEC.  We go forward now with the knowledge that the proposals we make as legislators have the support of IBEC who agree that it is possible to put these provisions into practice.  That is a very good starting point for any new legislation.  This is fundamentally important legislation for the social, economic and cultural well-being of this country in the years ahead and it is vital, therefore, to have this level of active support from IBEC.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 5: In page 15, subsection (1), lines 1 and 2 deleted, and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;vehicle&rsquo; includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  part of a vehicle,</P>
      <P>(b)  an article designed as a vehicle but not capable of functioning as a vehicle,</P>
      <P>(c)  a skip designed or used for carriage on a vehicle,</P>
      <P>(d)  a load on a vehicle;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall I promised this House that I would examine in some detail the law on abandoned vehicles to encompass the disposal of such vehicles <Col N="344" /> within the ambit of the Bill.  We have been working on that since the Bill passed all Stages here and moved to the Seanad.  We have a number of amendments &mdash; with which we are dealing as a group &mdash; to deal with this issue.  The effect of the amendments is to strengthen the law in relation to abandoned vehicles.  These amendments will repeal the existing provisions of the Litter Act, 1982, in relation to abandoned vehicles, insert a new section in this Bill to deal with the matter and introduce certain related provisions.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section 71 represents a re-enaction and strengthening of the existing provisions of sections 10 to 13 of the Litter Act.  For the purpose of clarity it is best if the amendments are dealt with here in discussion in two groups.  The substantive amendments are Nos. 2, 18 and 19.  Amendment No. 18 is the principal amendment, it proposes to add a new section 71 to the Bill regarding abandoned vehicles.  Sections 9 and 13 of the Litter Act, 1982, deal specifically with abandoned vehicles.  It is evident that there is considerable overlap between these provisions and certain provisions that are already part of the Waste Management Bill.  It is more appropriate, in present circumstances, that matters relating to abandoned vehicles are incorporated fully in this Bill rather than being dealt with separately in disparate pieces of legislation.  Accordingly, it is now proposed to update and strengthen our legislative controls on abandoned vehicles in the context of this comprehensive Bill.</P>
    <P>The new section 71 would strengthen the existing provisions in the Litter Act as follows: higher penalties specified in section 10 of the Bill would also apply to offence in relation to abandoned vehicles, the weaker provisions in the Litter Act where the maximum prosecution fine on summary conviction is £800 would be repealed and come under the ambit of the penalties to be imposed under section 10 of the Bill.  Under this provision local authorities may remove abandoned vehicles from land without <Col N="345" /> the consent of its occupier and without giving notice of entry on land except in the case of a private dwelling where 24 hours' notice is specified under these provisions.  At present, the Litter Act requires the consent of the occupier or 14 days' notice to the occupier before such vehicles can be removed by a local authority.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 proposes to repeal sections 9 to 13 of the Litter Act which deal with abandoned vehicles so that they can be transposed more effectively and strengthened in this provision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes to amend the definition of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; in section 5.  This amendment is consequential on the proposed insertion of the new section 71.  The existing definition of the word "vehicle" would be replaced with a more extensive definition outlined in the Litter Act.  It now includes part of a vehicle, a load on a vehicle, any such vehicle that is no longer capable of functioning, for example, a hulk or a wrecked vehicle. They will be encompassed and subject to the provisions of the new subsection.</P>
    <P>The remaining three amendments are related.  Amendment No. 8 proposes to re-enact section 9 (1) of the Litter Act which is being repealed.  The amendment would insert a new subsection 38 (3) to require a local authority to provide or arrange for the provision of such facilities as appear to be necessary and reasonable at which vehicles may be discarded.  The proposed amendment would maintain the existing requirement on all local authorities to provide facilities for the reception of abandoned vehicles.  Amendment No. 9 provides that the power available to local authorities under the existing subsection (3) to enter an agreement or joint agreement with other local authorities or other persons, shall also apply to the provision of facilities for discarded vehicles.  It can be done on a composite basis between adjoining local authorities or between local authorities and private operators.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 provides that for <Col N="346" /> the purposes of the proposed new subsection 38 (3), local authority includes a non-county borough corporation and an urban district council.  Urban district councils borough councils and county councils would all have a statutory duty to have a facility to receive abandoned vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments.  Abandoned vehicles are a nuisance in Dublin city and in other parts of the country and I am pleased higher penalties are being imposed.  When one is trying to have a vehicle removed, local authorities say it cannot be done, for different reasons.  In the case of abandoned vehicles which have registration plates the position is that local authorities will not remove such a vehicle unless enormous pressure is applied.  Is that still the case, even with these amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The new provision will enable a local authority to simply move in on a property and take an abandoned vehicle.  The law on registration is a separate matter.  Obviously when a vehicle is changing ownership there is a legal requirement in existing law that the local licensing authority, the local county council, would be notified.  The number plate which may or may not be attached to the vehicle would not affect it in terms of whether it is regarded as litter or waste under these provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a worthwhile and substantial amendment.  Abandoned vehicles constitute a major blemish on our landscape and very often a large number of them are dumped in scenic areas where the population is dependent on tourism for its economic survival and jobs for themselves and their children.  Nonetheless these people can be casual and careless about dealing with or tolerating abandoned vehicles.  I compliment the Minister, in the context of this Bill, for seeking to systematically strengthen and update the law in dealing with abandoned vehicles as the Litter Act has failed in this respect.  If the litter <Col N="347" /> law had not failed the situation would have been allowed to develop to the point where abandoned vehicles are peppered around the countryside and a blemish on it.  The single most frequent complaint from tourists at the end of a holiday is not about the quality of the food, transport or service but about litter.  Certainly abandoned vehicles are a huge component of the overall litter problem.</P>
      <P>I am extremely pleased the Minister has decided to put that issue in this legislation which deals with solid waste instead of leaving it to be dealt with under a Litter Act that is proving ineffective.  He has the total support of my party.  It is important that the operation of this provision is monitored and that we have in place a law which is a clear definition of what constitutes an abandoned vehicle.  Time out of number I complained about abandoned vehicles only to be told that because there was a loophole in the law it was not possible to deal with the matter.  Now we will have a new law in place.  It is important that it is sufficiently tight and that the definition and the powers are sufficiently defined to enable local authorities to deal swiftly and effectively with abandoned vehicles and that the right to do so will be put beyond aye or nay.</P>
      <P>It is important to monitor how this is being implemented.  I would be encouraged if I thought we had a law that worked effectively and which would rid our country, once and for all, of the scourge of abandoned vehicles.</P>

      <P>The Chair should not encourage the Deputies.  The word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; includes a vehicle left in <Col N="348" /> such circumstances or for such period that it is reasonable to assume it has been abandoned and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.  Under section 8 local authorities are indemnified against anything done in good faith and without negligence in the course of the removal of such vehicles.  Therefore, if it is reasonable to assume that a vehicle is abandoned, a person could not take an action against a local authority for removing it.  The definition and indemnity provisions are clear in that regard.</P>
      <P>We also dealt with a number of the anomalies to which Deputy Quill referred regarding the existing provisions of the law.  Local authorities had to serve 14 days notice on the owner of the land before removing a vehicle.  We are providing them with a new armoury of powers to preserve a pristine environment and remove abandoned vehicles and rusted hulks from our countryside. We want to insert a provision that deals effectively with the removal of abandoned vehicles and that has been achieved in the amendments under discussion.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to insert a new subsection (10) into section 38 to enable a local authority to specify conditions which shall apply to the discarding or deposit of waste at facilities provided by local authorities.  Amendment No. 11 proposes to insert a new subsection (10) in section 38.  Amendment No. 7 is a consequential amendment to section 38 (2) (a).  The net effect of these amendments is to provide for proper control over the deposit or discarding of waste by the public at all waste management facilities provided by local authorities.  It is possible at present to determine where different categories of waste will be deposited. For example, local authorities can specify that tyres must be deposited at a certain site and domestic refuse at another site.  This amendment extends that provision to all waste management facilities run by local authorities.  For example, a local authority may specify that Christmas trees must be disposed of in a certain location.  The provision merely broadens the general discretion of local authorities to specify where waste can be disposed of at reception facilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new subsection (3A) into section 83 of the Environmental Protection Act, 1992.  The import of the amendment is to provide that section 53 of the Waste Management Act shall apply in the grant or review of a licence or revised licence under Part VI of the 1992 Act. This will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to satisfy itself regarding the ability of an applicant or holder of an IPC licence under the Environmental <Col N="356" /> Protection Agency Act to meet the financial commitment and other possible liabilities arising with compliance with the licence provided.  It will also allow the agency to require appropriate financial provision to be made for the purpose.  Such financial provision may include a bonding arrangement or other form of financial security.  The Deputies and others were anxious on Committee Stage that in terms of issuing waste licences there would be clear indemnities, clear bonding and a clear financial capacity to deal with any pollution that might arise from the holding of such a licence and that we would not have people abandoning a project when they went broke as happened in unfinished housing estates.  We have done that very effectively in waste licensing.  I suggest that we take the opportunity to extend that to existing IPC licensing under the 1992 Act.  It was not done then but we should reflect the strong views put to me on waste licensing in IPC licensing as well.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

    <P>(12) Proceedings for an offence under this section may be brought by the local authority which served the notice concerned".</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment which inserts a new section into the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990, empowering local authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans in respect of their farms.  Deputies will recall that we had some discussion about this and I promised I would extend it into the area of farm pollution as well.  I have had discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and with the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>During our earlier consideration of the Bill, there was a debate about the potential of agricultural waste and certain farming practices to cause water pollution.  There was a recognition by many Deputies that, in addition to the controls to be applied to waste in general, the Bill contained a number of provisions focusing principally on agricultural wastes.  Deputies welcomed these provisions but raised concerns that the threat posed to the environment by some agricultural activities should be countered more effectively.  In responding to the debate I undertook to introduce an amendment to the water pollution Act when the Bill came before the Seanad for the purpose of dealing <Col N="364" /> with the excessive enrichment of waters caused by nutrients contained in farm wastes and chemical fertilisers being washed off and causing eutrophication in our waterways.</P>
    <P>The water courses of Ireland are relatively clean when compared to those of other European countries.  However, in Ireland circumstances have arisen where farm wastes have the potential to impact seriously on the quality of rivers and lakes generally, due to the large volume of waste involved and its high nutrient content, in particular, its high phosphorous content.  Farm run-offs is a significant source of pollution causing high nutrient levels in waters and giving rise to eutrophication.  There has been a disturbing trend in the proportion of river channel to be affected by eutrophication since the early 1970s.  The national overview of water quality for the period 1991-94 which was published recently by the Environmental Protection Agency is a comprehensive overview of the state of the Irish environment of which the Environmental Protection Agency can be very proud.  A new overview will be published every five years from this day on.  The overview looks at every aspect of the environment.  It shows that eutrophication or slight to moderate pollution affected 28 per cent of surveyed river channel.  This compared to 21 per cent for the previous period of analysis which was 1987-90.</P>
    <P>Since it is essential that we address this issue, I am availing of this opportunity to introduce an amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990 to provide that a new responsibility may be placed by a local authority on individual farmers to prepare nutrient management plans in respect of their farms. When considered necessary these new powers will be used by local authorities to prevent, eliminate or minimise pollution caused by a particular segment of nutrients from farming.  I hope that farmers generally will adopt nutrient planning as a key element of their farm management strategy for their financial <Col N="365" /> benefit and, of course, for that of the environment generally.</P>
    <P>There is an associated amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 which seeks to provide farmers with an additional incentive to comply with the provisions of nutrient management plans for their farms.  This takes the form of extending the good defence provision to a prosecution for the general water pollution offence under section 3 of that Act to circumstances in which the accused can prove that a farming activity was carried out in accordance with a nutrient management plan.</P>
    <P>By international standards we have an extremely good environment but one worrying aspect is the increasing percentage of our navigable waters which are slightly or moderately polluted by eutrophication or farm run-offs, about which we must do something.  Through the combined efforts of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the REP programme and informative initiatives undertaken by Teagasc and others &mdash; I had the privilege of launching a video for farmers on the spreading of artificial and natural fertilisers &mdash; we will reduce any deterimental effects on our environment.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to give local authorities power to require farmers whose lands adjoin a sensitive area of river or lake to implement a nutrient plan or, if and when there is an occurrence of clear eutrophication in a particular stretch of river or lake to engage in direct discussions with them to ascertain how they apply nutrients to that particular stretch of land, if Teagasc can help them or if a system can be devised to ensure that whatever damage is done is minimised or eliminated.  The incentive to farmers, by making it a good defence to devise and follow a plan in the case of prosecution, will encourage them to plan properly for the addition of nutrients.  We have had discussions with the farmers' organisations and I believe there will be a general welcome for this proposal.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, the report of the Environmental Protection Agency confirms that, generally, our environment is very clean but that, while not serious, there are problems on the agricultural front.  Circumstances may arise after a sudden, torrential shower of rain, in which there may be some seepage of nutrients into waterways for which a farmer may not be entirely to blame.  He might very well be putting much effort and work into being environmentally sensitive to local waterways.</P>
      <P>While supporting the Minister's amendment, given that there is much confusion about the REP scheme, would the Minister agree that, unless that is eliminated, implementation of this provision will be very difficult? Having spoken to farmers and others in the agricultural industry at a recent Fianna Fáil conference on the environment, I know there is much concern and confusion about that scheme which, while an excellent one, warrants greater clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment represents a significant improvement on the Bill as originally drafted.  The Minister is correct in saying that on Committee Stage a number of Members expressed grave concern about the quality of our water nationwide and farm fertiliser run-offs.  The recent, well researched report of the Environmental Protection Agency confirms that the overall position is worsening.  Following our membership of the EEC and the intensification of farming here, there has been increased if not excessive use of fertilisers, proven by Teagasc reports. If we are really serious about preserving the quality of our water it is important that we put in place the requisite legislative safeguards.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this discussion I said that what this country needs is a more integrated Waste Bill, specifically consolidating the legislative provisions or solid waste and those on air and water quality.  In a sense, this amendment is a step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> I am concerned that there may be some element of complacency in the Minister's proposal.  In the context of this amendment he says that a new responsibility "may" be placed on farmers to devise a nutrient plan.  Bearing in mind the worsening quality of our water, I would be much more confident about its future condition if the word "may" were changed to "must", thus placing a clear legislative requirement on farmers to prepare a nutrient plan. The REP scheme, while working indifferently, overall is a good one which, if properly implemented, should help in achieving the objectives of the Bill. Whenever farmers are given incentives such as State-aided grants through Teagasc along with a considerable amount of detailed information, expertise and advice on how to deal with excessive use of fertilisers resulting in run-offs from their land, the principle that the polluter pays must apply.  There must be a very clear legal requirement on farmers to be more responsive to the law and more responsible in putting in place the type of safeguards against any excessive runoff from fertilisers used on their lands.</P>
    <P>We must now take a firm stand on this issue.  While I will not call a vote on it, I would be much more confident of the provisions of this Bill achieving their objective were the word "must" substituted for the word "may", thus placing a clear responsibility on farmers whose lands adjoin watercourses, streams and rivers to devise and implement a nutrient plan, with clear procedures in place to monitor its implementation.</P>
    <P>For example, we know what happened to the water in Lough Derg and a number of our other key waterways.  I tend sometimes to give wrong place names.  While I will not be contesting the next Presidential election or anything of that nature, I do not want to get myself into trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;nevertheless a number of our rivers are being subjected to <Col N="368" /> considerable eutrophication about which we cannot afford to be complacent.  No doubt the Minister expects the provisions of this Bill to remain effective for many decades to come, and does not envisage its amendment in, say, 20 or 30 years' time.  In that respect, I would insert a more precise requirement than he proposes.</P>

      <P>I suspect from Deputy Quill's contribution that she is not very interested in the agricultural vote, especially in Carraigavar which is an intensive farming area.  In defence of the farming community, none is more aware of the value of nature than farmers because farming is about nature. Where pollution occurs, it happens more by accident than by malicious design.  As we come into the silage season, there will be spillages of silage effluent which usually occur during bad weather.  I am glad to see the Chair will be taking my side of the argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to look at where he comes from.  Agricultural damage to the environment is not as bad as we are led to believe.  Many Members have referred to the REP scheme which is against intensification. If the REPS were in place throughout the country we would not have the vibrant economic agriculture that we now have and production would be retarded very substantially.  I am aware of farmers who wish to put management <Col N="369" /> schemes in place for the distribution of farm effluent but because neighbouring farmers have participated in REPS they are not able to sign up for a scheme to distribute the effluent.  The overuse of chemical fertilisers has resulted in excess nutrient value in the soil.  An education process should be put in place on the proper use of chemical fertilisers in order to eliminate their overuse which is a waste of our resources.  Our economy would benefit from the saving in foreign currency required to buy the imported raw material used in the manufacture of chemical fertilisers.  We are not engaged in intensive agriculture but there is a tendency towards more intensive pig and poultry production. Intensification in the dairying area is restricted by quotas.</P>
      <P>Farming is about nature and in my view no farmer would maliciously destroy a lake, river or waterway.  The Bill is acceptable but I am concerned about the small print and what the Minister may introduce by way of regulation. I know representations will be made to the Minister as has happened on all occasions but I would like him to retain the power to use his discretion.</P>
      <P>Seanad amendment No. 17 refers to:</P>
      <P>the application, to, or the injection into, the land concerned or the application to crops growing thereon, by him of animals for other waste and the times and rates at which such application or injection is carried out.</P>
      <P>Will it be mandatory that the effluent be injected into the ground?  If that is the case, it will be a substantial cost factor on the farming community and will have a retarding effect on agricultural development.  The type of equipment necessary to do this job is hugely expensive because the four wheel drive tractor necessary to drive the spray equipment is also expensive.  The Minister should have discretion as to whether the old system of spreading can be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not study agriculture in great depth but everyone knows that phosphorus and possibly potassium is <Col N="370" /> applied to the land in November, December and January and the nitrogenous fertilisers are applied towards the end of February and March. Nitrogenous fertilisers can have the same polluting effect as phosphates where algaes will grow on the non-fast flowing rivers and streams.  Whether we like it or not, agriculture is going through a period of uncertainty and any further cost is not in keeping with the times we live in.</P>
    <P>Disposal of offal from the meat plants is relevant to this Bill.  That is a much bigger issue and I envisage protests about the abuse of many landfill sites. There is a perception that farmers indiscriminately pollute the environment and throw fertilisers around but that is far from the truth.</P>

When the Minister writes up the terms I hope he will allow them discretion to work in the way that suits them.  It is not in anyone's interest to interfere with the watercourses.  We have to face the reality that our country is built on water.  I appeal to the Minister to use his discretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have struck the balance right when in succession one Deputy says I am going too far and the other says I am not going far enough. It sounds like mission impossible but I believe I can actually please both Deputies.  I will explain the situation a little more.</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion that there is malice or even negligence on the part of farmers.  Everybody would agree that in a very direct way farmers are the custodians of our natural environment. Because they are so directly affected by it, they are more attuned to its protection than most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency in its most comprehensive <Col N="371" /> analysis of the Irish environment has identified the water channel as needing special attention.  We required the Environmental Protection Agency in law to produce a report.  The least we should do is pay due attention to its very detailed and comprehensive report and I intend to do just that.  The report tells us that eutrophication of our waterways has increased by some 7 per cent since the last survey and we need to do something about it.  Analysis carried out by Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry tells us that farmers are wasting money by using too much fertiliser so it is not a burden on them to have proper monitoring of the nutrient contents of their land.  In its report <i>The State of the Environment in Ireland,</i> the Environmental Protection Agency on page 121 &mdash; referring to a report by Tunney <i>et al</i> of 1994 states:</P>
    <P>The authors suggest that chemical P fertiliser inputs could be reduced by about IR£25 million per year, on a national scale, without any adverse effects on production.  Even greater savings could be made over a number of years if farms where high soil P reserves have been built up over the years were to draw down these reserves to a more acceptable level.</P>
    <P>Having a nutrient management plan monitoring the inputs to agriculture can not only be a major bonus to the environment and resolve the significant problem of eutrophication identified by the Environmental Protection Agency, but can have significant financial benefits for farmers.  There is no conflict in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the point made by Deputy Quill about the "may" and "must" and this will also answer Deputy O'Keeffe's point.  In the amendment I am not requiring that every farmer must, by law, have a nutrient management plan in the detail specified as I do not consider it is necessary at present. <Col N="372" /> Local authorities can require the individual farmers, whose land adjoins sensitive water courses where there are perceived or real problems, to draw up such a plan.  I hope that ultimately every farmer will have such a plan for the financial and environmental reasons I outlined. That will happen as it is the direction in which we are going.  We cannot require a particular means of insertion of nutrients into the soil.  Under this section farmers are required to draw up a register of how they might propose to do this.  Such a register would provide relevant information to enable local authorities or farm advisory agencies to give good advice.  It is a fair and environmentally positive system and I am sure it will be welcomed by the farming sectors on whom it will not be overburdensome.  Ultimately the effort involved in preparing such a plan will be a very good investment.</P>

      <P>As this is the last time the Bill will be before this House, I thank Deputies on all sides for their contributions during all Stages.  I join Deputies in thanking the large number of outside interests ranging from trade unions, IBEC, non-governmental organisations and environmentalists to individuals who not only submitted evidence and presented themselves before committees of the Oireachtas, but produced new proposals and refinements. In processing this legislation I have tried to be as open to any positive suggestion I could encompass.  Because of that many Deputies may say that the Bill has grown during its passage through the Houses and involved us all in a great deal of work.  I share Deputy Ryan's view that the incredible volume of work Deputies have put into this Bill is not reflected in column inches in any newspaper. <Col N="377" />  People talk about the workings of this House, but it is amazing that when we work in committee and tease out complicated important legislation we do not get great credit for that work outside this House.  The monument of the working of the House will be the legislation and its real impact on the environment.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank a very burdened group of people, the officers of this House, particularly those in the Bills Office who deal with amendments right through the night as in the case of this Bill when substantive technical amendments were worked on.  That should be acknowledged publicly.  I express my sincere thanks to all the officers and Deputies involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thank everybody involved in the Department of the Environment, officers in the Bills Office and others who put so much work into this Bill.  I would also like to thank the Minister who, in his usual way, listened to people's points of view and accepted many amendments, as a result of which the Bill has grown.  Many members of the public with whom I raised this matter during the past year were not aware that this legislation would be passed and bring about changes.  I told them the Bill would soon be passed and would have a positive impact on their lives.  They may not agree with some parts of it initially, but it will have a positive impact in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister was talking a good deal of rubbish, but on the waste management front he should make the point that this is important legislation that will benefit our environment in the long-term.  I thank the Minister for listening to the many points put forward in the course of the debate.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister and congratulate him for the manner in which he introduced this legislation, piloted through the different Stages and the openness he demonstrated to new ideas by Members or outside bodies.  I <Col N="378" /> also thank his officials who were enormously helpful to Opposition Deputies in explaining the provisions of the Bill and their implications.  I join the Minister in thanking the officers in the Bills Office who worked long and hard on this Bill to which there were perhaps more amendments than to any previous Bill this year, which was the outcome of a good deal of effort by officials in the Department of the Environment and officers in the Bills Office.</P>
      <P>This is excellent legislation.  For a long time we have taken our environment for granted, but we can no longer do that.  I look forward to the Bill's effective implementation.  I am very much encouraged that in future the Environmental Protection Agency will monitor its implementation and scientifically demonstrate whether we are making progress and if the environment is benefiting from this legislation.  We will no longer be dependent on folklore from different parts of the country. Scientific information contained in an Environmental Protection Agency report five years' hence &mdash; and I hope we will all be here five years from now &mdash; will be the measure of which we will judge the benefit of this legislation.</P>
      <P>We will know then whether there has been a reduction in the eutrophication of the rivers or an improvement in the standards of environmental practice.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects the proposal of the Minister for Education to establish ten regional boards of education as outlined in the White Paper on Education and calls on the Minister for Education to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; recognise generously the very positive role played by vocational education committees in the evolution and development of Irish education;</P>
      <P>&mdash; give a commitment to the House to retain and develop a modernised vocational education committee system; and</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is designed to ensure an adequate debate takes place on a fundamental issue relating to the development of Irish education.  We wish to ensure that the various arguments made by different interests might find articulation in this legislative assembly.  It is important that such a debate takes place prior to the publication of legislation on the issue and that all Members of the House have an opportunity to make a contribution. The debate on intermediate education structures is not new.  Proposals were tabled during a previous Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition Government in the early 1980s.  There has been an ongoing drive in the Department of Education for the establishment of intermediate education structures and in chapter 14 of the White Paper on Education the Minister outlines in detail her policy approach to this issue.</P>
      <P>The White Paper states that the Government has decided that legislation will be presented to the Oireachtas providing for the establishment of education boards which will also set out their functions and composition.  The White Paper refers to a phased transfer of functions from the regional education boards and indicates that after a period of five years there would be an independent evaluation of the boards' effectiveness.  The White Paper also states that the Government has decided there will be legislative reform and rationalisation of the vocational education committees system.  This will mean the abolition of a number of vocational education committees and many await with trepidation the outcome of the deliberations of the rationalisation commission established by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper states that the new regional boards will have substantial co-ordination and support service functions and will be the co-ordinating bodies for adult and continuing education, vocational education and training and outdoor education centres in their regions.  It also states that the boards will channel Exchequer funding to the <Col N="381" /> vocational education committees or to other providers of these services and that the board will also have a co-ordinating role in relation to publicly funded youth and sport activities.  All these activities are administered and operated to a high standard at present by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The White Paper states that there will be ten education boards and outlines the geographical remit of each board. Dublin city will be one region; the Dublin County board will include Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council areas; the mid-east board will cover counties Kildare and Wicklow; the midlands board will cover counties Offaly, Longford and Westmeath; the mid-west board will cover counties Clare, Limerick and Tipperary North Riding; the north-east board will cover counties Cavan, Louth and Meath; the north-west board will cover counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim; the south-east board will cover counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford and Tipperary South Riding; the southwest board will cover counties Cork and Kerry; and the board for the west will cover counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The White Paper outlines the composition of the regional education boards and indicates a reduction in the number of public representatives who will be entitled to a position on the boards.  The Minister does not specify the number of elected representatives who will be entitled to become members of a regional board.  However, a considerable reduction in the numbers is indicated.  The Minister will be entitled to nominate members to the regional education boards which signals significant Government involvement and influence over the new boards.</P>
    <P>The White Paper makes clear that the powers and legislative remit of the boards will significantly reduce the powers and authority of the vocational education committees which will remain following the work of the rationalisation commission.  The Minister intends that the vocational education committees <Col N="382" /> will be required in future to submit all their plans, programmes and budgets to the relevant education board for consideration and incorporation, with or without modification of the plans, programmes and budgets of the boards themselves.  In addition, the vocational education committees will function as providers of education within the framework provided nationally by the Minister for Education and elaborated regionally by each board.  Exchequer funding in support of providers, including the vocational education committees, other schools, community and voluntary organisations will be channelled through the education boards.</P>
    <P>The White Paper makes it clear that the role of vocational education committees is to be redefined <i>vis-á-vis</i> the education boards and other providers. The amending legislation for the vocational education committees which the Minister intends to introduce will provide for the retention of vocational education committees as statutory committees with specific responsibilities but which, nonetheless, will be clearly under the jurisdiction of regional education boards.  One has to question the Minister's policy in terms of having two competing intermediate structures.  The vocational education committees will not survive as they have to date under the new arrangements and their powers, remit and resources will be seriously curtailed as a result of the new policy outlined in the White Paper.  There should be one intermediate tier between the Department of Education and the school boards of management.  The proposals as outlined by the Minister are a recipe for bureaucratic chaos.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated from time to time that the establishment of the boards, after the passing of the relevant legislation, will be on a phased basis. However, she has not been very specific about the time scale involved or the phased implementation of the plan which is envisaged.  She has refused on a number of occasions to outline the cost of establishing the regional education boards.  I have tabled a number <Col N="383" /> of parliamentary questions on the matter and the Minister has refused to provide the necessary information.</P>
    <P>Cost is a key issue in this debate.  On almost a daily basis I receive complaints and expressions of concern from many in the education sector about the lack of resources available for the provision of important education programmes. There are huge demands for more visiting teachers for children with special disabilities, more resource teachers and remedial teachers, a reformed and more effective school transport system, the provision of capital funding for the refurbishment of old school buildings, the acquisition of new sites and the development of new school buildings.</P>
    <P>The education budget is very significant and amounts to approximately £2.2 billion at present.  However, huge demands are still made on resources.  In the foreword to the White Paper the Minister made it clear that the implementation of the proposals in that document will be subject to the Maastricht criteria and the annual budgeting restrictions imposed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On three occasions in this House, the Minister refused to provide details of the cost framework undertaken by the Department of Finance on the proposals contained in the White Paper on Education.  It is extremely important that Members are given access to these figures to gain an idea of the cost of the proposals in the White Paper.  Needs could then be prioritised and an implementation strategy could be developed over a specific timeframe.  People involved in the area of education would like to be aware of the mountain which must be climbed in terms of the cost implications of the proposals in the White Paper.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not shown greater transparency by publishing the cost framework that was undertaken by the Department of Finance prior to the publication of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is possible to implement the reforms and proposals <Col N="384" /> contained in the White Paper on an <i>ad hoc,</i> annual basis.  A five year implementation is required and I am surprised the Minister has not published such a plan or costed proposals and prioritised them accordingly.  For this reason I have expressed severe reservations about the Minister's proposals to drive forward with the establishment of ten regional education boards in advance of many other worthy proposals on the curricular and teacher supply area.  We need to know the costings involved before a decision is taken.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that available resources should be directed towards children, teachers and schools in general.  There is a genuine fear that the cost involved in the establishment of ten regional education boards could be very significant.  Many experienced politicians have pointed to the development of the health boards for example, and the huge costs which followed their establishment and development.  A similar situation could evolve after the establishment of regional education boards.  It is my party's view that all resources must be directed to areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>I invite politicians to meet parents involved in campaigning for better educational facilities for children with special needs, for example.  Despite the publication of its report a number of years ago, many of the special education review body's proposals have not been implemented.  I acknowledge that there have been some improvements but much needs to be done.  The parents of children with special needs are angry, frustrated and disillusioned with the lack of political commitment shown by the Government to their plight.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many people involved in special schools who complained bitterly about the lack of speech therapists, adequate resources, proper facilities, etc.  If one speaks to those involved in the area of early school leaving, one again hears a story of neglect, under-provision and a deteriorating situation.  High Court judges complain on an almost daily basis that there is no <Col N="385" /> proper preventative educational institution to which young offenders involved in crime might be sent.  Such an institution does not exist because the Government has not provided the necessary resources to provide additional places for young male and female juvenile offenders.</P>
    <P>In the cutbacks announced in June 1995, the Minister removed 1,000 places from the VTOS scheme for the long-term unemployed.  She also refused to proceed with the provision of ten additional psychological posts and the appointment of 21 visiting teachers for the travelling community.  Where do the Minister's priorities lie and what will be the cost of setting up the new regional education boards?</P>
    <P>If I put the issues I just outlined on one side of the equation and the establishment of new administrative structures on the other, where should the money go and where should the priorities lie?  Surely any available resources should be allocated to those in greatest need rather than allocated and directed to structural changes and new bodies. That is the view of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Furthermore, the geographical remit of the new regional education boards is clearly too large.  There is no county identity or loyalty in the geographical configuration of the new boards.  In a report entitled <i>Restructuring Education in Ireland</i> by Alice Brown and John Fairley, it is very cogently argued that there is a strong case for considering the present county/city boundaries as the natural boundaries for any new intermediate structures. The county and city are clearly the basis of community and self-identity.  The authors of that report suggest it is also the best basis for securing openness, accountability, parental involvement and community partnership and their views should be given very careful consideration.  The White Paper makes very strong play on the need for parental involvement and a sense of partnership in educational provision.</P>
    <P>Following their particular research and experience in Scotland, it is the <Col N="386" /> view of Brown and Fairley that, if we really want to see parental involvement and participation in education and community partnership and participation, the best geographical unit for any intermediate education structure should be the county or the city.  They are of the view that from the perspective of achieving the required degree of co-operation between education, industry and economic interests, such a unit gives the best possible opportunity for doing so.  Their report came to the conclusion that a network of county-city local education committees should be established instead of a regional tier.  I will deal with that proposal later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>The authors of the report were particularly worried about the establishment of regional education boards and feared that the absorption of the vocational education committees into larger bodies could lead to loss of cohesion and a diminution in the importance of vocational education.  They are also worried that the unique focus on vocational education provided by the vocational education committees would be lost precisely at the time when it could become a competitive advantage for the country. In their view, vocational education is set to become more, rather than less, important.  They argue that regional education committees would be likely to be too large and remote from communities to be fully legitimate, particularly given the very high degree of identification with counties and cities.  They argue strongly that a regional tier would be less likely to forge strong links between education and community development and would make it more difficult to involve parents, employers and the community in decision making. This is a key point.</P>
    <P>If the proposals in the White Paper are to be implemented in terms of partnership, community and parental participation, the regional model is clearly not the way forward.  It will offer only a token opportunity for parents and the community to become involved because the geographical remit involved is too large and extensive and simply would <Col N="387" /> not allow for local participation or involvement.  This represents a very serious drawback in the Minister's proposals and essentially undermines the objectives of the White Paper in terms of parental and community involvement in educational development.  Furthermore, these geographical regions would not attract any loyalties from the communities they propose to serve.</P>
    <P>The issue of public representation in the new regional boards must also be addressed.  There has been much criticism and cynical analysis of the role of the public representative on vocational Education Committees in the past.  As a chairman of the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee, I consider myself well placed to make a valid judgment on the contribution of public representatives to that body and to vocational education committees in general.  The principle that underlines the necessity for public representation on bodies such as the vocational education committees and regional education boards is one of democratic accountability.  Ultimate democratic accountability is to the people.  The will on the people must always be paramount in any democracy. Any democratic institutions established in this State should always pass the test of democratic accountability in a very real and immediate sense.  Whatever the ills of the present system &mdash; some undoubtedly exist &mdash; one cannot avoid the fact that the most effective way to ensure democratic accountability to the people is to ensure adequate public representation on these bodies.</P>
    <P>Those directly elected through local authorities have a mandate from the people and must ultimately answer to them in the form of regular local and general elections.  That is the ultimate test and it is wrong to establish regional boards or any new institutions without adequate democratic representation.  I make no apology for stating, or making it a cornerstone of my own personal philosophy, that public representatives deserve to be on vocational education committees and on any new bodies <Col N="388" /> established in education or any other sphere of Government activity.  Public representatives are elected by the people, they have a mandate to act on behalf of the people and are answerable to them.  Directors, chief executive officers or full-time officials are not accountable to the people in that fundamental sense and any new arrangements that give considerable powers to directors of regional boards of education, who would be directly answerable to the Department, the Minister and the Dáil through a number of chains of communication, are not an adequate alternative to our system of democratic accountability in a number of institutions, particularly vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>In addition, public representatives have played a noble role in vocational education committees.  Many councillors have given years of service to vocational education committees and have made noble contributions in the areas of adult education, further education, youth work, traveller education etc.  This experience and contribution should be generously recognised and not undermined.</P>
    <P>There is not a need for two sets of competing intermediate structures in the education system.  It is politically dishonest of the Minister to suggest that one can establish regional educational boards while retaining some vocational education committees.  It is clear from the White Paper and the establishment of the rationalisation committee on vocational education committees that the Minister intends to considerably reduce the number of vocational education committees.  It is dishonest to suggest that the remaining vocational education committees can survive in any effective way side by side with the new regional education boards as there would be considerable duplication and overlapping and unnecessary rivalry and competition would develop.  This is a recipe for bureaucratic disaster and does not have my support.</P>
    <P>On the role played by vocational education committees in the development <Col N="389" /> of education since their establishment in the 1930s, the 38 vocational education committees have more than 60 years expertise and experience in delivering technical instruction and vocational education generally and their work and influence has developed and changed over the years.  They provide a wide range of education and have been responsible for much of the innovation in the system.  They have proven to be adaptable, capable of moving with the times and of responding in a modern way to the market place.  We must remember that it was the vocational education committees who were involved in the establishment of the national network of regional colleges and colleges of technology.  This is an achievement which cannot be underestimated.  The vocational education committees have proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms for broadening access to third level education. Vocational education committees oversaw the establishment of many regional technical collegess and administered them up until recently.  The House should commend the vocational education committees on this achievement which has not been generously recognised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees have also interacted very successfully with FÁS in the development of apprenticeship programmes and apprenticeship education generally.  They pioneered the world of adult education for many years before it became fashionable to do so. They are involved in many youth organisations and in the provision of youth and sport facilities.  The range of activities vocational education committees provide is impressive.  For example, music would not have been advanced to the same extent in many rural areas without the progressive leadership role adopted by vocational education committees and teachers in developing county music schemes.</P>
    <P>Public perception may not always have matched reality in terms of the vocational education committee's contribution to education.  Some vocational <Col N="390" /> education committees have not performed brilliantly at all times; unfortunately mistakes have been made by some vocational education committees at certain times but this does not justify an outright attack on the system or the deliberate attempts to undermine the contribution they have made to education.  The Minister and her Department are responsible for the negative attitudes to the vocational education committee system in the past two to three years.  An attempt has been made to soften up public opinion and to prepare the ground for the abolition of vocational education committees.  This has taken the form of selective leaks about certain vocational education committees and has resulted in a lack of any clear Government recognition of the role and contribution of vocational education committees.  Morale among the members of many vocational education committees is low because it is perceived that the Government and the Minister have no time for them.  In their analysis of vocational education committee structures Brown and Fairley summarised their strengths as embracing support and co-ordination, partnership and community, innovation and responsiveness.  We should cherish these attributes dearly and should not move easily to undermine them or remove them from the education system.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees have been very strong in response to the needs of the less well off and disadvantaged in the community.  This was an important factor in the establishment of the vocational education committees in the 1930s and it continues to be an important factor.  The modern manifestation of vocational education committees assistance to the disadvantaged in the community can be found in the extensive youth education service and the development and support given to the Youthreach programme for early school-leavers which has proven to be very successful despite limited resources and a lack of co-ordinated and concerted Government policy on early school leaving.</P>

      <Col N="391" /> The chronic problem of long-term unemployment has been well addressed by the vocational education committees. A lack of skills and educational achievement has condemned many people to a life on the dole queue and education is the key to opening the door to jobs and subsequent prosperity for them.  In this context, the VTOS was well managed by the vocational education committees. This scheme has proven to be an outstanding success since its introduction in 1989 by Deputies Woods and O'Rourke.  We have seen at first hand the tremendous success of the scheme in helping people who were long-term unemployed.  This indicates the extent to which the teachers and administrative staff of vocational education committees were capable of adapting and responding to changing needs and attitudes, to deal with adult learners.  Many of these teachers taught mainstream subjects in the junior and senior certificate cycles and adapted quickly to administer VTOS and deal with the further education sector.  I will not refer in detail to the further education sector but I am on record as describing it as the most innovative and effective development in education in recent years.  We should thank the vocational education committees for their outstanding contribution to the development of this sector.  The vocational education committees have responded to the demands of the market place and provided education in a broad and diverse range of subjects.  The teaching and administrative staff of the vocational education committees deserve praise for their tremendous contribution in this area.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil accepts the need for the devolution of authority from the top downwards.  We favour the devolution of the greatest degree of power and authority from the Department.  In this context, the boards of management of schools should have a considerable degree of authority and responsibility for the operation of schools on a daily and weekly basis.  We have carried out <Col N="392" /> research and met the various sectors in the education system and we have been saddened somewhat by the degree of mistrust between them.  The educational system has evolved over many years and different sectors have grown and developed in accordance with their ethos, history and tradition.  There is a need to build consensus from the bottom up before we impose structures from the top down.  For example, the voluntary secondary sector view the emerging regional education boards with great distrust.  They are extremely wary of them and believe they will lessen and undermine the status of the voluntary secondary school.  Likewise, the vocational education committees and other sectors feel threatened by the proposed regional boards and believe they will lead to the ultimate demise of the vocational educational system.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil accepts the need for greater co-ordination, co-operation, joint teamwork and effort between the providers of educational services within a given area.  The first step towards such co-ordination and co-operation is the development of a genuine consensus between the various partners and providers in education, the vocational, primary, voluntary and secondary sectors, parents etc.  As an initial first step in developing co-ordination and co-operation between the various providers county based fora of education should be established so that each county would have its own education forum. These fora would not initially be set up on a statutory basis and could be serviced by a secretariate drawn from either the vocational education committee sector, the voluntary secondary system or, by agreement, from both.  This would be a matter for the providers who would attend the forum which would comprise all providers of educational services in a given county or city area. It would meet regularly throughout the year and would endeavour to co-ordinate and plan ahead in terms of the provision of basic services.  For example, it could co-ordinate activities to deal with the difficulties experienced by early <Col N="393" /> school-leavers, the development of proper psychological services etc.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where co-ordination and co-operation can be developed further between the various providers of education.  We should start by establishing a forum of education in each county or city.  We recently met representatives from County Clare where such a forum has been in place for some time.  I have read a number of their reports and the meetings were attended by a broad representative grouping from all the sectors.  Considerable consensus emerged in regard to a number of issues as did the view that the county forum concept could play a useful role in the co-ordination of courses and provision of services.  They also agreed that such a body should encompass the primary and second level systems.</P>
    <P>We should establish a forum in every county.  These fora could evolve and develop into statutory education authorities on a county by county basis based on the experiences garnered through the fora.  Consensus must be built from the bottom up, not imposed from the top down.  Such a proposal has the best chance of success in the future and offers the best model for the development of an intermediate tier. Fianna Fáil is prepared to give its support for the development of such a system.</P>
    <P>I am at all times concerned about the cost implications of any intermediate tier and express the same reservation in relation to the development of county based education authorities.  I believe in a step-by-step approach and development of consensus initially.  With consensus established, much can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the Minister's proposals to establish new regional education boards.  It is important that the issue be debated.  I have been concerned for some time that the Minister has neglected to keep Dáil Éireann informed of developments in the education world, particularly in the context of the reforms announced in the <Col N="394" /> White Paper on Education.  There have been too many private seminars and briefings, leaks to newspapers about legislative proposals and so forth.  All legislation ultimately must come before the Oireachtas.  The Minister should have due regard and respect for the legislative role of Deputies and Senators who will be asked to make a contribution and asked to vote for the legislation which will give effect to the establishment of ten regional education boards.  In that context Fianna Fáil will be opposing the legislation and on its return to office will abolish any regional education boards established.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that consultation should take place with various partners and other groupings and not with Members of the Dáil or Seanad.  There has been only one debate on the White Paper since its publication.  There has been no debate at the Select Committee on Social Affairs on this proposal or any other proposed legislation dealing with education issues.  The Oireachtas has not been involved in any meaningful way in the education legislative process. Many Bills have been promised, yet there has been little consultation with Members.  That is regrettable and the reason I was anxious to ensure the issue was debated in the House.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There comes a time in the tenure of office of every Minister when he or she begins to contemplate on the harsh realities of political life and the inevitable departure from office.  If one's party's support is running at 4 per cent in crucial by-elections, it tends to focus the mind on what one has accomplished and left to posterity, one's mark of distinction, the questions of by what measure have the lives of the electorate improved because of one's public service, what legacy one has bestowed to the nation and what legislation has made a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end the White Paper has been scoured from one action packed page to another, read inside out and upside down, pushed at, nudged at, cajoled, <Col N="395" /> wined and dined and brought from convention to forum and back to Marlborough Street, all to secure just one shred of an innovative idea, the minutiae of something new that the parliamentary draftsman can encapsulate in a Bill to give the Minister her swansong, her bequest to the nation.  The wheel has stopped at regional education boards.</P>
    <P>Not content with the sprawling mass of bureaucracy that is the Department of Education or an attempt to rationalise and reorganise, the Minister has decided to do what any decent Labour Minister would do, add another layer of bureaucracy.  She should go ahead and create more paper and red tape, working parties and committees.  There will be a core board the members of which will be appointed to an education board, subject I am sure to ministerial approval.  This board, in turn, may then establish committees and the specialist groups to advise.</P>
    <P>Where will it all end?  When will we allow teachers to teach and bother about education properly?  We should forget about the time sheet, clocking in and clocking out and the integrity of the school year.  The Minister cannot even guarantee the integrity of the national examinations system.  Above all else this is sacrosanct, but it has now been contaminated.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the education sector is at an all-time low, not just among teachers, parents and administrators but among pupils who are asking what it is all about.  It is about teachers being allowed to teach and pupils who are willing to learn, with each being provided with the funding, resources, structures and means to do so.  What we do not need is yet another level of bureaucracy. What we need is real and tangible education assistance.  There is not a single sound reason for the establishment of regional education boards.  The entire education sector is crying out for more funding and assistance.</P>
    <P>The annual Estimates at the end of last year included a figure of £350,000 for the initial costs of setting up regional <Col N="396" /> education boards for part of this year. By budget day this sum had been dropped from the revised Estimates. The question is how much it will cost to set up regional education boards in a full year.  In the White Paper the matter was side-stepped.  It states that the cost of the boards will represent a marginal additional cost rather than an entirely new area of expenditure.  There is no such thing.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the legislation promised before the summer recess and that regional education boards cannot be established before 1 October, annualised expenditure could not be less than £1.4 million in initial staffing and pre-programme costs.  If we bill-in full staffing, premises and normal general running costs, the additional allocation for the ten regional education boards could not be less than £2.5 million for each board, giving a total of £25 million. It costs £40 million per year to run the education boards in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What else could one do with this spare £25 million?  Who really wants regional education boards?  Every pound spent on a regional education board means one pound less for the children of Ireland.  I am sure the people of Ballybrack and Sallynoggin are not writing to the Minister or standing outside her clinics asking when a regional education board will be established.  If she asks the parents of the children whom she represents, they will give her a different answer.</P>
    <P>I cannot say what the people of Ballybrack and Sallynoggin want, but I do know what the people of Donegal South-West want.  They certainly do not want a regional education board.  Six or seven national schools have been awaiting the provision of extensions for the past two to three years.  We are looking for additional remedial teachers, psychological services, teacher centres, proper disadvantaged teaching posts and access to services that will make a difference in meeting the education needs of our children.  If I had £25 million to spare, I would not throw it at <Col N="397" /> things which will not make any difference to children.</P>
    <P>The 38 vocational education committees have diligently served the community for the past 65 years.  They have been dynamic and innovative.  Not alone have they committed themselves to their core mainline second-level school provision, they have also been responsive to community needs through the provision of outdoor education centres, adult education and training centres, teacher centres, youthreach programmes, VTOS programmes as well as training programmes for travellers and prisoners.  They have co-operated and collaborated with all other agencies and community groups throughout the country and participated in joint ventures which have facilitated and supported local education and economic development.  They are not just committees for vocational schools but for the vocational education sector.</P>
    <P>When the Minister spoke at the IVEA conference in Newcastle, County Down she delivered her speech as if it were a funeral statement.  She spelled out in no uncertain terms what the real role of vocational education committees will be and stated that they will be trustees guaranteeing the ethos of schools. If the Minister does not have the backbone to make the decision to abolish the vocational education committees, she should not insult the people committed to the provision of vocational education.</P>
    <P>The president of the IVEA, a former Fine Gael Deputy, had this to say:</P>
    <P>The IVEA are not interested in the retention of an emaciated vocational sector.  It would be more honest and sensible to abolish all 38 vocational education committees entirely.</P>
    <P>This is not a partisan or a party political matter.  As the Minister would know if she listened to the public representatives from the Government parties, this is bureaucracy versus democracy.  It is a waste of money.  If the Minister is so determined, stubborn and pig-headed as to persist with this foolish plan to introduce REBs, immediately on our return <Col N="398" /> to Government, as our spokesperson said, we will abolish REBs and apply the resources where they are really needed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann welcomes the establishment of education boards on the basis set out in the Government's White Paper on Education, <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> and</P>
      <P>&mdash; recognises generously the very positive role played by vocational education committees in the evolution and development of Irish education;</P>
      <P>&mdash; supports the retention and development of a modernised vocational education committee system, within the new education boards structure, on the basis set out in the White Paper; and</P>
      <P>&mdash; supports the principle of community partnership which will underpin the composition and operation of boards of management in every school and the education boards in every region.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In Ireland, we have always had an enormous respect for education.  We have shown this by the intense debate which led up to the publication of the White Paper.  We show it by an annual investment in education of over £2 billion and we show this regard for education by the continuing debate as we move to implement the White Paper policies.  This huge interest and intense debate is a sign of a healthy society.  This interest means that we realise the enormous importance of education in determining our future.  It means we realise that education must change as times change and that we are all engaged in planning for the education system of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation which will establish <Col N="399" /> the education boards is a central part of that plan.  Its drafting is well advanced. It is most important legislation.  I am especially pleased today to have this opportunity to bring to the House my vision of the education boards of the future and to invite Members to participate in these far-reaching plans for the future.</P>
    <P>I want to address three issues: why is it essential that we decentralise Irish education; why establish education boards and what will they do; what is the future of the vocational education committees?  First let us look at the background which has produced the education system of today.</P>
    <P>The education system has served the country exceedingly well over the decades.  Our people are now one of the best educated in the world.  Standards continue to rise each year.  A recent international report concluded that Ireland was second only to Singapore in the contribution made by education to the competitiveness of its economy. Given this record of success, why do we need to change?  That answer is that we cannot stand still.  We must build on our success.  We must adapt and manage change.  It is essential to set out the basis for our confidence and the new arrangements are both timely and important.</P>
    <P>The present system for central administration of schools, particularly with regard to teacher allocation and provision of school buildings, originates from the time when national schools were first established in Ireland in the nineteenth century.  The Department of Education was established in 1924 and the Minister for Education assumed responsibility for all national, secondary and technical education.  A centralised system of administration was appropriate at that time, given the need to ensure that the education system was developed on a consistent basis.  At that time, it was essential to oversee the development of these crucial sectors at national level.  The Department of Education played a key central role in this development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> The Vocational Education Committee Act, 1930, set up the vocational education committee structure to administer continuing and technical education in the vocational education committee areas.  This development recognised that important aspects of the education system could most effectively be delivered by bodies that were in touch with the needs of the local region.  The vocational education committee system did not affect centralised departmental control of the vast majority of our 4,000 primary and second level schools, control of pre-schools and PLCs, adult education and traveller education, school attendance and school supports.</P>
    <P>We have had massive expansion in education since the 1960s.  Free second level education transformed the educational landscape.  There has been a huge increase in the day-to-day involvement of the Department with this rapidly expanding system, but there has been no change in structure to manage this expansion.</P>
    <P>What has been the result of this?  The Department of Education is overwhelmed with the day-to-day business of the education system, a system in which more than one million students and teachers are involved every day. The Department, through sheer pressure of business, is seen as bureaucratic, unresponsive and slow.  Communities develop a dependency culture while waiting for a central Department to make decisions.  Partnership in planning for education is stifled.  Competition, rather than co-operation between different schools, can result.  That is why now, more than ever, we need decentralised structures in education.</P>
    <P>Given the maturity of our educational system in the 1990s, there is now the need to look afresh at the administrative arrangements.  A number of key challenges facing our education system have been identified.  First, the existing centralised structures, based as they are on an administrative model from the previous century, are no longer appropriate in the context of a modern and rapidly evolving educational system.  The scale <Col N="401" /> of the system has increased greatly over the years.  Education has increased in complexity and subtlety across a number of areas, for example, in providing for the development needs of individuals of all ages, in nurturing social cohesion based on pluralism and diversity and in addressing the broad skill needs of the economy.  The traditional centralised arrangements cannot address these changing needs.  We need a structure that is responsive to the needs of the regions and representative of community interests, not remote from them.  We need to devolve co-ordination and administrative functions from Marlborough Street into the regions, where they belong, and we need to empower our schools to act as resources of learning for their community.</P>
    <P>Second, we are all aware of the need for accountability in the efficient expenditure of public resources.  In today's environment, education quite rightly accounts for a significant proportion of our national resources.  The administrative models we currently have were designed for another age when education was a modest undertaking for the State.  We need new arrangements to administer our education system in an accountable way.</P>
    <P>Third, modern international thinking strongly supports the idea that the appropriate role of any central education authority, such as the Department of Education, should be to focus upon policy development issues.  The actual administration of the system should be as near to the level of selfcontained regions as possible, co-ordinated by the central authority.  The OECD in its 1991 review made this point quite strongly in the context of the Irish education system.</P>
    <P>At a European level, regional and local involvement in administrative matters such as staffing, school building provision and developing linkages with the business environment is now very much the norm.  The central role of the State is generally confined to areas such <Col N="402" /> as overall policy matters, curriculum supervision and quality assurance.</P>
    <P>Empowerment and mobilisation of regional and community resources is a feature of the education systems in countries such as Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands.  Even countries such as Italy, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, which share with Ireland a tradition of highly centralised control of all aspects of the education system, have made significant progress towards devolving responsibilities to the regional level.  We are unique in Europe, therefore, in our level of centralisation.</P>
    <P>Arising out of these various considerations, the development of education boards with a regional focus is a natural progression for our education system. The new arrangements will bring us squarely within the mainstream of best international practice in educational matters while being designed specifically in line with the needs and distinct traditions of our education system.</P>
    <P>Having identified the need for devolution from the centre to the regions, the next questions are, how to implement this devolution and what structures would best serve the needs of students, communities and regions.  The proposals for education boards with a regional focus, coupled with reform of the structures of school governance, are a coherent and sensible response to these questions.</P>
    <P>The education board proposals were not arrived at in a vacuum &mdash; quite the contrary.  In 1994 I published a position paper setting out my thinking on the establishment of education boards with a regional focus.  The position paper was the subject of round-table discussions with all the partners in education.  The final proposals, as set out in the White Paper, reflect the constructive input of the partners.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, in setting out clearly the fruits of many years deliberation on this matter, identifies the key benefits that will attend the devolution of authority from the centre to the <Col N="403" /> regions.  These benefits include enhancing the quality of education; facilitating an effective partnership among all those with an interest in education at national, regional and community levels; realising national objectives in education &mdash; such as equality of access and relevance to the needs of the community &mdash; in an effective way; eliciting a broad level of acceptance from those within the regional remit of the board and reflecting the diversity within the Irish school system; promoting transparency in education, particularly in regard to resource allocation; and enhancing public accountability.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government has good grounds for confidence that the move to regionally-focused education boards will harness the goodwill, expertise and innovation that is found within the regions and within the communities.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by some that the proposed education boards would be too large, too remote and too centralised.  Such criticisms are completely without foundation.  The White Paper stated that there would be ten education boards and set out their geographical remit.  This is based upon county boundaries with the boards varying in size from five counties in the case of the South East Education Board to one local authority area in the case of Dublin city.  The aim in deciding on this geographical spread is to establish regions with a substantial population but which are geographically homogeneous and not excessively extensive.</P>
    <P>It is important to be clear on this point.  The size and structure of boards must be determined in line with one criterion only &mdash; what is best for the education needs of the region.  That is the overriding concern.</P>
    <P>The important concept here is balance.  I pointed out earlier that the existing centralised arrangements cannot continue, but it would be foolhardy to rush headlong to the opposite extreme, where the education system is decentralised to such an extent that we have complete fragmentation, with a <Col N="404" /> multiplicity of educational agencies and a lack of co-ordination at regional level.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposals strike a balance between introducing realistic devolution into the delivery of educational services on the one hand, and avoiding excessive fragmentation of service delivery on the other.</P>
    <P>The regions selected will represent sensible, viable units for co-ordinating a very wide range of educational services at the regional level.  The proposed ten board structure will facilitate the necessary co-ordination at the national level. In addition, the education regions, which will coincide broadly with local Government and health board areas, will facilitate co-operation and co-ordination of service delivery to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>The concern is sometimes raised that the boards might in some way be remote from local communities.  Community interests would be ignored, the argument goes.  Nothing could be further from the reality.  The White Paper proposals, when seen in their entirety and as a coherent whole, will facilitate and encourage participation at local and community level in the education system.  To understand the reason this is so, it is necessary to see the education board proposals in their proper context.</P>
    <P>The education boards are one important element of a series of reforms set out in the White Paper. The same legislation that will provide for the establishment of the education boards will also provide for the establishment of new boards of management in all Statefunded schools at primary and second level.  The legislation will support the schools in providing a high quality education service.  In addition, the schools will develop a renewed focus as a community resource.  Involving the community in the governance of their schools, as well as encouraging the participation of all sections of the community in local schooling, is the way to promote local community involvement in local and community education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> We need only look at the composition of the education boards to see how they will express the principle of partnership: school patrons, including vocational education committees, parents, teachers, public representatives, ministerial nominees and the wider community, including minorities all will have their place on the education boards.</P>
    <P>We will have partnership in planning with an education board in each region and partnership in providing education with a board of management in each school.  It has been claimed that existing support services will be lost following the establishment of the education boards.  There is no basis for this claim. If anything, the boards will be in a position to provide a range of support services that are more in line with the needs of the region.  It has been suggested that the issue of funding the regional education boards has been avoided.  This is not the case.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> makes clear that the establishment of education boards will take place on a phased basis, following the enactment of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The gradual transfer of functions to the boards will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The establishment of education boards will not result in a completely new area of expenditure over and above the present expenditure levels.  Instead, there will be a reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.  In this process, resources will be <Col N="406" /> freed from some areas to help offset resource needs in other areas.  While the resources needed to establish the education boards will naturally be subject to careful appraisal, consideration of any additional costs should take into account the significant benefits which the new arrangements will bring &mdash; benefits in terms of improved regional planning and co-ordination of all education services and the provision of support services to primary and secondary schools in the most cost-effective way.</P>
      <P>Education boards will plan education in the region, in accordance with national policies, harnessing co-operation between schools, empowering communities to take decisions about education.  They will fund education according to national criteria, openly, transparently, subject to public accountability and in a way which will command public confidence.  They will provide schools with supports such as inservice training, building maintenance, curriculum advice and psychological services. They will provide an appeal machanism for complaints and will measure quality in schools through in-depth inspection in the context of the school plans.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that there is a plan to eliminate the vocational education committees.  Some people have attempted to portray the White Paper proposals as an attempt to do away with them entirely or to deprive them of their powers and functions.  This is not true.</P>
      <P>The White Paper states that vocational education committees will be retained and will function as providers of education within the framework established nationally by the Minister for Education and elaborated on regionally by each education board. Exchequer funding and support for the vocational education committees will be channelled through the education boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the establishment of education boards, the vocational education committees will remain in place as statutory committees with substantial local authority involvement and with <Col N="407" /> responsibility for the second-level schools currently under their remit; ownership of their schools; employment of staff, including teachers and the appointment of boards of management to their schools.  The vocational education committees will also be enabled to continue in their role as providers in the following areas, in addition to the general junior and senior-cycle programmes at second level; vocational education and training, including post leaving certificate courses; adult and continuing education; outcentres; the arts in education; and the operation of outdoor education centres.</P>
    <P>The reservoir of experience which the vocational education committee sector has gained will ensure that it will be a key player in the new educational landscape.  While the education boards will plan and support education in the regions, the vocational education committees, together with the other sectors, will be central in its delivery.  Nothing could be clearer and simpler that that.</P>
    <P>The enormous contribution made by the vocational education committee sector to our education system deserves to be recognised generously and without reservation.  I am happy to warmly commend it for the tremendous work it has done and continues to do.  There is no agenda to get rid of the vocational education committees.  On the contrary, we plan to reform and strengthen the vocational education committee sector to ensure it is ready for the new era.</P>
    <P>A key consideration in any proposals for the modernisation of the vocational education committee sector is the need for a vocational education committee to be sufficiently large to provide for the effective concentration of resources.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the area of jurisdiction of many of the existing vocational education committees is too small to be cost effective.  Needs have changed and populations have altered since the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the White Paper, a commission on school accommodation needs has been established to conduct <Col N="408" /> comprehensive demographic and statistical research and to advise me.  The first task of the commission is to examine the existing vocational education committee structure and to report and make recommendations on its modernisation.  The commission has embarked on its task with enthusiasm and openness.  I would like to place on record the extensive consultative process which is taking place.  An advertisement was placed in the national press on 14 March seeking submissions by 29 March 1996. The commission exercised flexibility in the closing date for the receipt of submissions.  In all cases where an extension of time was sought it was granted.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to ensure that every vocational education committee is given an opportunity to make oral presentations to the commission.  The vast majority of the oral hearings have now taken place.  In addition, the IVEA is making a presentation both to the technical working group and to the steering group of the commission.  When the commission finishes its work, every vocational education committee group will have had an opportunity to make a presentation. These consultations have taken place in a spirit of openness and transparency.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the commission on social accommodation needs has been criticised.  It has been said that the school accommodation needs of each region should be a key function of the appropriate education board.  The need to examine school accommodation on a coherent basis is too important to postpone until the education boards have been established and are fully operational.  I consider that the commission, with representatives of the partners in education, is the most effective mechanism for addressing this very important topic.  At the end of its time, the functions of the commission will transfer to the education boards.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the role of the State and the Minister in education arises as part of their overall concern to achieve economic prosperity, social well-being <Col N="409" /> and a good quality of life within a democratically structured society.</P>
    <P>The State must seek to create, promote and support the conditions within which education can realise its potential in society.  The democratic character of society requires education to embrace the diverse traditions, beliefs and values of its people.  Irish education is profoundly influenced by the long commitment of the Catholic and Protestant Churches and other religions to the provision of education.  The vocational education committees have made a significant contribution to the development of the education system.  Ireland has benefited from a distinguished tradition of higher education.  All have served Irish students and society well.</P>
    <P>I trust that Deputies will accept the need to change our education system. That is what the education boards will do.  I firmly believe that our education system must build from the ground up. Our schools must act as a resource for our communities, to promote local involvement in local schooling.  Education boards, together with vocational education committees, must act as a resource for the regions and the Department must act as a resource for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>That is the vision set out in the White Paper.  I call on all Deputies in the House, all who care about delivering a better education system at all levels and in all regions, to support this vision.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks about openness and transparency but her speech today proposes the exact opposite.  It is a classic example of double-speak.  She complimented the vocational education committees on their tremendous role in education.  If the system is working well, why fix it? She said the vocational education committees made an enormous contribution <Col N="410" /> to our education system but also said that the jurisdiction of many of them is too small.  She implied that some people portray the White Paper as an attempt to do away entirely with vocational education committees.  It is significant that she used the word &ldquo;entirely&rdquo; because it gives an indication of her intentions in regard to smaller vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the regional education boards will work in partnership with the vocational education committees, but she also referred to the reallocation of funding and the freeing up of resources.  As additional money will not be provided for the establishment of these boards, funding will be taken from another sector and I have no doubt the vocational education committees will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From where did the proposal to set up the boards emanate?  The Minister mentioned decentralisation.  The setting up of these boards is the antithesis of decentralisation.  The Fianna Fáil Party has always supported the principle of decentralisation to the regions.  The Minister is merely creating an extra tier of bureaucracy.  The vocational education committees will be downgraded to rubber-stamping decisions made at a higher level.  As a former member of a vocational education committee, I am particularly unhappy with the Minister's decision and the proposals in the White Paper.  What will be the cost saving?  Is there a cost implication involved?  If not, why set up these boards?  It will cause great upheaval and a loss of morale in many vocational education committees. When we were in Government we successfully staved off the proposal to abolish some of the smaller vocational education committees.  The Minister knows that she has all-party support for retraining those vocational education committees.  There is all party support for the retention of the Drogheda Vocational Education Committee which is bigger than any of the smaller county vocational education committees and caters for more than 2,000 pupils.  I urge the Minister to tread carefully in her <Col N="411" /> decisions about that vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the Commission on School Accommodation Needs has been open in its deliberations.  I hope it will take into account the views of Members and other public representatives on the vocational education committee structure.  I also hope the Minister will consider the views of Members on all sides about reducing the number of vocational education committees.  These unnecessary boards will merely reduce the influence and power the Minister acknowledged vocational education committees have had for the past 60 years.  If something is working well, why fix it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleagues for bringing this important motion before the House.  While the Minister may believe she will be able to implement this measure with ease, storm clouds are gathering.  Members from all sides of the House, those who benefit from the wide range of services provided by the vocational education committees and those who deliver the services have grave concerns about this proposal.</P>
      <P>I was amazed at the Minister's speech.  It must be galling for those who have given a lifetime of service in the vocational education committees to listen to the Minister's pious platitudes while at the same time she wields the axe to cut the ground from under them. She did not put forward a convincing argument for setting up these boards. She spoke in vague terms about providing for the effective concentration of resources.  What does that mean?  She referred to costs, but costings have not been done.  Deputy Coughlan outlined the increased costs incurred in setting up regional boards in Northern Ireland. The extra resources will not be delivered to those who need them most, they will compound the increased bureaucracy required to deliver the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> The Minister's reference to decentralisation flies in the face of what will happen to the vocational education committees and the regional boards.  This is an attempt to recentralise, to wrest control from county level and give it to regional boards which can be more easily managed and controlled by the Department. Let us wipe the decentralisation suggestion off the slate, the setting up of these boards has nothing to do with decentralisation.  This is the most bizarre decision taken by the Government and it will be fought by our party and many others in the educational system.  If the Minister is successful in convincing her colleagues in Government, particularly the backbenchers in the Labour Party, to implement this issue, it will be reversed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is extraordinary that a Labour Party Minister should make this proposal when it is supposed to be interested in bringing in the lowest common denominator in the decision making process.  This proposal would wrest control from those who have successfully delivered these services for many years.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech to suggest that the vocational education committees have failed to carry out their functions.  This is merely a notional idea put together by the Minister and her officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a commission.  During my time in this House no other Minister has produced so many glossy documents or set up so many costly commissions, none of which has helped to deliver a better education system.  About £200,000 has been expended this year on the commission.  How many remedial teachers might have been provided with that kind of largesse from a Minister who is on an ego trip to perpetuate a notion of hers?  The proposal is extraordinary.  It is sinister in its concept and, despite her earlier platitudes, the Minister said nothing to change my mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to tear down a structure that has been the envy of</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> Europe.  I have had the privilege of serving on a vocational education committee board.  I admit I had a healthy scepticism about what people involved in the boards engaged in.  Although I cannot attend meetings as often as I would like, I attended often enough to see the extraordinary commitment at a range of levels to delivering education in its broadest sense, and to see people struggling with limited resources, but only one clear objective &mdash; to ensure that whatever funding is available will be spent on those who need it, not on the administrative structures that deliver the service.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is extraordinary at a time when we have, rightly, focused on the human resources programme available through the Minister's Department and the tremendous funding from Europe.  If we are to deal with unemployment, the only way is through the education system.  The vocational education committees have been to the forefront in creating new services needed in the education system. In many cases they went beyond their remit, without having to look over their shoulders, and delivered services into the community which were ahead of their time to meet educational needs. They have brought people back into the education system.  They are retraining people.  Consider the contribution being made by the VTOS and Youthreach schemes.  All the schemes within the vocational education committee structure run on limited resources but at all times maximising what is available. Despite this, the Minister proposes to set up ten regional boards, removed from where the needs are, to sit in judgment on what might be divided in a much larger area.  We know from experience that there are many occasions when different counties, for different reasons, at different times, have different needs.  It is those primarily involved who are best able to cater to those needs.  They can react and focus resources and make the correct decision to ensure that the services required at <Col N="414" /> any given time are being made available.  The Minister's proposal is to remove all that in the name of so-called decentralisation which, clearly, it is not.</P>
    <P>Nobody is saying that the vocational education committees are perfect. Nothing in any democracy is so perfect that it does not need adjustment, modernisation, enhancement or change.  The vocational education committees would accept, in a changing world, that changes are needed.  Their proposal to have one vocational education committee in each county is correct &mdash; many counties have two vocational education committees.  Changing that is a step in the right direction, but there is more to it than that.  It must be recognised that development, change and flexibility is essential, and that this is best decided on and delivered at the level at which the vocational education committees operate.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary decision that was taken many years ago to set up regional colleges under the guidance and control of the vocational education committees would not have been made were it not for the drive and the vision of people within the vocational education committee structure that delivered those colleges; they had to go beyond their remit and they had the courage to do it.  They also had the local knowledge to make decisions about what was needed.  It is a tribute to those in the vocational education committees at all levels that that structure has become so important in our education system.  If we were sitting at the regional board structure, would we have that system today?  Would we have a further education system being delivered?  Would we be bringing people back into education who have been out of the education system for a long time?  Education and training is central to any achievement and that has always been recognised by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that we can run a two-tier or twin-track system consisting of regional boards and vocational education committees.  The vocational education committees will be neutered and <Col N="415" /> nothing the Minister said this morning persuades me that the vocational education committees will survive.  They will not, and it is dishonest to suggest otherwise.  If the Minister lacks the courage to be up front about it, she should not be doing what she is doing because there is nothing in what the Minister said since the White Paper was published that would lead one to any other reasonable conclusion than it is the long arm of the Department that is behind the creation of this new structure.</P>
    <P>It is not a structure that is required in our education system.  If the system is not broken why are we trying to fix it? The Minister may smile, but we recognise that there is a capacity in any organisation for change.  The vocational education committees have changed.  I have outlined what they have done in recent decades, but the Minister suggests that we are dealing with a staid old organisation.  Something else that is interesting about the vocational education committees, different from many of our other semi-State bodies that build empires to foster their own ego without any regard to the services they are delivering, is that the vocational education committees never took that approach.  That is a compliment to the people who are on the vocational education committee boards, including public representatives.</P>
    <P>I have never attended a meeting where a party-political stance has been taken, because people realise the importance of the work of the vocational education committees, and that decisions made at that level are crucial for the communities they represent, for the children who seek to be educated.  We need the structure of the vocational education committee, and the dynamism that exists within that structure.  If the Minister tears down this structure it will take us years to recover. If this is pursued it will be one of the worst political decisions I have ever seen.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the Minister <Col N="416" /> should try to foster this new structure when few if any really want it.  As to those who are some way inclined towards it, it is because they feel frozen out for other reasons, but we do not need regional boards to deal with such issues: we need a structure that works. The structure we have is the envy of everybody in Europe.</P>
    <P>Why, when we go abroad or speak in this House or in the European Parliament, do we talk about our educational system?  It is because it is the envy of many countries in Europe and throughout the world.  We are proud of it, and rightly so, because the level of training skills of our youth are our greatest asset. In the midst of this growth and opportunity, the Minister wants to tear it down.  It is a cynical exercise on the part of the Minister, one I can assure her she will not win, not merely because Fianna Fáil in Opposition wants to oppose it but because it is wrong.  She will not win because those in the educational system will not allow her move in the direction she proposes.  We have seen too much of this type of cynical exercise in the past which cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of these negotiations, to which I have referred already, is to agree terms for mutual recognition in relation to technical specifications laid down in the respective markets of each country and to accept the common testing, certification and marking of products.  This will reduce the need for, and cost of, duplicate testing and certification, will open up those markets and facilitate trade growth between the countries in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> The NSAI has responded to this increasing role for standardisation.  As indicated, it has established 14 consultative committees bringing together interests in various industrial sectors with the objective of monitoring worldwide standards work continuously, identifying projects relevant to Ireland and developing Irish positions relating to them.  The NSAI is also represented on the three European standardisation bodies &mdash; CEN &mdash; European Committee for General Standardisation; CENELEC &mdash; European Committee for Electrical and Electronic Standards; and ETSI &mdash; the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.</P>
    <P>Each of these bodies has up to 5,000 standards projects under review at any one time.  The NSAI is also represented on the two international standards organisations, the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and International Electronics Commission (IEC). While the Authority develops national standards as required, the emphasis of its workload relates to the implementation of European and international standards.  In addition, NSAI publishes and distributes a wide range of Irish and international standards, guidebooks and catalogues.  It also published an annual guide to products and processes certified by NSAI during the year in question.  It provides an information and education service for industry relating to standards and regulations applying in various export markets.</P>
    <P>As a result of extensive consultation and planning by the European Commission, a more clearly defined European structure for testing and certification is evolving.  European standards setting out operating criteria for laboratories, certification-inspection bodies and accreditation bodies have been published as the EN 45000 series under European rules these must be transposed into national standards in each member state.</P>
    <P>In addition, the relevant Council of Minister has adopted a resolution endorsing the key issues of the Commission's document on a global <Col N="418" /> approach to testing and certification. These issues include the development of national accreditation structures, the promotion of the EN 29000 and EN 45000 series of standards, relating to quality assurance systems and the operating criteria for laboratories and certification bodies respectively, and the establishment of the European Organisation for Testing and Certification &mdash; EOTC.</P>
    <P>Accreditation involves giving national authorities the responsibility of assessing the abilities of test laboratories and certification bodies to properly carry out their tasks.  It formally recognises competence by means of third party expert technical assessment against agreed criteria.  It also involves regular surveillance and periodic reassessment.  Accreditation in Ireland is carried out by Forfás through another autonomous committee, the National Accreditation Board, established under section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>A consequence of developments at European level is that national accreditation systems must comply with requirements for the establishment of &ldquo;notified bodies&rdquo;.  These are testing laboratories and certification-inspection bodies which are specifically designated by member states and notified to the European Commission to carry out the conformity assessment requirements as set out in the relevant directives.</P>
    <P>A number of different conformity assessment procedures are set out in the directives.  They vary from simple product certification to product design, manufacturing procedures and quality system certification for complex products used, for example, in the medical field.</P>
    <P>A key requirement of notified bodies is that, apart from having the necessary technical competence, they should operate independently and impartially and have a separate legal identity.  They are expected to conform to operating, including organisational, criteria laid down in the EN 45000 series of standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> In our case this requires that testing laboratories operated by Forbairt and NASI certification procedures, and those of other bodies be accredited within an independent and impartial system.  Only in this way can they comply with the EN 45000 series of standards.  This also requires that the bodies concerned have a separate legal identity.</P>
    <P>In summary, the objectives of the EN 45000 series of standards require that accreditation functions and certification functions be carried out by authorities which are absolutely independent of one another.  Accordingly, under present structures, the National Accreditation Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland &mdash; both of which now operate as committees of Forfás &mdash; do not meet the key operating and assessment criteria required by the EN 45000 series of standards for such bodies.</P>
    <P>The National Accreditation Board cannot, in the present circumstances, accredit NSAI as a certification body and the integrity of NSAI certificates, including the one thousand ISO 9000 certificates already issued by them, could potentially be called into question in the continued absence of conformity with legal requirements related to operational independence of agencies.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the necessity for accreditation, I have had a number of different approaches examined, including a number put forward by the staff interests in NSAI.  I consulted my legal advisers, the NSAI itself, the National Accreditation Board, the European Organisation for Tests and Certifications and officials in Directorate &mdash; General III of the European Commission.  The advice I received was that the setting up of an independent national standards body was necessary.</P>
    <P>I am therefore, proposing, that responsibility for the accreditation of laboratories, certification bodies and inspection bodies should remain with Forfás but that Forfás's responsibility for standardisation/certification matters, <Col N="420" /> at present delegated to the NSAI as a committee of Forfás, should be transferred to the NSAI as an independent statutory body under the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Provision for the welfare in all its aspects of existing NSAI staff has been a central concern of mine in drafting this Bill.  Section 38 provides for the staffing of the new authority.  It requires that staff currently carrying out functions related to standardisation within Forfás should transfer to NSAI.</P>
    <P>It guarantees them the same rights which they currently enjoy within Forfás in relation to pay, pensions and equality with similar grades in other agencies.  It particularly guarantees staff members the right to apply also for any promotional opportunities which are advertised in Forbairt, IDA Ireland and Forfás.  The provisions of the Bill as they relate to staff matters are such as to allay any fears that personnel in the NSAI would be disadvantaged in any way when, on the passage of this Bill, the agency is established as an autonomous legal entity and is functional separate from Forfás.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides the Minister with the right to appoint not more than 13 members to the board of the new authority.  The Bill follows the common international approach in requiring that only those persons who are already directly interested and involved in the standardisation process should be considered for representation on the board. It requires that the board should comprise the widest range of interests possible without any one section predominating.  It will thus be possible to ensure that consumer interests as well as safety experts will be represented, together with a range of interests of manufacturers and industrialists.  The chief executive officer will automatically become a member of the board.</P>
    <P>The autonomous establishment of the NSAI is a significant development.  It involves a necessary change in the structure and status of the organisation.  That change will enhance its role and ensure <Col N="421" /> that an awareness of the importance of standards and their certification is further profiled nationally and internationally.  It will bring the best out of the organisation and ensure its future prosperity through the most effective delivery of its important national task.</P>
    <P>As the responsible Minister, I can also understand how change in any organisation can give rise to concerns on the part of its employees.  In my view there is no basis for such concerns by reference to the provisions of the Bill.  I believe however, that the fullest involvement of staff at all levels will enhance morale and increase efficiency. Workers should be facilitated in making the fullest contribution to the operations of the NSAI and be directly involved in its decision-making processes.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I intend to propose an amendment to paragraph 2 of the First Schedule, on Committee Stage, to make specific provision for representation of worker representatives on the board of the NSAI so that they have the influence and authority to inform decisions, be they of an operational or policy nature.</P>
    <P>Provision for such worker representation has not been a feature of the NSAI board to date.  My commitment to provide for it now should give all employees the confidence to approach the organisational change which is in prospect with renewed assurance and the expectation of an even better working environment characterising the newly constituted NSAI.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main provisions of this Bill and the rationale which gave rise to its introduction.  It is not contentious legislation but one which is informed by an increasing focus on the part of the European Union and international agencies on the importance of establishing and achieving product and process standards.  That importance reflects the role which agreed and recognised standards now play in facilitating trade growth, economic development and employment creation.</P>
    <P>The legislation, when enacted, will <Col N="422" /> reinforce the independence of the National Standards Authority of Ireland by making its certification and standards development services totally independent of other agencies which are charged with delivering different tasks.</P>
    <P>The importance of standards and their certification is central to the whole process of economic development.  This legislation will put the NSAI on a very sound legal and administrative footing. It is important to do this quickly.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to constructive and informative debate on its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and add at the end of the motion the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;this day six months, in order to ensure that the concerns of the staff of NSAI to the proposed changes be fully addressed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has taken the unusual step of proposing an amendment to the Second Reading of this Bill because of the serious concern of the staff of Forfás in relation to this legislation.  Our party believes that there has not been a sufficient attempt to take on board the concerns of the staff and we believe a six month break is necessary to thrash out the issues and determine what changes are required.</P>
      <P>The background to this Bill is significant in the reason for our amendment. The Bill was first suggested when Fianna Fáil and Labour were in Government.  My colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan, had gone a long way down the road of meeting with people and talking over the format of the Bill. There was a specific reason for its proposal then.  At the time, Forfás could not appoint subsidiaries as the legislation establishing the body did not allow for this.  Therefore, the NSAI could not be set up as a subsidiary.  The position was well outlined in a letter written by the chairman of the NSAI, Mr. John Donlon, who stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> The reason for the change in Government policy in February 1994 to establish NSAI as an autonomous body arose from the recognition that it was impossible for Forfás to implement the arrangement for NSAI, together with ICLAB, to be made subsidiaries under section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1993.  This arose from a legal opinion obtained by Forfás from senior counsel in December 1993.</P>
    <P>The chairman made clear in the letter that this inability to appoint subsidiaries was the Government motivation at the time.  Last year, under the Industrial Development Bill, 1995, specific powers were given to Forfás and its agencies to appoint subsidiaries.  In fact, bar some matters relating to county enterprise boards, this was the sole purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the Second Stage debate on the Industrial Development Bill on Friday, 7 July 1995, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, said in relation to subsidiaries as reported in volume 455, column 1690, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>there are areas of activity, particularly in relation to Forbairt that may in future be considered more appropriate to be carried on outside the mainstream of the agency concerned.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister in fact suggested that the matters before us today might be in mind for a subsidiary, as can be seen from the Official Report. He suggested that functions from the Eolas brief, which was where the NSAI was before the three new agencies were established, would be suitable for the subsidiaries.  There is a necessity for the Minister to explain what he had in mind when he sought the powers to establish subsidiaries under the Industrial Development Bill.  Based on the letter of the NSAI chairman, it would appear that the Industrial Development Bill solved all the problems and was the way forward.</P>
    <P>In my view, these facts require that a <Col N="424" /> fundamental rethink takes place on the legislation before us.  The staff of the NSAI deserve explanations as to what is going on.  They believe the whole situation has been contrived by the executives of the NSAI.  The staff believe the management have their eyes on big jobs and big money and the only way this can be achieved is with a separate agency. The staff also claim that the main investigation and review of the options for the NSAI have been done by its own management.  The staff accused the management of sitting in closed judgment and of having gone to the EU and made the case for the establishment of the agency as a separate entity.  By the time the Department of Enterprise and Employment got to review the matter the deal was done.  The staff also say the management advised the EU of potential conflicts of interest and in this way advanced their own case for separate agencies.</P>
    <P>These are serious charges that must be answered.  For some time, I have been calling for a halt to be put to the turf wars between agencies and for a rationalisation of the agencies.  I do not want Members to accuse me of shedding crocodile tears.  We were in Government when what I now consider to have been a very grevious mistake was made on the break-up of agencies.  I admit to what happened to them.  It was decided by Cabinet, of which I was not a member, but I clearly implemented the spirit of it because I was a Minister of State in the Department and spoke in the Dáil and Seanad as a follow-up to Deputy Ruairí Quinn on it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the proliferation of agencies at that time sent out a signal that it was open season for more and more agencies and rather than having agencies which are leaner, fitter or meaner &mdash; whatever is the appropriate adjective &mdash; there is an almighty turf war going on between the various agencies to such an extent that in some regional offices of IDA/Forbairt there is internal fighting as to who answers the telephone and to what manager that query should be addressed, whether it <Col N="425" /> be IDA inward investment, Forbairt or an amalgamation of the two.  It has led to a mess.  Instead of the energies of people in those agencies being devoted to getting jobs domestically or internationally for Ireland, a great part of their energies is used in putting ringfences around their own areas of responsibility.  I have domestic knowledge of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. As part of our election manifesto, which will be published shortly, I will be detailing what I intend to do in that regard.  As well as all the bureaucracy, there is also a question of double and treble costs for the same functions.  The establishment of this separate agency is likely to cost approximately £1 million per annum.  Need that cost be incurred?</P>
      <P>The NSAI traces its history to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961.  It has operated as a division of IIRS, later as part of its successor body, EOLAS and latterly as Forfás.  There have been many signposts along the road.  In its different formats it appeared to deliver a good service in developing, publishing and promoting standards for products and services to ensure they meet market requirements and are safe.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland joined the European Union, with its increasing emphasis on a common market for goods and services, NSAI has played a vital role in ensuring that the necessary new standards to support this movement met Ireland's needs. NSAI also provides a certification service to manufacturing-service companies.  That service has certified more than 1,400 companies to the quality system standard ISO 9000.  Ireland now ranks among the top three countries in the world in terms of the number of companies certified to this standard compared to the size of its industrial base. This certification service is self-financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stated reason for setting up the <Col N="426" /> NSAI as an autonomous body is to bring it into line with similar moves in other European countries.  It is also claimed that the move is necessary to ensure that NSAI could operate as an impartial certification body in accordance with European standards which govern the operation of this type of body.  However, there is no mention of any EU directive in this Bill or any legal or mandatory obligation on us to change.  I note the Minister referred to the requirements of the European Commission, yet he made no direct reference to any directive that requires the establishment of another State agency.</P>
    <P>Two observations must be made to the claims that the change is driven from Europe.  We checked the position with the European office and other agencies, but were told there is no set pattern across Europe on certifying bodies.  The European Accreditation Council does not require the certifying body to be separate.  All that is required under guidelines EN 45012, to which the Minister referred, is that if the certification activities are carried out by a legal entity which is part of a larger organisation, the links with other parts of that organisation should be clearly and definitively laid down.</P>
    <P>These guidelines are voluntary standards, subject to ongoing change.  The European Accreditation Council is a voluntary organisation.  The Minister acknowledged that when he said that the European situation is evolving rather than having evolved.  Therefore, why are voluntary codes and voluntary bodies driving the legislative schedule here?  Could any necessary change not be achieved with a subsidiary of Forfás. I would go further than that.  I have said on other occasions that the proliferation of agencies has reached farcical proportions.  The time has come for rationalisation.  The integration of Forfás back into the Department of Enterprise and Employment should be considered in consultation with the staff of Forfás, the other agencies and the Department.  It does not make sense that two units are <Col N="427" /> developing policy.  If Forfás was integrated back into the Department, two separate policy groups could be established, one for small business and one for big business.  If that was done together with staff consultations, bodies such as the NSAI could become subsidiaries of Forbairt.  That would prevent a mass of new State agencies.  The other technical matters handled by Forbairt could also be established as separate subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>That way forward would be preferable to another stand-alone agency.  At present, there must be 200 State agencies dealing with enterprise matters. They include Forfás, Forbairt, IDA Ireland, An Bord Tráchtála, the Crafts Council, 35 enterprise boards, 35 area partnership boards, 36 Leader groups, grant aid from 50 funds, the FÁS back-to-work scheme, social welfare payments for those who work a certain number of hours a week and Údarás na Gaeltachta schemes available to people who live in designated areas.  An interesting map of a county setting out the number of agencies offering a plethora of supports and guidance to would-be business people was sent to me recently.  The would-be business person who sent me that map said he was perplexed about the number and proliferation of agencies and that he would apply to all of them for fear that he might lose out.</P>
    <P>The only group in the Forfás-Forbairt mix that may require a stand-alone structure is the Irish National Accreditation Board.  From my experience as Minister for Education and taking account of the training provided by FAS, I consider this particularly relevant.  It is untenable to have the NSAI and the Irish National Accreditation Board in such close quarters as that board makes decisions on standards and awards.  That much smaller accreditation board could easily be established in its own right without any major cost.  Has the Minister examined this proposal?  He should do so as much emphasis has been placed on that in <Col N="428" /> education and training circles. TEASTAS, an education-industry training body, will set standards and make awards.  The National Accreditation Board, a small grouping, will decide if an ISO standard should be awarded and the standards to be attained for such awards.  From an educational standards point of view, it makes sense that the accreditation board should be established in its own right.  I do not make that point as a browbeating measure, but that body should be properly distanced from the other to enable it to set proper standards and ensure they are rigorously met.  Will the Minister consider making the accreditation board a subsidiary of Forfás while making the NSAI a subsidiary of Forbairt?  That would set a distance between the functions of accreditation and certification which should be properly distanced. Has the Minister investigated that matter with the EU?  Did he establish that subsidiary status for the NSAI would not be appropriate and, if so, will he lay before the Oireachtas correspondence in that regard?</P>
    <P>If the proposal to separate the NSAI from Forfás proceeds, what does it mean for other State agencies which have certifying bodies within them? Must they also be set up as autonomous agencies?  Will all the accreditation activities be passed to new semi-State agencies?  There is a danger that we will have another raft of State agencies dealing with enterprise.  If that happens, and it would appear inevitable if we are to accept the logic for the establishment of the autonomous NSAI, there will be major cost implications.  Already, costly and complex structures are in place with Forfás, IDA Ireland and Forbairt.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report never envisaged such a hierarchy or that by replacing two agencies we should create three.  If this proposal proceeds, we will have four and it will also spawn life in other areas.  In a few months there will be more empire building.  I trust that the Minister's common sense makes him aware that inherent in many proposals <Col N="429" /> put forward is a strong element of empire building, not so much among the Indians as among the chiefs.  When I was a Minister I remember getting files proposing developmental advances and making decisions on them.  Following up the developments years later, one inevitably finds that the beneficiaries are not consumers or taxpayers but empire builders who see opportunities for their own good.</P>
    <P>The cost of establishing the NSAI as an independent agency could be £1 million.  There will be a new chief executive and support staff, extra administration costs and greater overlap with other agencies.  Not all the work of the NSAI is self-financing.  As part of Forfás, the NSAI has access to specialists outside its own areas.  There is considerable interaction between specialists in the larger agency which will be lost if there is to be a separation.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the motion specifically refers to staff concerns.  The staff do not favour the separation of the NSAI from Forfás or the reassignment of their contracts of employment to a new State body.  The result of a staff survey highlight the level of concern.  In a poll answered by 77 of the 103 staff in the NSAI, 61 did not agree with the proposal to separate the NSAI's functions from Forfás, 13 favoured the change and three votes were spoiled.  Of those polled, 62 said they would not willingly transfer employment from Forfás to an independent NSAI agency.  Of the respondents, 70 said that staff should have a choice about transferring and 65 said that staff should have the option to return to Forfás within two years of the creation of the NSAI.</P>
    <P>The staff also have concerns about the deterioration in staff conditions in a new agency.  Their conditions already appear to be less than satisfactory. About 66 per cent of the staff are curently on contract and some of the staff have been in that position for seven years.  In a smaller agency staff will have fewer promotion opportunities.  The Minister of State indicated that NSAI staff will continue to be able to compete <Col N="430" /> for promotional opportunities in IDA Ireland, Forbairt and Forfás.  Has this been agreed with the unions in those organisations?  Has management in those organisations indicated to the Minister of State how many vacancies will go to NSAI staff?  It would appear most unlikely that agencies will give promotions to staff from outside their organisations.  If they had such remarkable generosity of spirit, would that not cause internal industrial relations difficulties?</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives the new authority the power to establish subsidiaries.  There are already fears that contract staff may be told their jobs have been transferred to the US, for example, and they may take it or leave it.  Forbairt staff are also concerned about the Bill because section 8 states that all functions related to standardisation, harmonisation or inspection invested in Forfás will only be exercised by the new authority. Technical work is carried out on assignment from Forbairt.  This measure could have implications for Forbairt's technical staff.  Will they become part of an autonomous agency?  In principle I welcome the proposal that worker directors should be appointed to the board and that consumers should be represented on the NSAI &mdash; the Minister of State intends to propose that as an amendment.</P>
    <P>I seek a six month delay to see if the problems can be worked out.  The staff I have met seem reasonable and innovative in the solutions they have put forward.  They have proposed a new format for the certification activities of the NSAI and this struck a chord with me in terms of the integrity of the accreditation process and the need for distance to be established.  However, this has not been considered but has been summarily dismissed.  The staff believe that the management of the NSAI are going through the motions and the deal is done.  I would be surprised if the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, continued to condone such industrial relations practices.  The ideas behind the Bill are good.  However, I <Col N="431" /> propose this amendment in order that the process should be correct.  While the ideas are good in theory, their development and the motives behind them need to be more thoroughly examined.  That could be done in the extended period referred to in the amendment.  The amendment is proposed to take into account the staff concerns and I hope many of the issues could be addressed more completely in the six-month period.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said he did not consider this Bill contentious. I was inclined to agree with him until I heard Deputy O'Rourke's concerns.  In the context of concerns about State agencies I support the views expressed in the Culliton report.  However, this Bill does not concern an agency which deals directly with jobs or investment. We are dealing with the establishment of an independent statutory body where before such an agency did not exist.  I welcome the Bill from that point of view.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the NSAI as an independent statutory body reflects a greater recognition of the need for quality management standards in Irish industry and business.  A growing number of companies have received the ISO 9000 quality system standard which is a testament to the progress made.  I agree with the Minister of State that the NSAI's certification service has had a dramatic impact in Ireland over the past five years.  Companies have come to realise that such standard marks are not just an optional extra, rather they are a must if they hope to survive in the competitive international business environment.  These standards are quoted extensively by specifiers in public and private purchasing requirements.  Certification by the NSAI complies with international standards.  It is recognised world wide as conveying an assurance of quality and conformity to recognised performance requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the NSAI as an independent statutory body strengthens <Col N="432" /> its role in helping industry to understand and to meet the technical quality and safety requirements of European and international standards in the domestic and overseas markets.  With the advent of the single market, its role in ensuring compliance with stringent European standards on the quality and safety of products should not be underestimated.  With the NSAI's access to the latest information on the development of standards in more than 90 countries, it plays a key global role which will be enhanced with the new independent status.</P>
    <P>Given the expert advice and assistance it provides to industry, it is interesting to note that the National Standards Authority does not fulfil the requirements of ISO 9000.  It is by no means an exception in the public service in this regard.  Any agency such as the NSAI should operate to high standards. It may prove a challenge to the new statutory authority to pursue the type of standards adopted by other companies and agencies.</P>
    <P>The public service has quite a distance to travel in terms of quality and standards.  Some semi-State companies have faced up to the challenge of achieving higher standards of service but the same cannot be said of the Civil Service and public service in general.  Taxpayers will pay the Government more than £12 billion in 1996 to provide a range of public services. However, ideas of quality assurance and customer service do not feature high on the agenda of Government Departments and Offices.  The National Standards Authority catalogue lists more than 1,500 Irish-based holders of the ISO 9000 standard.  Less than 2 per cent of these are State organisations, despite the fact that the State employs one in four people in the workforce.  This is clear statistical evidence that there is a quality management deficit in the public sector and we have paid a high price as a result.  If the Blood Transfusion Service Board had operated a quality management system, would the horrendous problems that arose with regard to <Col N="433" /> hepatitis C have occurred?  One must only consider the plight of the hundreds of women who contracted this disease to assess the scale of those deficiencies.</P>
    <P>ISO certificates are held by semi-State companies such as Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Bord na Móna, the ESB and Telecom Éireann.  In many cases the certificates only cover certain aspects of the companies' operations. When some agencies proudly state they have achieved a standard, they may only be referring to certain divisions of their organisations having achieved a standard.  It is not acceptable that more than 90 per cent of public servants work in organisations which have not attained a recognised international quality standard.  It is vital that political pressure be exerted to ensure that this quality deficit disappears.</P>
    <P>A major opportunity to tackle this problem was presented in the form of the strategic management initiative launched by the Government last week. A specific time frame should be set to achieve these standards.  Perhaps the year 2000 might be the deadline for change.  Alternatively, the Government could develop a quality regime along the lines of the citizens' charter recently implemented in the United Kingdom.  In Northern Ireland, the passengers' charter sets out standards to which Northern Ireland Railways must operate in punctuality, reliability, cleanliness, etc.</P>
    <P>Irish people may not be aware of increasing international pressure for high quality standards and standards of excellence.  There are two ways in which the benefits of setting a standard may be seen.  Companies will have objective measures against which they can benchmark their activities and performance. This is increasingly important in global markets, particularly for Irish companies dealing with their counterparts in the United States where &ldquo;benchmarking&rdquo; is a buzz word.  The Irish standard has been set for the past five years and this provides enormous help to companies attempting to do business abroad against the odds.  It also gives customers <Col N="434" /> and consumers a certainty so that consumers of a service can see that there is an objective measurement of a company with which they wish to do business, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties experienced by Irish exporters is in reassuring prospective customers.  Irish companies entering foreign markets will be questioned about their identities and required to give assurance in relation to the service or product on offer.  It is important that there be some way to provide a benchmark.  This is where quality marks and the ISO come in. They provide comfort and reassurance to receivers of a service or purchasers of a product.  This gives an extra lever to Irish business.</P>
    <P>On funding I understand the basic cost of establishing the new statutory agency will be £1 million but it is expected that the agency will be self-financing to a large extent.  It is important that the service provided by this agency be competitively priced so that companies will be attracted and will feel it is something they must actively pursue and which is very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I recognise the concerns expressed by staff with regard to the establishment of a separate agency.  Those concerns must be addressed.  However, in terms of quality, there must be seen to be autonomy within such an organisation.  I welcome the statement of the Minister of State that it is intended to have a worker-director on the board.  This may go some way toward allaying the fears of the people already involved.  It should be possible to ensure that the new agency is established within a specified time frame as it is a necessary development.  I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that the agency be seen to be independent and autonomous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill.  Its purpose is to enable the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to provide for the establishment of the NSAI as an independent <Col N="435" /> statutory body and to transfer to it from Forfás those functions relating to standards and certification.</P>
      <P>The NSAI dates back to the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961. Since then it has operated as a division of the IIRS and Eolas.  Most recently the NSAI operated as a division of Forfás when that body was established by the Industrial Development Act, 1993.  The NSAI develops and publishes national standards and provides a comprehensive management system and certification service for industry and commence.  In the environmental area, the NSAI work programme is based on its environmental standards consultative committee &mdash; the ESCC &mdash; which was established in 1992 to bring together all interested parties concerned with the development of environmental standards.  The work of this committee resulted in the publication of a specific standard for environmental management systems IS 310 in 1994.  ISO 310 provides manufacturers with a certifiable environmental standard similar to ISO 9000 in the area of quality management systems to cover the increasingly important area of environmental management.  It is expected that ISO 310 will be replaced by a new ISO standard to give industrial firms here access to a recognised world standard.  With the exception of the British standard, in the past the IIRS and Eolas had little or no competition in this country.  We live and operate in a global economy and at least three companies are now competing for this kind of work.  I am satisfied that the necessary commitment is available among the staff of Forfás to meet this competition.  However, an assurance must be given that the legislation we put in place will improve the position and will not impede their ability to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we joined the European Union, with its emphasis on a common market for goods and services, the NSAI and its staff have played a significant role in ensuring that we have the necessary new standards to support this movement and meet Ireland's needs.  The NSAI also <Col N="436" /> provides a certification service for manufacturing service companies which demonstrate that the product-service they provide meets the published standards.  It is important to point out that the certification service has certified more than 1,400 companies to the quality assurance systems standard ISO 9000 and that Ireland ranks among the top three countries in the world in terms of the number of companies certified to this standard.  Given the size of our industrial base this is a significant achievement.</P>
    <P>The staff of Forfás have asked why this change is necessary.  When the then Minister with responsibility for science and technology, Deputy Brennan, announced in February 1994 his intention to set up the NSAI as an autonomous semi-State body the staff considererd this move to be ill-advised as it would add substantially to the cost of the operation without adding to its effectiveness.  It is claimed that this move is necessary to ensure that the NSAI can operate as an impartial certification body in accordance with European standards governing the operation of this type of body, for example, the EN 45012.  I have been informed by the staff that the European Accreditation Council has published guidelines on the application of EN 45012 which makes specific allowances for the certifying body to be part of a larger organisation with the following qualifications: &ldquo;If the certification activities are carried out by a legal entity which is part of a larger organisation the link with the other part of the operation should be clearly laid down.  Relevant information on activities performed by the other part of the organisation should be given by the certification body.&rdquo;  The 1993 Act under which it was established permits Forfás to set up the NSAI as a certifying body with clearly laid down links so as to preserve its impartiality.  It has been suggested that the Irish National Accreditation Board should be made independent of Forfás and perhaps set up under the Department of Enterprise <Col N="437" /> and Employment.  I ask the Minister to respond to these points in his reply.</P>
    <P>The justification for the setting up of the new body as outlined in the Bill poses questions regarding another division of Forfás, Forbairt.  The main focus of Forbairt is to support companies through a wide-ranging series of activities, including education, promotion, research, consultancy and standards. Will the new structure not give rise to a similar situation for Forbairt, some of whose sections include accreditation activities such as metrology, the National Laboratory and the National Electrical Test Centre?  Will it be necessary for these sections to be independent of Forfás and will this require the introduction of legislation similar to that before us today?</P>
    <P>The NSAI staff have a vested interest in these proposals as it is they who have built up the organisation to what it is today.  The organisation is held in high esteem at European and international level.  Section 38 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall accept into its employment with effect from the establishment day, in accordance with the terms of this Act, every person who immediately before that day was a member of the staff of Forfás and whose principal duties relate to a function vested in the Authority under this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 38 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions relating to tenure which are granted by the Authority in relation to a person accepted into its employment under subsection (1) shall not, while the person is in the employment of the Authority, be less favourable to the person than those prevailing immediately before that person's acceptance into such employment save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade unions or staff associations concerned; and if a dispute arises between the Authority and any such person as to the terms and conditions <Col N="438" /> prevailing immediately before that acceptance into the employment of the Authority, the matter shall be determined by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome this section which preserves the existing conditions of employment but I wish to address the increasing use of part-time and contract workers by Forfás.  This is a major issue as contract workers have no pension rights and find it difficult to secure mortgages.  It is estimated that the ratio of contract to permanent staff in the certification and inspection department of the NSAI is 3:1.  As a Labour Deputy I am deeply concerned about these figures not only as regards Forfás but also in the context of the developing trend nationwide to employ contract staff.  Such casualisation of a work force would not be tolerated by the IDA in securing a potential employer.  I understand it has been the policy of the personnel section in Forfás to review the posts of contract workers in Forbairt and its other agencies after a two-year period.  In the past such positions were made permanent but recently a contract employee received his third contract.  There are 43 contract employees in the NSAI and this does not include nine SIPTU clerical workers who are also engaged on contract work.</P>

Galway is an important city which is developing and requires the best treatment plant that can be put in place.  Following an exhaustive process of analysis I announced the decision on its location.  My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, has said repeatedly that he supports this decision.  I made it clear when I announced the decision in Galway that I was anxious to have the plant built with as little disruption as possible and to receive design proposals which would minimise the visual impact.  This process is ongoing.  The decision is supported by all my Cabinet colleagues and the overwhelming majority of the people of Galway and their elected representatives.</P>

Under the provisions of the Environmental <Col N="442" /> Protection Agency Act the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for overseeing the maintenance of the quality of our environment.  If there is a large quantity of offal to be disposed of, a number of options will be considered. The option of disposing of it in landfill sites will only be availed of where this is compatible with best environmental practice.  A number of other options are being explored.  These include incineration; rendering and incineration of the rendered by-product; freezing and storing until such time as it can be incinerated.  From my perspective and that of the Environmental Protection Agency, best environmental practices will be applied to whatever solutions are required.</P>

      <P>Action Against Litter is a radical initiative designed to prevent and control litter in Ireland and is built on four main foundations: improving local authority performance; reforming, <Col N="443" /> updating and streamlining litter legislation; promoting public awareness and education; and developing effective partnerships with commercial and voluntary interests to combat litter.</P>
      <P>Key actions to date have included: publication of a framework policy statement; mobilisation of support in the local authority, business and voluntary sectors; development and circulation of schools' information packs; and the launch of a multi-media public awareness campaign.</P>
      <P>Work is also proceeding on the preparation of a comprehensive new Bill to replace the Litter Act, 1982.</P>
      <P>An overall budget of £400,000 has been provided for Action Against Litter in 1996, of which an estimated £300,000 will be spent on the public awareness campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain places are particularly prone to litter, for example, the immediate environs of fast food outlets and, sadly, some of our schools and beaches.  In what way is the multi-media campaign targeted at the major offenders in terms of litter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the benefit of two analyses, an analysis of the composition of litter, conducted by my Department, and an attitudinal survey carried out by IBAL, Irish Business Against Litter, a very welcome new organisation established by a co-ordinated group of senior business people to bring the weight of business into the battle against litter.  That organisation indicated the attitude of people to litter and its survey places litter as the number one environmental challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is right in that the two areas that were highlighted in the litter survey as particularly bad were the vicinity of fast food outlets and some schools.  The schools pack is targeted particularly at heightening awareness of post-primary and primary school children of the problem of litter as an environmental question.  Very often school children are animated by world <Col N="444" /> environmental problems, whether relating to the whale, ozone depletion, greenhouse gases or global warming, and are blind to immediate environmental problems such as litter on their doorstep.  A very good video was produced by the Dublin teacher centres to help in the promotion and the pack is being circulated.  I look forward to the impact of that initiative.</P>
    <P>The general campaign of posters, newspapers, radio and television is designed to sensitise the public generally that it is no longer acceptable to despoil our countryside.  The theme, &ldquo;It's our country, don't rubbish it&rdquo;, which is a very good one, is intended to appeal to the sense of patriotism such as that which exists when we swell with pride at the performance of Irish sports teams or when Ireland is performing on an international arena.  I hope the theme will have an impact, but it is only part of the strategy.  Our intention is to build partnerships with local government.  I have had meetings with the chairpersons and chief executives of every local authority, the business community and local groups so that there will be a concerted effort by everybody to work together.  The Tidy Towns Competition and all other such vehicles will be used to change, over a period of time, the attitude of people to litter and I am convinced we will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>What proposals has the Minister in mind to monitor the progress of the campaign?  Can he say today, on his 40th birthday, that Ireland will be a cleaner place when he reaches the ripe old age of 41?  Is there a monitoring system in place so that the Minister can come back and tell the House that the investment of £400,000 was money well spent?  When will up-to-date litter legislation be introduced?  Regardless of how good or well-timed this campaign is, without back-up legislation we will be fighting a losing battle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be ongoing monitoring of this matter.  I have charged local authorities with producing <Col N="445" /> anti-litter plans at local level.  The Bill which, I hope, will be enacted during the course of this year will require particular strategies for local areas, including strategies relating to fast food outlets and so on, to be devised locally. That will involve ongoing monitoring by local authorities.  No doubt that matter will be debated when the Bill comes before the House.  Surveys such as that carried out in preparation for the campaign may be repeated.  I hope there will be an inventory of improvement rather than deterioration.  I agree that all the exhortation in the world will get us so far, but a component of the population will be immune to exhortation and good example and in those circumstances enforcement will be required.  New powers must be given to litter wardens so that those who are immune to good civic awareness campaigns and who continue to be environmental vandals are called to book and pay the penalty.</P>

      <P>In the original Programme for Government &mdash; I would quote it but I am aware that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not allow quotations at Question Time &mdash; commitments were given to refurbish older local authority housing.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment in the Programme for Government is clear and our approach to refurbishment is outlined in Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead.  The underlying trend regarding funding of refurbishment schemes has been to increase the allocation.  Taking into account the exceptional, extraordinary one-off payment which resulted from the tax amnesty, the amount of money involved is considerable, but I accept the Deputy's concern that it is not enough.  In 1995-96 almost £37 million was allocated under the remedial works scheme.  In addition, there is a commitment to provide bathrooms in local authority housing and we are very much on target to meet the objective of 1 January 1998.  An allocation of £4.3 million was made for that purpose over the two years of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new scheme was introduced for extensions to local authority housing, for which £250,000 was provided last year and £1 million this year.  There is considerable investment in refurbishment and remedial works.  I accept that the amount is never enough, but we must keep working to ensure there are <Col N="447" /> adequate resources and that they are used wisely.  I am carrying out a review to ensure we have full information on the operation of the remedial works scheme and to ascertain how best the resources can be used.  It is not simply a matter of physical refurbishment but also of management, and local authorities and local communities are central to the issue of management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister of State's nice words are not backed up with resources.  There have not been any additional resources provided in the past two years.  The Minister of State referred to the bathroom programme which may have been assisted by the tax amnesty in 1994 when £4 million was provided, but that was reduced to £3 million in 1995 and reduced further to £2 million this year. Politicians are fond of using the word &ldquo;review&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a definition of this review which I believe is a tactic to avoid providing additional resources.  Is the Minister of State committed to the nice words in the Programme for Government?  She will be aware that many local authority houses are located in disadvantaged areas.  Will she give people living in those areas some hope that their homes will be refurbished?  I accept that proper management by local authorities is necessary also.  Will she indicate the time-scale for this review?  When will the report be published?  When will we know whether the Minister is committed to the refurbishment of local authority houses or is she backing away from the promises made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The bathroom programme has been very successful and I will give the Deputy an indication of the progress made, not just by this Government.  I am not making absurd claims <Col N="448" /> but it is an indication of the success of this programme that we have reduced the number of local authority dwellings without bathrooms from 6,500 in 1990 to approximately 2,000 at the end of 1995.  There is not any problem in regard to funding for this programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On the remedial work scheme, this programme is carried out at various locations and is making a real difference in areas of deprivation. Resources have been allocated to the tune of almost £37 million in two years. I am not satisfied we are reaching out as far as possible and I am committing much of my time and resources to ensuring that refurbishment is a central part of the overall local authority housing programme.  We must take stock of experience on the ground because of the considerable resources required for major refurbishment works.  It is important to be knowledgeable about housing because many of these refurbishment works are the result of misguided and ill-informed housing policy in previous Governments which reacted in a way that was, in the long-term, extremely costly and caused more problems than were foreseen.  We must ensure now that we direct resources appropriately to meet the need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some validity in what the Minister of State said about the housing policy of previous Governments but we cannot simply tell people living in bad housing conditions that they will have to endure them while we examine the possibility of building new houses.  In the Dublin City Council area, where most of the residents are flat dwellers, there has been a considerable decrease in the number of refurbishment works done this year following on a similar decrease last year.  Will the Minister of State give some consideration to this area when examining the Estimates next year?</P>

      <P>While the living over the business initiative has generated some development, I am disappointed with the overall progress under the scheme to date.  As part of the review of the urban renewal schemes announced last year, I engaged consultants to study the impact, effectiveness and cost of the schemes which have operated to date.  I have asked that the study address the specific issue of living over the business in order to establish what might be required to make this concept more successful.  I will give careful consideration to the consultants' recommendations in framing urban renewal policies to be put in place when the current phase of designation ends in July next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister agrees the scheme has been a failure. That failure is unfortunate because similar initiatives have been successful in <Col N="450" /> England and other countries and this scheme could do a great deal to improve the city.  The reason for its failure is that a person cannot get a first time buyer's grant on buying a refurbished building, and there is also the problem of stamp duty.  If a person wants to buy an apartment in the inner city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State take those considerations into account because they are a major disincentive in the inner city?  It is much more attractive to buy a new rather than an old apartment and if a person asks an auctioneer whether to refurbish a building or build a new one, the auctioneer will advise him to build a new one. Will the Minister of State respond to the two points concerning stamp duty and the first time buyer's grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a disincentive but that is not the only problem with this particular scheme.  I am committed to the policy of developing residential units over commercial properties, particularly in areas where there is general dereliction.  That is a major challenge facing us.  It is not simply a question of stamp duty or the new house grant; other aspects have emerged also.  I would not write off this scheme because in Cork, for example, there has been some success.  The local authority in Cork has taken an interest in this part of the urban renewal programme which has resulted in some benefits.  There is a question mark over the way in which a local authority can enable this kind of programme to succeed.  How can we design incentives to get the responses we need?  There are difficulties in regard to access and design because in many cases we are talking about shops which do not have any access to the upstairs floor.  There are other considerations such as the question of fire regulations, which is currently being examined in the Department.  This is a multifaceted problem <Col N="451" /> that we must resolve.  This is not the arena to develop points but I am interested to hear what the Deputy has to say on this whole question.  I would like to succeed in getting this formula right, as far as is possible, but we cannot force people to develop if they do not have an interest in doing so.  Many shop owners are not interested in that type of development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister of State.  I put forward this idea when I was chairman of the planning committee in Dublin City Council a number of years ago.  That committee met the various people involved, including fire officers, insurance and gas company representatives, etc. and many of the problems that arose were sorted out. The main problem with regard to this scheme is that it is simply not financially attractive for people to refurbish buildings.  We should make it more attractive for people to refurbish buildings as opposed to building new ones because there would be a greater return to the Exchequer.  On another note, the report on developing Dublin's dockland was published and I notice the Minister of State was not involved in that nor had she anything to say about it; the report was launched by another Minister. Given that this is the most exciting urban renewal development in the country, will the Minister of State indicate to the House the reason she did not have any input into this document?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> The review I am carrying out relates to the Act and how it has operated.  While I have special areas of responsibility they do not include Temple Bar Properties or the Custom House docks.  The report refers to the review I am carrying out.  Any questions relating to designation will be as a consequence of the actual review which I expect will be published in June or July.  It is difficult to encompass all the different areas.  We have already touched on the element of urban renewal which involves living over the shop.  There are several different elements to urban renewal.  It actually functions effectively if we can focus on particular areas of responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the pilot scheme on living over the shop, one of which is in Cork, the pace of progress is remarkably slow.  Is it the Minister of State's intention to play a more proactive role in developing the concept of the provision of houses in inner cities? Has she spoken with Cork Corporation recently in respect of its project and, if so, has she established why it is not proceeding at a faster pace?  What factors are militating against faster development in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my pleasant duties in 1995 was to launch a seminar in Cork on the question of living over the shop which was well attended.  I pay tribute to Cork Corporation for adopting such a proactive role.  This is a matter which is best dealt with at local level. I have supported Cork Corporation in every way possible.  I will be making a follow-up visit to Cork in relation to this aspect of urban renewal.  Clearly, the scheme which was put in place has not been effective overall.  We need to learn from its limitations to ensure that the next time we produce a more appropriate one that delivers.  At the end of the day it will always be difficult to convince those who are not developers by nature, but who have other business interests, <Col N="453" /> to get involved in this type of development.  As regards the Deputy's last point, I am determined to promote the idea of living in the city.  I have done so since I came into the Department.  In terms of sustainability, whether it is public housing or private housing, it is the way to go in the future.  It is also of great benefit to residents and the larger community to have a living city.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to address the concerns of people regarding forestry that are not addressed in his recently announced regulations, namely forestry planted by more than one person or over a period of greater than three years.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12, 14, 36, 55, 79 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to promote the development of a strong forestry sector which can contribute to sustainable development, bring economic benefits to the rural economy and have positive environmental and amenity aspects.  Afforestation can also give rise to environmental problems, such as visual intrusion, acidification of water and rural isolation.  To address these concerns, I recently announced a new package of measures relating to forestry development.</P>
      <P>I have made regulations which substantially reduce the current threshold of 200 hectares at which planning permission and environmental impact assessment are required for afforestation projects.  A new threshold of 70 hectares for initial afforestation will apply to all planting commencing on or after 1 October 1996.  In addition, planning permission and environmental impact assessment will be required for cumulative afforestation, i.e., within 500 metres, by, or on behalf of, a single developer over a three-year period, where the afforestation would result in a total area planted exceeding 70 hectares.  In considering environmental impact statements, planning authorities will have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the impact of proposed projects on dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also made arrangements with <Col N="455" /> my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, that the forest service of his Department will introduce additional procedures for grantaided afforestation.  From 1 May 1996, the forest service is to notify local authorities of all projects exceeding 25 hectares in respect of which grant applications are received.  Additionally, local authorities are being asked to designate areas which they consider to be sensitive to forestry development for reasons such as the need to protect views and scenic areas, protection of the natural and archaeological heritage and the avoidance of rural isolation.  Local authorities will also be notified by the forest service of all proposals, regardless of size for afforestation in these designated areas.  Where a local authority is notified of a forestry grant application, any views given by the authority will be taken into account by the forest service in making its decision on any such application.</P>
    <P>It is also the intention of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to clarify and tighten the operation, and ensure enforcement, of the forestry guidelines which contain provisions on environmental controls for afforestation, including provisions on the appropriate distance of forestry from houses and roads.</P>
    <P>Taken as a whole, the package of measures which I have outlined represents a very considerable development of the regulatory procedures applying to forestry development and I do not consider that it would be appropriate to introduce even more stringent provisions as this stage.  My Department will, however, carefully monitor the effects of the new EIA and planning threshold, and the other procedures, and an overall review of the position will be conducted in three years' time.</P>
    <P>I have also stated my belief that there is a case for removing the current exemption from planning permission enjoyed by afforestation which falls below the EIA threshold.  Such a change would give greater flexibility in <Col N="456" /> imposing controls on forestry development than is possible under current legislation.  I will, therefore, be considering appropriate provisions for amending legislation in the light of the experience gained through the non-statutory local authority notification system which I have introduced.  Meantime, I believe that the measures which I have announced will be accepted as a reasonable and balanced approach, in the context of existing legislation, to addressing the legitimate environmental concerns which arise in the case of large-scale afforestation and in the case of smallerscale planting in sensitive areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the new regulations will apply as and from October 1996.  What action does he propose to take in regard to watercourses as it appears there is no direct statement regarding the distance from watercourses or the type of watercourses that will be considered?  He said that afforestation can give rise to environmental problems such as visual intrusion and acidification which affects our streams and rivers.  It is necessary to state clearly the distance from drains and watercourses that trees can be planted.  Does he envisage that the regulations will be implemented with the full support of local authorities?  Where the conditions are not complied with will local authorities have the same rights as under the ordinary planning legislation, namely, to stop work and seek restoration of the original facility as it might have existed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the matter of acidification, not all forestry projects cause or give rise to acidification.  This depends on the type of plant and the type of soil in which the trees are planted.  It is the job of the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor all our water quality.  In the past three weeks I have launched the state of the environment report on water quality and every other aspect of the environment. It is a comprehensive statement of <Col N="457" /> environmental quality by the Environmental Protection Agency who will continue to monitor our water quality.  We will take whatever remedial action is required to ensure that particular problems, such as acidification, are dealt with where they arise.  It is not my intention to stipulate that trees cannot be planted within a certain proximity of a river or watercourse because that would be dependent on the type of tree to be planted and the type of soil in which it is planted.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been given a new power to determine if areas are suitable for forestry projects and their decisions will be passed on to the forestry service in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to give the impression that all forestry projects are environmentally bad because, by and large, they are very good.  We have one of the lowest rates of afforestation in the European Union and a very low rate compared with Scandinavia and other more densely populated countries.  We want to increase the number of woodlands and I am anxious that a new range of native timbers and broad leaves are included in future projects.  The new guidelines specify that all forestry projects should be ringed by broad leaf plantations so that the impression of a natural Irish forest is given from the roadside.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations a new role by way of existing Statute has been carved out for local authorities.  If, ultimately, I am required to introduce a new Statute law to deal with problems that cannot be dealt with under the regulations.  I will examine the matter afresh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The new controls have not gone far enough.  Areas much smaller than 70 hectares should be subject to full planning permission.  The Minister has made some progress, but does he agree that there is not a clearcut provision in the new regulations which states that neighbours and other interested people should be alerted if planting, which can visually intrude and <Col N="458" /> isolate families, is proposed in an area? Does he agree this is a serious omission?  Will he take steps to ensure that a minimum notice of planning permission, such as that required for house building, is inserted in the new regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold a strong view on the environmental aspects of afforestation but it is not shared uniformly by those involved in forestry.  When these regulations were being drawn up my officials and I engaged in protracted discussions with forestry interests, not all of whom warmly welcome them. However, they are a major advance on the current provisions.</P>
      <P>In the fullness of time normal planning provisions will probably apply to forestry projects but that will require the introduction of new primary legislation.  I do not have a closed mind in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>My main point was that there is no provision which states that neighbours and other interested parties should be alerted when forestry is planned in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Nealon.  The Minister should introduce legislation specifying that two months' prior notice should be given when it is proposed to plant land.  A major difficulty in our area is that many people do not discover planting is about to take place until the machinery starts the work and surrounding lands are devalued as a result.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to specific types of trees which are not suitable for planting.  Will he make it mandatory that spruce or trees liable to produce acid are not planted within, say, 20 metres of a watercourse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of trees planted is primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The environmental impact and planning requirements come within my ambit of responsibility.  I operate within current Statute and cannot make primary law by <Col N="459" /> way of regulation.  I have an open mind in regard to full planning permission for forestry projects, but I want to see how these new proposals pan out.  In particular, I want to see how local authorities react.  Under the regulations I have signed into law, local authorities may designate areas as unsuitable for forestry.  If it is felt that planting in a specific area would obliterate a scenic amenity or isolate houses the relevant local authority may designate the area as sensitive and not suitable for forestry projects.  A balance can be struck between forestry projects that are essentially good and ones that isolate individual families or obstruct scenic views.  The regulations I have introduced go a long way towards achieving that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pointless implementing good regulations if people are not notified when planting is proposed.  Will the Minister introduce a system under which notice of planting must be given so that the local people can object to the council if it would cause isolation or obstruct views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the Deputy's question three times, but I will do so again.  I do not have the power to apply normal planning permissions to forestry projects unless I introduce primary legislation.  I have specified in the regulations that notification of proposed planting must be given to local authorities.  Under the new powers in these regulations, local authorities can intervene on behalf of the people about whom Deputy Nealon is concerned.  I have reduced the threshold from 200 to 70 hectares and I do not recall getting many questions about this until now.  I have introduced radical new environmentally positive procedures and I want to see how they will work.  If they do not have the necessary impact and projects continue to have a negative environmental impact, I will re-examine the regulations and consider introducing primary legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that afforestation is primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but I compliment the Minister for the Environment on his initiative.  A threshold of 70 hectares is excessive and should be reduced considerably.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the necessity to protect views and scenic landscapes.  Much existing forestry intrudes on that type of view.  Has the Minister any intention of trying to solve that problem in areas where views of the sea and mountains are obliterated by trees? Also, the 70 hectare rule will not affect the man or woman who wishes to plant a single row of trees which may well block the view of a scenic area.</P>
      <P>Another aspect the Minister might take on board relates to a health issue. In an area of my constituency a large family, whose children suffer severely from asthma, has had a forestry project planted right around their house.  Medical opinion is that the children will suffer much more from pollen proliferation resulting from the planting of excess forestry in the area.  I have probably caused Deputy Quill to sneeze by mentioning asthma, pollen, etc.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the medical problems which may be created by such plantations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to existing plantations, there are no powers available to me to take the action the Deputy suggested.  I can do nothing about damage &mdash; if that is the correct word &mdash; that has been done to date.  Where there is a visual amenity to be protected, it is a matter for the local authority to designate an area as unsuitable for planting. That is the power I have given, rather than going to the absurd level of requiring an environmental impact assessment <Col N="461" /> for planting every tree.  Some sort of balance has to be struck.</P>
      <P>I did serve as Minister for Health for a period, but I do not regard myself as qualified to comment on particular health matters.  Obviously I have great sympathy for anybody who is surrounded by trees and suffers from asthma or from the impact of being allergic to pollen.  However, I have no comment to make about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated he is willing to consider introducing primary legislation if his regulations fail. Will it be necessary for county development plans to designate sensitive areas or will it be possible for the county councils to designate them on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as necessary?  As the Minister is probably aware, a number of counties are at present renewing their county development plans, and if such areas are not included it will cause problems and create a time lag.  Are there any proposals with regard to conditions concerning the reafforestation of clear-felled land within a given period, because such areas are becoming a major eyesore up and down the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to issue guidelines on designation which will go to every local authority.  Designation will not necessarily be part of current plans. If that is not the legal position I will revert to the Deputy, but it is my understanding that that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of my question related to clear-felled land being left unplanted for a rather long time mainly due to the fact that Coillte gets the benefit of the extra premiums on virgin land which it does not get for land that has already been clear-felled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 95 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that the Minister may make regulations or give directions in relation to the provision of traffic signs, including road markings. The standards, measurements, use and legal status of signs are set out in such regulations and directions.  Guidelines setting out the technical requirements and methods of application of thermoplastic road markings were prepared by the City and County Engineers' Association in 1988, in association with my Department.  These provisions are being reviewed at present in the context of the preparation of a comprehensive traffic signs manual which will be launched as soon as possible.  We spoke about that previously in the House, and I hope to be able to launch that manual in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his action and an encouraged by the fact that he will shortly publish the outcome of his deliberations with the city and county engineers and his own Department.  Will he accept that there is an urgency to agree standards and put the markings in place on the ground? Will he also accept that in the UK independent surveys have demonstrated that where there were better road markings, both centre road and side road, there was a significant reduction in the number of road accidents?  For that reason does he think it is important that the proposals should be implemented and local authorities alerted and, if <Col N="463" /> necessary, required to put a certain sum of money into their estimates to ensure that this work is carried out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly in agreement with the Deputy.  I said months ago, in response to a question about road accidents, that I intended taking a range of measures, one of which was the preparation and publication of a comprehensive signs manual.  I am totally in agreement with the Deputy that road markings and signage are a crucial factor in maintaining high standards of road safety.  We have had a great deal of discussion on their preparation and the manuals are currently being printed. I understand it takes a little longer than normal to print them because the colours, by definition, have to be perfect. That will be available to every local authority, and I will be pushing them to have a uniform system of signage so that when people travel around the country they will meet the same standards, measurements and directions, and avoid confusion.</P>
      <P>In relation to the primary roads, the National Roads Authority is also investing significant sums of money in signage and marking.  Anybody who has travelled in the last 12 months on the NI and the N2 in particular will have noted the reflective markings on those roads. These will be systematically put on all the national roads.  Coming back from Northern Ireland I was very impressed by the N2 which was like an airport runway in terms of the reflectors.  Very good quality roads are a tremendous asset.  Such markings will be a particular asset on county roads where there are bends or the road narrows.  I am anxious that a considerable proportion of moneys from the increasing pool of money for non-national roads available to local authorities will be spent on this very important safety aspect.</P>

      <P>I agree completely with the Minister when he says that attempting to reform local government without examining its funding is a waste of time.  I have said continuously in this House that it should be tackled on an all-party basis notwithstanding the temptation to use it as a political football.  Now that the Minister has received stage I of the study on local government financing, can he give some time-scale within which he expects stage II to commence?</P>

      <P>I do not intend to engage in a broad-ranging discussion on the consultants' report which I shall publish. I hope phase II will be up and running in parallel, which will constitute taking the most likely options recognised by the funding group and exploring them in some detail.</P>
      <P>On the Deputys' original question, this is a review of all aspects of local government funding, in turn, leading to a comprehensive review of the realistic requirements of local government into the next century to finance all the schemes to be implemented.  I am particularly aware of the infrastructure required in the case of sewage disposal, water supply and so on.  I have published the water needs study of Dublin. Major continuous, infrastructural investments will need to be maintained and developed, the funding of which will necessitate realistic decisions into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot simply ignore the problem and hope that the current position will suffice.  We can do better if we can reach a consensus.  Terrible mistakes were made in the past when we allowed local government issues to become divisive.  I know that, in Government, it is asking a lot of people to build this consensus but over the past three and a half years five parties have been in Government. The likelihood is that over the next ten to 15 years those five parties will interchange, which appears to be the way politics is moving.  It is not in anybody's interest to sacrifice local government to <Col N="467" /> any narrow focus of making points in the hope of winning a general election.</P>
    <P>On that principle, I hope we can build some form of consensus for a funding mechanism which will be fair, equitable and acceptable to the general public.  I will facilitate that process.  Whether it will come to a conclusion before the next general election I cannot say but I shall advance the process as quickly as I can.  I shall also engage in broad consultation with my colleagues in Government and with local authorities who have expressed very strong views on this point.  I have been very encouraged by the comments I have heard.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to hear the response of Deputy Eoin Ryan and the Minister since I had asked whether he would agree that the funding of local government had tended to be used as a political football locally and nationally over many years.  That has been the case, to the extent that the public has become disillusioned, discovering that politicians make promises in Opposition but once in Government, they act differently.  Would the Minister agree that there is a need for the establishment of an all-party committee to put the interests of the public and local democracy first rather than seek political favours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in agreement with the Deputy.  When they appeared before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, Deputies Bertie Ahern and Harney were clear that they favoured an all-party approach to the issue, stating that serious reform would be achieved only if the matter was dealt with on that basis, one expressed also by their spokespersons, Deputies Dempsey and Quill.  I do not know whether we will achieve that consensus which will inevitably become more difficult the nearer we approach a general election, but it is worth endeavouring to do so.  Once we have undertaken our in-house review, I <Col N="468" /> will do my best to facilitate such an analysis quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that an enormous amount of political leadership will be required to sell any different system of funding of local government to the general public?  The history of any such attempts since 1977 has been plagued by base, gross cynicism on the part of a number of politicians.  Based on that experience, would he consider permitting a debate on the consultants' report here, when all parties could contribute and possibly arrive at a consenses?  That would be tying parties to some agreed principle, the details of which could be worked out in phase II of the consultants' report.  If we are to claim any self-respect, we must be successful on this issue but it is also important that we be at one in this House.  Does the Minister accept that it is equally important that what Members say in the House corresponds to their comments on returning to their constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps broadcasting of the proceedings of the Oireachtas has ensured greater coherence between what is said here and in constituencies.</P>
      <P>I am heartened by the views expressed here.  We are setting ourselves the major task of devising a form of local government funding but it will be extremely important that any such device commands public support.  That will be achieved only if we can reach a broad political consensus within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have an open mind in relation to a debate here; that would be a matter for the Whips to organise once the report is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fear whenever one publishes any report is that somebody will extract a sentence or concept in an endeavour to sink it.  Therefore, we must all be measured in our attitude to this one.  As I have said, if we kill it off now, it will be dead for all time; nobody will be the better or worse for such action but local government will be the worse.  Nobody will want to be a kamikaze pilot and fly <Col N="469" /> solo on this issue.  If we are serious about devolving power to local government, we must put in place a secure funding mechanism, bearing in mind a range of new costs evolving on them to maintain an expensive infrastructure in which we are investing with the aid of Cohesion Funds.</P>

      <P>People will not mind paying service charges if local government services are responsive.  During the recent by-election in Dublin West it was apparent that no services were provided in huge tracts of the constituency whereas people in wealthier areas were complaining about service charges.  This is an example of how local government is not working.</P>
      <P>Considering that there is agreement among Members this afternoon, would the Minister not agree that it is absolutely ludicrous for the Fine Gael Party to try to tie local government reform with the residential property tax?  There is no connection whatsoever.</P>

      <P>In the Programme for Government &mdash; and I was involved in the negotiations &mdash; we asked the professional review group to include in its remit the residential property tax.  All the local charges have to be reviewed to see what mechanism we can advance with.  Some funding mechanisms &mdash; whatever views people expressed about them in the past &mdash; carry baggage in the public mind.  We need to have a system which has broad public and political support.  I think we can find such a system but not if we are trying to score points off each other.  We should start on the basis of not trying to put anybody out of the equation.  As Deputy Quill has said, if we want to keep our self respect on this issue we should try to keep our counsel and try to be constructive about it.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of public roads, including the provision of facilities for pedestrians, rests with individual road authorities.  In the case of non-national roads, including roads in urban areas, the improvement of pedestrian facilities normally falls to be funded from the road authority's own resources, supplemented by the annual grants for these roads.  It is a matter for individual road authorities to select the projects they wish to fund, subject to the general guidelines which apply.  In the case of national roads, any necessary improvements in pedestrian facilities would be a matter for consideration by the local authority concerned and the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>The improvement of pedestrian facilities could also form part of proposals for urban and village improvements for which grants are available to local authorities from my Department under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>Pedestrian facilities, including facilities for people with disabilities, and traffic calming measures may also qualify for assistance under the scheme of traffic management grants provided annually in respect of the Dublin Transportation Initiative area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The public register to be kept by local authorities under the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996 will not include the names of the landlord or tenant or the rent in respect of the dwelling.  The privacy of landlords or tenants is not therefore compromised by the information contained in the register, which is confined to the address and a brief description of the rented dwelling, and the date of receipt by the local authority of the application to register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of public concern about the local authorities seeking different base data on rented accommodation?  Did she supply local authorities with a standard form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I have provided local authorities with very clear regulations on the information that is required of landlords.  I listened to and consulted with landlord interests, representative groups and tenants.  I was conscious of the question of confidentiality and took it into account.  It is very clear in the regulations and in the booklet which I have distributed widely.  I reiterate, to <Col N="472" /> counter the misinformation, that the information in the public register is confined solely to the address of the rented house, a brief description of the house type and the date of receipt by the local authority of the application to register. Any other information requested is purely for the information of the local authority and will be confidential.  It is provided in order that the local authority can carry out its duties of enforcement.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been clearly informed as to the detail of these regulations.  If the Deputy is aware of a problem in some local authority he should provide me with the details.  I am satisfied that local authorities have been advised fully as to the information to be made public as opposed to the confidential information they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have data from several local authorities, all of which are seeking different information.  Some will allow an agent to make the application but others require the landlord to make it.  Some local authorities require the landlord to sign his name to a statement that this is a total record of all his property in that local authority area.  The departmental instructions are not being interpreted in a standard way by all local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find that local authorities will not be providing information to the public, which is what landlords have expressed concern about, except that provided for by regulation.  Landlords either misunderstood the regulations or were misled as regards them.  The information to be provided in the public register is uniform, the address, the description and the date of receipt of the application to register.  The additional information a local authority may require is totally confidential to that local authority and is its business.  The requirement for the register is very clearly stated.  I am concerned that the media misconstrued what this registration is about and how the question of confidentiality has been <Col N="473" /> dealt with.  Clearly the Deputy is unaware that when it comes to the public register, three items of information will be in the public arena.  Deputy Noel Ahern is well aware of the facts in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing the licensing of drivers provide that access to a provisional licence for category A (motorcycles) is restricted to those who have either held a licence under sub-category A1 (motorcycles under 125cc) for at least two years in the previous ten years, or those over 25 years of age.</P>
      <P>The EU Second Directive on the driving licence provides that it is a matter for each member state to decide whether or not to introduce sub-categories such as that applying here to motorcycles under 125cc.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing the Driver Licensing Regulations in the context of applying those provisions of the Second Directive which are not yet in force. However, it is my intention to retain sub-category A1, as I am concerned that providing access to large powerful motorcycles for young people who lack previous experience of driving a motorcycle would not be in the interests of the individuals themselves or of road users generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> I appreciate that the criteria for access to category A licences are now more restrictive in this country than in the United Kingdom, but I am satisfied that the system in force here is fully justified in the road safety context.  It is possible, however, that the entry into force of the Second Directive will encourage the harmonisation of such criteria.  I envisage such harmonisation will not require a change on our part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer and do not dispute his stance on this issue.  As has often been said here, the promotion of road safety should be of paramount importance.  In the overall interest of promoting safety does the Minister consider that the current position is unsatisfactory?  Citizens of this country who give an address in this State, can get a licence in Northern Ireland which would not be issued here? That negatives our law and the good practice the Minister seeks to promote and maintain.  What can be done about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for anyone who gives a Republic of Ireland address to get a Northern Ireland licence, but those who give a Northern Ireland address can get one.  We have a higher standard, a young person under 25 years of age cannot get a licence for a vehicle or a motorcycle with a greater capacity than 125cc unless he held a licence for one below 125cc for at least two years.  I have no intention of changing that law and I would not be surprised if our stance on that is reciprocated in the provisions that will be introduced in the United Kingdom when there is harmonisation of the law under the European Union directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the casualisation of the workforce in the NSAI, there are 43 contract workers and that does not include nine SIPTU clerical staff on contract work.  Contract employees are being used by management as bargaining tools in the current situation.  This position is unacceptable <Col N="524" /> and should not be the example set by the State sector in terms of the casualisation of work through the use of contract workers.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Minister is concerned about the problem of the casualisation of work and I ask him to intervene to ensure that this problem is resolved before this Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>The staff of the NSAI encountered great difficulties with a number of sections, particularly sections 8 and 15. Section 8 states that all functions in relation to standardisation, harmonisation, certification or inspection vested, in Forfás by section 9 of the 1993 Act shall vest in and be exercised only by the Authority.  That could preclude Forbairt from carrying out some of its current activities and its future plans which it is in the process of developing.  Will the Minister reconsider this matter and bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to take account of the views expressed by staff on this matter?</P>
      <P>Section 15 states that the Authority shall have the power to establish companies, both inside and outside the State, for the purpose of providing services in relation to standards and certification.  There is great potential for registration work in the United States as subsidiaries of multinational companies here are achieving quality standards which their parent companies in America have not yet reached.  The staff of the NSAI are concerned that the inclusion of this section will prevent Irish workers from availing of this type of opportunity.  Will there be job losses? That needs to be clarified.  US subsidiary companies here meet the high standards set in this country.</P>
      <P>The parent companies in the US demand the same standards of themselves.  We should take advantage of the competition that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State intends to amend the First Schedule of the Bill to make provision for worker representatives on the board of the NSAI.  It is a progressive move which the staff will welcome.  I have expressed reasonable and legitimate concerns on <Col N="525" /> points put forward by the staff.  I hope the Minister of State will meet the staff again so legislation can be achieved that will ensure those involved can work together on the country's behalf.  There is a need for change and I hope the Minister of State can amend the Bill to improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Rourke.  I am pleased this legislation has finally come before the House. Some time has passed since the then Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, set out proposals to introduce this legislation which is needed to reassure consumers about the products they are purchasing, particularly in view of the recent BSE-CJD scare in the UK.</P>
      <P>This Bill will give autonomy to the NSAI which is under the aegis of Forfás at present.  The NSAI needs to be recognised as a separate entity, particularly in view of the certification awards it grants in the manufacturing and service industries.  Ireland has always had high standards for its manufacturing and service industries.  However, word of mouth is no longer acceptable and to maintain the high levels of support in the domestic and foreign markets, it is vital that the quality and safety of products be independently certified in line with recognised standards.</P>
      <P>It is important that consumer interests are represented on the board of the NSAI.  To date there has been no consumer input.  Consumers form a significant part of the standards equation and their exclusion from the process must be addressed.  The Minister must ensure a consumer input in the preparation and implementation of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the policing of the marketplace with regard to this Bill. There is little point in introducing this legislation if the correct measures are not put in place to ensure the regulations are properly policed.  Huge responsibilities have been placed on the Government by way of European regulations governing toy safety, medical <Col N="526" /> products, protective clothing, energy consumption and electrical appliances. This Bill provides an opportunity to rationalise the involvement of many Departments and bring them into line with modern European practices. Therefore, it is important that the necessary steps are taken to ensure these European regulations are correctly policed by the combined efforts of the Garda, the Customs service and the NSAI.</P>
    <P>The recent BSE scare in the UK has had serious repercussions for our beef industry.  It is vital that the NSAI has standards in the processing of food in Ireland.  What standards exist for food products, for the feeding of cattle pigs, poultry and other livestock or for the labelling of food products?  Certain standards are relevant to the needs of the market and the consumer.  Every consumer is entitled to have as much information as possible about the food he consumes particularly fresh meat, vegetables and fruit.  The French have established an excellent system known as the red label system.  This label guarantees the consumer the safety of the product being purchased.  If one purchases meat under this system information is given about the farm on which the animal is reared, the breed of the animal, the type of feeding system used in production and the content of the feed used.</P>
    <P>Certification is necessary for meat products because people are no longer satisfied with glib assurances about prime beef cuts.  Beef production is vital to our economic well-being.  A belt and braces food security policy is needed. Under this Bill we have an opportunity to establish a system such as the French have.  Consumers should know the farm on which the animal was reared, the breed of the animal and the system of feeding used.</P>
    <P>In France the farm of origin is indicated on poultry products; the stock is chosen for the quality of its meat; there must be specific open air space for farm raised poultry; guarantees must be given on the constituents of feed used; there <Col N="527" /> are strict hygiene rules for the production and slaughter techniques; and, each bird must have a personalised identity tag.  If we took similar measures we would have a food industry which would be the envy of the world.  The Minister of State should consider these matters for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The NSAI has a role to play in ensuring the highest standards of quality are achieved in our food industry.  We should adopt a system similar to the French system to protect our industries. Unfortunately, having read this Bill closely, I cannot find any indication that the Minister is to take steps to introduce such a labelling system.</P>
    <P>On the purchase of materials used in the development of public buildings, is the Minister of State aware that a considerable amount of imported products is being purchased by public authorities for the construction of public building? What control governs the safety of the products being purchased?  Do public bodies purchase to recognised standards?  These matters must be given serious consideration in view of the spending of public moneys.  Is it proposed that the NSAI will have a role in preparing standards for these products which will ensure that quality products made in Ireland are purchased by our public authorities, given that it is European policy to have common standards?</P>
    <P>Following the broad adoption by industry of the ISO 9000 quality standard, and the obvious benefits companies derive from its use, what role will the NSAI play in developing this standard in the public sector where it would undoubtedly provide a means for introducing cost savings and efficiency? What steps does the Minister of State propose to introduce the concept of ISO 9000 standards into Departments, State agencies, local authorities and county councils?</P>
    <P>Members are aware of the importance of employment.  It is widely recognised throughout Europe that a large number of jobs are created in small and medium sized enterprises and that <Col N="528" /> growth must be encouraged in these areas.  Small and medium sized businesses are already overburdened with red tape and it is important the Minister of State ensures that the NSAI takes the necessary steps to assist such businesses in coping with the new regulations contained in this Bill.  Where a group of ten businesses comes together as a unit to obtain certification for their products, the overall cost to the group should be reduced by a reasonable amount.  I intend to table an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the importance of standardisation and certification of industry in the regions, it is important that the NSAI have a regional presence and not be located solely in Dublin. What are the Minister of State's plans for providing a regional focus for imparting standards and information to industry and the consumer?  Perhaps he will consider my proposal that an office be located in the Cork region where a high level of service and manufacturing industry operate.  Since the Minister of State took office, I have appealed to him about the fact that the area of north Cork, small as it may be, has been absent from his agenda for decentralisation.  There are many fine towns in east Cork which could benefit from the process of decentralisation.  An opportunity now exists to locate an office in the Cork region because much of the industry there is located in the county towns. The Minister of State's political colleague from Cork city and I would be glad if he considered this matter.</P>
    <P>Many people are aware of the ISO 9000 quality standard.  The independent certification of Irish products is essential in order that companies can enter export markets and succeed in domestic sales strategies.  Irish producers are aware of the commercial importance of having the quality and safety of their products certified in line with internationally recognised specifications.  Consumers are also aware of this importance.  As I stated earlier, our attention should be focused on the public sector and we should encourage the <Col N="529" /> introduction of ISO 9000 standards to Departments, State agencies, local authorities and county councils.  This would encourage the introduction of cost savings and greater efficiency in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the area of education.  The importance of consumer standards should be introduced to the school curriculum so that children can appreciate and understand it from an early age.</P>
    <P>The reconstituted NSAI will play a vital role, through independent product certification, in facilitating sustained economic and employment growth in the years ahead.  It will provide a very important service to domestic manufacturers through efficient delivery of product certification and will set new standards, thereby enhancing the sales potential of Irish goods in the international marketplace.  The establishment of the NSAI as an autonomous agency will enhance its reputation as an independent certification authority in line with those of other member states of the European Union.  With its new designation, the NSAI will provide a world-class certification service to Irish industry.  This is essential if we are to meet the new trading requirements of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill on behalf of Irish industry.  It is important and necessary legislation.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, in placing a worker representative on the board of the NSAI, has come around to the Fianna Fáil way of thinking.  I recently tabled an amendment to the Irish Steel Bill aimed at putting a consultation process in place.  The amendment was not accepted by the Minister of State but I believe he has learned from that and come around to my way of thinking in this area.  It is never too late to change one's opinions.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion of the fact that local authorities are not efficient.  The National Standards Authority, through ISO standards 9000 and 9002, has a way to measure efficiency and standards in general.  It should be <Col N="530" /> obligatory that local authorities and the public sector attempt to attain these standards which would measure their efficiency.  Many businesses in the hotel and catering industry are presented with a plaque which denotes the fact that they are efficient and successful.  For this reason, local authorities should be encouraged to participate.</P>
    <P>Small firms will be the engine of job creation and enterprise in the future and must be encouraged to participate.  Such participation will involve a cost factor. Earlier I suggested that ten firms of equal standard might be permitted to unite to qualify for the ISO 9000 on a group basis.  This matter must be sympathetically considered.  Perhaps a figure of ten companies is too large, but I am open to negotiation on that point.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition one can table many good amendments and resolutions but the Government has the power to vote them down.  I hope that a spirit of compromise will obtain on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to co-operating further with the Minister of State on Committee Stage. He may accept some of the amendments tabled by Fianna Fáil as he is coming around to my party's way of thinking.  I have no doubt that he will accede to some of our requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy O'Keeffe's concluding remarks in relation to the manner in which his and the Minister of State's thought processes are uniting.  Is this the shape of things to come?  Have we seen the first signs of a great new coalition which could take us beyond the year 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is interesting in that it is part of a phenomenon relating to the regulation of science and technology and the role of semi-State bodies in this regard. During the past 20 years there has been a considerable consolidation of semi-State bodies involved in science and technology.  The National Science Council, the National Board for Science and Technology, an Foras Talúntais and an Foras Forbartha were closed down, consolidated or seriously reduced.  It was <Col N="531" /> during this phase that expenditure on science and technology was reduced and the international scientific journal <i>Nature</i> described Ireland as having turned its back on science.</P>
    <P>The cycle has turned and to some extent this is due to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is to be commended on the changes he has introduced.  We are moving on to a new phase, expanding and setting up a new semi-State body.  This seems to indicate a change in policy which may be modelled on a scientific cycle, for example, the carbon cycle where compounds first go up into the air and are later built into large molecules.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I am contributing to the debate is to highlight the concerns expressed by the staff of the IIRS who have questioned the necessity for the Bill.  They believe that the issue of a conflict of interest could be addressed by moving the National Accreditation Board out of Forfás and relocating it in the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I ask the Minister to deal with this point in his reply.  They have also raised questions about the cost of the authority which need to be answered.  One of the primary reasons given in the past for the closure of semi-State scientific bodies, for example, the National Board for Science and Technology, was cost.  This was a low point during a dark decade for science and it is important that we learn from those mistakes.  It would be a great pity if the people behind those policy decisions did not realise the damage they caused to the capacity of science and technology during that period.  It is important to remember that science and technological capacity cannot be built up over night but rather is developed slowly and systematically.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Ryan about sections 8 and 15 and the provision which will allow for the establishment of companies outside Ireland for the purposes of providing services in relation to standards and certification.  Is the Minister concerned that <Col N="532" /> this may be used as a means of exporting jobs of the country?</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has indicated that he is prepared to make provision for worker participation on the board of the new authority.  I wish to reiterate the concerns expressed about the number of contract staff employed in this area.  The ratio of three contract workers to one permanent worker is grossly excessive.  Contract staff are employed on a year-to-year basis and have no stability in terms of employment.  It is impossible to build up scientific capacity if the people working in this area are constantly looking for jobs so that they can make provision for their future.  The ratio of three contract workers to one permanent worker is unacceptable and not reconcilable with the proposal to build up capacity in this area so that we can meet the highest standards in the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that the ratio of contract to permanent staff may have been used as a negotiating tool in the preparation of the Bill and I would like to hear the Minister's views on this point.  There is necessity for standards in the area of science and technology.  Our industries will stand or fall in the modern global economy on the basis of its standards and it is important to invest in standards and science and technological capacity.  This is a long-term investment but it will yield dividends.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the food industry and it is worth reiterating that the strength of the dairy industry is related to the sustained investment in science and technology since the establishment of the faculty of dairy science in University College Cork in 1926 and the faculties of veterinary medicine and agriculture in UCD.  The capacity of the dairy industry is in sharp contrast with the dismal state of the meat industry.  It is important that this is understood by the people who are ultimately responsible for developing science and technology policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The angle <Col N="533" /> from which I propose to address the Bill is slightly different from that of previous speakers.  Most problems are addressed by the establishment of a new State body or agency.  The time has come for us to ask ourselves why we need a proliferation of State bodies and agencies. During the late 1980s a concerted effort was made to rationalise this area. However, in the meantime three new organisations.  Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland, have grown out of one organisation.  The initial decision to establish these agencies arose from the recommendations in the Culliton report on industrial development.  It is time we questioned the significance of that decision.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may say I am going off at a tangent but I am focusing on the proliferation of State agencies and bodies.</P>
      <P>There has been record growth in the economy in recent years.  Yet statistics illustrate that this growth has not been converted into worthwhile jobs.  We must ask ourselves if growth in the economy would have materialised if we had left the industrial development structure as it was prior to the establishment of Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  What tangible contribution have they made to growth in the economy?  The reality is that the difficult fiscal decisions taken in the late 1980s led to the growth in the economy.</P>
      <P>The failure to create jobs is exercising the minds of the Government, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and his Minister of State.  There must be some reason there has not been a translation of growth in the economy into much needed jobs.  What are the underlying factors preventing this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings of a recent study of the economic environment for businesses North and South carried out for the Small Firms Association by one of the most reputable economic study groups in the country show that there is a greater prospect of achieving profitability, success and sustainable development in Newry than in Dundalk in my constituency.  What are the reasons for <Col N="534" /> this?  Why are the comparative costs much higher on this side of the Border?</P>
    <P>Why has the political establishment shied away from tackling the problem of job creation?  I am not pretending that there is a panacea, but if costs, many of which are imposed by the State, were brought under control successfully, job creation might be accelerated.  I apologise for going off on a tangent, but this relates to the proliferation of State bodies and agencies.</P>
    <P>I am not advancing the argument that there should not be a national standards authority.  To oversee, implement and supervise there is a need to have a structure in place, but is it necessary to establish a separate, autonomous authority to fulfil this role?  The Minister of State will argue that it is of paramount importance that there is an independent adjudication, but it seems that whenever we are confronted with a problem we establish a new State body or agency to resolve it.</P>
    <P>It may well be the case that it is not possible to put the new regime in place without establishing the new authority, but what consideration has been given to asking one of the existing organisations to fulfil this function of overseeing the attainment of standards in a range of economic activities, which clearly is essential if we are to keep pace with developments in Europe?  This may prove more cost effective with lower administrative overheads.  I am not suggesting that the attainment of standards can be achieved on a voluntary basis, but I wish to afford the Minister of State an opportunity to outline his thoughts on some of the points raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution to this important debate. My colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan, when Minister of State, took the initial steps leading to this legislation.  I subscribe to the view that we should get it right given that we are talking about the establishment of an autonomous body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some problems have been highlighted by the staff of the NSAI, which is under the aegis of Forfás.  They have <Col N="535" /> suggested that legal advice should be sought.  My party's spokesperson, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, has suggested that an extra six months should be allowed to enable the proposed changes to be fully considered.  This is an important step and it is vital that we get it right.  There has been a worrying proliferation of State agencies, as I stated yesterday at the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy at which the Estimates for the Department were discussed.  I also stated that there is a need to separate the enterprise and labour affairs functions of the Department.  I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>This issue is of vital importance when it comes to matters such as the BSE-CJD scare on which there is a need to reassure the consumer whose interests should be addressed in this Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to accept that there is a need to enter into proper consultation over a six-month period.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 200 agencies dealing with enterprise-related matters. There have been many discussions on the roles these agencies play and the way they overlap and interchange.  My colleague, Deputy Séamus Kirk, has questioned the need for the NSAI, but if we can get it right, it is worth doing.</P>
    <P>It is important that we bring with us the staff, who feel management has gone over their heads in dealing with the European Union.  They have an important role to play and will be centrally involved.  It is appropriate, given that much time and effort have been devoted to the preparation of this Bill, that their concerns should be allayed.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that this proposal was first made during the tenure of office of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, we are not opposing it for the sake of it.  We listened to what people had to say.  We are asking the Minister of State, at a minimum, to allow extra time.  Much has been said by my colleagues about the food industry in particular and the need for proper scrutiny.  The question of labelling has <Col N="536" /> been dealt with by the French authorities.  The Government should handle the issue with great care.</P>
    <P>In dealing with other legislation the Minister of State accepted practical and sensible suggestions by Members on this side of the House.  He should do the same now and allow an extra six months as it will be worth the effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their very constructive contributions.  The main issue I must address is the necessity for the NSAI to be established as a separate body.  I reject the notion that this legislation is informed by any unthinking approach instigated by the management of the NSAI to create another State agency to improve the prospects of a few.  As I pointed out at some length in my speech, the rationale for this Bill is a serious one, dictated by the need to protect the integrity of the certification service provided.  I have personally considered in some depth advice from a range of authoritative sources on the need to establish NSAI as an autonomous legal entity.  I started out with some reservations and had the issue thoroughly investigated.  I concluded this course is by far the most effective in terms of ensuring that the status and role of NSAI is enhanced and that the independence of the service which it provides could not now, or in the future, be called into question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to the concerns of NSAI staff, as did Deputies Ryan, Upton and Kitt.  I have had several meetings with the representatives of the staff and explained in considerable detail the need for this legislation to protect their interests and to remove current constraints on the growth and advancement of the organisation.  I delayed processing the legislation because of the gravity with which I took the arguments they made to me.  That is the only motivation behind this Bill and provision for the maintenance of all the benefits and conditions which NSAI <Col N="537" /> staff currently enjoy is specifically written into the text of the Bill.  In addition, I am making provision for representatives of staff interests to have places as of right on the board of the agency.  This has not been the case to date and its advent will provide further assurances to staff in the knowledge that they will be a direct party to all decisions which the board will make in the future.  This will add a significant new dimension to the balance of the board and give a fuller recognition to the rights and responsibilities of all who work in the NSAI.</P>
    <P>I suspect there will be time on Committee Stage to deal with many of the arguments made during this Stage.  On Deputy O'Rourke's point about the £1 million imposition as the cost of this decision, there is no basis for that figure. Whatever the cost &mdash; it has not been assessed &mdash; it will be marginal.  There is merely a transfer of functions involved and no cost of that order is envisaged.  I <Col N="538" /> do not wish now to deal with Deputy Upton's remarks on the future of science and technology policy.  I accept the importance he attaches to the role of our STI capability in terms of developing a competitive economy here. I will come back to those arguments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Kirk's point about the proliferation of agencies &mdash; a point also made by Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; and why there is not a normal correlation between the superior growth rates we are experiencing in this economy and those of other EU member states, that argument had substance in the past, but that is not the case any more.  If we look at the performance over the last couple of years or so, a more normal relationship is beginning to be established between immensely respectable growth and the rate of job creation coming on stream.</P>

      <P>I thank you and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the valuable time of the House to speak on behalf of the Post Polio Support Group.  I am pleased they are represented in the gallery by their chairman, Mr. Jim Costello.  I pay a special tribute to Mr. Costello and Ms Joan Bradley, members of the executive of their group, and Dr. Séamus O'Dea and Dr. Orla Hardiman, their medical advisers from Beaumont and Cherry Orchard hotpitals.  They represent people who suffer from the post polio syndrome &mdash; PPS or late effects of polio.  This group has been almost forgotten by the health sector and by the administration of the health services.</P>
      <P>In the 1940s and 1950s, polio was a notifiable disease and had to be reported to the Department of Health.  Unfortunately, for those who recovered and took their place in life, their position changed dramatically in that they were not recognised by any particular administration and have been left to fend for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Polio is no longer with us except in very exceptional cases but the consequences <Col N="541" /> are with us in a new internationally recognised and confirmed condition known as post polio syndrome.  This syndrome affects some 4,500 people there, some of whom are in my constituency.  Many are in constituencies of various Members who have raised this matter with the Minister by means of direct representations and parliamentary questions.  I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who has special responsibility for people with handicaps, is present.  In my representations and in representations by Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Deputy Róisín Shortall, the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, Deputy Penrose and many others we have all used our influence with the Minister.  The Minister and his Department have offered facilities.  These have been outlined for us in respect of eligibility for medical cards, the drug cost subsidisation scheme, the drug refunds scheme, disabled person's maintenance allowance, mobility allowance and other medical services.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of State that all these schemes are available to everyone else simply because they are means tested.  For this special group who suffer from the condition known as post polio syndrome we need to do better than just tell them of all the facilities that are available.  We need from the Department an evaluation of their needs which they have quantified.  We are subject to the Minister's critical analysis and independent review of these needs.</P>
    <P>We want post polio syndrome sufferers to be considered eligible for the long-term illness scheme.  Many sufferers consider this a life long illness. We ask the Minister to consider setting up a trust in which the Department of Health would be involved.  As a minimum we request the Minister of State, as a matter of urgency, to meet with an all-party delegation from this House and representatives of the post polio syndrome group, who are not vociferous but whose needs cannot be denied.  We need a meeting with the Minister of State in order to put down on paper <Col N="542" /> their needs and requirements, otherwise we will condemn them to a life of nonparticipation in the workplace because means testing will eliminate them.  Since the 1940s and 1950s these people have participated to the best of their ability in the workplace where it has been physically possible for them to do so.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the generosity with which Deputy Michael Ferris has addressed the issue and included me in the Adjournment debate, albeit briefly.  I tabled some written questions on the matter and I share the views of people affected by post polio syndrome or late effects of polio.  During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s polio was an affliction from which many people suffered.  Sadly, the struggle came to an end for some while many others who came to grips with life had to overcome huge disabilities in terms of health and non-recognition of what they were doing to fight the disease. They also had to fight for recognition in their environment whether in their family, at school, work or in society.  In many cases they fought heroic battles and overcame by physical resurgence and sheer mental ability the difficulty in which they found themselves.  This drama is repeating itself in diminished form in fatigue, fatigue of the muscles, fatigue of the body, lack of concentration &mdash; all of which are recognised as post polio syndrome.  I ask the Minister to set up a trust fund so that the needs of these people can be met.  I would gladly join an all-party deputation.</P>

    <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illness.  The list of specified illnesses covered by this scheme has not been extended since 1979.  However, the needs of people with significant or <Col N="543" /> ongoing medical expenses are now being met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long-term medical condition such as post polio syndrome or late effects of polio, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the health board to decide.</P>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for persons who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book, and who are certified by their medical practitioner as having a long-term medical condition, with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to pay more than £32 in any month in respect of prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as post polio syndrome. Accordingly, there are no plans to extend the range of illnesses currently covered by the long-term illness scheme.  However, on foot of the case advanced by the Deputies, I will meet a delegation from the post-polio syndrome group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's <Col N="544" /> media reports on the discovery of a penicillin resistant bacteria in the new bone marrow transplant unit in St. James's Hospital raise a number of serious questions.  Why was this information covered up since 29 March?  In the public interest, it should have been disclosed.  How did the bacteria get into the water system of a new isolation building at St. James's Hospital?  Were patients in the unit made ill before it was discovered?  Have all patients who were in the unit been notified?  Was that done prior to the publication of the story this morning and were staff informed?</P>
      <P>It appears the existence of this bacteria was a closely guarded secret at the hospital.  It also appears that most staff and patients at St. James's were not informed of its existence.  If that is the case, the hospital, the Eastern Health Board and the Minister for Health acted irresponsibly.  Patients and staff should have been given full information.</P>
      <P>Patients in the unit are at serious risk of infection because their immune systems have been suppressed to prevent the rejection of bone marrow transplants.  It is incomprehensible that such a bacteria could have existed in the water supply of an isolation unit in a hospital.  For it to be discovered in an isolation unit for bone marrow transplant patients makes it all the more grave.</P>
      <P>I question the statement issued late last night by the Department of Health claiming that the bacteria is innocuous. As it is penicillin resistant the Minister knows it can have serious consequences. If it is innocuous why is the hospital afraid to use the water in the unit?  Why are patients, who are supposed to shower twice a day and who are cut off from the rest of the world in a sterile environment for up to three weeks, forced to use water from outside the unit? Why have all kinds of anti-infection procedures been introduced?  Will the Minister also clarify if the number of patients taken into the isolation building has reduced significantly since the discovery of the bacteria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> The bacteria discovered normally exists in decaying organic matter.  This implies there is something dead or decaying in the water system of the new unit, which cost £1.5 million to install and was opened today by the Minister for Health.  One would not expect such infection to creep into a new building. Will the Minister outline the examinations that took place on the building prior to the admission of patients?  Was outside assistance recruited to deal with the infection?</P>
    <P>This episode raises more questions about the absence of a system of co-ordinated audits for hospitals and health agencies.  This matter arose, first, in regard to the Blood Transfusion Service Board which breached its standards by knowingly using the blood of a woman with infectious hepatitis.  There were not any checks and balances in place to prevent or detect that.  Questions about the absence of audits also arose in a recent case where doses of chemotherapy were administered to a cancer patient.  There does not appear to be an independent system of auditing standards and practices in hospitals generally.  Such a system must be set up urgently so that hospitals, health agencies and so on can be monitored in a proper fashion.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to outline the circumstances surrounding the infection of the water system in the isolation unit at St. James's Hospital and to allay public concern about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Health to reassure the public on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has received a full report from St. James's Hospital regarding the presence of pseudomonas organisms which had been detected in the water supply at the bone marrow transplant unit.  The organisms in question are commonplace.  For this reason, quality assurance inspection control procedures are in place in hospitals as a matter of routine.  This means that <Col N="546" /> samples of water are regularly tested for organisms such as pseudomonas.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, the presence of pseudomonas was identified through this quality assurance system and not as a result of clinical infection in any individual.  In fact, no clinical illness related to pseudomonas has been identified in the unit.</P>
    <P>From the medical advice he has received, the Minister is satisfied the organisms in question are not a frequent cause of illness.  Their existence in the water system was identified prior to today's official opening of the new unit and the clinical decision to open the unit was taken in the knowledge of the existence of those bacteria and because it is believed the risks posed to patients undergoing bone marrow transplant is minimal in such circumstances.  The benefits of bone marrow transplantation for patients with leukaemia far exceed the potential minimal risk of infection posed by such commonplace organisms.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to reassure the House and the members of the public as to the thoroughness of the quality control procedures in place at St. James's Hospital and which led to the detection of the organism in question.  Patients and their families can have full confidence in the safety arrangements and precautions in the new transplant unit at St. James's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large file on this matter in the Minister's Department.  It was there long before the Minister of State or I entered the political system.  This was a priority matter some time ago, but it has lacked impetus in recent times.  The north Westmeath group water scheme was officially approved, but it did not proceed. However, in recent times proposals for the scheme have been revived and Deputies from the constituency have become active in the matter again.  The people in the area believe in democracy <Col N="547" /> and in approaching Government and Opposition Deputies in the belief that a Government is as good as a watchful Opposition.  Hence, it is my role this evening to put forward a case for the people of the area.</P>
      <P>This is a large scheme and many people would have a better quality of life if it were finalised.  The process has been explained to those who wish to join, money has been collected and meetings have been held.  By and large the paraphernalia that surrounds all group water schemes has been dealt with.  Those who originally devised group water schemes should be commended on their initiative.  The people who join them pay money and, therefore, have a part ownership.</P>
      <P>The plans for the scheme in north Westmeath have been agreed, but a large amount of funding will be necessary to implement it.  Those involved in the scheme believe that if they are to retain the good will of those who wish to join, the Department of the Environment must confirm as soon as possible that the scheme can proceed towards award of contract.  If the goodwill of the people involved in the group water scheme is to be retained, they need confirmation from the Department of the Environment as quickly as possible so that the scheme can progress through the stages which will lead towards the final realisation of the award of contract matters such as this.</P>
      <P>All Departments move slowly, but big Departments move even more slowly.  I am aware that this is a major scheme, but I urge the Minister to arrange for the speedy expedition of the remaining components of the process and give an assurance regarding the budgetary arrangements.  There are over 600 households whose quality of life will be greatly affected if this group water scheme does not go ahead.  I strongly endorse it and I urge the Minister, who has taken a personal interest in it, to give us an affirmative answer this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Rourke for raising this important matter which has been a focus of significant public attention in recent weeks.  It was also the subject of a parliamentary question tabled today by Deputies Penrose and McGrath, so I am very aware of the united public front put up by the Deputies representing the Westmeath constituency in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>It is a very large and ambitious scheme intended to serve 600 or more households and associated farms.  Considering that the average size of group water schemes is 40 houses, it can easily be seen that this is no ordinary group scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme was first mooted as far back as 1978.  I was not in the House then, but the venerable tradition of Deputy O'Rourke's family was represented even then in this House. Initially, the lack of suitable sources of drinking water inhibited group water scheme development in this area of north Westmeath.  The development of the Castlepollard regional water supply scheme extended the public supply as far as the group catchment.  However, it would still be necessary to lay substantial lengths of trunk main through the heartland of the group's catchment to guarantee an adequate supply to peripheral areas.</P>
      <P>The technical elements of the redesigned scheme were approved by Westmeath County Council in December 1989, subject to a number of conditions relating to the upsizing of water mains, provision of district metering and hydrants and additional storage capacity.  The proposal was not actively progressed by the group for a time but has, more recently, been reactivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a large-scale and complex project by any standards and not typical of group schemes generally.  The scheme comprises over six miles of eight inch trunk water mains, 17 miles of six inch, 19 miles of four inch and about 15 miles of three inch distribution mains.  Two <Col N="549" /> reservoirs are planned, one at Brownstown of 150,000 gallon capacity and one at Rosmead of 200,000 gallon capacity.</P>
    <P>The group has so far submitted grant applications in respect of some 377 houses and 230 farms.  I do not have an accurate assessment of overall membership at this time, but I understand there is a potential 600 members within the group's catchment.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, this will be a difficult scheme to construct and finance under the Department of the Environment's group water scheme programme.  The standard group water scheme grants of £1,600 per house and £1,200 per farm, with members' own contributions, are unlikely to be sufficient to finance it.  To ensure the financial viability of the scheme, it would also require a substantial supplementary grant from the Department of the Environment.  At this stage, there is no reliable estimate of cost for the project or the group's total grant entitlement.</P>
    <P>The group has been asked to submit a bill of quantities for the overall scheme, showing a schedule of quantities for each section and up-to-date prices for the items listed in order that costs can be accurately assessed by the Department.  Until such time as this information has been received and examined, it is not possible to determine what the overall cost is likely to be or the level of grant-aid necessary to ensure the financial viability of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy and her constituency colleagues that I will deal with this matter as quickly as possible when the outstanding information required by my Department is received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to answer my question regarding the urgent need to commence work on the building of the proposed new community school, in Rathmore, County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise the urgency of this matter.  At present approximately <Col N="550" /> 125 students attend the vocational school and about 375 attend the Presentation Convent Secondary School. Working conditions for students and teachers in each of these schools are chaotic, unhealthy and most unsatisfactory.  Ten classes &mdash; more than half the students attending the secondary school &mdash; are accommodated in three large prefabricated buildings which are in very bad condition.  The same situation pertains in regard to Rathmore vocational school.  The parents, County Kerry Vocational Education Committee and teachers in the vocational and secondary schools cannot understand why a contractor has not been appointed to build the proposed new community school, given the announcement by the Minister for Education earlier in the year that work would commence shortly, and the fact that tender documents were submitted to the Department in November 1995.</P>
    <P>I cannot impress strongly enough on the Minister of State how important it is to appoint a contractor immediately so that the heavy excavation work which is necessary before work can start on the construction of the new school can be carried out during the summer holiday period.  This work should commence in June.</P>
    <P>The proposed new community school is urgently needed.  It will take in a huge catchment area between Baraduff and Knocknagree and the Rathmore and Gneevgullia areas generally.  Nobody in Rathmore and its catchment area can understand why the implementation of the health and safety regulations which came into force on 1 March 1996 should hold up this project.  The proposed implementation of these health and safety regulations was well known to all the Departments of Government and local authorities well before the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>As it may be impossible to reopen the Presentation Convent secondary school after 1 September next, I ask the Minister to give a firm assurance that a contractor will be appointed immediately to <Col N="551" /> carry out the necessary heavy excavation work during the summer recess. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed new community school for Rathmore in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>Initially, I would like to give some details regarding the background to this case.  A community school of 1,894 square metres was approved for Rathmore and it was orginally envisaged that the school should cater for 300 pupils in the long term.  However, following a review of the enrolment projections, the planning and building unit of my Department decided that permanent accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term enrolment of 475 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The architectural planning for the new school has been completed and in November 1994 my Department made <Col N="552" /> arrangements for the invitation of tenders.</P>
    <P>The building unit has now completed an examination of the preliminary tender report.  Certain requirements relating to the new Health, Safety and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations which came into operation in March of this year have to be finalised before construction commences.  Provision has been made in the 1996 capital programme for this project.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the pressing need for this new school and I will ensure that all outstanding matters are resolved as quickly as possible.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the project is progressed and construction commenced at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had some definite news for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in replying to previous questions on this subject, the decision to undertake a special restoration programme for regional and county roads took account of the seriously deficient condition of significant lengths of these roads, a fact which is attested to by the views of public representatives in this House and elsewhere.  The main problems with the non-national road network are to be found in county council areas and these were given high priority in the allocation of the 1996 non-national road grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £8 million in discretionary block grants has been allocated to urban road authorities in 1996 for works on roads in their areas.  The level of these allocations has increased significantly in recent years, from £5.5 million in 1993 to £8 million in 1996, an increase of 45 per cent.  In addition, a sum of £4.07 million has been allocated to urban authorities in 1996 under the EU co-financed scheme of grants for improvement projects and under a special, once-off scheme for the restoration of road pavements in areas where exceptional <Col N="476" /> damage has been caused by work connected with water or sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>In all, therefore, grant allocations of £12.07 million have been made to urban authorities in 1996, an increase of £2 million on the grants paid in 1995.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the concerns about privacy are unfounded, as the public register will not contain the name of the landlord or tenant, or the rent of the dwelling and these particulars will not be disclosed by housing authorities.  I am also satisfied that the annual fee of £40 per unit is reasonable, to provide authorities with resources to enable them to enforce, in a pro-active manner, the statutory requirements relating to the private rented sector.</P>

      <P>It has been the stated policy of Government, since announcing the intention to establish the Environmental Protection Agency, that the agency's integrated pollution control licensing <Col N="481" /> function should operate on a self-financing basis.  The fees provided for under the Environmental Protection Agency (Licensing Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995, and approved by the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment, are designed to recover the costs of the agency of processing applications for licences, reviews of licences or revised licences; they also reflect the need to maintain equity between different classes of licensable activity and to avoid placing an undue burder on small-scale enterprises.  I am satisfied that these objectives are currently being met.  The regulations also enable the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce, refund or waive fees in certain cases.</P>
      <P>The integrated pollution control licensing system has been in operation since May 1994.  In the light of the progressive expansion of the licensing system and the experience gained by the Environmental Protection Agency, I intend to keep the level of application fees under review in terms of both the self-financing and equity objectives.</P>
      <P>Annual compliance monitoring fees for activities licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency are a matter for the agency to determine on the basis of its costs, and to recover directly from the licensed activities.  All licensing fees payable to the Environmental Protection Agency are subject to independent audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General so as to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that the self-financing objective is fully and fairly achieved.</P>

      <P>Traffic and parking by-laws made by the Garda Commissioner under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, following consultation with the relevant local authorities and with my consent, provide the statutory basis for the application of disc parking. Under these by-laws, the introduction of disc parking in any area is a matter for the local authority.  The charges for parking discs are set down in the by-laws.</P>
      <P>Sections 35 and 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 &mdash; to be commenced later this year &mdash; provide for the replacement of sections 89 and 90 of the 1961 Act and will allow local authorities to make their own by-laws in relation to paid parking controls generally, including disc parking, without the approval of the Commissioner or the Minister.  The devolution of control is in line with the general policy of extending the discretionary powers of local authorities; it is desirable also, in this particular case, to give local authorities maximum freedom, in the exercise of their traffic management and other responsibilities, to determine the level of charges and other conditions which should apply to parking in their areas, having regard to local circumstances.</P>
      <P>At present, rates of charges for disc parking vary widely and it is probable that local authorities would wish such variations to continue having regard to the different circumstances of different areas.  The adoption of a national disc parking scheme, with standard fees &mdash; or the introduction of mutual recognition arrangements while maintaining different fee levels &mdash; could give rise to significant income losses for some local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the arrangements proposed under the Road Traffic Act, 1994, it will <Col N="484" /> be a matter for local authorities, generally, or particular groups of authorities, to determine whether or not to introduce standard conditions and charges for disc parking.  A possible alternative would be the introduction by local authorities of arrangements whereby discs would be more widely available for purchase in their areas, particularly by visitors, singly or from on-street machines; I will be asking local authorities to consider this and other possibilities fully in reviewing their disc parking systems.</P>

      <P>Applications in respect of three integrated water and sewerage scheme proposals relating to County Clare have been submitted to the European Commission for co-financing under the Cohesion Fund.  No decision has been made by the Commission for co-financing under the Cohesion Fund. No decision has been made by the Commission on two of these proposals (the Burren and North Clare Water Services Plan and the South East Clare Wetlands Scheme) and I cannot say when a decision will be made.  In the case of the Lough Derg Catchment Protection Scheme, a decision approving expenditure of some £10.5 million was received from the Commission; the decision did not, however, relate to any of the projects in County Clare.</P>

I draw to the Deputy's attention that section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967, has been in operation now for many years on this basis.  The section's primary aim is to alleviate the financial expense incurred by taxpayers as a result of non-routine and non-reimbursable health expenditure whether or not the treatment is provided within the State.  I have no plans to change this relief.  Furthermore, there may be EU implications if any restrictions were to be applied in relation to where the service is provided.</P>

      <P>I regret that it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to ascertain the precise number of persons who work in the Republic of Ireland but live in Northern Ireland.  Such information is not readily available from the data kept by the Revenue Commissioners. However, a rough study of the numbers involved was carried out for the tax period 1992-93 and an approximate figure of 2,500 was arrived at.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question &mdash; what is the cost of tax refunds to such cross-Border workers &mdash; it is not clear what the Deputy is referring to.  Typically, tax refunds would not arise in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Deputy's information, the taxation of cross-Border employment is governed by the Irish and UK domestic tax laws and by the Ireland/UK Double Taxation Convention.  In the cases to which the Deputy is referring, an individual residing in Northern Ireland and working for an employer in the Republic would be taxable in the Republic in the same manner as would an Irish resident employee.  The Northern Ireland resident would, however, also be taxable on such earnings in Northern Ireland, but a credit would be allowed against that tax for the tax paid in the Republic.  As the tax rates in the Republic are invariably higher at present than in Northern Ireland, the credit allowed for the tax in the Republic would generally wipe out any further taxation of the income in Northern Ireland.  There would not, however, <Col N="493" /> be any question of a refund of tax paid in the Republic in such cases.</P>
    <P>I hope the above clarifies the position and adequately deals with the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in order to qualify for repayment under the scrappage scheme the vehicle being scrapped must have been first registered not less than ten years before the date on which it is scrapped.  This requirement is well known.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the vehicle was first registered &mdash; in the UK &mdash; on 4 December 1986 and was scrapped on 22 February 1996.  It was therefore considerably short of the ten years qualifying requirement and does not qualify for repayment under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A certificate of destruction in respect of the scrapped car was furnished by the applicant.  It had been issued by a trader approved by the Revenue Commissioners for that purpose.  While the precise circumstances in which the vehicle was scrapped are not known responsibility for ensuring &mdash; before it is scrapped &mdash; that it qualifies under the scheme rests with the owner of the vehicle.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy is aware, the Report on the Development of the Psychiatric Services <i>Planning for the Future,</i> published in December 1984, recommended a shift in the delivery of sevices for the mentally ill from an institutional to a community-based service. Since then, the report has been adopted as policy by successive Governments and acute units in general hospitals, day hopitals, day centres and community residences have been opened to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>Other therapeutic interventions which have altered the delivery of psychiatric services include domiciliary assessment, community nursing and home support, respite care, out-patient clinics and clinical rehabilitation services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons with mental illness are provided with a continuum of care for acute admission through care at home or in the community.  Services for patients who are acutely mentally ill are provided in a hospital setting.  When a patient has recovered from the acute phase of his/her illness they are discharged to the care of their general practitioner in conjunction, where necessary with the sector mental health team.  Discharge from acute care is made on the basis of a clinical decision involving a medical and nursing assessment that the patient does not pose a danger to himself or herself <Col N="496" /> or to the public.  It must be emphasised, however that it is not possible to predict the future behaviour of any person, including those with a mental illness. The civil rights of the patient to a normal life in the community must be taken into account by those responsible for his/her care.</P>
    <P>Prior to discharge from hospital, each patient is assessed individually to identify his/her psychiatric needs together with his/her personal strengths.  Following assessment, a specially designed programme of rehabilitation is drawn up for each patient.  Such programmes aim to cultivate the social, communication and vocational skills of a patient.  The patient remains under the care of the mental health team for as long as he/she requires.</P>
    <P>An advantage of the organisation of care for the mentally ill in this country is that the same authority &mdash; the health board &mdash; is responsible for medical and nursing care in hospital and in the community, the provision of housing for the mentally ill in the community and the provision of sheltered employment.  This has enabled services for the mentally ill to be provided in a more comprehensive way than is the case in other countries where these functions are divided among a number of agencies.</P>
    <P>In the light of the arrangements for the discharge of patients and the recognition of their rights to a normal life in the community, I do not believe that a structure of the kind described by the Deputy is either necessary or appropriate.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have not been approached by the ME support group regarding this matter.  However, last year, officials of my Department met representatives of an organisation representing people with ME, the Irish ME trust, regarding their concerns relating to increasing awareness of ME and research into its causes.</P>
      <P>People with ME can avail of services provided in the normal course of health service provision through the health boards.  A general practitioner provides personal, primary and continuing care to individual patients and families.  In relation to medical conditions generally, including ME, a general practitioner will be concerned with prevention and anticipatory care as well as an effective response to illness and patient rehabilitation.  As agreed with the ME Trust at the meeting last year, the Department gave the Irish College of General Practitioners for circulation to its members detailed information provided by the Trust on this disorder.</P>
      <P>Health research is carried out under the aegis of the Health Research Board which has an open invitation policy regarding applications for research funding and allocates its resources annually according to the priorities it attaches to the various requests received.  Organisations, such as the ME support group, seeking to fund research, should contact the Health Research Board.</P>

      <P>The grants in question fell into two main categories: the EU co-financed scheme of specific improvement grants, and the INTERREG grants which became payable in 1995. The allocation of funds in each case was project-based.  The selection of projects for funding from among the applications submitted by local authorities was determined on the basis of their compliance with the strict EU eligibility criteria, the priority attaching to particular projects, and the needs of different areas.</P>
      <P>Specific grants were also made available in 1994 and 1995 to the Border counties involved to meet in full the cost of reopening cross-Border roads.  In addition, two county councils received grants in 1995 to assist them in the purchase of road repair machines.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of each fire authority to provide for the training and equipping of its fire service to deal effectively with the various risks it may encounter, including those arising from hazardous substances.  To assist fire authorities in this matter, my Department has issued extensive guidance at various times on pertinent matters such as hazard analysis, risk assessment and testing of emergency plans.  Emphasis has been placed on the importance of pre-incident planning and the guidance given has been supplemented through seminars and courses organised by the Fire Services Council for senior fire officers.  The council's hazardous materials course and ship and port fires course provide specialised training on the identification of hazardous materials, in addition to the provision of full-scale practical response exercises.</P>
      <P>Emergency Services Hazards, which provide useful information on dangerous substances, have been issued by my Department to fire authorities to distribute to fire fighters and other personnel who may be involved in responding to emergencies.  In addition, many local authorities have access to the CHEM-DATA computer information system on dangerous substances.</P>

      <P>In April 1993, the then Minister concluded that, in the absence of detailed information on alternative alignments, it would be inappropriate to certify the proposals from the corporation which were then before him; the corporation were therefore requested, in co-operation with Sligo County Council, to arrange to have a new traffic study of the borough and its environs carried out.</P>
      <P>Any fresh submissions from Sligo Corporation will be dealt with in accordance with the Roads Act, 1993 which provides a single comprehensive procedure for the environmental impact assessment of all road projects likely to have significant effects on the environment.  This procedure ensures the fullest public participation in the process.  In view of my quasi-judicial role in relation to both EIS and CPO proposals, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>The access to finance scheme is part funded by the EU Structural Funds under the Small Business Operational Programme.  Consequently, as I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on the Adjournment of 30 April 1996, there were certain obligations under the EC Treaty to ensure that it complied with Community policies in a number of areas such as competition policy, the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy.  Commission approval for the Operational Programme for Small Business therefore necessitated the negotiation of a number of conditions relating to Community policy and sensitive sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The advertisement referred to by the Deputy was intended to convey to farmers the message that errors made by them in their 1996 area aid applications arising on foot of faulty mapping by my Department's agent would not be penalised. <Col N="516" /> The advertisement stated that errors, for example, those arising from faulty mapping by the farmers themselves, made by farmers in their 1996 area aid applications would have to be dealt with in the usual way &ldquo;and could involve penalties&rdquo;.  Such penalties would arise where errors are made deliberately or through negligence on the part of the applicants &mdash; if the errors are found to be obvious and unintentional, however, penalties will not be applied.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that the advertisement is entirely fair and in issuing it, the intention was to ease concerns which were being expressed by farmers. In so far as the Department's agent is concerned, this firm will be required during 1996 to correct any faulty mapping issued to farmers at no extra contract cost to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two clear stages at national level in the process leading to the start of construction of the proposed light rail network in Dublin.  The first stage, which was launched on 12 December <Col N="518" /> last, is the public consultation process being undertaken by CIE.  The purpose of this is to explain the concept of light rail, to outline specific light rail proposals, to listen carefully to any concerns expressed in relation to those proposals and to respond to those concerns where possible.  I would urge everyone with questions or concerns about the light rail proposals to avail of the opportunity afforded by the public consultation process to make their concerns known to CIE's project team on light rail.</P>
    <P>The second stage is the statutory process.  Legislation providing for this process will be introduced shortly.  This legislation will require the preparation of a number of detailed documents by CIE including an application for statutory powers to construct light rail and an environmental impact statement, both of which will be available for inspection or purchase by the public. The legislation will oblige me, as the responsible Minister, to consider any written submission made by any person in relation to the application for statutory powers and the environmental impact statement.  It will also require the holding of a mandatory public inquiry. The legislation will further oblige me to fully and objectively consider the report of the public inquiry and any written submissions made to me before making a final decision on CIE's application for the statutory powers to construct light rail.  In addition to these two stages, EU approval procedures will also have to be completed.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on, or enter into any discussions or correspondence with interested parties regarding, detailed aspects of the light rail proposals in view of the proposed statutory approval procedures and my proposed quasi-judicial role in relation to the grant of statutory powers to construct light rail.  However, with regard to concerns expressed about the impact of light rail on employment in the Kilmainham area I would refer to my reply to Question No. 228 of 30 April 1996.</P>

      <P>At present there is only one mobile phone issued by the Department to an unestablished staff member.  Monthly bills, which include detailed call records, are received for this phone by the management services branch.  Having been recorded by management services branch the bills are subject to certification that all call charges were incurred on official business.  Bills are then forwarded to finance branch in Renmore for payment and, if necessary, recovery action in respect of personal use.  This procedure works well and I have no plans to change it.</P>

      <P>The moneys available to my Department this year for undertaking coastal protection works will be fully utilised on carry-over works and already approved works.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the erosion problems being experienced by many coastal local authorities.  Priority proposals have been submitted to my Department and they will be considered over the life of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services which provides for an investment of £5.1 million over the 1994-99 period.  Obviously the funding in any one year is limited and, therefore, it is not possible to undertake works in every coastal area in each year. To date no works have been undertaken in County Donegal.  However, Donegal will continue to be considered in future years of the Operational Programme.</P>
