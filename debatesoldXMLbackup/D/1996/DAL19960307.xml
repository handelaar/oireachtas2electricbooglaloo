      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Ray Burke and call on him to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring specific and urgent consideration: the refusal of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, to honour the declared policy of the Government on openness, transparency and accountability by his decision to refuse to <Col N="1782" /> answer, and to transfer to the Taoiseach, a priority question tabled by me today asking if the Tánaiste's attention had been drawn to the reported request by the Taoiseach to Mr. John Hume in relation to the vote on the Scott report in the House of Commons; if he has checked the veracity of the report; his views on the appropriateness of such a request and if he would make a statement on the matter.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 12, Statements on the report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, and item No. 2, Metrology Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It <Col N="1783" /> is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 12: (i) the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply not exceeding 15 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the IRA statement should not go unchallenged but demands a strong statement from this House? It seems as if the Government's only response so far is that it is unhelpful. Will the Taoiseach join me in deploring the defeatist attitude of the IRA and the fact that it seems to say even the Mitchell Commission on decommissioning was a precondition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is most inappropriate.  There are many ways under the procedures of this House for dealing with this sensitive area.  I ask Members not to continuously try to compromise the Chair by seeking to raise matters which are clearly not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That creates a difficulty for me because I rose this morning to hear statements about an illegal organisation involved in an armed struggle on the world news, not on the Irish news.  I, as the democratically elected leader of the largest party on this island, am not allowed to condemn this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle of this House, I resent the impression given that it is not possible <Col N="1784" /> to raise such matters.  It has always been possible to do so, but at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to join me in making it clear that nobody in this House will live with another 25 years of futile violence or under that threat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the publication of the forthcoming Finance Bill, does the Taoiseach agree it is improper for any Minister to give individuals, on the payment of £100, rare access to the Minister for Finance as he finalises that legislation? Does he believe that is inappropriate behaviour for a Minister regardless of the notepaper on which the invitation was written?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, it has not been dealt with. The notepaper is one issue.  However, the content of the letter is a serious matter. It is a resigning matter for the Minister who has responsibility for ethics in public office.  There cannot be one standard for Fine Gael Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis mór sásaimh dom labhairt anseo ar Thuarascáil An Choiste Idir-Ranna Comhordaithe um Fhorbairt Oileán. Sílim go mbeidh an cáipéis seo fíorthábhachtach do thodhchaí mhuintir na n-oileán amach ó chósta na hÉireann.  Is léir go ndearnadh neamhní ar riachtanisí an phobail iargúlta seo ar feadh i <Col N="1790" /> bhfad, ach anois tá creat straitéiseach d'fhorbairt na n-oileán amach ó chósta na hÉireann leagtha amach ag an Rialtas don 21ú aois atá beagnach linn.</P>
      <P>Thug an Taoiseach, John Bruton, TD, dúshlán dom go luath an bhliain seo caite maidir le toscaí maireachtála i gcoitinne ar oileáin amach ón gcósta a fhorbairt agus fheabhsú.  Chuaigh mise agus mo oifigigh i mbun oibre go sciobtha agus is dócha go bhfuil léargas maith agam faoi láthair ar na fadhbanna atá ag goilliúint agus atá le sárú ag an bpobal seo.  Táim tar éis cuairt a thabhairt ar fhormhór na noileán amach ón gcósta agus tá plé déanta agam le coistí pobail éagsúla agus dreamanna eile nach iad atá ag iarraidh na hoileáin a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Tá 21 oileán ar a bhfuil cónaí orthu amach ón gcósta thuaidh, thiar agus theas d'Éirinn (de réir Daonáireamh 1991).  Is iad na saintréithe atá ag baint leo ná nach bhfuil ceangal acu leis an mórthír agus nach bhféadfaí teacht i dtír orthu ach amháin ón bhfarraige nó ón aer, agus go bhfuil pobal na n-oileán ina gcónaí ann le glúin amháin ar a laghad.</P>
      <P>The ongoing difficulties faced by the communities living on our offshore islands have been widely acknowledged. The need for a coherent Government response to this section of Irish society has led to the recent publication of the report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development which sets out the strategic framework within which future action in relation to the islands can be taken.</P>
      <P>The population on offshore islands varies from just a few people to more than 800.  For the vast majority of these islands population levels have fallen steadily in recent years.  This decline, combined with a comparatively older population than on the mainland, is a serious threat to island communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report highlights a cycle of decline whereby out-migration as a result of the lack of economic opportunity and a reduced level of services combines with an ageing population to further undermine the sustainability of island life.  This cycle could ultimately <Col N="1791" /> lead to the desertion of many more islands and this would represent a major tragedy for the entire people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland's offshore islands are a linguistic, cultural and heritage asset to the nation and have a special inheritance and a way of life which is unique. We would not easily be forgiven by future generations if we failed to address the needs of our offshore islands and to take appropriate action to safeguard that heritage.</P>
    <P>Ireland receives considerable assistance from the European Union on the basis of our peripheral location and our need to gain access to EU markets on equal terms.  It would reflect very badly on us if we did not in turn try to assist those parts of our country which are the most remote and vulnerable locations in the State.</P>
    <P>Government intervention can also be justified on the basis of the general social policy goal of reducing inequalities in incomes and opportunities between island and mainland communities. This approach also underlines Government action in the fields of education, health and housing as well as local and rural development.  The report addresses the needs of the island communities in each of these areas.</P>
    <P>However, it must also be stated that there are limited resources available to the State to address the difficulties which have been identified.  Our objective, therefore, must be to find the most cost effective way of enabling islanders to participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation through sustainable economic activity.  Accordingly, the report stresses the need for long-term sustainable solutions which utilise scarce resources for maximum effect and take account of the environmental pressures which islands may face if development is unplanned or indiscriminate.</P>
    <P>The Government has also recognised the need for a partnership between island communities and State agencies which would allow islanders to be prime movers in strategies affecting their own <Col N="1792" /> future and this is a central theme underpinning the approach set out in the report.</P>
    <P>This report addresses the key issues and difficulties confronting our island communities and proposes a strategic framework within which future action can be taken and which harnesses the energy and resources available from both the public and private sectors in order to make a real improvement in the standard of living of islanders.  The report also makes a number of recommendations on specific issues of importance and I would now like to address these.</P>
    <P>Without question, the single most important issue facing island communities is access.  It is the dependence on sea or air transport which defines island life.  At present there is a large variation in the quality of access services and a fragmentation of responsibility.  A situation has emerged whereby access to some islands is good while access to others is being seriously compromised through lack of suitable vessels or landing facilities.  The Government has acknowledged that each island should be entitled to a socially desirable minimum standard of access service.  It has also accepted, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, that access services should be provided at a local level where possible.</P>
    <P>I am in the process of meeting the local authority island committees in the countries of Cork, Mayo, Galway and Donegal. These committees comprise local authority members and island representatives.  The local authority island committees are being asked to bring forward a prioritised programme of works for island access which will be assessed initially by a technical subcommittee of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee.  This procedure will ensure that local representatives, including island representatives, will be able to put forward proposals which best utilise available resources for island access.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1793" /> The Government has created a financial envelope within which the current operational costs of access services will be financed, together with a provision for infrastructural works.  This allocation has been supplemented by an additional allocation of £1 million 1996.</P>
    <P>These changes will facilitate a simplified process for submitting and assessing island access proposals, real local input into the prioritisation and design of services and a coherent and strategic Government programme to bring island access up to the socially-desirable minimum standard.</P>
    <P>By involving the local authorities, and utilising the skills available from several Departments on the interdepartmental committee, the Government will be able to extract maximum value from the resources available.  The local authority island committees can play a major role in the years ahead as pro-active players in the island development process.</P>
    <P>This is not an attempt to avoid responsibility, but a way of establishing structures which will allow local representatives and islanders to participate in decision-making.  It would be easy for me to allocate funds on the basis of representations to me or the interdepartmental committee, but this would only centralise power further and prevent the emergence of strong and sustainable structures.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the role played by Deputy Molloy in 1970 when as Minister for the Gaeltacht he initiated the proposal for an air service to the Aran islands.  I was not quite accurate when I contradicted the Deputy yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh mhaith agat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It must also be said that the former Minister, Tom O'Donnell, in 1973 sanctioned the first investment by Gaeltarra Éireann, Údarás na Gaeltachta's predecessor, in Aer Aran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities have also been asked to draw up reports on the infrastructural requirements of the islands <Col N="1794" /> and to submit these to the interdepartmental committee within six months. Particular attention has been drawn to the issues of waste disposal and water supply.  Of course each island faces a unique set of circumstances and responses will have to vary according to these local conditions.</P>
    <P>Education is of particular importance to island communities because the link between young people and their island can be broken when they have to travel to the mainland for secondary education. Of course, having to send children away to school at a young age is itself a great disincentive for parents living on an island.</P>
    <P>The Government, on the recommendation of the report will include representation from island communities on the new regional education boards; the Government will increase the means test limit in respect of the remote area boarding grant in line with third level education grant limits, this will ensure that many more parents qualify for this grant aid; and it has been agreed to undertake a pilot project on the use of information technology as an educational resource on an island.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations in relation to the health services, energy supply and communications have also been accepted.  The interdepartmental committee will now follow-up on these proposals with the relevant State agencies and I expect to see the quality of these services to the islands improve over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The limited economic development of the island can be ascribed to factors such as access costs, poor infrastructure, low population density and peripherality. Many island communities have therefore been marginalised, with their economies heavily dependant on transfers through the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The problems of access and peripherality have mitigated against industrial development on the islands.  However, economic activity is taking place in agriculture, fishing, tourism and crafts.  The report has identified further steps to be taken in these areas to stimulate <Col N="1795" /> development and maximise their contribution to the island economies.  I visited some of the islands and the work taking place there is commendable.</P>
    <P>Changes in the budget disallow the first £2,000 of income from REPs for social welfare purposes.  That is important and it removes one of the obstacles to the take-up of REPs on the islands.</P>
    <P>The islands have great potential as tourist destinations.  The interdepartmental committee, in consultation with Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, will commission a detailed and comprehensive study to examine the potential of tourism on the islands, including the issues of marketing, training and infrastructure. This will complement the work being undertaken by Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann through the Leader II programme.  A major increase in tourism earnings on the islands will be achieved through this work.</P>
    <P>Advances in technology also offer new opportunities for island communities. The use of computers for work or education can reduce the disadvantage of geographic isolation.</P>
    <P>I know that Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann is upgrading its own computer network to assist communications between islands.  In 1995, my Department grant-aided Comhdháil to allow it invest in the necessary technology.  I know that it is considering launching a site on the Internet and other such ideas.  Sherkin Island Community Council also got grant assistance for the purchase of computer equipment.  This will help Comhdháil's own work and allow more islanders to benefit from new technology.</P>
    <P>I have also met with representatives of the European Island Commission, part of the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions.  They demonstrated some of their achievements in the area of information technology.  They have already built up a large database on several EU islands.  I have also seen some of the excellent work of Údarás na Gaeltachta's subsidiary G-Com.  The <Col N="1796" /> potential for improving island life through information remains vast.</P>
    <P>Following the report, I indicated my intention to initiate a pilot project on the use of information technology as a distance education and information resource for the islands.  I expect this project will further develop programmes which can be used to overcome the educational difficulties faced on the islands.</P>
    <P>The biggest single difficulty facing islands is the barrier encountered by small, isolated communities in accessing and co-ordinating the many diverse agencies and Departments concerned with their development.  In response to this issue, the report has recommended a series of measures.  First, each local authority, through its island committee, has been asked to take an expanded role in articulating and responding to island needs.  I have met the Cork Island Committee and have arranged dates within the next month to meet the other three local authority island committees. This role for the local authorities in promoting island development is consistent with the Government policy of devolving power and responsibility to a local level.</P>
    <P>Each non-Gaeltacht island with a permanent population threshold of 100 which is not currently receiving community development support is to have the services of a community development officer.  This will help to stimulate local development initiatives on the non-Gaeltacht islands.</P>
    <P>County strategy groups have been established in every county to provide for effective liaison and communication between the different local development bodies.  They will now put in place mechanisms to ensure full consideration of the particular needs and unique aspects of island communities.</P>
    <P>The area partnership companies have been asked to foster links with their island communities to ensure that the needs of islands are fully recognised within the partnerships' local development plans.</P>
    <P>The islands are also to have available <Col N="1797" /> to them the services of appropriate officers of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Teagasc and the Departments of the Marine and Enterprise and Employment.  These officers will act as points of contact as well as examining and promoting the potential for island development.</P>
    <P>Finally, and most important, the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee, chaired by myself as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, will oversee the implementation of the report.  This will ensure that the recommendations are followed through. The local authority island committees and Comhdháil will have links with the interdepartmental committee to ensure that policies and programmes continue to develop in accordance with the needs of islanders.</P>
    <P>I thank Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann for its very constructive contribution to the report and ongoing work on behalf of the islands. Comhdháil has played a vital role in bringing together the different islands from Tory to Skerkin.  It has worked to build links between all the islands and to bridge the differences between Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands.</P>
    <P>The inhabitants of Rathlin Island, off the coast of Antrim, have recently voted to join Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann. I very much welcome the opportunities for co-operation and exchange provided by their membership.  They have much in common with their colleagues along the other coasts and I hope mutual benefits will arise from this common link.</P>
    <P>The Government on the recommendation of Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, selected Comhdháil as a Leader II company.  This is the first time the islands have been designated as a single unit for a programme such as this and is a recognition of the high quality work of the Comhdháil executive and its full-time staff.</P>
    <P>The funds available through Leader II will allow many developmental projects to take place.  The programme will also help to empower local community <Col N="1798" /> groups to play an even greater role in the local development process.  Leader II provides a real opportunity for the islands to promote tourism and other economic activities.  The ideas included in Comhdháil's submission included a single brand or marketing image for all island produce.  I very much welcome this and other initiatives.</P>
    <P>I thank the members of the interdepartmental committee for their time and effort.  I look forward to working with them during the implementation of the report which represents a strategic framework for developing the offshore islands of Ireland.  While it does not represent a panacea or a dogmatic set of rules it does provide an important basis for action and policy-making by this and future Governments.  I believe it will be judged as such in the years to come and I am pleased to recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm labhairt ar an ábhar seo inniu ach caithfidh mé a rá go gcuireann sé andíomá ormbheith ag labhairt ar tuarascáil atá chomh bocht agus a bhfuil a laghad sin ann.  Tá mé ar feadh trí bliana ag fanacht ar an tuarascáil seo agus is dócha go raibh cuid againn ann i dtosach báire a cheap go mbeadh plean gníomhaíochta anseo a bhféadfaí tabhairt faoi láithreach agus a chuirfeadh chun leasa na n-oileán.  I ndeireadh an lae is léir céard a tharla, go raibh ionadaí as gach Roinn Stáit ag plé leis an tuarascáil gan éinne sásta aon chumhacht a ghéilleadh agus in ionad baint den mhaorlathas a bhaineann le bheith ag plé le cúrsaí oileáin tá curtha leis mar tá na comhairlí contae anois curtha isteach san áireamh.  Is bocht an scéal é gurb é sin an toradh atá ar shaothar trí bliana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An t-am seo anuraidh, ag caint le Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, leag mise amach plean gníomhaíochta do na hoileáin.  Is dóigh liom go raibh níos mó a bhí suntasach agus a bheadh éifeachtach sa phlean a leag mé amach an lá sin ná mar atá sa tuarascáil atá faoinár mbráid.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bunúsach <Col N="1799" /> nár tugadh aghaidh ar bhunfhadhbanna na n-oileán.  Tá go leor ráite, tá go leor dea-thola ann, ach níl aon phlean gníomhaíochta ann.  Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom díriú ar cheist, dar liomsa, go mba cheart díriú uirthi.  Tá sé in am gur Roinn amháin a bheadh ag plé leis na hoileáin feasta.  Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, níl ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin amach ón gcósta ach suas agus anuas le 3,000 duine.  Tá os cionn 2,000 de na daoine sin ina gcónaí ar oileáin Ghaeltachta agus 800 acu ina gcónaí ar oileáin Ghalltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne mise moladh an t-am seo anuraidh, moladh a bhí simplí, éasca é a chur i bhfeidhm agus nach dtógfadh ach cinneadh beag Rialtais, is é sin, go gcuirfí na hoileáin ar fad isteach faoi aon Roinn amháin agus go dtabharfaí an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir, Gaeltachta agus Oileán níos mó ar an Roinn sin; is é sin go mbeadh dhá chuid sa Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, an Roinn Ealaíon agus Cultúir agus an Roinn Gaeltachta agus Oileán.  Dá ndéanfaí é sin d'fhéadfaí ansin rudaí ar nós na seirbhísí farantóireachta agus na céanna a chur faoi aon Roinn amháin &mdash; bheadh freagracht ann.  D'fhéadfaí freisin cúram gnó eile a chur faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Oileán. Bheadh daoine ann a déarfadh go mb'fhéidir go ndéanfadh sé sin dochar ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ach caithfear cuimhneamh go bhfuil níos lú cainteoirí Béarla i gceist sna hoileáin Ghalltachta ná mar atá i gceist i mbaile mór Bhéal an Mhuirthid, i gceantar na bhForbacha nó i gceantar Bhearna Thiar.  Ó tharla go mbeadh sé soiléir go raibh dhá ról níos mó ag an Roinn seo, ról oileánda agus ról Gaeltachta, is dóigh liomsa go mbeadh sé soiléir go ndéanfaí plé leis na hoileáin Ghalltachta trí Ghaeilge-Bhéarla agus plé leis na hoileáin Ghaeltachta trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl an moladh simplí sin sa tuarascáil. Mar a deirim, is léir nach raibh an toil pholaitiúil ann cur isteach ar aon cheann de na Ranna Stáit agus gur ligeadh seans thar bráid.  Tá caint sa tuarascáil <Col N="1800" /> ar fháil isteach agus amach ó na hoileáin, ach, dáiríre, aon mholtaí ann. Tá caint ar an gclúdach seo go bhfuil an milliún punt seo ann, ach níl sé ráite go soiléir cén chaoi a gcaithfear an milliún punt seo.  Tar éis trí bliana séard a bhí mise ag súil leis ná go mbeadh staidéar taobh istigh den tuarascáil seo ar cén chaoi a seasaimid i láthair na huaire ó thaobh céanna de, ar an mórthír agus ar na hoileáin, chun freastal ceart a dhéanamh ar na seirbhísí farantóireachta agus go mbeadh suirbhé cuimsitheach ann ar éifeacht na seirbhísí farantóireachta go dtí na hoileáin agus moltaí dá réir ó thaobh céanna agus seirbhísí farantóireachta de.  Tar éis trí bliana níl sé sin ann.  Níl ann ach gur féidir le comhairle chontae staidéar a dhéanamh anois agus moltaí a chur chuig an Aire.  Má bhí sé i gceist aige an cúram sin a leagan ar na comhairlí contae, bheadh sé chomh maith an t-airgead a thabhairt dóibh agus ligean dóibh dul ar aghaidh leis an jab.  Ach an rud atá ann anois go mbeidh dream amháin ag moladh do dhream eile scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an rud seo nó ar an rud siúd, níl aon chiall ná dealramh leis, agus sílim go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire é sin.</P>
    <P>Téimid ar aghaidh ansin go dtí cúrsaí oideachais, agus sin an áit a dtéimid chun seafóide.  Tá deontas ann ar a dtugtar, remote areas boarding grant.  Go dtí seo bhí teorainn ioncaim ag baint leis an deontas seo.  Is minic a thóg mise ceist faoin teorainn ioncaim sa Teach.  Tá i gceist anois ag an Aire an teorainn a ardú ó £9,000, go garbh, suas go dtí leibhéal na ndeontas tríú leibhéal.  Chuir mé ceist ar an Aire Oideachais le gairid, cá mhéad duine atá ag fáil an deontais theoranta, is é sin, cá mhéad duine ar na hoileáin a bhí os cionn na £9,000, agus cá mhéad duine taobh amuigh de na hoileáin a bhí ag fáil an deontais seo a bhí os cionn na teorann ioncaim.  Cúig dhuine is fiche san iomlán a bhí i gceist, agus bhí 24 dhuine acu sin ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin mhara &mdash; duine amháin ar an mórthir a bhí i gceist.  An bhfuil an tAire a rá liomsa, nó an tAire Stáit, go bhfuil ciall nó réasún le scrúdú maoine agus is éard a bheidh de thoradh air go <Col N="1801" /> mbeidh ceathrar nó cúigear a bheidh os cionn na teorann ioncaim.  Sin seafóid. Costas cúig mhíle punt san iomlán a bheadh i gceist le fáil réidh leis an teorainn ioncaim go hiomlán agus caithfear airgead mór ag cur scrúdú ioncaim ar chuile ghasúr as na hoileáin a bheidh ag dul ar scoil ar an mórthír.  Cúigear nó seisear ar na hoileáin a bheidh os cionn na teorann ioncaim &mdash; múinteoirí, bainisteoirí monarchana agus daoine atá ag cur seirbhísí fíor-riachtanacha ar fáil ar na hoileáin, nó an cineál dreama is deacair a mhealladh isteach go dtí na hoileáin. Agus ansin tá an Rialtas ag rá go bhfuil siad i bhfabhar daoine a choinneáil ar na hoileáin.</P>
    <P>Tiocfaidh mé ar ais ar ball go ceist na n-aersheirbhísí, ach tá faillí déanta ansin freisin.  Ba mhaith liom dul ar aghaidh go dtí ceist chúrsaí costas maireachtála. Tá a fhios ag an saol Fódlach gur ceann de na fadhbanna is mó a bhfuil muintir na n-oileán ag strácáil leis ná an costas a bhaineann le maireachtáil ar na hoileáin. Níl dada ráite faoi go bhfuil fiú caint air istigh an tuarascáil seo.</P>
    <P>Tar éis sin, ar ndóigh, tá an cheist ann maidir le VAT a íocann oileánaigh ar rudaí ar nós bia, éadaigh ghasúr, mar go gcaithfidh siad VAT a íoc ar an iompar isteach go dtí na hoileáin agus níl aon chúiteamh molta sa tuarascáil seo ar an VAT sin.  Arís, rinne mé moladh tá bliain ó shin, moladh a bhí simplí agus éifeachtach, go mbeadh an-ghlacadh ag muintir na n-oileán leis, go mbeadh liúntas oileánach ann sa chóras leasa shóisialaigh agus cánach agus go mbeadh ruainne beag breise le fáil ag an dream a bheadh ag brath ar chúnamh leasa shóisialaigh ar na hoileáin, agus liúntas cánach breise do na daoine atá ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin i bhfianaise na cánach breise a íocann siad ar VAT ar rudaí a thabhairt isteach go dtí na hoileáin. Níl aon tagairt do sin sa tuarascáil.</P>
    <P>Tá tagairt sa tuarscáil, ar ndóigh, d'fhorbairt na turasóireachta &mdash; tá an tAire tar éis é a lua ar maidin &mdash; d'fhorbairt na hiascaireachta, d'fhorbairt na talmhaíochta, ach tá a fhios ag an Aire é féin, agus tá a fhios agamsa, gur beag duine ar na hoileáin nach mbíonn ag <Col N="1802" /> brath ar chúrsaí leasa shóisialaigh ag am éigin den bhliain.  Faoin gcóras scrúdú maoine, má chuireann duine ar oileán lena ioncam ó thaobh chúrsaí iascaireachta, lámhcheardaíochta, feirmeoireachta nó cúrsaí turasóireachta de, baineann an Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh an tsuim chéanna díobh sa chúnamh leasa shóisialaigh.  Mar sin, tá fáinne fiaigh ann nach féidir a bhriseadh.</P>
    <P>Ná habradh an tAire liomsa nach bhfuil ann ach corrdhuine ar na hoileáin gur féidir leo déanamh gan chúnamh leasa shóisialaigh i rith na bliana, ach arís níl aon rud ráite faoin scrúdú maoine.  Táimid fós ag dul ar aghaidh leis an tseafóid go bhfuil scrúdú maoine á chur ar fheirmeoirí in áiteanna ar nós Inis Meáin, Inis Bó Finne agus Inis Oírr, feirmeoirí nach bhfuil acu ach dhá bhó agus go bhfuil an oiread sin eolais acu a chur isteach chucu nuair atá a fhios ag an saol Fódlach nach bhfuil aon bhrabach acu as na rudaí seo.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with this report because it does not address the issues in a meaningful way.  There are no proposals for the reorganisation of services to ensure that islanders may access services at the one stop shop.  The manager of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann has to deal with one set of agencies on behalf of the Gaeltacht islands and different agencies for the non-Gaeltacht islands.  A year ago I put forward a very simple proposal that all islands, irrespective of being Gaeltacht or non-Gaeltacht, would be under the aegis of a new Department to be known as the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Islands. There are 800 people living on non-Gaeltacht islands and in excess of 2,000 living on Gaeltacht islands.  The ferry services, the piers and so on should be the responsibility of one Department.</P>
    <P>When the interdepartmental committee sat around the table with a representative from every Department its prime objective was to ensure that no Department lost control of any of its functions. That is the nature of civil servants participating in an interdepartmental committee but the function of the politicians should have been to ensure that the <Col N="1803" /> islanders' requirements were put ahead of departmental empire building.  There is no proposal to get rid of the ludicrous arrangement whereby the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications provides the ferry services to the Aran Islands, the Gaeltacht islands have no subsidised transport services, even though everybody in Dublin has subsidised transport services, and the transport service on other islands is subsidised by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Even at this stage I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of state said that access transport is vital but what is done about this in the report?  Instead of a blueprint we are told that the county council will set out the proposals on access transport. It should have been possible in the past three years while this committee was sitting, and particularly in the past year with the office of the Minister of State dedicated to the task, to draw up an action plan and survey all the requirements to provide access transport, in both landing facilities and ferry facilities.  This did not happen.  What is needed is a landing facility on each island and a corresponding landing facility on the mainland, suitable for the ferry boats that are required.</P>
    <P>If we are to make it attractive for young people to stay on the islands the most important requirement, as has been proven in the Aran Islands, is efficient access transport.  People should be able on a regular basis to leave the islands in the morning, do their business and return to the islands in the evening. There is nothing in this plan or in the famous £1 million envelope that would lead anybody to believe this will be addressed in a meaningful way.  It is very hard to stomach the allocation of £1 million in 1996 for access transport to the islands when one reads in today's newspaper that £17 million will be spent on a few Dublin DART stations.  Islanders for whom the ferry services are literally their only way on and off the islands are to be given £1 million to be divided <Col N="1804" /> among all the islands, despite the Minister of State's admission that they have been neglected for a long time.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations on education are a sick joke.  The means test for the remote areas boarding grant has been set for many years at the ridiculous level of £9,000.  I have stood in this House time and again asking that it be abolished.  Instead, provision has been made for a means test set at the level of the third level education means test.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Education asking how many students were getting the remote areas boarding grant whose parents' income was above the limit; the answer was 25, 24 of whom were living on offshore islands.  By raising the income means test level to £17,000, many of the 24 will be exempt but the Government will means test the income of parents of all children attending secondary school because there is no secondary school on the island and five or six will be over the limit.  This is bureaucracy gone crazy.  It should be pointed out that the people who are unlikely to pass the means test are teachers, gardaí and the co-op managers. Are we trying to drive them off the island and make it impossible to get people such as teachers, gardaí and factory managers to live on the islands? We talk about developing basic services. Everybody is entitled to a free secondary education.  The cost of boarding is part of that entitlement and should be available to everybody on the islands without undergoing a means test.  It is a total nonsense to impose a means test.  I would go further.  The grants should have been increased radically to cover proper modern boarding costs and the cost for students of getting to and from the island on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned new technology.  The headmistress of one of the schools on the Aran Islands was in touch with me when she was given the new technology and wanted to exchange it for a photocopier.  The reply I received after three or six months was that it could not be done.  We talk about bottom up development.  It is about time <Col N="1805" /> we listened to people and gave them their choices rather than telling them what they must take.</P>
    <P>The question of air services to the islands is not addressed.  We all know fixed wing aircraft are much cheaper to run than helicopters and that airstrips are cheap to provide.  An airstrip could be provided for the cost of a small amount of road.  I would have thought in this report we would have a comprehensive commitment to provide airstrips to accommodate fixed wing aircraft on the heavily populated islands such as Inishturk, Clare, Inishbofin, Tory and so on.  We know how cost effective this has been in the case of the Aran Islands but there is still no firm commitment to funding such airstrips.</P>
    <P>We need helicopters as more and more people are entitled to a winter helicopter service.  No clear guidelines or funding are provided for same.  We still depend on the Air Corps for emergency services.</P>
    <P>The report refers to health.  The main requirement from a health point of view is to enable pregnant women and those who are ill or old to attend the clinics and hospitals in the main towns.  In the winter it is not good enough that they have to undertake sea journeys to get to clinics.  Yet, it is not the type of transport the Air Corps is there to provide. There should be guidelines as to who, be it the Air Corps or a private company, will provide these services and who will fund them.  People should have an entitlement to air services to the mainland during the winter to attend clinics.  The Government talks about women's health but when it comes to island people, it is very short on action.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is well aware that the cost of living on the islands is much higher than on the mainland.  He is also aware that the islanders are the only people who pay VAT on food, children's clothing etc. because they have to pay VAT on the transport of these goods to the islands.  Last year, I proposed that islanders be compensated, for the extra cost of living and the fact that they pay VAT on items on which <Col N="1806" /> nobody else pays it, by giving them an islander allowance.  People on social welfare should receive an extra payment per week and an island allowance should be made available through the tax system to those who pay income tax. The cost would be negligible in budgetary terms but this would be a major step in trying to equalise the cost of living on an offshore island with the cost of living on the mainland.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare, the most fundamental issue on the islands was not addressed.  There was much talk during the past 25 years about developing fishing, tourism and farming.  I have spoken time and again about the depressing effect the pound for pound means testing has on the development of any small industries on the islands.  How often do we have to explain that if island people increase their earnings from farming fishing or craft work every penny is taken off the dole or old age pension. As long as that is the system, people will wonder if they are developing all these industries for the Minister for Social Welfare because they are not allowed to keep any profit from it.</P>
    <P>The means testing is thorough and comprehensive.  Officials from the Department of Social Welfare write to farmers in Inisheer and Inishmeán for full details of income.  Why can we not be realistic about this and acknowledge that on an offshore island tourism is for two and a half months, that fishing from an open currach, farming and craft work are not viable and people cannot live without social welfare.</P>
    <P>It is about time we told islanders we will not means test any of their activities because the income is so small and the people involved should be entitled to have some profit from their labour.  If the Minister took that step for the islanders it would be worth more than everything in this report.  If the Minister does not believe me he should go out to the islanders and put the choices to people. He could help self-development on the island.  As the Minister funds Leader programmes with the view to helping people, they are being pulled down by <Col N="1807" /> the social welfare code, and we are going nowhere.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed the report did not mention Rathlin Island, although the Minister mentioned it today.  As members of the Comhdháil I would have thought we had a unique opportunity to deal with the islands on an all Ireland basis.  We could also have availed of INTERREG funding from Europe and many other European schemes if we had decided to consider the islands on an all Ireland basis.  The people of Rathlin Island have a good relationship with the people on the other islands and with goodwill could be included in such a policy.  Sadly, this report does not even mention the existence of Rathlin Island.</P>
    <P>I hoped to see a clear charter of rights for islanders in this report.  I would have liked it stated clearly that islanders are entitled to the same standard of living, at the same cost, as everyone else.  Islanders do not want to become guinea pigs; they do not want to become a protected species; they do not want tourists to be sent out to look at them as if they were some type of strange people.  They are ordinary Irish citizens.  All they are seeking and all I am seeking on their behalf is that they be treated the same as everybody else, that they have the same right of access to services and to subsidies enjoyed by those in the cities, that they have the same right to education as people living on the mainland, that they have the same right to medical services and the same right to the standard of living enjoyed by people on the mainland at the same cost.  That is all they and all I seek.  I do not like the reservation mentality that some people adopt towards people living in rural areas.  I have always objected to the idea that people in rural areas were trying to preserve a standard and a way of life that is not relevant in the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>While I want to protect the architectural and cultural heritage of the islands &mdash; and my commitment to the Irish language is second to none &mdash; I want to do <Col N="1808" /> it in a way that is compatible with the highest standard of living, the best use of technology and the greatest quality of life that can be provided in the late 20th century.  Nothing else is good enough.</P>
    <P>Despite the length of time it took to prepare, this report totally avoids all the difficult questions.  It is a political copout and it is clear that the bureaucracy and the perpetual fighting among Departments for the retention of power won in the end.  The report is short on specifics and those that it contains are minimal: £1 million for access transport and infrastructure; a change, rather than the abolition, of means testing for 24 people and the exemption of income from the REPs &mdash; it was announced in the budget that would be on a nationwide basis.  When we examine those specific measures and strip away all the pious platitudes in the report, it contains very little.</P>
    <P>I am gravely disappointed with this report because a unique opportunity exists to develop the islands.  There are signs that if conditions were favourable, many islanders would like to settle on the islands.  The young people, in particular, want to do that but only if they can enjoy a 20th century lifestyle.</P>
    <P>Cúis díomá dom a laghad atá sa tuarascáil seo.  Ní maith liom seasamh suas anseo agus cáineadh géar a dhéanamh ar rud a chaith daoine saothar leis ach ag deireadh an lae níl tada ann.

      <P>Táimid ag fanacht suas le <Col N="1809" /> trí bliana is dóigh le haghaidh an tuarascáil seo agus bhí roinnt againn mífhoighdeach de bharr go raibh an Roinn i gcónaí ag déanamh leithscéil faoi cheisteanna a rabhamar ag cur orthu maidir le scéimeanna agus infrastruchtúr agus rudaí eile a bhí ag teastáil ó na hoileáin. Bhíomar ag fáil an freagra go gcaithfimis fanacht go raibh tuarascáil Choiste na n-Oileáin réidh agus foilsithe agus go raibh siad ag plé chuile cheist a bhí á hardú anseo sa Dáil leis na Ranna Stáit.</P>
      <P>Chuir sé díomá agus ionadh mór orm nuair a tháinig an tuarascáil amach tar éis trí bliana nuair a chonaic mé nach raibh aon toradh fiúntach le feiceáil ar obair trí bliana.  Tá díomá orm mar is dóigh liom go raibh dalla mullóg á chur orainn de bharr na gealltanais a bhí tugtha dúinn maidir leis an toradh a bheadh ar an obair seo.</P>
      <P>Níl a fhios agam cén fáth ar tharla sé seo nó cad a bhí ar siúl.  An raibh aighneas idir na Ranna Stáit nó argóintí nó an de bharr neamhshuim a tharla sé seo nó cad is cúis leis an drochthoradh? Níl tada le feiceáil ach gur dhírigh an coiste seo ar cheist na n-oileán ach nár tháinig siad suas le haon mholtaí cinnte nó fiúntacha a thabharfadh dóchas do mhuintir na n-oileán seo go raibh an stát dáiríre futhu agus go ndéanfaí beart ar a son sul i bhfad.  Sin mar atá agus is dóigh go gcaithfimid fanacht lena fheiceáil an bhfuilimid ceart nó an dtiocfaidh toradh éigin eile as nach féidir linn a fheiceáil anois.</P>
      <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht go cúramach le mo chomh Theachta Ó Cuív ag labhairt ar son Fianna Fáil agus táimid ar an dtuairim chéanna.  Ní mór a chur san áireamh nach bhfuil ach daonra de 3,000 daoine nó beagán leis ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin seo agus tá 21 acu ann a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí iontu.  Tá suas le leath de na daoine sin go léir ina gcónaí i mo Dháilcheantar amach ó chósta Chontae na Gaillimhe ar oileáin Ghaeltachta, Inis Mór, Inis Meáin, Inis Oírr agus ar Inis Bó finne, oileán nach bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An rud a chuir as domsa feadh na mblianta ná cé gur éirigh linn Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta <Col N="1810" /> a chur ar an saol agus rudaí éagsúla a dhéanamh tríd na huirlisí sin ar son muintir na n-oileán Gaeltachta i mo Dháilcheantar ach nach raibh sé chomh héasca sin rudaí a dhéanamh ar son an oileáin nach bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht, de bharr nár thit cúram an oileáin sin ar aon Roinn Stáit ar leith.  Bhí na hoileáin amach ó chósta Mhuigh Eo níos faide siar fiú ná ár n-oileáin agus na hoileáin ó thuaidh agus ó dheas, cé nach raibh muide sásta fiú leis an méid a bhí déanta againne.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé ar bís mé éisteacht leis an Aire anseo sa chéad alt dá ráiteas don Dáil.  Is léir gur déanadh neamhní de riachtanais an phobail iargúlta seo le fada.  Níor deineadh neamhní de riachtanais na n-oileán a bhí i mo Dháilcheantar agus inné bhí orm a chur in iúl don Aire nach raibh an ceart aige nuair a bhí sé ag labhairt faoin aerseirbhís agus glacaim buíochas leis anois as ucht tuarascáil na Dála a cheartú sa mhéid is go dtugann sé aitheantas go raibh an aerseirbhís ann i 1970 cé go gcuireann sé i mo leith go raibh mé i mo Aire Gaeltachta ag an am.  Níl sé sin fíor ach an oiread agus níl a fhios agam cá bhfuil an tAire ag fáil an eolais míchruinn seo go léir.  Bhí mé i mo Aire Rialtais Aitiúil agus buíochas le Dia, bhí Aire Airgeadais agus Aire Gaeltachta ann ag an am, Seoirse Ó Colla, a raibh an-suim aige sa teanga agus san obair a bhí ar siúl i Roinn na Gaeltachta agus a thug ancúnamh d'aon togra a chuireamar os a chomhair.  Is de bharr obair a rinne Seoirse Ó Colla mar Aire Airgeadais agus Aire Gaeltachta a tháinig an aerseirbhís chun cinn nuair a chuireamar na h-argóintí os a chomhair.  Fear an-dílis don Ghaeilge agus do na Gaeltachtaí agus mo léan nár tháinig aon fhás ar aerseirbhísí ó shin agus nár éirigh liom féin aerseirbhís a fháil d'Inis Bó Finne cé go ndearna mé brú.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag súil leis an dtuarascáil seo go gcuirfí amach plean cinnte maidir le seirbhísí riachtanacha a chur ar fáil taobh istigh de thréimhse ach níor deineadh aon staidéar nó aon mholtaí den tsórt sin.  Nuair a léitear an tuarascáil is <Col N="1811" /> é atá ann ná moladh go ndéanfaí staidéar air seo agus an cás a mheas agus go rachadh daoine ag comhoibriú lena chéile agus go mba chóir do údaráis áitiúla ar fud na tíre díriú ar dheacrachtaí na n-oileán.</P>
    <P>Tá gach rud luaite sa tuarascáil ach níl aon mholadh cinnte agus is é an t-easpa pleain an t-easpa is mó ar an dtuarascáil a chuireann as dom.</P>
    <P>I am proud that half the population living in offshore islands are in the Galway West constituency, which I have represented for the past 31 years.  I have diligently tried to represent their needs during these years.  I feel I have a proud record of achievement in succeeding in bringing modern facilities to most of those islanders.  However, I often feel depressed with the lack of progress in bringing facilities to those living on other islands.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to the Dáil there was no piped water on the islands, except for a small scheme in Kilronan in Inishmore, no tarred roads, except for one coming out of Kilronan on the main island, and no electricity, air or ambulance service or modern ferry.  The only ferry went to Inishmore once a week in winter and twice a week in summer, which then had a population that exceeded 1,000 people.  There was no inter-island mainland daily passenger ferry service and only a small and inadequate tidal pier at all islands.  Land goods could only be brought to the island on high tide at some piers while one could not attempt to go near the others, even on the calmest of summer days, because they were too small.</P>
    <P>Many things have happened to the islands in my constituency in the intervening years but I am still not satisfied that we have been successful in providing the people there with the level and standard of facilities available on the mainland.  That was always my objective and I hope the Ministers and the various Government Departments will try, as far as possible, to give that a standard of living to those on the offshore islands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> This report is disappointing because it does not set out any specific detailed plan to provide the kind of essential services, facilities and developments for which the islanders hoped.  It only gives a list of aspirations under a number of headings, typical of which is the need to establish mechanisms and potential and to examine particular problems.  It gives recommendations that matters such as accounting for the need to retain the island's unique culture and language be examined.  It also calls for examining the development of the most appropriate strategic approach to developing the island's tourism, the feasibility of establishing an island product marketing group, the development of a strategy for islands, the improvement of facilities for tourists waiting at harbours, the provision of training courses under CERT, FÁS and Údarás and broader issues relating to access, transport, harbours, roads, water and sanitary services.</P>
    <P>This report contains only general statements; it is the most disappointing document any interdepartmental group has produced during my years in this House.  I have never seen such an ineffective document.  What were these people doing?  The Minister chaired this committee.  How could he expect that the Members of Dáil Éireann and the island communities would openly welcome these proposals when there are no specifics contained in it? Everything in it is vague and generalised and leads to something else.  The whole document is pitched and written on the basis that everything needs to be examined and assessed.  The kind of report we wanted to hear after all the time these officials, including the Minister, spent looking at this matter would have made specific recommendations.  Deputy Ó Cuív made some recommendations and he has good practical knowledge and experience of their needs because, like myself, he has visited them for many years.  He also has the added experience of being a bainisteoir of a comharchumann.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to have heard something that would have equated to <Col N="1813" /> the real needs of the islanders, like a mission statement outlining what the Government sees as its duty to those communities.  Is the Government committed in seeking to achieve a standard of living for those on the offshore islands which would equate to that available on the mainland?  If its objective in regard to its overall policy for the islands was committed to that kind of mission statement, we could begin to devise ways of solving these problems.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get access to the islands.  Enormous additional costs are involved because of that difficulty of access and of the extra transporting of all goods used on the island.  If the goods are not manufactured on the island, they must be transported there and goods manufactured on the island, such as agricultural, craft and other pro ducts, have to be brought out.  There is no recognition of the unique costs added to these islands.  VAT is charged on the purchase of goods.  However, it is charged again when they are being transported to the islands.  Islanders have to pay double the VAT rate, there is no proposal to grant any concession or any reference to these difficulties in the report.</P>
    <P>Since there is a higher cost of living on the islands, which has been estimated as being as much as 50 per cent higher than in the mainland &mdash; it is certainly between 33 and 50 per cent &mdash; there should be a special level of social welfare payment made to people residing on qualifying offshore islands.  These payments should at least be one third higher than the rate applicable on the mainland.  Housing grants should also be increased in line with the increase in the cost of living on an annual basis to allow for the exceptionally high cost of building a house on an island.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in this report to housing.  This is an extraordinary omission. One of the difficulties experienced by islanders in my constituency is if they are not able to build a house for themselves, they must go to the local authority, which will not build one for them <Col N="1814" /> unless they provide a site.  If they do not own land, they will not get a local authority house and if they do, it is only because they waited many years for a house to become vacant on the island. This real and practical difficulty has been ignored by the Minister, who, with others, worked for three years in preparing this document.  A family had to leave the islands because they did not have the wherewithal to purchase a site for Galway County Council which would not buy one.  Instead, it provided them with a house on the mainland. Other families have been in touch with me to indicate that they are experiencing similar difficulties.  Families who asked the county council to build a house for them on a site provided are living in overcrowded conditions either with a relative or in a broken down old house which is only habitable in fine weather in July and August.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to this problem in the report.  The local authorities should be obliged to provide sites on the islands to facilitate the construction of houses for those not in a position to provide them for themselves.  The housing grants should also be increased on an annual basis in line with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Those in employment on the islands should not be asked to pay tax at any level higher than the standard rate of 27 per cent.  There should be a standard subsidy payable to all ferry services to the islands.  It is not acceptable that some services are not being subsidised. This is happening in my own constituency. Whereas the services to the three Aran Islands are subsidised, the services to Inishbofin are not.  The same applies to the services to Inishturk.  There should be no inequality.  This problem has been highlighted previously and it is time to eliminate the distinction.</P>
    <P>An air service should be provided to all islands with a population of 50 people or more.  The Minister of State did not refer to any proposal which would give islanders hope that action <Col N="1815" /> will be taken on this issue.  The air service to Inisheer, Inishmaan and Inishmore established in 1970 has not been extended to include any other island.  If the airstrips were provided it would not present Aer Arainn or any other company with any operational difficulty to provide a service.  The Minister of State should give a commitment that an airstrip will be provided on every island with a population of 50 people or more.</P>
    <P>Proper landing facilities should be provided to enable ferry boats come alongside the pier in average weather conditions.  For generations islanders had to endure cruelty and hardship in rowing out in small boats to ferries to load and unload furniture and various other goods.  This should be laid down as a clear objective.  An indication should be given that special provision will be made to ensure small piers are raised to a proper standard.</P>
    <P>The pier at Kilmurvy on Inishmore was destroyed in a major storm in 1991 or 1992 and all efforts to restore it to its former condition have ended in failure. The Department of the Marine referred the matter to the local authority which, in turn, referred it back to the Department. Roinn na Gaeltachta states that it has no role to play.  Yet, the Minister of State claims the Government appointed him to look after the interests of islanders. The pier mentioned, which is used by small lobster boats, has been in a dilapidated condition since the early 1990s when it was demolished by high seas. That is evidence of the neglect.</P>
    <P>VAT should not be chargeable on goods transported to the islands.  Islanders should be relieved of the obligation to pay VAT on the double.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State recognises, islanders have to travel to the mainland for business, educational, health and various other reasons.  This may entail an overnight stay in a town and taking a taxi as there will not always be a bus there when they arrive on the mainland. The costs involved should be taken into account by the Department which should consider providing a regular <Col N="1816" /> scheduled service which should be subsidised by the State to ensure that islanders can travel to the mainland early in the morning, transact their business and return in the evening.  This has been achieved on the Aran Islands. There should not be top quality facilities on some islands and none on others.  We should seek equality.  Now that we have access to EU funds for many of these developments, we are in a unique position. This was not the case in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>On the question of education, I expected the Minister of State to make a clear statement that the means test for secondary school pupils living on offshore islands would be abolished to allow them avail of boarding out grants, which should be increased.  A travel allowance should also be payable to offset the huge extra costs involved.  There was a vague reference to increasing the threshold slightly.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that the same rate of tax is applied to motor vehicles on the islands as on the mainland.  These vehicles have made a huge difference to the quality of life of the islanders.  In the early years vehicles were always old bangers, but now good quality cars and vans are available.  However, because of the condition of the road structure they tend to deteriorate rapidly.  Corrosion is a major factor because of the salt air in the marine environment and poor winter weather conditions.  Vehicle registration tax levels on the islands should only be one quarter of those on the mainland.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, the condition of the road structure is a major factor in assessing the quality of life of the islanders.  Because of neglect they are in a bad condition.  I would have expected specific proposals to be made in a report such as this to bring them up to a satisfactory standard.</P>
    <P>Potholes are a problem throughout the country.  I hope the ten year programme announced by the Government to resolve it will have some effect.  There is no reference to the special needs of offshore islands which must not be left to the mercy of the local authorities. <Col N="1817" /> Because of their small populations, the extra costs involved in transporting tar and chips and the inconvenience caused for engineers and workmen in travelling to the islands in bad weather, etc., the task is more awkward.  It is much easier to carry out roadworks on the mainland. Somebody must have responsibility for ensuring that island roads are not neglected because of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Water is another basic infrastructural need.  The Minister of State said that £1 million would be available for the 21 islands to cover priority proposals put forward by island communities after consultation with Comhdháil and the local authorities.  It would probably cost £1 million to provide the water scheme for Inis Mór applied for by Galway County Council &mdash; it would certainly cost that to carry out such works on the two islands.  A proper sewerage scheme is also required.  The Minister of State's £1 million could be used up very quickly if it were used for those purposes.  He did not indicate the type of work that would be funded, but £1 million will be of little use if it is used to fund water and sewerage schemes and road improvements.</P>
    <P>The report is vague and disappointing. However, I do not wish to be critical.  I have been arguing for the needs of island communities for many years.  The setting up of the interdepartmental committee is progress because the problems will be focused on, but the lack of positive proposals is disappointing. The report provides us with the ammunition to continue to hound Ministers for follow up action on assessments, reports and examinations.  We will not be put off by the glib language in the report.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his endeavours. If he fulfils his aspirations he deserves great credit.  If not, the position will be worse than ever.  We in Opposition can only highlight these matters and if our parties get into Government we will assume responsibility.  In my time as Minister I worked diligently and achieved good results, but I regret not having time to do more.  It is sometimes <Col N="1818" /> difficult to convince Ministers of the extent of certain problems.</P>
    <P>The Government is focusing on the difficulties of island communities.  A committee was set up by Deputy Andrews and the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has been given special responsibility for this area.  I support the report's objectives but it is regrettable it contains very few specific proposals.  I hope the Minister of State will acknowledge the points made in this debate and fight a harder battle for more funds to meet the needs of the island communities.</P>

Tá mé féin sa Dáil le 15 bliana agus tá an Teachta Molloy anseo i bhfad níos faide agus ní cuimhin liom aon díospóireacht ó tháinig mé isteach anseo ar oileáin na hÉireann agus na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir na n-oileán agus an méid a tharla do na hoileáin le blianta fada anuas.  Táimid i gceannas ar ár gcuid cúrsaí anseo le 70 bliain sa tír seo agus sílim go bhfuil sé scanalach an dóigh a chaitheamar leis na hoileáin i rith an ama sin; bhí dearmad déanta orthu.  Sílim go bhfuil creidiúint ag dul don Aire a chuir an coiste seo ar bun agus an Rialtas a d'fhoilsigh é.  Ar deireadh thiar táimid ag tabhairt aitheantas do na hoileáin go bhfuil siad ansin agus go bhfuil deacrachtaí acu agus go bhfuil fonn orainn rud éigin a dhéanamh chun an rud a chur ina cheart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht le cainteoirí an fhreasúra agus deir siad nach plean gníomhaíochta é seo &mdash; not an action plan.  Ach má dhearctar ar an téarmaí tagartha a tugadh don coiste ní hé sin a bhí i gceist.  An rud a bhí i gceist ná anailís a dhéanamh ar dheacrachtaí na n-oileán agus moltaí a dhéanamh.  Tá an plean ag dul go direach leis na téarmaí tagartha a tugadh agus sílim gur bunchloch nó dúshraith í an tuarascáil seo ar cad a thig linn a dhéanamh sna hoileáin chun iad a chosaint agus a chaomhnú <Col N="1819" /> agus a choinneáil beo ins na blianta amach romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá an plean cuimsitheach.  Téann sé isteach i ngach gné de shaol na n-oileán &mdash; infrastruchtúr, cúrsaí oideachais agus seirbhíse sláinte, cúrsaí fuinnimh agus mar sin de.  Tá gach gné de saol na n-oileán clúdaithe ins an phlean seo.  Sa bhliain a bhfuil an Rialtas seo in oifig sílim go bhfuil aitheantas speisialta tugtha acu do na hoileáin, a Cheann Comhairle. Tá Aire Stáit againn a bhfuil cúram na n-oileán air don chéad uair agus tá sé freagrach don Taoiseach féin. Is dul chun cinn mór é sin agus ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Aire as an tsuim atá léirithe aige sna hoileáin. Tá sé ag iarraidh cuairt a thabhairt orthu go léir ina chuid am saor agus an deireadh seachtaine seo caite bhí turas an-torthúil aige nuair a thug sé cuairt ar dhá oileán i mo Dháilcheantar féin, an dá oileán is mó a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí orthu, Árainnmhór a bhfuil suas le 600 ina gcónaí air i láthair na huaire agus oileán Thoraí a bhfuil thart ar 120 air.  Tá sé tábhachtach go dtabharfadh an tAire cuairt ar na hoileáin agus go bhfeicfeadh sé mar dhuine ón dtaobh amuigh cad iad na deacrachtaí atá ann agus go mbuailfeadh sé leis an daoine atá ina gcónaí ar na hoileáin, go speisialta na comharchumainn a bhfuil an oiread sin oibre déanta acu le blianta anuas chun saol eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta mhuintir na n-oileán a chosaint agus sin go díreach a bhí ar siúl ag an Aire Stáit i dTír Chonaill an deireadh seachtaine seo caite.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom focal molta a thabhairt do na comharchumainn go háirithe an comharchumann ar oileán Arainnmhóir agus an comharchumann ar oileán Thoraí atá ag obair go dian ar son muintir na n-oileán sin.  Tá an-obair déanta acu agus ní mór aitheantas a thabhairt freisin don Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta as ucht an t-ardú suntasach de 40 faoin gcéad a deineadh i ndeontas reachtála na gcomharchumann. Bhí siad ag lorg an airgid seo ar feadh na mblianta, fuair siad geallúintí faoi ó pholaiteoirí agus ba é <Col N="1820" /> an tAire Gaeltachta, an Teachta Ó hUiginn leis an Aire Stáit a thug an t-ardú mór seo dóibh a chuirfidh ar a gcumas leanacht ar aghaidh leis an obair forbartha a bhí ar siúl acu.  Is beag cainteoir ón bhfreasúracht a dhein tagairt dó sin go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá eolas againn uilig ar scéim Leader 1 agus bhí Leader ann do na Gaeltachtaí. An chéim mhór atá tógtha le Leader 2 ná go bhfuil scéim ar leith ann do na hoileáin go léir idir oileáin Ghaeltachta agus oileáin Ghalltachta agus go bhfuil Comhdháil na n-Oileán freagrach as dáileadh an airgid agus reachtáil na scéime seo.  Aitheantas is ea é sin do na hoileáin agus do na deacrachtaí atá acu. Anois go bhfuil scéim dá gcuid féin ag na hoileáin tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh na hoibre le feiceáil i gceann cúpla bliain.</P>
    <P>Ní plean oibre é seo ach plean a dhein scrúdú ar dheacrachtaí eacnamaíochta, sóisialta, oideachais agus sláinte na n-oileán.  Saghas framework atá ann a thabharfaidh deis do na Ranna Stáit agus do na húdaráis áitiúla pleananna a chur le chéile fá choinne na hoileáin a fhorbairt.  Sílim go mbeidh dualgas ar leith ar na comhairlí contae agus mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Maoildhia, b'fhéidir gur deineadh neamart de na hoileáin go dtí seo, ach tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar gach rialtas áitiúil agus ar gach comhairle chontae plean cuimsitheach ar son gach oileán ina gceantar a chur chuig an Roinn chun a rá cad atá ar intinn acu a dhéanamh do na hoileáin ó bhliain go bliain.  Is cinnte gur céim ar aghaidh é sin.</P>
    <P>Bhí muintir na n-oileán ró-fhada ag éisteacht le daoine ag rá leo seo, siúd agus eile a dhéanamh.  Sa phlean seo tugtar ról do mhuintir na n-oileáin féin lena gcuid pleananna féin a chur le chéile i gcomhairle leis na comhairlí contae agus na húdaráis eile.  Mar dhuine atá ag déanamh ionadaíocht ar Dháilcheantar ina bhfuil oileán beidh mé ag súil leis go mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil ó na Ranna anseo i mBaile Atha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Tá an-chuid cainte ar fhorbairt ón mbun aníos agus sin go díreach atá <Col N="1821" /> anseo agus ní ón mbarr anuas, bhí go leor de sin againn.  Ceann de na laethanacha is tábhachtaí sa phlean seo ná leathanach 65.  Tá liosta de na hoileáin go léir a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí orthu ansin.</P>
    <P>The section of the report, which lists all the inhabited islands, tells the story of what is happening.  If this list had been compiled 20 or 30 years ago there would have been 40 or 50 islands listed rather than the present 20.  In the 30 years between 1961 and 1991 there was a drastic decline in the population on every island.  In 1961 approximately 1,000 people were living on Árainn Mhóir island in my constituency but by 1991 this had fallen to approximately 600 people, a reduction of 37 per cent.  I very much regret that the Minister did not have an opportunity last weekend to visit Bó Finne which suffered a decline in population of 97 per cent between 1961 and 1991.  There is no other place in Ireland, Europe or the world which has suffered such a drastic decline in population in a 30-year period.</P>
    <P>During the Famine one million people died while another one million people emigrated.  The depopulation of islands is on a par with that catastrophe. Last weekend I pointed out to the Minister the beautiful island of Gola, one of the most accessible islands off the Donegal coast but which is no longer inhabited.  I remember a time when several hundred people lived on that island which had a two teacher school.  The decline of 35 per cent in the population of the islands between 1961 and 1991 is a terrible indictment of us all, regardless of our political persuasion.  If this trend is allowed to continue what will be the story in another 30 years?  How many islands will still be inhabited at that stage?  Very few of them will be inhabited if the present trend continues.</P>
    <P>It is timely, appropriate and proper that we are discussing this framework report for the development of the islands in the years ahead which will help to halt the drastic decline in population and, hopefully, reverse it.  This <Col N="1822" /> can only be achieved with the co-operation of all the relevant agencies and Departments and the people of the islands who have a better understanding of their difficulties than anyone else.  At long last these difficulties will be dealt with in a meaningful way, thereby halting the decline in population and ensuring that this valuable part of our cultural heritage is not lost.  It should be remembered that the islands were inhabited before the mainland.  For example, the ruins of round towers, monasteries and other archaeological sites on Tory Island prove that it was inhabited before the green lands of Donegal.  The same can be said of the Aran Islands where Dun Aengus, a pre-Christian archaeological site, can still be seen.  We will have to bear the guilt if any more islands become depopulated.</P>
    <P>In spite of the decline in population much progress has been made in developing the beautiful island of Árainn Mhór.  For example, it has a good education system and an excellent comhar chumann which is very committed to the development of the island.  I remember visiting Arranmore Island as a newly elected Dáil Deputy and seeing the entire young population of that island from ten or 11 to 18 years of age leaving the island en masse every Sunday evening for the mainland, and their parents or relations would not see them again until the following Friday evening. Times have changed.  Since then a secondary school has been opened on Arranmore Island.  The Minister of State visited that school last Friday where he sampled the hospitality of the staff and met some of the children.  It is a major step forward for Arranmore that the young people have primary and post-primary education facilities on the island and can get a full secondary education in their own environment among their own people.  It is a great pity that when they finish their secondary education there is little or no employment for them on the island and they have to emigrate to the States, to England and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> The island is now developing aquaculture. A beautiful holiday village is being built there and I am glad that the IFI, which is doing so much for Border areas, has shown an interest in Arranmore also.  I hope the future will be brighter for the young people there and that they will not alone get their education on the island but will be able to spend their lives there.</P>
    <P>Tory Island is one of the most historic islands off our coast with a civilisation going back to prehistoric times.  At one time there were 370 people living there. Ten or 15 years ago the island population was at the point of extinction. Donegal County Council had decided to build houses on the mainland for the people of the island, but a few farsighted people established a co-operative and the decline was halted.  The population was as low as 70, and today there are over 120 people on the island. They have a thriving school and last September I was glad to announce, through the good offices of the Minister for Education, a second teacher for the school.  We are so used to hearing about primary schools losing schools and teachers.  However, the trend on Tory has been reversed.  They have a second teacher and there are 30 young children attending the school daily.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister of State.  As the king himself said last Friday when we were there, if he is not remembered for anything else he will be remembered proudly by the people of Tory Island for his achievement in getting something for which the people of the island have been lobbying for the past 70 years, a pier and a harbour. Boats can go to Tory Island most days of the year, but there are many days on which they cannot land and have to turn back to the mainland.  I was very proud a fortnight or three weeks ago when the Minister announced an allocation of £4.6 million for the provision of proper harbour facilities for the island.  The people there have proved that they are worth it, and I am sure that when that facility is provided many <Col N="1824" /> people will have an opportunity to visit the island and see for themselves what is available there.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dul ar aghaidh agus roinnt rudaí eile a rá.  Tá áthas orm go raibh deis agam labhairt inniu ar an ábhar seo agus molaim an iarracht atá ins an leabhar seo &mdash; Framework for Action &mdash; agus is cinnte má chuirtear na moltaí seo i bhfeidhm go n-éireoidh níos fearr leis na hoileáin sna blianta amach romhainn ná mar d'éirigh leo sna blianta atá imithe thart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy McGinley on getting the £4.5 million. However, his work is not over.  There will now be a very fine harbour on Tory Island, but the two harbours on the mainland are inadequate.  Donegal may have to wait four or five years because it is the turn of Mayo to get the tranche of funds which may follow from this report.  I am sure Deputy Ring will be looking for the £1 million for Clare Island.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his invitation to all Deputies across the board to attend this launch, albeit that it took place in Dublin.  I say that pointedly because I regret that when the Minister for Health came to Mayo last Monday he broke precedent by not inviting all Deputies to attend the third launching of phase 2 of Castlebar Hospital, where £20 million is to be spent in the next few years.  In fairness to the Minister, he took a cross-party view in issuing invitations.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report, but not because of any earth-shattering recommendations proposed in it.  It was conceived by Deputy Andrews over three years ago.  The islanders welcomed the establishment of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee and the publication of this report was awaited with anticipation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the map on the inside page shows, there is a large number of islands in my constituency of Mayo, many more than are shown &mdash; only the inhabited islands are depicted.  It is well known that in Clew Bay alone there is an island for <Col N="1825" /> every day of the year.  I have never tried to count them, nor would I wish to.  One of those islands, now uninhabited, was purchased by John Lennon of the Beatles and it was international news at the time that he intended to set up home in Clew Bay.  Unfortunately, that plan never materialised and the island has only recently been resold.</P>
    <P>Prior to the formation of the committee, islanders had seen their population base devastated by a continued and, in some instances, rapid decline, particularly in the economically active age groups, leaving them populated only by very young people and an increasingly dependent elderly population.  For generations they have asked for improved access, special incentives and grants to preserve the population base, help and assistance to modernise fishing fleets, improvements in infrastructure, such as the provision of generating stations, ice plants, money for roads, help with the establishment of group water schemes and many other demands, some of which have been met and others which are still outstanding.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that good work has been done on the Galway islands.  I am familiar with Inishmore, having been travelling to and from it for the past 25 years.  In later years good work has also been done on the Mayo islands.  This is an opportunity to look at the future needs of those islands.  I welcome the publication of the report as a reference point to work to for the future.  I welcome particularly the commitment to review progress each year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the committee will be in existence for three years.  Much can be achieved in that time if there is the political will to do so.  Problems unique to island living and the action necessary to stabilise population loss are well known and I do not congratulate those involved with the report for identifying them.  I do not share the Minister's confidence that publication of this long awaited report will mean a new beginning to countenance the decline in the population on offshore islands.  I accept that a co-ordinating body with <Col N="1826" /> finance and muscle could revitalise and help ensure the long-term viability of many islands.</P>
    <P>The report was welcomed by Comhdháil Óileáin na hÉireann and other bodies and I hope their confidence will be justified.  The euphoria created by spin doctors and handlers which surrounds the publication of any report ensures a successful launch. Adverse comment is not entertained and the Government briefing is upbeat and full of promise.  Media commentators reporting on local radio or in the newspapers will uncritically regurgitate the main details of the press briefing and all will be rosy in the garden.  This is the first time that the contents of the report have been analysed in detail.</P>
    <P>The report is long on generalities and short on specifics.  To describe it as a breakthrough for island communities is an abuse and misuse of the English language. Unless maritime county councils commit financial resources to the already identified infrastructural problems there will not be a breakthrough for island communities and the fragile thread which enables them to hold on to a way of life, increasingly under pressure from the attractiveness of relocating to the mainland, will be broken.</P>
    <P>With the exception of Inis Mór which enjoys a booming tourist trade, all islands have suffered a dramatic drop in population.  Inis Mór and Arranmore off Donegal have the largest populations. For islands with a small population the decline has exceeded the overall average by a factor of nearly 100 per cent.  If we take the group of islands referred to on page 65 the average fall in population over 30 years is 35 per cent.  There are variations in that from a fall of 97 per cent on Inishbofin to 8 per cent on Sherkin Island.  Islands with a population of 50 or 100 people show the most dramatic drop in population and their survival is under threat.  If the trend continues for another 30 years most islands will be uninhabited.</P>
    <P>Following my proposal, Mayo County Council set up an islands subcommittee. <Col N="1827" /> Before that the council, with the assistance of various State agencies, carried out improvements to most main offshore islands.  Three other maritime county councils have such committees and they allow for a focused approach in responding to the priority needs identified at meetings by the representatives of the islanders.  The framework established by the report follows on from the precedent set by Mayo County Council and adopted by other councils.</P>
    <P>The Cork island study was referred to.  We meet islanders several times during the year and, having regard to our responsibilities as councillors and limited resources, we respond to their needs as best we can.  In the past two years we worked successfully with Leader I and received funding which enabled us provide excellent facilities.</P>
    <P>The report states that access is of critical importance to the future development of the islands.  Non-Gaeltacht islands have been discriminated against in the provision of funding on the capital and current sides.  I welcome the fact that Gaeltacht islands enjoy a subsidy, the free travel scheme, aeroplane access and support for setting up airstrips.  I hope that will continue but other islands should be given equal treatment.  The annual subsidy on the current side, including the cost of ferries and the Aer Arann subsidy, amounts to £800 per inhabitant on the three islands that receive the subsidy.  That is a large sum and should be given to other islands where it is possible to provide a ferry or airline service of the same standard.</P>
    <P>I cannot equate a policy of transport subsidy, which is discriminatory, with preservation of the Irish language.  The people on Clare Island and Innisturk are as deserving of financial help in transporting materials and foodstuffs to their islands as a Gaeltacht island.  They are just as entitled to have a reasonable charge imposed on them to transport their livestock to the mainland as any other island.  In 1994 the cost of living survey carried out on six islands with <Col N="1828" /> the co-operation of representatives of Comhdháil Óileán na hÉireann showed that a basket of 23 common food items purchased on a weekly basis cost 16.6 per cent more on the islands than on the mainland.  A family who wish to build a house must transport all building materials to the islands and the disadvantage in price is 52.1 per cent.  One can see the need for a transport subsidy to be given to all islanders.</P>
    <P>The challenge is to halt the downward spiral in population migration to the mainland.  Throughout the report reference is made to such aspirations and verbiage as &ldquo;consultations&rdquo;; &ldquo;drawing up priority lists&rdquo;; &ldquo;review plans&rdquo;; &ldquo;explore fully&rdquo;; &ldquo;pay special attention&rdquo;; &ldquo;review existing responses&rdquo;; &ldquo;identify improvements&rdquo;; &ldquo;develop policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;examine potential&rdquo;.  The report is a way forward but I am looking for commitments. What is needed from all sides of this House is not to pay lip-service to a unique part of our heritage worth preserving, but to commit financial assistance and support at an accelerated rate, particularly when the economy is returning record amounts of revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of Deputies about the future of those living on the islands, which are of great social, cultural and historical significance. Although I do not represent the islands, it is vitally important that we do everything we can to keep people <i>in situ</i>.  No matter how much we consider this or previous reports, we will be judged on whether we had the ability to make conditions attractive so that people want to live on the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make it attractive for people to move and to stay on the islands and to travel to and from them.  Something which has dogged all island communities over the years is their inability to travel to the mainland at various times of the year.  One often hears people, particularly in Dublin, express romantic views about island life and there have been many documentaries about this over the years.  That is all very well <Col N="1829" /> when one is sitting back watching island life on television, but it is a romantic view of the most austere conditions in which people must live.  If one had to live on an island for six or eight months of the year with howling winds and snowstorms, that romantic view of island life would quickly evaporate. That is one of the main reasons people will not live on the islands.</P>
    <P>According to the report, approximately 800 people live on the islands off our coast.  If that figure decreases, we will face a considerable problem in that the island communities will not be able to regenerate themselves and the population will be an ageing one.  The report highlights a number of issues and I hope the views expressed will be listened to over the coming years.</P>
    <P>It is important that people are able to travel to and from the islands whenever they wish.  However, it is expensive to provide air transport &mdash; the only form of transport that can be guaranteed, Aer Arann, provides that service in Galway. I make no apologies to anyone when I hear people talk about a subsidy to ensure that the inhabitants of the islands have access to the mainland.  We must accept that people live on the islands and I congratulate those who established Aer Arann.  The Aran Islands are a great attraction for tourists and this report states there is a great future for tourism on some of the islands.  That is something which must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Despite the austere conditions in which island people must live, one would have assumed that in the era of technology jobs could be created on the islands which could not have been contemplated heretofore.  Forbairt, the IDA, the county enterprise partnership boards or the county councils should be in a position to give an additional subsidy to potential employers who previously might have looked at Dublin, Galway or a town in Connacht before considering the islands.  Because of that pecking order, there is little chance that an industrialist or a person who may create one or two jobs would want to go to the islands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> If we decide to give a subsidy for air and sea travel, then we must go a step further.  We must make it attractive for people to try to create jobs in those areas, particularly in the tourism and craft sectors.  It should be financially attractive for people to set up businesses on the islands.  That is nothing new as such a system applied to the west in the 1970s.  It worked well and many of the factories in the west came under that regime.  If industrialists showed any signs that they might leave the richer eastern region, they were provided with a financial incentive to move to the west.  There is nothing wrong in extending that to the islands.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows how the Structural Fund operates as far as headage payments are concerned.  I would like to make a plea today which I hope will not fall on deaf ears.  If ever there was an area suitable for the super severely handicapped areas scheme, it is the islands, other parts of Connemara and Dingle.  This is an ideal opportunity to ensure that we get a higher level of livestock payments through the super severely handicapped areas scheme, which had been spoken about for long enough in Brussels.  I mentioned this to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, on a number of occasions and I know he is very involved, as is Deputy Carey, the Minister with responsibility for the west. Between the two of them, I hope there will be an announcement in this regard.</P>
    <P>A few months ago an important decision was made in the budget in relation to the REP scheme as far as it relates to recipients of social welfare. That is of major benefit to people living on our islands.  There will be a disregard of £2,000 on REPs payments for social welfare purposes.  That is a very important factor because the low acreage on the islands means the people must rely on social welfare for nine months of the year.  It is extremely important that we get that message across.  The REP scheme will also benefit tourism on the islands.  The Minister <Col N="1831" /> of State, Deputy Durkan, had a great input to this scheme, which should be better publicised.</P>
    <P>The report states that the islands committee will be given responsibility under the Leader II programme.  That will provide an opportunity for local interests to come together.  Unlike previously when there was insufficient money to set up projects, the position is now changed and, while islanders may argue that there is still not enough money, there is provision for local development.</P>
    <P>It is important that there is co-ordination between the State agencies that have an input into the daily lives of islanders.  One of the great problems down the years has been access to the islands &mdash; it was not always easy to get a doctor or nurse to the islands.  Such problems obviously influence people in deciding whether to live and rear their families on the islands.  This project will be costly on the Exchequer but it will improve the social and cultural life on the islands.</P>
    <P>There is great vitality on the islands. I am not an expert on this matter, but islanders are beginning to believe that with better access and new technology, it will be possible to make a better livelihood. At the end of the day what matters is money.  Some people believe that I am being crude in adopting that attitude and that there are other aspects of island life that are important, but if people do not earn a decent living they will leave the islands &mdash; I make no apology for saying that.  With better opportunities and improved access to the islands a greater number of people will remain there.  In providing the various services, my colleague, Deputy Carey, has taken on board the views and aspirations of islanders.</P>
    <P>With greater co-ordination it will be possible to stabilise the population of the islands.  I would like to see a dramatic increase in the population of islands, but I do not think that will happen. There are many areas on the mainland in rural Ireland where there is a great decline in the population.  It would, therefore, be unreasonable to <Col N="1832" /> think that as a result of this measure there will be a huge increase in the population of the islands.  It will be a good day's work if we succeed in stabilising the present population.  If we address the impediments to progress and make life easier for the islanders they will respond positively.  The uniqueness of the islands is a great advantage, particularly in terms of tourism. If the necessary services are put in place islanders will be able to play a much greater role in attracting tourists.</P>
    <P>I highly commend this report and hope its aspirations become a reality.  I am sure that on review of the first year of the project progress will have been made and it will be considered a good development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an Tuarascáil seo antábhachtach do mhuintir na nOileán agus ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad dul síos comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Carey.  Tá sé tar éis cuairt a thabhairt ar fhurmhór na nOileán agus tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh sé cuairt ar na hoileáin eile.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I join other speakers in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, on his work in this area. Yesterday he said that the former Minister, Tom O'Donnell, initiated the first flights from Aer Arann but, while not wishing to take from Tom O'Donnell's role in attracting investment by Gaeltarra Éireann in the Aran Islands in 1973, he departed a little from that view today when he said that he acknowledges the role played by Deputy Molloy in 1970 in initiating a proposal for an air service to the Aran Islands.</P>
      <P>In 1970 my late father, who was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht, was on the first flight to the Aran Islands.  As Deputy Molloy will confirm, weather conditions got so bad that day that the return flight was cancelled.  That gives an indication of the problem of access to the islands. Even though improvements have been made since that time, with better aircraft and so on, access is still a major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a person from the Aran <Col N="1833" /> Islands who is a great supporter of Galway United soccer team outlined the difficulties he experiences in travelling to see the team.  If a match is held in Galway city on Saturday evening or there is an away match, it is not possible for him to return to the island on the same day.  That example highlights the problems faced by a sports fan who wishes to follow his team.  Access to the islands is a major issue and I am not sure the Minister of State highlighted it sufficiently.</P>
    <P>The declining population of the islands is of concern.  We know only 21 islands are inhabited and that is the first indication that the population of the islands has fallen.  It is indicative of what is happening in the western region. Recent figures published by the western development partnership board suggest that only 7 per cent of the population live in the north west while 41 per cent live in the eastern counties.  There is a big shift in population movement from the western region to the major cities, particularly Galway.  A major challenge is posed to Government to stabilise the position on the islands by maintaining the present population and providing whatever investment is possible.</P>
    <P>Account must be taken of the cost of improving access to the islands.  Business people and householders find the cost of house building materials and housing refurbishment expensive.  I was disappointed that the Minister of State did not refer to housing.  Galway County Council has encountered difficulties in acquiring housing sites.  It is difficult to purchase a site for a house.  The council is doing its best to acquire sites but the difficulties involved are compounded for people who wish to build their own houses.  In the past an exemption applied in respect of registered contractors and I hope it still does.  Any assistance from the Department or Údarás na Gaeltachta to Gaeltacht islands in that regard must be welcomed.  The bottom line is that the £1 million allocation is welcome, but it is not enough.  The full allocation could be spent on the Aran Islands alone, to provide houses, and <Col N="1834" /> water and sewerage schemes.  The largest of the Aran islands, Inishmore, is a popular island for tourists and even though I am a Galway man I classify myself as a tourist when I visit that island.  The basic infrastructural facilities sought by islanders must be provided by the Government.  If the necessary funding is provided it will give a great boost to the tourism industry, a major one on the islands.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not refer to the health services in detail although he may have mentioned them in passing. The provision of adequate health services for islanders must be addressed.  I am aware many initiatives have been taken in the Western Health Board area to improve services.  The introduction of Aer Arann in particular has meant that doctors, nurses, dentists and other health service providers have been able to travel to islands quickly.  I was very pleased three weeks ago to see that Galway University College Hospital has a video link up with Inishmore.  It was inaugurated by the Minister for Art, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins. People on the islands can link up in a private and confidential way with members of the medical profession in the hospital.  It is a welcome development and I hope the service will be extended to other islands.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not refer to the new Teilifís na Gaeilge also inaugurated by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Although that station may broadcast for only two or three hours initially, I hope some of its broadcast time will be dedicated to health services.  I envisage this type of consultation between a doctor in Galway city and an islander will be further developed.</P>
    <P>If we had sufficient money, the ideal solution would be for islands to have resident doctors.  Only a number of islands have a resident doctor.  I understand that in general, GP services are provided by doctors from the mainland who visit the islands on routine calls, as requested or when the islanders visit a doctor's surgery on the mainland.  More <Col N="1835" /> money would provide the solution to improving health services and I hope more funding will be provided.  A good public health nursing service is provided on the islands.  Islanders want reasonable access to health services and I hope that can be provided.</P>
    <P>The elderly and school children form a high proportion of the population on the islands.  That has major implications for health service providers, the Western Health Board in the case of Galway. I am aware that in County Mayo Dr. Cowley has promoted the idea of the air and sea rescue ambulance.  That idea deserves support and consideration. While a helicopter service can be called when needed, it was pointed out by the committee that in many cases there is not an appropriate place for a helicopter to land.  The provision of dedicated helipads would improve delivery of the service.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the need to co-ordinate this health service with other services. During Question Time yesterday, the leader of my party, Deputy Ahern, referred to the need for a single agency and although the Minister of State may have dismissed that idea yesterday, he should reconsider it.  The health services to which I referred are only one aspect of the problems faced by islanders. There are many other areas to which I could refer.  I stress the need to improve the health services for the islands and to consider the needs of the elderly and children who form a high proportion of the population on the islands.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will consult islanders on these issues and the health boards will examine the potential for developing services.  Available technology should be used as in the case of the video link-up with an island community provided by the Western Health Board.  Local authorities must also consider what assistance they can provide to islanders whether through the provision of houses or badly needed water and sewerage schemes on which no doubt the Minister will liaise with health boards and local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> There has been much recent discussion on providing access for the disabled to public buildings and other areas.  Deputy Mary Wallace recently introduced a Private Members' Bill on voting facilities for them.  Whenever and wherever landing sites are being provided for air or sea transport, access much be provided for the disabled.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the income limit for eligibility for grants for students from remote areas attending boarding schools are being brought into line with those applicable to third level maintenance grants.  I asked the Minister yesterday whether this increased limit would ensure that all island students would be eligible for such grants, to which I think he replied in the affirmative.  No doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I have since heard there may be a number of children who will not qualify even under the raised limit.  I should like the Minister to check out those facts because there should not be any limit imposed on such students.</P>
    <P>Those grants originally formed part of the school transport scheme.  Since it is sufficient trauma for island children to have to leave home, they and their parents should not be subjected to this further hardship.  Major anomalies have been identified in the overall school transport scheme.  Bearing in mind the small number of island pupils involved, such limits should be totally abolished, affording all island children an opportunity of obtaining grants and attending boarding school.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the REP scheme which is trotted out here daily, as it was yesterday when we were discussing biological diversity and it was advocated in the preservation of our flora and fauna.  Deputy Connaughton made the point that henceforth the first £2,000 of income under the REP scheme will be disregarded for social welfare purposes.  While that amelioration is to be welcomed, more money needs to be allocated to the funding of this scheme.  Certainly, if it is to be extended to biological diversity and to <Col N="1837" /> island applicants, more money must be provided.</P>
    <P>While claiming that applicants under the REP scheme are being paid, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has informed us that he will endeavour to obtain funding from some other source.  Although I have not yet heard the source of such funding, it is crucial that it be forthcoming since it would be of enormous benefit to Connemara and the west generally.  Despite our best efforts to obtain information on the allocation of funding, it has not been forthcoming from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, another matter I hope the Minister of State will have investigated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann and County Galway in the Leader II programme, thus ensuring that all islands benefit from its provisions.  While the Leader programme has been described as a last resort for applicants seeking funding for community development projects, it is of particular benefit to tourism.  When replying the Minister might elaborate on how islanders will fare under Leader II.</P>
    <P>I hope new technology will be deployed to provide new opportunities for island communities whether by way of computers, video or television links. Not so long ago the one-teacher school received the great bonus of having a telephone installed.  This is a most important development, affording that one teacher a link with parents, doctors and others whenever an emergency arises at school.  If we can utilise these great advances in technology for the benefit of island communities we shall have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>Although more money is not always the answer to all problems, I hope the Minister of State will be able to obtain greater funding since the £1 million could be expended on the Galway islands alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on having finally published <Col N="1838" /> this report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development of which he is chairman.</P>
      <P>In his contribution the Minister emphasised the islands' contribution to Irish life in cultural, historic and linguistic terms, to which all of us would subscribe. All of us have a certain romantic attachment to the islands, accepting that their special inheritance and way of life needs to be cherished and valued.</P>
      <P>The publication of this report, following long delays, is a mark of progress, a clear-cut acknowledgment of the many problems.  It provides a focus for discussion and can be a turning point for the still inhabited islands if its recommendations are implemented and, most important of all, its projects properly funded.  There, I am afraid, I must end my complimentary remarks about the Minister of State and his report.</P>
      <P>Located at the mouth of Sligo Bay is the beautiful Coney Island which featured elaborately this week in &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo;.  Its circumference is 1.5 miles by 0.75 miles.  When I speak of Coney Island the House will readily appreciate I am not talking about a few rocks protruding from the sea.  There is no bridge, causeway or road linking Coney Island with the mainland.  It is an inhabited island, not privately-owned. In other words, it fulfils all the criteria for consideration in this report and its recommendations, yet Coney Island appears to have vanished into clear air, like Hy-Brasil, from the interdepartmental report.  It is not listed in Appendix I among inhabited offshore islands nor does it feature in the illustration on the obverse side of the cover showing all the other 21 islands.  Apparently Sligo Bay is devoid of anything remotely like an island; there is no mention of it anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warn the Minister of State that Coney Island has a way of hitting back, of getting even with people.  When St. Patrick visited the island he clashed with an old pagan woman called Stoner who, disapproving of his presence, took unilateral action and served him cooked cat instead of rabbit.  The lore does not say <Col N="1839" /> what this did to St. Patrick's digestion but it does say that he lost a tooth in the process and if anyone cares to check they can cross the courtyard into the National Museum where they will find the tooth of St. Patrick among the Christian artefacts.  Having omitted Coney Island from the islands that qualify under all the criteria.  I advise Deputy Carey to be very careful when he is dining out in the Sligo area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister has all his teeth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Patrick did something positive.  He promised the people of Coney Island that the tides would always allow them to get to Mass on the mainland with dry feet.  Ironically, possibly the reason Coney Island is not featured in this report is that if you know the tides and various other features you can at certain times, drive across one and a half miles of foreshore to get to the island.  It is outrageous if this tenuous link excludes Coney Island from funding.  The status of Coney Island should be changed immediately and I have no doubt the Minister of State will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population of Coney Island has also declined dramatically from approximately 140 in the late 1880s to two inhabited houses today.  However, there are 11 habitable houses on the island and a public house which opens periodically in the summer.  The summer population is 30 or more and it is the belief that many people who came from the island originally would settle permanently there if they had reasonable services. The most important of all the facilities needed is electricity.  There were proposals some years ago to erect pylons and overhead cables to provide a power supply to the island but this was rejected.  This is one of the great panoramic views in the west.  If you are coming in by plane to Sligo Airport at <Col N="1840" /> nearby Strandhill, you will first see Lough Gill and the Isle of Innisfree, in the distance Glencar lake with its waterfall, further on to the right the bare head of Benbulbin, on the left Queen Mave's cairn, in the distance the Ox and the Donegal mountains, in the bay Coney and Inishmuray islands and on a clear day the woods of Lissadell.  The ESB wanted to erect a row of pylons amidst this beauty, naturally we all resisted it and the board did not proceed with the idea.  That should not mean the island is left without electricity, which is the vital key to its future.  It can be brought in by underground cable at a relatively modest cost when the advantages to the island are realised.  The nearest existing service point is a relatively short distance away.  Will the Minister take immediate action to ensure that the island gets electricity as that is the single most important thing he can do for Coney Island?</P>
    <P>In the report the emphasis has been on access.  One can reach Coney Island by boat from the Rosses Point side or at low tide one can drive to it from Strandhill.  There is considerable scope for improving access to the island although of its nature access to the island will be difficult.  Will the Minister grant aid a feasibility study by Sligo County Council, the relevant local authority, on the improvements that can be carried out and some measures that have been clearly identified by the people living on the island?  Relatively simple work can be carried out that would not make a huge dent in the Minister's budget.  Will the Minister redirect a modest amount to kick-start development on Coney Island as it has enormous tourism potential and would constitute a major attraction in the Sligo area?  However, facilities such as access and electricity need to be improved and the postal service which was suspended three years ago would have to be resumed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" /> Plans for future development have been drawn up by the islanders.  They have some excellent ideas on tourism and craft work, the restoration of old buildings and technologically based industries.  For such industries it does not matter whether you are on the island or on the mainland.  Coney Island has got off to a bad start but it is now up to the Minister of State.  Deputy Carey to take action.</P>
    <P>The report provides a framework and a focus for the islands, a blueprint for action.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, can take action and it is now up to him to get the funding.  The heamorrhage of people and the damage down through the years cannot be reversed but the Minister can give the island a chance and above all give it hope.  The report focuses on the islands, if it is acted upon it will make a difference and the Minister will deserve the gratitude of future generations.</P>
    <P>When the last residents were leaving Gola Island, off the Donegal coast I made a television programme recording it which I hope is in the RTE archive.  It was a very sad occasion, I hope that will never happen to Coney Island but that clearly is in the hands of the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím go mór roimh an Tuarascáil atá os ár gcomhair agus go mór mhór roimh an díospóireacht atá againn inniu ar na hoileáin.  Déanaim comghairdeas leis an Aire Stáit as an sár-obair a rinne seisean agus gach éinne eile a bhí ceangailte leis an Tuarascáil.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na hoileáin ar chósta na hÉireann ar a bhfuil cónaí ar dhaoine go buan caithfimid ceist a chur orainn féin caidé go díreach ar mhaith linn go dtarlódh dóibh.</P>
      <P>Ar mhaith linn go dtiocfadh deireadh leo faoi mar a tharla do Ghabhla nuair a druideadh na tithe agus tugadh tithe do na daoine ar an mórthír agus ligeadh do shaol an oileáin bás a fháil?  Chuir sin deireadh tobann le traidisiún, cultúr agus seanchas an oileáin sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An é sin an deireadh a ba mhaith linn <Col N="1842" /> a fheiceáil ar na hoileáin eile?  Nár mhór an trua agus nár bhocht an rud é dá mbeadh muintir na hÉireann i gceann daichead bliain ón am seo ag rá gur lig muidne do na hoileáin seo bás a fháil? Sílim go bhfuil sé riachtanach againn saol na n-oileán a chaomhnú agus a chothú ar son an chultúir, an traidisiúin agus ar son na Gaeilge atá ar mhórán acu, gan trácht ar na daoine féin.</P>
    <P>Mar shampla, le hairgead a dhéanamh ar iascaireacht tá gá le báid mhóra agus ar ndóigh le céanna.  Ní féidir le hiascairí a mbeatha a shaothrú le báid bheaga ag iascaireacht thart fá chladach oileáin.</P>
    <P>Mar sin cuirim fáilte roimh an doiciméad seo agus roimh na moltaí atá ann. Ach is í an áis is tábhachtaí agus is riachtanaí ná córas iompair.  Tá gach rud eile agus saol na n-oileán ag brath ar a bheith ábalta fáil isteach agus amach gan deacracht &mdash; rud an-simplí ach a chosnaíonn go leor airgid.</P>
    <P>Tá gá mór le báid farantóireachta agus le céanna maithe.  Ag caint air seo ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an £4,000 do ché nua ar Oileán Thoraigh. Tá aithne agam ar mhuintir an oileáin sin agus nuair a fhaigheann siad cúpla punt bíonn níos mó á lorg acu.  Mar sin tá súil agam anois go mbeidh an tAire Stáit ábalta aerstraice a thabhairt dóibh. Sin rud eile a bhí ar an liosta acu.</P>
    <P>Beidh Machaire Rabhartaigh agus Bun Beag ag iarraidh cúpla punt a fháil fosta.  Ansin beidh muintir Ailt a' Chorráin ag gearáin.  Sin mar atá ach tá tús maith ar aon nós déanta leis an gcé nua ar Oileán Thoraigh.</P>
    <P>Tá gá an-mhór fosta le córas héileacaptair. Ní mórán cabhair iad seo gan bóithre maithe ag gabháil leo.  Córas maith taistil an chéad rud a chaithfear a sholáthar má tá muid i ndáiríre faoi seo.</P>
    <P>Chun seo a dhéanamh tá sé riachtanach go leanfaí an moladh atá sa doiciméad seo &mdash; sé sin go dtiocfadh iomlán coistí agus comhairlí agus údaráis chuí le cheile gan mhoill chun plean oibre a chur le chéile.  Ach an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad ná go gcuirfeadh an Rialtas agus an tAire Stáit an t-airgead ar fáil.  Nuair a bheidh tús curtha le córas iompair is <Col N="1843" /> féidir ansin pleananna a dhéanamh faoi thurasóireacht, córais uisce agus séarachais, scoileanna, fostaíocht, iascaireacht agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report which was awaited by those of us who represent constituencies with islands.  I listened with interest to the debate.  The Minister of State is acutely aware of the needs of the islands because when he had the opportunity to visit Donegal recently he took it upon himself to visit Oilean Torí and Oilean Aranmór.  We must not forget Inishbofin and Inisfree.  This report addresses the problems of four islands.  Several years ago an islands committee was set up in Donegal on the initiative of county councillors.  Members of the committee have been awaiting this report and look forward to working with Comhdáil na nOileán, Údarás na Gaeltachta, FÁS, the vocational education committee etc. to develop a proper plan and a strategic approach to the islands in their area.  I look forward to that and I hope we will all have an input into it.</P>
    <P>A number of basic issues must be addressed but it will be expensive to solve them.  Unless they are addressed we cannot speak of other economic benefits for people on the islands.  I read with interest in the report that recommendations will be implemented if the money is available but if not other options will have to be looked at.  That is a more sensible approach.  Some people think they should have everything that is available on the mainland. I do not agree.  Everyone should have basic services such as water and séarachas and they should have an income but they are also unique.  Their uniqueness, tradition, music and language needs to be cherished to make them different, to give them that little extra.  I read with interest what the Minister had to say, that we should enable islanders to participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation through sustainable economic activity.  He prefaced that remark by saying that naturally <Col N="1844" /> they could not have everything that one can have on the tír mór.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at many other needs of island people.  I regret that many councils aided and abetted people to leave the islands by saying they would provide proper housing for them, instead of providing small houses on the islands.  That policy is changing in Donegal County Council.  We had houses built on Tory Island &mdash; I am sure the Minister saw them during his recent visit &mdash; at considerable expense.  That type of positive discrimination towards islanders is needed.  The infrastructural needs of islands are obvious and an effort will have to be made to provide them.</P>
    <P>Access by sea and air is vital if we are to address the health needs of islanders. Access to an emergency service, particularly during the winter months, is vitally important.  Winter months on the islands are not the same as winter months in Dublin.  In winter islanders have to cope with storms, no electricity and no access for several weeks, if not months, to the mainland.  We need to look at the access to emergency services. An emergency service should be based in Donegal for the Donegal islands and in Galway or Mayo for the islands off the coast there.  In the event of an accident or serious illness access to Leterkenny General Hospital or Sligo General Hospital would be required.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the issue of education, an area in which I have an interest.  Some islands are not as fortunate as we were in Aranmore where we worked with the parents.  It was a tough struggle to convince the Department of Education of the need to provide a second level school.  Donegal vocational education committee persevered and we had a couple of rough elections.  There was a boycott because they did not get their school but the people stood fast and got what they deserved, given that the boarding schools had closed.  It was difficult to get to and from the island because the ferry service was not as good at that time.  Parents were worried <Col N="1845" /> about the safety of their children.  When the boarding school closed, the children were boarded out and parents were concerned as to whether the children were behaving themselves.  Fortunately, there was a sufficient number of children on Aranmore Island to justify a small school.  This school is a credit to the people of Aranmore Island who support it.  They have a beautiful building and excellent teachers who are totally dedicated to the educational needs of the children on the island.  This has enthused and given life to that island.</P>
    <P>A debate is taking place on Aranmore regarding the amalgamation of the two schools.  I note the Minister for Education has indicated she will allocate money towards that amalgamation. I would like to know if that is correct because the people on the island have not agreed to an amalgamation.  Until such time as the parents and teachers agree that there is a need to amalgamate, it would be wrong of the Minister to make any decision without first consulting the people on both sides of the island who stand firm on their individuality. Splitting an island community is not the best way forward.  I realise the Minister of State is doing his best to encourage people to work together and to ensure that island people have some type of solidarity.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is mentioned in the report, which recommends that an islander should be a member of the educational boards.  I do not have any problem with that suggestion although I am not in favour of regional education boards.  A regional education board covering the large area of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, which has been referred to in the White Paper and by the Minister for Education, will not meet the needs of the small Gaeltacht or island communities.  It would be more preferable to have such a board based in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Money should not be allocated to bureaucratic structures which will not be of any educational benefit to certain areas.  I am sure the Minister has been lobbied by people from the Gaeltacht <Col N="1846" /> regions on the need to base the regional structure in the Gaeltacht, which would include the islands.  It is important that the islands are represented on such a body and it would give a different perspective to the educational needs of islanders.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues referred to distance learning, access to computers, etc.  These are vital needs for people living on islands.  Distance education has not been well developed in Ireland as a whole but the provision of computer systems for primary and secondary schools as well as adult education is vital.  Open University type courses should be provided for people living on islands who, because of distance and time, cannot travel to a regional technical college two or three times a week.  I welcome the debate on this issue and I hope the Higher Education Authority will examine the possibility of providing computers for people who wish to avail of distance education.</P>
    <P>All people should have access to information technology, particularly young children living on islands.  Unfortunately, island schools do not have the same resources as, say, a large primary school in south County Dublin which can afford to buy its own computers. Perhaps the Minister of State would make representations to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, with regard to making grant aid available to small island schools to ensure they have access to computer technology.</P>
    <P>Agriculture and fishing are the two traditional ways of earning a living on an island but fishing is no longer a viable source of income for islanders.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture is a possible alternative employment for islanders and in that regard I hope Údarás na Gaeltachta will ensure that islanders, and not large companies, benefit from any developments in that area.  Islanders and perhaps co-operative movements should be given funding and all other necessary assistance to provide an income for themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion in the <Col N="1847" /> report that the Department of the Marine, BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta, together with Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, should assess the viability of aquaculture.  There is a reference also to developing seaweed enterprises which are quite successful in County Donegal. These recommendations are sensible but it is unrealistic for small fishermen to compete with large trawlers operating out of ports such as Burtonport and Killybegs.  Island people, unfortunately, do not have opportunities to accrue wealth so it is vital to ensure they benefit from any aquaculture development on the islands.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a new source of income for the islands.  Many people, particularly foreign tourists, enjoy visiting islands and the freedom to wander around in safety.  Bord Fáilte, unfortunately, does not feel it necessary to provide grant aid for the upgrading of tourist accommodation facilities.  There must be a change of policy in that regard if we are to ensure that such facilities are provided. I know this area will be developed under Leader but Bord Fáilte will have to review its policies to take account of the real needs of tourism development.</P>
    <P>We must ensure also that training programmes are made available to islanders, particularly through FÁS or CERT, in addition to marketing courses and perhaps an overall course in tourism skills.  That is absolutely necessary if we expect people to provide such services to tourists.  They must also be given the necessary resources to upgrade their facilities, otherwise they are fighting a losing battle.  The islands are unique and they should be marketed as such but that can only be done if we ensure that proper ferry and air services are available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and I hope the strategic framework for the development of the offshore islands will soon be forthcoming.  I hope the Minister can convince his colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance, that proper resources are needed for the islands by way of infrastructure, access, education, <Col N="1848" /> etc.  Otherwise, the work that he and his predecessor have done in bringing the island people together will be wasted.  I sincerely hope that ten or 15 years from now we will not be facing the problem of people leaving our islands, as hapened on Gola Island.</P>

      <P>As Minister with responsibility for rural development, I am aware of the challenges facing rural communities and of the efforts they are making to secure their future.  Many rural areas face serious economic and social problems characterised by population decline, including a drift from the land, small scale and low income farming in some cases, as well as underemployment and unemployment resulting from a shortage of off-farm alternative job opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an acute awareness of rural communities who demonstrate a willingness and determination to tackle the problems and to play a meaningful role in determining their future.  That applies equally to our island communities. However, given their peripheral location, population size and limitations on economic activity because of lack of <Col N="1849" /> economies of scale, the challenges there are all the more acute.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee's report takes full account of these conditions and sets out a strategic framework for future development.  The issues of access, infrastructure, education, health services, sectoral investment and local development have all been examined in a comprehensive and systematic manner by the committee, and the recommendations which have been endorsed by Government will make a major contribution to the quality of life of island communities.  The report, is not an end in itself and the work of the interdepartmental committee will continue under the Minister's chairmanship in order to implement the various recommendations and, no doubt, to examine and discuss the on-going developments on the islands.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee's report is a comprehensive and strategic one but I intend to concentrate on issues which relate to the contribution my Department can make to island development, that is, agriculture related issues and the Leader programme.</P>
    <P>In so far as agriculture is concerned, the report acknowledges the difficulties island farmers face in terms of the land quality and small size of holdings.  In addition, there is the problem and cost associated with the transportation of farming inputs, livestock and farm produce.  Nevertheless, a number of useful recommendations have been made which can improve significantly the incomes of farmers in both mainstream and alternative enterprises.</P>
    <P>One of the keys to improvement, on the islands and in many rural areas, is in the provision of effective and supportive training and advisory services.  The report recommends that Teagasc assesses the additional skills island farmers require to maximise the potential of their holdings and I will ask Teagasc to undertake this task and to offer every assistance possible to island farmers. This will include examination of the recommendation on promoting a group <Col N="1850" /> approach to production and marketing and the possibility of developing a brand image for island produce.  This latter point is an idea which the Leader programme on the island might also address.</P>
    <P>Annual payments to island farmers under the various premium and disadvantaged areas headage schemes amount to about £750,000.  All islands are currently classified as &ldquo;More Severely Handicapped&rdquo; for headage payments purposes.  European Union approval is being sought for a new classification of &ldquo;Extremely Disadvantaged&rdquo; and it is proposed to include all inhabited islands in this category.  Under this category, it will be possible to increase headage payments above the amounts currently paid in &ldquo;More Severely Handicapped&rdquo; areas.  Precise details have yet to be established but I am sure this departure will be welcomed by island communities.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that REPS is ideally suited to the type of farming practised on our offshore islands, i.e. extensive farming.  With this in mind I am obviously keen to ensure that the take up of REPS on the islands will be significant.  I recognise, however, that island farmers have met difficulties in their efforts to join REPS.  However, I must also recognise that substantial progress has been made in this regard and I, together with Department officials, will work to ensure that REPS is as available on the islands as it is on the mainland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív was critical of the REPS programme for island communities. I suggest that the Deputy encourage the island communities to become involved in REPS because it is ideally suited to island communities, especially given the new specification changes we introduced to suit the islands.  I hope there is a greater take up of the REPS scheme by the island communities so as to capitalise on its benefits.</P>
    <P>It was represented to me that the lack of an exemption of REPS payments from the means test for unemployment assistance was providing a barrier to <Col N="1851" /> REPS participation in many areas, including the islands.  Following prolonged discussion on this with the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare I was delighted that the Minister for Finance, in the 1996 budget, introduced an exemption of the first £2,000 of a REPS payment from the means test for unemployment assistance. This exemption is, of course, in addition to the offset of costs incurred in complying with REPS measures.  This concession goes a long way to meeting the recommendation made in the committee's report.  I am confident this exemption will make REPS more available in many western areas in particular and I am sure it will be equally welcome among island farmers.</P>
    <P>As the House is probably aware many offshore islands are designated as degraded areas under REPS i.e. areas where overgrazing, by sheep in particular, is a problem.  Obviously this is a problem REPS is seeking to address and to this end my Department, in late 1995, succeeded in obtaining the approval of the European Commission to a revised system of incentives under REPS in degraded areas.  The revised incentives are substantially more generous and, indeed, more flexible than the original measure which applied and should contribute significantly towards overcoming this serious environmental problem.  A particularly attractive element of the improved incentives is the introduction of a group incentive triggered where two or more of the shareholders in a designated commonage who, taken together, own more than 50 per cent of the sheep on the commonage join REPS, then the group incentive of an additional £12 per acre is available to all shareholders in the commonage who join REPS, including any already in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am also aware from representatives from Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann and the farm organisations that the provision of REPS planning services has been something of a problem for island farmers.  My Department raised this <Col N="1852" /> matter with both Teagasc and the private planning agencies and I hope that, as a result, planning services will be more available to island farmers.  A group approach to planners would be beneficial and would reduce the cost of plans.  My Department is anxious to encourage the island farming communities to participate in REPS and will facilitate them to ensure this innovative and very worthwhile scheme is fully taken up by island farmers.  Indeed, I recently indicated my willingness to visit the islands with a view to assessing the problems on the ground and to help in any way I can.  I intend to visit a number of islands in the summer.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the problems of transporting animals between the islands and the mainland.  A related issue is the need for improvements in the facilities at piers and quays in terms of, for example, holding pens.  This is an issue the report recommends should be addressed in consultation with the local authorities and I will ask my officials and Teagasc to co-operate fully in examining the situation.</P>
    <P>Rural tourism can make a significant contribution to job and income creation in many rural areas and the islands have additional potential in this regard, being a particular attraction for visitors.  A number of important projects were grant aided on the islands under the Agritourism scheme under the Operational Programme for Rural Development, 1989-94.  I hope the success of the projects and the availability of funding under the current scheme will encourage islanders to invest further in tourist facilities and attractions.  The Leader programme also provides funding for rural tourism projects and I am confident that the work of the approved Leader group, Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, to which I will refer in a moment, will contribute to the development of the island tourism industry to the benefit of the economy of the islands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan referred to accommodation and I totally agree with her statement.  There is a grant aid provision <Col N="1853" /> of 20 per cent for this in the Leader programme where it is needed.  It is desirable to have as much quality accommodation as possible in our island community to encourage people to visit and stay.  Recognising that each island has its own particular characteristics and problems, the main thrust in the interdepartmental committee's report is that the islanders themselves are best placed to play the lead role in devising and implementing development strategies. The main role of the Government, therefore, is to create the conditions and facilitate development rather than involve itself in every aspect of island development.  There is every indication that the island communities are more than willing to rise to this challenge.</P>
    <P>The evidence is available from the island communities' participation in the pilot programme for integrated rural development implemented by my Department in the period 1988-90.  That programme involved the appointment of a rural development &ldquo;co-ordinator&rdquo; to work with &ldquo;core groups&rdquo; of local activists in 12 rural areas, including the islands.  Its purpose was to provide a catalyst and facilitate development by raising the awareness of communities about their needs and potential for development, identify priorities for action and work towards achieving those local aspirations.  The independent evaluation of the programme found that it had generated significant employment and incomes and &ldquo;could make a distinctly useful contribution to economic and social development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the programme, the island communities demonstrated a commitment to it which indicated clearly that they were capable of participating in and contributing to their own development. Despite the pressure and pace of modern live, it was abundantly clear that the spirit of self-help and community participation, an essential ingredient of local development, is alive and well on the islands.</P>
    <P>While the Leader programme is an EU initiative rather than a national programme, in many respects it reflects the <Col N="1854" /> principles and objectives of the pilot programme for integrated rural development.  There is the same emphasis on &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; local developments and local participation in the implementation of a local business plan.  It was no surprise, therefore, that Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann submitted an excellent application for island development under the Leader II programme.  I was more than happy to recommend the plan for support to the Government and delighted that it decided to allocate funding of £1.058 million.  I signed the agreement between the group and my Department for the implementation of the plan on 1 February 1996.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme is based on the principle of bottom-up development and provides an opportunity for rural communities to involve themselves directly in their own development.  The approved groups are provided with funding to implement a plan which they themselves have drawn up.  The most important feature of the programme is that the groups set their own priorities for development and have the authority to grant aid local projects.  The plans cover investments in technical assistance, including animation and group administration costs, training, rural tourism, small and medium enterprises, marketing and processing of local produce and the preservation of the environment.</P>
    <P>These are sectors in which useful contribution can be made to the economy and communities on our islands.  I am confident that the funding allocated to the islands under the Leader II programme, combined with the other funds outlined in the interdepartmental committee's report, will make a significant contribution to the development of the islands.</P>
    <P>The main benefit of the Leader programme is the involvement of the islands communities themselves in their own development.  While I have referred to sectoral investments under the Leader II programme business plan, the benefit of the programme cannot be measured in financial terms only.  I <Col N="1855" /> expect all groups to devote attention and resources to the process of nurturing ideas, guiding and supporting project promoters and, especially, facilitating and encouraging community development.  This process of animation is the key aspect of the Leader programme which distinguishes it from other programmes.  I am gratified that Comhdháil intends to implement a number of key regional animation programmes which will pay dividends long into the future.  Nowadays, there are many sources of funding for economic activity, but the underlying support for animation and capacity building is critically important in encouraging and assisting communities to identify and exploit their potential for development.</P>
    <P>To attain maximum benefit under the Leader programme it is vital that co-operation takes place at many levels. All Leader programme groups are required to ensure that a comprehensive strategy of co-ordination with local communities and agencies is put in place before commencing the programme. Comhdháil has put liaison mechanisms in place and I am confident this will pay dividends on the islands as this strategy will ensure that the Leader programme complements the activities and actions identified in the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee's report.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme business plan is for the development of all offshore islands and will enable Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann to address the potential for development as it sees it. However, island communities have much in common with the communities on the adjacent mainland and can benefit from close contact and exchange with those communities.  I am pleased, therefore, that Comhdháil will be represented on the county strategy groups for the counties along the coast with offshore islands.  These groups have been established to ensure the co-ordination of activities among the area based initiatives at county level.  The exchange of information and experience between islands as a group and with the adjacent <Col N="1856" /> mainland will ensure close co-ordination of the delivery of programmes to the benefit of island communities.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to note that, in the case of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, so many community organisations and State agencies are prepared to give of their time, energy and expertise at board and sub-board level in the group.  This demonstrates an enthusiasm and commitment which I hope will manifest itself not only in terms of goodwill, but in practical concrete assistance for the future.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the hard work and commitment of those involved in Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann in preparing for the Leader II programme. The balanced and targeted measures outlined in the plan should make a substantial contribution to redressing island decline.  I congratulate all concerned in drafting the plan and on their success in being selected to implement this programme.</P>
    <P>The publication of the interdepeartmental committee's report marks an important step in island development.  A strategic framework is now in place and the working committee will continue to ensure that the various recommendations are implemented.  My Department is commited to contributing in any way possible to that work.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate and compliment my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, who has made a major contribution to the island communities long forgotten and ignored.  For the first time there is a strategy in place which will ensure the future of the islanders.  Its implementation presents a challenge for which additional resources will be needed.  The Minister of State has made a start by giving us a platform from which to work and an objective to work towards.  That is important.  I am more confident now than at any time in the past about the future of the island communities.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South West):</i>
        <Col N="1857" /> Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Tuarascáil an Choiste Idir-Ranna Comhordaithe um Fhorbairt Oileán agus comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit agus le gach duine a bhí páirteach ann. Cuireann an tuarascáil os ár gcomhair an <i>status quo</i> ar an hoileáin agus níos tábhachtaí fós na fadhbanna atá acu go léir ó thaobh oideachais, infrastruchtúir, seirbhísí sláinte, soláthar fuinnimh agus cúrsaí cumarsáide.  Tá fadhbanna talamhaíochta acu freisin maidir le Leader agus le hiascaireacht.</P>
      <P>Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach tuairisc mar seo a bheith againn ionas go mbeidh clár oibre ní amháin ag an Roinn ach ag na Ranna Stáit go léir a bhfuil baint acu leis na hoileáin.  Ba chóir go mbeadh plean comhordaithe ann ach ag an am gcéanna ní hé seo deireadh an scéil.  Tá bóthar fada os ár gcomhair amach anseo agus beidh an tAire seo freagrach agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé féin agus oifigigh a Roinne, cé acu Roinn an Taoisigh nó an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta, ar fáil lá i ndiaidh lae chun amharc i ndiaidh na fadhbanna a bheas ann.  Ní féidir na fadhbanna go léir a réiteach le dhá mhilliún punt agus sin an méid atá luaite sa tuarascáil.  Tá go leor eile de dhíth agus tá súil agam go bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre faoi seo agus sásta an méid airgid atá ag teastáil a chur ar fáil chun seirbhísí a fhorbairt ar na hoileáin.</P>
      <P>Ba cheart go nglacfadh achan Roinn den Rialtas leis an bpolasaí seo.  Ba cheart go mbeadh na seirbhísí atá ar fáil ar an mórthír ar fáil ar na hoileáin freissin. Tá rud luachmhar againn sna hoileáin agus ní mór dúinn cuimhneamh ar an tábhacht a ghabhann leis na hoileáin seo ó thaobh an chultúir, na teanga, na staire agus na hoidhreachta de.  Tá dualgas orainne mar ionadaithe poiblí, ar an Rialtas agus ar an Aire Stáit seo amharc i ndiaidh na riachtanais seo.</P>
      <P>Bíodh an tAire cinnte go mbeimid ag coinneáil súil ghéar air féachaint cé mhéad atá sé sásta a dhéanamh ionas nach bhfágfar an tuarascáil seo ar leataobh ag fanacht ar Rialtas eile chun an obair a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to all those involved in <Col N="1858" /> the preparation of the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Island Development.  This fine document examines the <i>status quo</i> and, more importantly, highlights what is necessary to increase the standard of living on islands to that enjoyed on the mainland. Island people work hard and want to fend for themselves but they need the necessary tools to do so &mdash; the infrastructure, harbours, roads, educational establishments and other services available on the mainland.</P>
    <P>Since 1961 there has been a serious population decline on the islands.  On Arranmore, the largest island off the Donegal coast, the population decreased from 948 to 546 and on Inishboffin from 171 to three, although it increases during the summer months. On Tory Island it decreased from 264 to 119.  The position is similar on Inishfree, Claggan, Inishbiggle, Clare Island, Inishtruk, Inis Mór, Inis Meáin and Inis Iarr.  All those islands are in my Euro constituency and I am responsible for their development.</P>
    <P>The decline in fishing in the past few years has resulted in many islanders emigrating as they are no longer able so sustain their families.  The Department of the Marine should consider providing additional grant aid for fishing boats on the islands.  In the past there were difficulties with salmon and drift net fishing, but although islanders caused little damage and caught few fish at that time, they are being penalised for the sins of others.  They did what was necessary and a recent report stated that drift netting was not the main problem at the time.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine has an important role to play in developing pelagic and demersal species.  In conjunction with BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta, it should also examine the possibility of promoting fish farming on islands.  There are ideal locations off Arranmore Island for farming halibut and this could be developed on the lines of the fish farms on Oileán Cléire off the Cork coast.  Fish farming could provide employment in areas where there <Col N="1859" /> are no alternative sources of employment.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed when the Minister terminated the Gaeltacht authorisation grants for areas including the islands.  I received similar requests for many years but turned them down because I realised the importance of those grants to Gaeltacht areas on the mainland and the islands.  I know the Minister of State is in a difficult position.  He visited Arranmore Island last Friday and agreed that the scenic road from Leabgarrow should be repaired.  If necessary harbour funds should be used and the Commissioners of Irish Lights will play an important role in that.  Each year the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht provides funds for Arranmore, Tory and other islands.  The islands should be grant aided and receive Council funding.  At present they cannot afford to repair roads to turbary plots, their only means of fuel. Island communities also suffered as far as grants for installing windows and doors are concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, not only should the islands be represented on the regional education board but they should have their own board.  The islands will benefit under Leader and I urge the Ministers of State, Deputies Carey and Deenihan, to ensure that all the necessary information is made available to the island communities.  They should work closely with the local officers and management.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party in Government played an important role in regard to Tory Island.  We recognised the importance of a proper harbour infrastructure and provided the necessary finance to carry out hydrographic and topographic studies, which culminated in the report available to the Minister.  I welcome the £4.6 million that will be expended on Tory.  Funds should also be provided for road repairs and other necessary services. The Minister for Education made an ambiguous statement recently about education on Arranmore Island.  We <Col N="1860" /> want a clear and unequivocal statement of her intentions regarding that island.</P>
    <P>If an amalgamation is in the best interests of the children then the new school should be located on a green field site.  This has already been brought to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

My office participates in the work of the Central Review Group on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and will be involved in any discussions that might arise in that forum on a new agreement.  As is the normal practice, officials from various Departments, including those from my office, will be involved in preparatory discussions in advance of any negotiations on a new programme.

The Taoiseach's views on <Col N="1861" /> the importance of this programme are well known.  On the last occasion he said it was as exciting as a reheated TV dinner while on other occasions he said it was designed to let economic sleeping dogs lie and represented a triumph of bureaucracy over enterprise.

      <P>It was agreed at the Summit held in London on 28 February that the British and Irish Governments would conduct intensive multi-lateral consultations with the relevant Northern Ireland parties in whatever configuration was acceptable to those concerned, beginning on Monday, 4 March and ending on Wednesday, 13 March. The purpose of the consultations was defined as being: (a)  to reach wide-spread agreement on proposals for a broadly acceptable elective process leading directly and without preconditions to all-party negotiations on 10 June 1996; (b)  to reach wide-spread agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of substantive all-party negotiations and (c)  to consider whether there might be advantage in holding a referendum in Northern Ireland with a parallel referendum held by the Irish Government in its jurisdiction on the same day as in Northern Ireland.  The purpose of such a referendum would be to mandate support for a process to create lasting stability, based on the repudiation of violence for any political purpose.</P>
      <P>The two Governments will review the outcome of the consultations immediately after 13 March.  Following that, the British Government will bring forward legislation on the elective process, based on a judgment of what seems most broadly acceptable, and decisions will be announced, as appropriate, on the other issues which are the subject of the consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultations began, as scheduled, on Monday.  Following an informal meeting in Belfast, the Secretary of State and I met jointly an SDLP delegation. Yesterday I returned to Belfast for meetings with delegations from The Workers' Party and the Alliance Party and I also had various informal contacts. Since Monday, the British Government has had meetings with several parties in Belfast and in London.  There have also <Col N="1867" /> been numerous meetings among the parties, in a variety of formats.  I will have a wide range of further meetings before 13 March.  In this intensive and ongoing process it is not possible for me to specify precisely when or in what configuration each of these will be held. However, I hope that, in addition to further meetings with the British Government and those parties I have already met since Monday, it will be possible to arrange meetings with others.</P>
    <P>The position of the Government on meetings with Sinn Féin has been stated clearly on several occasions since the ending of the IRA's cessation of violence on 9 February.  There will be no resumption of ministerial dialogue until there is a restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.  Unless there is a restoration of the ceasefire I will not meet Sinn Féin during the present consultations. It goes without saying that I fervently hope there will be such a restoration and that it will be possible for Sinn Féin to re-enter direct political dialogue with Government Ministers and to take part in the all-party negotiations beginning on 10 June.  Channels of communication at official level remain open and allow for the exchange of views on those issues which are the subject of the consultations.</P>
    <P>For the reasons outlined, Sinn Féin was not invited to the ministerial consultations on 4 March, nor did it seek a meeting with the Government at official level on that day.  If it had done so, it would have been facilitated.  A meeting between Mr. David Trimble and members of the Government, as suggested by Mr. Trimble in a recent letter, has been arranged for next Monday.  Mr Robert McCartney, MP, has also sought a meeting with the Government and we are seeking to make arrangements in this respect also.  I hope that meeting will take place early next week.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department have also been in contact with the DUP, the UDP and the PUP.  I hope that it will be possible to arrange meetings with each <Col N="1868" /> of these parties at an early date.  I had very useful and positive meetings with the PUP in Belfast on 23 October last and in Dublin on 6 February.</P>
    <P>I will continue to stress, as I did at my recent meeting with the PUP, that, irrespective of the outcome of whatever elective process is put in place, a means of assuring the active involvement of the loyalist parties in the subsequent negotiations is found.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Washington on 8-9 February.  I had valuable discussions with President Clinton and other members of his administration during which the concept of proximity talks was among the issues covered.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Major agreed at the February Summit that details of an elective process were for the parties in Northern Ireland, together with the British Government, to determine. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for the Government to state a preference in regard to the electoral system to be chosen.  We are, of course, aware, from our contacts with the Northern parties, of their various views and preferences.  As was stated in the communiqué, an elective process would have to be broadly acceptable and lead immediately and without further preconditions to the convening of all-party negotiations with a comprehensive agenda.  As indicated by the Taoiseach, the Irish Government will support any proposal for an elective process which, we are satisfied, is broadly acceptable to the parties, has an appropriate mandate and is within the three-stranded structure. Beyond setting these parameters, the communiqué does not prejudge the form of the elective process to be chosen.</P>
    <P>The precise manner in which an elective process feeds into the three-standed all-party negotiations commencing on 10 June is a matter of direct concern to the Government and is one of the matters we are currently discussing with the British Government and the parties.</P>
    <P>The structure and format of the negotiations, and their venue, are also among <Col N="1869" /> the subjects being discussed in the present consultations with a view to reaching widespread agreement.  As I previously indicated, decisions will be announced as appropriate after the Governments has reviewed the outcome of the consultations.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the substantive all-party negotiations will be based on the Framework Document, which describes the shared assessment of the two Governments of a possible outcome to those negotiations.  We believe it sets out a realistic and balanced framework for agreement which could be achieved with flexibility and goodwill on all sides.  We intend that it will be on the table for consideration.</P>
    <P>I am taking steps to ensure that the necessary resources are in place to allow the Government to make a full and appropriate contribution to the negotiations. Organisational and staff planning are also under way in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the details of the negotiations of the last few days and their outcome does the Tánaiste on reflection agree that the response of the Government in calling the IRA statements of the last 24 hours unhelpful is far too feeble?  Will he agree that the rubbishing of the Mitchell principles by the IRA is ominous and is, essentially, a rejection of the commitment to democratic principles as a basis for negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude to violence and to its use is well known, and I have made it clear in this House on many occasions.  I was asked for a comment on an article in <i>The Irish Voice</i> when I left the negotiations in Belfast yeasterday. That article, to the best of my understanding, was written prior to the issuing of the joint communiqué of last week, and I referred to it in that context. I said it was unhelpful, and I also made it clear that, as far as I am concerned, we want Sinn Féin to be at the negotiating table.  We have not excluded Sinn Féin.  Its members have been <Col N="1870" /> excluded because of the bombs in London. There is a very easy way for them to get back into negotiations, that is, by restoring the ceasefire.  We have asked them to do that, and I am grateful for the support in this House of the other parties, all of whom have made it clear that we stand united in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have also made it clear on numerous occasions that I regard the Mitchell report as central to making progress on many issues.  It is regrettable that when the report was published originally it was not put on the table and made available to the parties for discussion. Decisions were made at the time by the British Government which I felt were not helpful.  Be that as it may, the Mitchell report will be central to negotiations which will take place, it is hoped, in the near future.  It certainly will be central to the negotiations that will commence on 10 June.  This House welcomed the Mitchell report.  It is a skilful contribution to what we are all trying to achieve and, in terms of making progress in the future, it has a very important role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 3 asks whether there is a firm agreement to hold elections.  Although the Tánaiste dealt with the question of elections and the circumstances in which they might be held, it is probably fair to deduce from what he has said that there is no firm agreement that certain conditions would have to be complied with, including broad acceptability, the three-stranded process and so on.  That being so, I remain to be convinced that there is any value in having elections other than to satisfy such parties as suggested them some months ago or suggested them last year &mdash; in fact they could make an already difficult situation worse.</P>
      <P>Given the three unfortunate statements by the IRA since 9 February, will the Tánaiste agree that a mark of acceptance of democratic principles for entry to the talks on 10 June might be the acceptance of the principles set out in the Mitchell report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1871" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question asked by Deputy O'Malley about the elective process, the Deputy is probably aware of my preference which is that we get into all-party negotiations as quickly as possible.  I have expressed my views on elections publicly and at meetings with the British Government.  Elections in Northern Ireland tend to polarise an already divided society.  One does not get agreement out of elections whereas one can get agreement out of negotiations. Be that as it may, and that is my view and the view of the Irish Government, the situation as of now &mdash; and we made that clear in last week's communiqué &mdash; is that if we can have an elective process along the lines of the Mitchell recommendations, we will have that elective process.  What is of most concern at this stage is that we go directly and without further preconditions from an elective process into all-party talks on 10 June.  One has to be very careful that no further preconditions are raised.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Burke that the statements from the IRA have been particularly unhelpful in what we have all tried to achieve since the Canary Wharf bombing and the acceptance of the Mitchell principles.  My preference is for a restoration of the cessation of violence. That, in effect, as both Governments have said, would enable Sinn Féin to come back into the preparatory phase of the discussions and, if there is an elective process, they would participate in that as well.  I would prefer to see the Mitchell principles and the Mitchell report on the table at the all-party negotiations.  We need to be very careful not to raise further preconditions.  What is important is that if we have a cessation of violence it will bring the parties to the table.  I made it clear in the last few days that we want an inclusive process. This means involving Sinn Féin, but it has the key to being included and being at the table.  That key is a reinstatement of the ceasefire by the IRA as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has twice <Col N="1872" /> made the point, with which I fully agree that there should be no further preconditions to the talks commencing in June and that the elections must lead to negotiations. I share the view of the House that we do not need elections.  If they are to happen, so be it, but there cannot be further preconditions.</P>
      <P>As to the necessity for clarity, nowhere is this clarity more obvious than in relation to what happened on Monday with the publicity coup of Sinn Féin being locked outside the gates of Stormont.  Was the decision to block their entrance to the room a decision of Sir Patrick Mayhew under right wing Tory pressure or was it, as an official claimed, a joint decision?  It is important and necessary that the Tánaiste and Sir Patrick Mayhew should get their act together and clarify exactly what is involved in all-party inclusive talks.  It is vital that Sinn Féin be there and that the ground rules are clear.  We must have clarity so that the situations that have developed will not be allowed to develop in the future.  It is important that Sinn Féin, as distinct from the IRA, be given maximum assistance to involve itself at official level in what is going on. We cannot have preconditions or further disagreements.  We want absolute clarity which is lacking at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously clarity is important in dealing with Anglo-Irish relations and politics in Northern Ireland.  We all have a role to play in establishing clarity.  I am sure Sinn Féin would have been facilitated if it had sought a meeting at official level but there was no request for a meeting prior to last Monday.  The Deputy will appreciate that Stormont Buildings is under the direct control of the British Government and despite the fact that we have offices there we are not in control of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I made clear, it is important that due courtesies are extended to everyone and that there is prior discussion on the structure of meetings.  That did not occur between Sinn Féin and either Government prior to last Monday.  As <Col N="1873" /> the Deputy knows, we had meetings arranged with the SDLP and held other meetings yesterday.  Hopefully we will have more meetings tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday.  We have tried to the best of our ability to make every facility available but it is a two way street. Obviously Sinn Féin has a very important role to play but the key aspect at present must be to reinstate the cessation of violence and let us get back to having all-inclusive party talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Tánaiste's belief that the statement attributed to Mr. Adams published in New York last night to the effect that the IRA is ready for another 25 years of war was given prior to the communiqué last Wednesday, if the person making the statement wished to amend it he had a week in which to do so.  Is it not particularly ominous and regrettable that he failed to change or amend the statement? Is the Tánaiste satisfied in these circumstances that Sinn Féin representatives genuinely want to seek a restoration of the ceasefire if they make statements of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that I am responsible for my own actions and accountable to the House for them, but I am not responsible for the actions or statements of Mr. Adams nor do I intend to accept responsibility for them.  As I have made clear on numerous occasions, the futility of violence as a means of bringing about a political settlement has been demonstrated over the last quarter of a century and a full-scale return to the horrors of those years would not only be tragic in itself but would not change the nature of the realities which can be addressed and resolved only by negotiation.  Mr. Adams and his colleagues have made enormous efforts over many years to change the strategy of Sinn Féin to a peaceful one and I would say to them, in regard to sentiments expressed such as protecting or not leaving Nationalist areas of Belfast defenceless, that the best way of bringing relief to the <Col N="1874" /> Nationalist areas would be to reinstate the cessation of violence and for it to represent the people it claims to represent at the all-party talks.</P>

      <P>All parties in the House have worked for the restoration of the ceasefire but there are other players involved in the North.  Does the Tánaiste share my concern at expressions from other armed groups on the so called republican side who have indicated that they in turn are ready to take up arms?  Has the Tánaiste or his Department made any effort, through the political parties with which they are associated, to try to persuade all concerned not to recommence armed activities?</P>

      <P>I am sure Members share the view that we do not want any paramilitary group on either the loyalist or Nationalist side engaging in violence. We know the futility of violence.  It will not solve the problem.  In that respect, I pay tribute to the loyalist groups who have been stoic in their leadership since the breakdown in the IRA ceasefire.  I hope that will continue.  Whatever prospect there is of the IRA reinstating the ceasefire would be vitiated by a return to violence on the other side.  The responsibility lies in the main with the IRA.  I hope it will listen to the pleas, demands and wishes of the majority of people on this island as demonstrated on the streets last Sunday week, reinstate the ceasefire and let us get back to all-party negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 28, 30 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference which will consider amendments to the European Union Treaties is due to be launched by Heads of State or Government in Turin on 29 March.</P>
      <P>On 28 February the European Commission adopted its opinion on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference. I welcome the Commission's opinion which represents an important contribution to the work of the conference. I have no doubt that many of the Commission's ideas will receive considerable support from other member states also.  Each member state will, of course, be free to bring forward its own proposals at the Intergovernmental Conference and any Treaty amendments will require the unanimous agreement of all member states.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming White Paper on Irish foreign policy will set out the broad approach which the Government intend to take in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the European Commission is one of the issues which will arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and indeed may fall for reexamination from time to time.  I have made clear on previous occasions and <Col N="1877" /> reiterate now the Government's firm view that further enlargement of the Union should not have any implications for the right of every member state to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  To deprive member states of the automatic right to nominate a Commissioner, far from making the Commission more efficient, would in our view, make it less efficient in its essential role of protecting the common interest and retaining public support for its central role, which Ireland fully supports, in the process of European integration. We consider that it would, however, be appropriate for the large member states to agree, in the context of further enlargement, to nominate only one member of the Commission and I, therefore, welcome the view expressed by the Commission in its opinion that, in the context of enlargement, the number of its members should be reduced to one per member state.</P>
    <P>As regards the method of appointment of Commissioners, the Commission has suggested in its opinion that its members should be designated by common agreement between the President and the respective Governments of the member states.  This largely reflects the present arrangement. Ireland will consider positively proposals which would enhance the efficiency and collegiality of the Commission.</P>
    <P>On the question of the extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers, the Government attach importance to enhancing the efficiency of decision-making in the Union and we, therefore, favour the extension of qualified majority voting to several additional areas as regards both traditional Community business and in the justice and home affairs area.  Qualified majority voting has worked to Ireland's advantage in many areas.  We recognise, however, as do many of our partners, that there are a number of sensitive areas in which decisions should continue to require the unanimous agreement of all member states.</P>
    <P>As regards the European Parliament, <Col N="1878" /> there is a broad view emerging that a ceiling should be placed on the membership of the Parliament and that the Parliament cannot be allowed to grow with each successive enlargement.  A figure of 700 members has been mentioned as appropriate.  This approach is likely to mean a reduction in the number of MEPs from each existing member state. We will insist that the smaller member states continue to have an adequate level of representation in the Parliament and we, therefore, welcome the recognition in the Commission's opinion that the distribution of seats should continue to ensure what in purely demographic terms is the over-representation of the less populated member states.</P>
    <P>On the proposed EU/WEU merger, I refer Deputy Byrne to my reply to Question No. 5 which deals with this aspect of his question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>A person would not make any assumptions around here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the comprehensive reply given by the Minister.  My party shares the views expressed and has published them in its foreign policy document, <i>Our Place in the World.</i> It is essential that each member state should nominate a Commissioner even if larger member states must reduce the number of Commissioners they nominate to one. It is essential for efficiency and collegiality that each member state has one Commissioner.  While I share the view on the ceiling on the parliament, we must preserve the position as regards smaller member states like Ireland.  Has <Col N="1879" /> there been any response yet from the other member states as to the views expressed in that document?  Has it been discussed informally?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no opportunity to discuss this since that opinion was furnished.  However, I am sure it will be discussed in Turin or at the General Affairs Council before that.  As the Deputy will be aware, informal discussions would take place on most of these issues between foreign ministers.</P>

The White Paper will be published this month and I will look for a debate in the House with plenty of time available for Members to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I generally agree with what the Minister said &mdash; the thrust of his reply was probably correct as far as this country is concerned &mdash; does he realise some of the difficulties which exist, particularly if the situation suggested in relation to Commissionerships arises?  Does the Minister believe it is fair or democratic that Germany, with a population in excess of 80 million, should have the same representation in the Europe Union at Commission level as Malta, which has a population of 240,000 or, as we are constantly reminded, half the size of Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not need to alert me to the difficulties.  I am probably aware of all the difficulties which face us down the line in relation to enlargement and the Intergovernmental Conference and we are preparing to deal with them.  The Deputy must be aware that we have a parliament and a Council of Ministers.  We have been <Col N="1880" /> well served by the institutional balance struck by the European Union and we want to see it continue.  Questions need to be addressed such as that raised by the Deputy.  Obviously, these are matters for negotiation and we have set out the principle which we want respected, that is, our entitlement as a member state to appoint a Commissioner, a point which I believe will be accepted by our fellow member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the circulation of material by the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to schools under the Communicating Europe initiative &mdash; the Minister will recall that we started this together &mdash; supporting our membership of the Western European Union represent Government policy?  One of the key recommendations of the Communicating Europe initiative was to educate and raise awareness among the public and students as regards European structures and issues.  That should be done in a balanced way.  I appreciate what the Minister told us about the White Paper.  Will he confirm if that approach by the Minister of State, of which I have no doubt he was aware, was Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well positioned to know about the strategy, Communicating Europe, in which he was involved and on which he did good work.  That good work is being continued by the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  It is important that the public is well informed.  I understand the document to which the Deputy referred <Col N="1881" /> has been circulated to many organisations and lobby groups and not only to schools.  A mistake which we all saw in relation to the Maastricht Treaty was the lack of information available to the public.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister of State was within his rights on behalf of the Communicating Europe strategy group to circulate information for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 10, 11, 21, 24, 40, 42 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broad approach which is being <Col N="1883" /> pursued by the Government in relation to issues expected to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference, including the question of relations between the EU and the Western European Union, has been the subject of a number of statements by me in this House and elsewhere.  This approach will continue to be in harmony with our outlook and traditions and at the same time responsive to the new and still evolving challenges that face us in promoting peace, security and progress at the European and global level.</P>
    <P>The questions put by Deputies Ray Burke and Kirk arise from views expressed in the declaration adopted by the Western European Union assembly at its extraordinary session in London on 22 and 23 February 1996.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union assembly is a consultative body made up of parliamentarians from the 10 Western European Union member states. Parliamentarians from Western European Union observer states, Western European Union associate members and associate partner states also attend in accordance with their respective status but do not participate in the adoption of declarations by the assembly.  In accordance with Ireland's observer status in the Western European Union, Ireland was represented in an observer capacity by Members of this House at this meeting of the Western European Union assembly.</P>
    <P>The views of the Western European Union assembly are not binding on the member states of the Western European Union.  Western European Union decisions are the preserve of the Western European Union council, made up of representatives of the Governments of Western European Union member states.  The Western European Union's position on the forthcoming intergovernmental conference was adopted at the meeting of its Council of Ministers last November in Madrid.  The Western European Union agreed on the <Col N="1884" /> importance of a comprehensive definition of security, rather than an exclusively military one.  The Western European Union member states also explicitly acknowledged that the Intergovernmental Conference will need to harness to the best effect the diverse contributions to security and defence that European nations are able to make, and the national security and defence positions of each country must be respected and the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference must be acceptable to people in each member state.</P>
    <P>The views reflected in the Western European Union Assembly Declaration would appear to be at odds with the Western European Union's own formal contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference adopted at Madrid.  Also, I am not aware of any intention by the Western European Union council to take up the assembly's proposal for a White Paper as referred to in the Question from Deputy Kirk.</P>
    <P>For reasons that I have outlined, I do not regard the Western European Union Assembly's Declaration as impinging on Ireland's position outside military alliances.  Accordingly, I do not believe that any useful purpose would be served by pursuing the specific points raised by the Deputies with my colleagues in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have raised the issue of relations between the EU and the Western European Union.  Article J.4.2 of the Maastricht Treaty provides that the Western European Union is an integral part of the development of the European Union.  In this connection proposals and suggestions have been put forward in the context of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference. The Intergovernmental Conference will review the common foreign and security policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence, in accordance with the objective set out in the Maastricht Treaty to <Col N="1885" /> assert the union's identity on the international scene.</P>
    <P>A central issue in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be to determine how the CFSP provisions, including through the EU-WEU relationship, can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security.  The proposals contained in the European Commission's formal opinion for the Intergovernmental Conference, and in the agreed communiqué from the meeting in Freiburg on 27 February, between German and French Foreign Ministers, are situated in the perspective of enabling the EU to respond more effectively to the international challenges which face it.</P>
    <P>With a view to facilitating CFSP decision making, Foreign Ministers Kinkel and de Charette have suggested that the possibility of differentiating between decisions of principle and implementing decisions should be examined.  They envisage that implementing decisions could be taken by qualified majority vote.  There is already a provision to this effect in the Maastricht Treaty which has yet to be used in practice.  They also suggest for consideration the idea of voluntary abstention by partners who are unwilling or unable to join a consensus.  This would not prevent the EU's majority from taking or implementing the decision in question.  The two Ministers have also suggested that partners in the minority should show political and financial solidarity in such cases.  It is of relevance to note in this connection that the proposal has also been made that CFSP, as a general rule, should be financed from the Community budget.</P>
    <P>The Government believes it is important that the EU should enhance its capacity to exercise a constructive influence for the development of a stable, just and peaceful international system.  To this end, we will be working at the Intergovernmental Conference for practicable and sustainable ways of improving the functioning of the CFSP. We agree that the possibility of making <Col N="1886" /> more use of the Maastricht Treaty's provisions for qualified majority voting on implementing decisions should be explored.  However, with some partners, we do not favour proposals to move to qualified majority voting for sensitive foreign policy questions, particularly decision-making and financing arrangements in the context of proposals to develop a common defence policy for the Union.  Any Treaty changes proposed, including in relation to decision making or financial arrangements in the CFSP area, could be adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference only if all partners, including Ireland, were to agree.</P>
    <P>With regard to EU-WEU relations, the French and German Foreign Ministers stated that their objective is the eventual merger of the Western European Union with the EU and their wish to make progress towards that goal at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.  The Commission also favours incorporation of the Western European Union into the Union according to an agreed timetable.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that various possible institutional options for future EU-WEU relations were identified in the Reflection Group report and in the Western European Union contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference. These ranged from maintaining the EU and Western European Union as separate organisations, but with enhanced co-operation between them, through to proposals for eventual full merger.  Both the Reflection Group report and the Western European Union contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference accepted that the different positions of member states would have to be respected and that negotiations on the various options were a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>There is an emerging consensus that the EU should be better equipped to make a contribution internationally in such areas as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations &mdash; the so called Petersberg tasks identified by the Western European Union.  For their part, the <Col N="1887" /> Foreign Ministers of Germany and France envisage that the objectives inherent in the Petersberg tasks should be reflected in some way in a revised Maastricht Treaty.  The Commission has made a proposal along broadly similar lines.</P>
    <P>The Government is studying these and other proposals carefully.  Like the other neutral states which are observers at the Western European Union &mdash; Finland, Sweden and Austria &mdash; Ireland sees scope for exploring further the potential for Irish involvement in the Petersberg tasks, and the suggestions that these tasks could be given an EU treaty basis in any revision of the Maastricht Treaty.  I should make clear that Ireland's approach to involvement in the Petersberg tasks of peacekeeping or humanitarian operations in no sense entails any mutual defence commitments that would be incompatible with its policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remarks by Mr. Javier Solana, Secretary General of NATO, in Munich on 3-4 February 1996, I understand he said he believed &ldquo;that an enhanced institutional relationship between NATO and the European Union could add significantly to achieving a comprehensive crisis management strategy&rdquo;.  In making this suggestion, Mr. Solana made it clear that he was speaking strictly on a personal basis. Accordingly, I do not propose to comment on his remarks.</P>

      <P>One of the most serious decisions to be made on foreign policy relates to the issue we are debating, which has major implications for us. Varying views are expressed at Commission level, Western European Union Secretary General level, in the Kinkel report and in reference to the Petersberg Declaration.  These are complex issues.  I strongly suggest to the Tánaiste that the message from the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, to the children through the schools is naive, seriously <Col N="1888" /> damaging and misrepresents the position. For example, the four existing neutral countries could have full Western European Union membership&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to Deputy Kitt, the information issued by the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, which was sent not only to schools, was published in two articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> in late 1995 and no objection was raised at that time in this House or elsewhere. We are becoming aware of the complexities of common foreign and security policy.  Prior to the intergovernmental conference we want to ensure there is full and through discussion, at all levels, of the complex issues involved.  The Deputy will recall that some years ago when we sought associate membership of the Western European Union this House did not discuss whether it was right or proper for us to do so.  The decision was taken by the Government without consulting the House.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste referred in his detailed reply to the Petersberg <Col N="1889" /> tasks.  The Petersberg Declaration outlines those tasks and states that the military units of Western European Union member states acting under the authority &mdash; that is the crucial word &mdash; of the Western European Union could be employed for humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacekeeping.  That role is much wider than the role played by us at present, which is as observer.  We are not a full member of the Western European Union, and to claim that the Petersberg tasks allow us flexibility within foreign common and security policy would be dangerous.</P>

I want to approach that from a positive point of view.  Our other European Union partners, Austria, Finland and Sweden, which have remained outside military alliances and, like us, are observers at the Western European Union, have also shown an interest in Western European Union peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks.  In saying that I am being totally consistent with a statement made by the Deputy's leader, Deputy Ahern, on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a positive contribution to make and have made very positive ones since we joined the United Nations in peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks.  There are a range of possible options and concerns in regard to the future institutional relationships between the EU and the Western European Union.  They have been identified and will be discussed at the intergovernmental conference.  We do not have any apologies to make for the traditional position this country has taken and we should not approach discussions on it with the view that we have anything to apologise for.  We should approach them from a positive point of view.  A new security architecture for western Europe is developing.  That is consequent upon what has happened during the past number of years, the ending of the Cold War, the new relationships, the development of NATO and other organisations and the various interrelationships that will take place.  I would like a rational discussion and debate about how security architecture will develop.  I want to approach that from a positive point of view and I hope I have the backing of the House on that.  I am proud of the contribution made by Irish men and women down through the years in humanitarian and peacekeeping tasks.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's response and I agree with much of what he said.  I wish to refer to my earlier point, also made by my colleague, Deputy Burke, which relates to what the Tánaiste said.  We want a balanced and intelligent debate.  If any Minister is communicating with students on this matter, we want the message spelled out clearly in appropriate language.  Deputy Burke and I have referred to the activities of the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell.  His party said bluntly during the 1994 election that it supported full membership of the Western European Union, but the Tánaiste may be evasive <Col N="1891" /> on this.  I ask that in communicating with our young people we should follow the spirit of the Communicating Europe initiative and not advance a pro-WEU position.  I ask the Tánaiste to take a personal interest in this matter and ensure that when dealing with school children especially that his views as expressed here are represented, not the personal views of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the Deputy's supplementary on the basis of wanting to make a positive contribution.  The Deputy will recall from his time in the Department of Foreign Affairs that we hold seminars around the country to give the people a sense of ownership of foreign policy.  In the past they did not have that and the House did not have an adequate input into the development of foreign policy.  We have set out to remedy that and we are on the way to being successful in doing so.  The communication made by Deputy Mitchell to many institutions and bodies is consistent with the information given during those seminars which took place throughout the country and the White Paper will set out all the options.  It is important to set them out and I hope we can have a discussion which acknowledges the realities of European security architecture.  I have had many discussions with the Finns, the Swedes and the Austrians on this matter.  They are far more forthright about accepting the realities of European security architecture. We have been slow to acknowledge certain institutions and alliances, but that is not to say in any way that we have anything to apologise for in regard to the role we have taken.  We must take cognisance of the realities, including the changes that have taken place since the collapse of the Cold War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the realities that must be taken into account when talking of the Finns and the Austrians is the reality of geography and their position regarding the borders of the former Soviet Union bloc.  Does the Tánaiste <Col N="1892" /> agree with the view on this side of the House that the most effective contribution Ireland can make to the work of peace is to place our Defence Forces at the disposal of the European Union under the auspices of the common foreign and security policy for the purpose of helping in situations such as crisis management where peacekeeping skills and resources would be required, similar to the role we played with such a proud record with the United Nations since the early 1960s?  To involve ourselves with the Western European Union having regard to its nuclear capacity would go beyond our neutral status and our commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we have made a proud contribution through our role in the United Nations That is acknowledged in any debate that takes place at the UN or in any of our bilateral relations.  We will be mindful of that in terms of our contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Deputy reminded me of the geography of the Finns, the Swedes and the Austrians in relation to the development of foreign policy.  It is important that we put all the issues before the House and the people in the first instance, which we will do by way of the White Paper. We agreed in the programme, A Government of Renewal, as we did in the previous Government, that if it were decided to change our status it would be done only by the people who rightly own the policy position taken by many Governments through the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter. Does the Tánaiste approve of central European Union funding for the Western European Union which will mean that Ireland, a neutral non-nuclear country, will be a partner in financing a nuclear armed military bloc dominated by the richest western and colonial states?  Does he agree that we have the option of not becoming further involved in the Western European Union?  Will he also agree that our desire to make <Col N="1893" /> a positive contribution to peacekeeping around the world can be well accommodated through the UN and that perhaps he ought to be occupied in making the UN more effective rather than trying to look for an alternative, as appears to be the case?  Is it time we had a referendum on neutrality so that the people can have ownership of foreign policy once again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is seeking to anticipate the discussion that will take place on publication of the White Paper. First and foremost I want to defend the United Nations, but I am sure the Deputy would accept that there are certain weaknesses in the United Nations and it has been changing its policy by looking for regional organisations to carry out various peacekeeping duties.</P>
      <P>One example is what is happening in former Yugoslavia where the world powers feel the United Nations need the support of NATO through IFOR.  That would not have happened five or ten years ago.  The European Union has a crucial role in implementing the civilian aspects of the Dayton Accord and has an interest in such matters.  I hope we can have a very open and frank discussion on the options, responsibilities and challenges facing us in all these issues after the publication of the White Paper and before the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

I want to refer to this misleading document entitled &ldquo;Message from Gay Mitchell TD&rdquo; in which the Minister of State, amongst other things says that the four existing neutrals could then have full Western European Union membership available to them without taking on Article V commitments, thereby retaining their existing levels of neutrality indefinitely.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restoration of a functioning and <Col N="1896" /> independent system of justice is essential to the process of national reconciliation in Rwanda.  The Government strongly supported the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which was established under UN Security Council Resolution 988 of 8 November 1994 with the task of prosecuting those responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international law.  Investigations by the tribunal have been focused on approximately 400 identified suspects and its initial indictments of eight people arising from massacres in the Kibuye region were announced on 12 December.  The tribunal Prosecutor, Justice Richard J. Goldstone, hopes to begin full trial hearings before the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Both bilaterally and together with our EU partners, we have repeatedly confirmed our preparedness to assist in the restoration of an impartial and effective system.  Since 1995, we have spent over £1.52 million on the justice sector and in support of human rights initiatives in Rwanda.  This funding has been allocated, as follows, to a broad range of entities, which have central responsibilities for ensuring that those responsible for the genocide are brought to trial and that mechanisms exist to ensure full accountability for human rights violations while having regard at the same time to the need for national reconciliation:</P>
    <P>We have given: £150,000 to the International Tribunal for Rwanda to issue indictments and bring to trial those responsible for the genocide; £615,000 in direct bilateral assistance to the Rwandan Ministry of the Interior for communal police training and to restore the legal structures in the Ministry of Justice, which has found itself without the administrative capacity to hold trials: £125,000 to the UN High Commission for Human Rights and to the UN/EU Human Rights Field Operation for human rights monitors in Rwanda; £132,000 for the International Conference on <Col N="1897" /> Genocide organised by the Government of Rwanda last November in Kigali, including a follow-up grant of £82,000 to establish a small secretariat which will implement the recommendations of the conference; £350,000 to support the International Committee of the Red Cross, who are working with the Government to relieve prison overcrowding and improve conditions and, in many cases are responsible for the care and feeding of prisoners in Rwandan prisons, and £150,000 to indigenous Rwandan NGOs, including women's groups, which aim to promote self-help, reintegration and reconciliation at local level in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>I am aware of recent media reports that over 100,000 Hutus have been victims of revenge killings in Rwanda in which the Rwanda Army has been implicated. While recognising that Hutus continue to be victims of ongoing ethnic violence in Rwanda the UN has not so far been able to substantiate these allegations. They have been specifically denied by the Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the United Nations on 29 February.  The Government is not currently in a position to discount or substantiate these reports but is keeping them under active review.  It is our firm opinion that the perpetrators of any revenge killings which may have been carried out should be brought to justice before the appropriate authorities without any further discrimination.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that the Government will continue to focus on the key issues of justice, human rights, national reconciliation and accountability for the genocide and other killings, in Rwanda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging that none of us can visualise or appreciate the huge violation of human rights in Rwanda and that Ireland has contributed aid through its membership of various organisations which is to be welcomed, will the Minister of State agree that such aid does not constitute the <Col N="1898" /> overall solution to its enormous problems? I am not at all sure confirmation of our preparedness to become involved is all that convincing, given the severity of the overall position in that country &mdash; it smacks somewhat of another accusation, of &ldquo;standing idly by&rdquo;, with regard to a statement of Governments some time ago in another connection.  Is there anything further the Minister of State considers we can and should do given that there are thousands of persons packed into prisons every day many of whom die from hunger and maltreatment while awaiting trail on charges of genocide?  Does the Minister envisage a time when justice will be seen to be done, when some normality and basic human rights will be restored in Rwanda because, until such time, all our contributions will be squandered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland played an important role attempting to assist the peace process in Rwanda and ensure that the genocide that took place there does not recur.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the many Irish public officials, aid workers and NGOs, in many cases, substantially financed by Irish aid, who have undertaken extraordinary work on behalf of Rwandans and the more than 1.5 million people outside its borders.</P>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to think that Ireland has not played and does not continue to play a very substantial role in this respect.  Our role has been recognised internationally and the visit by our President last October put even greater emphasis on our interest in Rwanda.</P>
      <P>The situation in Rwanda is extremely difficult and sensitive but there is a substantial restoration of public order with the people carrying on normal lives and the return to working the land.  This is in the context of at least 500,000 people although most estimates suggest it is nearer to one million people, mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, having been killed in the genocide.  It is very difficult to envisage a society that has suffered such a grievous loss returning to normality in a brief time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> There are a number of peacekeeping efforts being brokered to which we have been a party.  I met Commissioners Bonino and Pinheiro on the matter as recently as ten days ago.  The European Commission is now sending, with our very strong support and partly at our suggestion, a specific European Union Commission special representative, Mr. Ajello, who has done sterling work in Mozambique in trying to end the conflict there.  We are supporting Mr. Ajello's appointment.  He will be going to the region shortly and we hope his efforts, with those of the former US President Carter and former President Nyerere of Tanzania, will set the scene for the administration of justice and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The reconciliation and genocide conference was historic and it brought to Rwanda people from Ethiopia, South African Jewish people who had survived the Holocaust and people from Central and South America, all of whom suffered great traumas.  It was specifically to discuss how to move Rwandan society to the next stage of justice and reconciliation.  It has to be said &mdash; and this is one of the greatest failings of the international community &mdash; that the tribunal failed to indict those who were the instigators and ringleaders of the genocide.  I think the Rwandan Government now accepts that not everybody involved in the genocide can be arrested but the ringleaders and the instigators must be.  Two years after the genocide, only eight indictments have been served.  One of the greatest confidence building measures would be for the international tribunal and Rwandan justice to proceed to indict the instigators and ringleaders.</P>
    <P>We have given money to the International Red Cross who is responsible for monitoring the condition of the prisoners. It feeds and provides water to almost all prisoners at this stage.  I visited a jail in the southern city of Butare. The jail was meant for 1,100 people but there were thousands in it.  They were not being physically ill treated but the <Col N="1900" /> degree of overcrowding was astonishing. This is a very complex situation and all our efforts are to move towards justice and reconciliation and an end to the culture of impunity following the genocide and we will continue to work for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be very little co-operation from the Rwandan Government in apprehending those who have been accused of genocide because I take it that most of them are still within the Rwandan Border.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister define the relationship between the Irish and the Rwandan Governments?  Given the Rwandan's Government record many people believe the relationship should be at arm's length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that all the people who have been indicted by the tribunal are outside the Rwandan Borders and it requires the co-operation of other Governments for these people to be brought before the tribunal.  The Rwandan Government has assisted in the restoration of a certain kind of order and reconstruction of civil society based on the advice available to us from the European Union.  As a result of a number of visits by the President and myself to the region and the advice of former US President Carter and former President Nyerere we believe that while the Rwandan Government must be extremely careful on the question of human rights, the Government offers one of the hopes for the return of stability and reconciliation.  That does not mean we have not clearly criticised the Government about human rights abuses and we will continue to draw to the attention of the Government any human rights abuses which come to our attention.</P>

      <P>All the headings I read out were in the context of our assistance to the justice system, the care of prisoners and the recreation of the communal policing system.  Given that Rwanda has a French judicial structure, that is essential to the process.  All the moneys, which totalled £1.52 million, are in fact related to the reconstruction of the justice system in Rwanda.  That money has been very well spent.  The conference on genocide was about ways of moving forward to reconciliation in Rwandan society and dealing with how one comes to terms with the fact that so many were involved in the perpetration of genocide. It would not be possible for all those people to be brought to trial and in a constructive way, therefore, the focus should be on a trial or other process to deal with the ringleaders and the instigators.  Many millions of people died and yet there were no major trials after the overthrow of the Derg.  Delegates at the conference had very valuable examples to offer and the money spent on it was extremely good value.</P>

      <P>I listened to the comprehensive answers to several of these questions.  I do not believe people can move forward in society while the perpetrators or people suspected of these crimes are in prison and from what I read in various newspapers it is suggested that as many as 60,000 people are still held in captivity.  I agree that all of them cannot be tried.  Nobody is suggesting Ireland alone can take on this enormous task.  It should be taken on in conjunction with our partners in Europe.  We have had lengthy discussions on neutrality and where we stand.  The task of sifting out who is responsible, who should be allowed go free, who should be detained in prison and who should carry out the trials should be for an agency other than the Rwandan Government.  Otherwise no matter how people are treated it will be seen as a form of revenge.  What steps are being taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure that justice is done and seen to be done for these <Col N="1902" /> 60,000 people who are held in what appear to be no more than pens?</P>

      <P>An outside agency, the international tribunal, was to be responsible for trying the people accused of genocide.  The shortcomings of the international tribunal, under the auspices of the UN, has led to many people still being held in jail.  I attended a recent meeting of more than 200 people who worked in Rwanda, including many members of the clergy and missionaries. They strongly supported the Irish Government's position and what it did in Rwanda.  The leader of the European Union monitors to Rwanda is an Irishman with much experience in the field. We have listened closely to the advice of those people who have been so involved with that country.</P>

    <Title>Report on Island Development: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State with responsibility for western development and rural renewal, Deputy Carey, on the manner in which he has tackled the neglect of island communities off our coastline to whom mere lip service has been paid since the foundation of the State.  The rigours of living on an island are not understood by many people.  I come from a constituency that has seven of the 21 islands and I know only too well that those island people have suffered.  I have seen a strong virile population on those islands 30 or 40 years ago dwindle to a very <Col N="1978" /> small group.  The islands are part and parcel of our culture and history, so much so that a former Taoiseach saw fit to buy an island off the Kerry coast. That island is not mentioned in the report.  Perhaps he restored that island to its former glory and it does not need any State assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that sword had been put back into its scabbard some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only paying tribute to the man who had the foresight to put his money where his mouth was.  He bought that island for his retirement in order to escape the pressures on the mainland.  If there are pressures on the mainland today there are also pressures on the islands off our coastline.</P>
      <P>I was thrilled when the Taoiseach appointed Deputy Donal Carey as Minister of State for western development and rural renewal with special responsibility for islands.  On two occasions, in the past four months, I accompanied the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, when he visited Oileán Cléire and Bere Island in Bantry Bay, off Castletownbere and conveyed to islanders the clear message that he was prepared to tackle the problem. I firmly believe work begun is half done.  There is no point in former Ministers of previous governments paying lip service to the islanders.</P>
      <P>Seven of the islands to which I referred are off the south-west coast, seven more are off the west Mayo coast, four off the Donegal coast and three are off the Clare-Galway coast &mdash; a total of 21 islands.  Cork County Council saw fit four years ago to form an island's committee, a subcommittee of the Cork County Council.  Eleven representatives from the Schull and Skibbereen electoral areas together with representatives from the various bodies on the seven islands concerned, meet periodically to discuss the difficulties under which island people are labouring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an efficient county manager. Noel Dillon, who has worked extremely hard on the island committee and who <Col N="1979" /> puts his money where his mouth is.  He will ensure that Cork County Council plays its part in providing the financial contributions required to fund grants for islanders.  It is clear that this island committee has worked effectively and efficiently.  County councils in the west should follow Cork County Council's lead and formulate island policy in conjunction with the Minister, who has special responsibility for the islands.</P>
    <P>This is the first time since the foundation of the State that a Government has given responsibility for island development to a particular Minister.  I am proud that the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, was chosen to shoulder that responsibility.  I have no doubt he will do an excellent job and will render an excellent account of his stewardship.</P>
    <P>Life is not all roses on the islands. Wealthy Germans have bought many of the smaller islands and developed them into holiday havens for visitors from western Europe.  Oileán Cléire lies approximately seven miles south of Baltimore, and from the day I was old enough to look out the window of my humble home in Goleen, I could see that island on the horizon.  There has been a decline in the population on those islands and they have suffered from the neglect of successive Governments over the years who did not pay any attention to maintaining their populations. Some islands off the coastline suffered discrimination because the population was not Irish speaking.  I hope that day is long gone.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has responsibility for both the native and non-native speaking islands.  It does not matter whether a person speaks English, French, Dutch, German, Greek or Russian, life on all islands is the same.  The same problems exist on Irish speaking and English speaking islands off our coastline.  Islanders endure the same hardships in getting their produce to the mainland, getting building materials to <Col N="1980" /> the islands and sending their children to schools on the mainland.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, and myself recently visited a school on Oileán Cléire and we were greatly impressed with the level of education being provided, the interest shown by the teachers and the good nature of the children.  Those young boys and girls were full of life but they have a dismal future ahead of them unless the recommendations in this report are implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State allocated £1 million this year to the islands to upgrade access facilities.  That is the beginning of what will, I hope, be improvements in the lives of people living on our islands.  Access to and from the islands is of paramount importance and nobody should be in any doubt about the dangers involved in travelling to and from the mainland, frequently in substandard ferries or boats.  Islanders live with such danger on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The cost of delivery of one tonne of lime to Beare Island, approximately five miles off the shoreline in Castletownbere, is £18.  The delivery cost on the mainland for one tonne of lime is £11.70, a difference of £7.20 per tonne. It costs islanders an enormous amount of money to transport their cattle to the mainland, yet they get the same prices for those cattle at Skibbereen or Bandon mart as farmers from the mainland.</P>
    <P>The Government must realise that living on an island is not easy.  Transport costs can be exorbitant.  It costs £600 to deliver a lorry load of readymix concrete to Beare Island whereas the same concrete is delivered on the mainland for £350.  Therein lies the problem as far as the hardships of islanders is concerned.</P>
    <P>Island national schools should have special school status and the minimum number of pupils required should be reduced from 25 to 14 to maintain teachers at such schools.</P>
    <P>If we want to be realistic about developing the islands, we must take all these factors into account.  Actions speak louder than words and we must <Col N="1981" /> do everything possible not only to maintain the present population on the islands but to increase it where possible. Our islands are rich in culture, nature and history.  The islanders are not begging for money, only seeking their just entitlements.  They must, and should, get the same facilities at the same price and rate as those on the mainland.  That would entail the subsidisation of agricultural materials from the mainland to the islands concerned.  It is unfair to ask the islanders to try to exist on frugal incomes from their farms without giving them the chance of obtaining products at the same price as their neighbours on the mainland.</P>
    <P>There is also vast potential for the development of the fishing industry on the islands off our coasts.  We also have energetic Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann co-operatives in Inish Cléire which play their part in trying to make life easier for those living on the islands. There is a successful turbot farm in Óileann Cléire and the quality and condition of those fish are second to none. This industry could be extended to the other six islands off our south western coastline.  The Oilean Cléire co-operative must be congratulated for the manner in which it has dealt with the development of the fish and agriculture industries on the island.</P>
    <P>The cycle of decline among island communities is clearly illustrated in this report, which refers to high transport costs; reduced competitiveness; an increased cost of living; less opportunity for economic activity; less attractive as a place to live; outmigration, especially of the young; reduced demand for goods and services; a long-term population decline; an ageing population and a lower birth rate.  This sums up the serious situation that successive Governments allowed to continue through the years, until the Government saw fit to appoint a Minister to investigate and arrest the decline of our island populations.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council and Donegal County Council have made headlines in setting up island committees &mdash; I do not <Col N="1982" /> know if Galway County Council has an island committee.  If they want to arrest the decline of population and life in rural Ireland and our islands, these county councils must play their part in island committees, draw up a plan and submit it to the Minister, who is ready, willing and able to look after the islanders and maintain the population levels of our native islands, which has been neglected since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years we have had a tendency to rewrite Irish history but this is the first time a Government report has attempted to rewrite our geography.  Only west coast islands are marked in the map of Ireland in this report.</P>
      <P>This Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development is no mean body.  It has representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach; Agriculture, Food and Forestry; Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; Defence and the Marine; Education; Enterprise and Employment; the Environment; Equality and Law Reform; Finance; Health, Social Welfare; Tourism and Trade &mdash; the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications have two representatives in this high powered group.  We are fortunate to have the chairman of that committee, the Minister of State responsible for Western Development, Deputy Carey, here today.  Indeed, he was highly praised by Deputy Sheehan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Lambay and other islands off our east coast do not appear in this report.  I can understand why some of these smaller islands do not appear but Lambay is populated.  It is a private island owned by the Revelstoke family. I have had the privilege of visiting it and it is a beautiful spot with great potential. As a first step, a footnote about Lambay should be added to this report.  The Minister of State might recognise someday that the whole world is not just the <Col N="1983" /> west coast; we have islands on the east coast.</P>

      <P>Lambay is a private island owned by the Revelstoke family but people live on it and work its farm. It has rare species in its wildlife preserve and it deserves to be mentioned in this report.</P>
      <P>I praise the late Lord Revelstoke for the work he put &mdash; it was his life's work &mdash; into the gardens, farm and preservation of wildlife on the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has great tourist potential, as it is near Dublin city, and as a nature reserve.  People live on this island and it has a wildlife preserve.  It also has tremendous potential for water sports and sailing.</P>
      <P>Fingal County Council is concentrating on the potential of tourism and upgrading the environmental and amenity aspects of the region.  When I was chairman of the old Dublin County Council we bought some regional parks. We are proud of our amenities, such as Malahide Castle, Newbridge House in Donabate and the magnificent regional parks between Skerries and Balbriggan. We took a forward looking approach towards providing amenities for the people of the region.  Lambay Island has long-term potential as an amenity to be shared not only by the family that owns it but also by our population and our incoming tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in his capacity as chairman of this co-ordinating committee, to enter into discussions with the family owning the island with a view toward greater co-ordination, for example, in the use of Rogerstown harbour, which is the private harbour used by the family on the mainland.  The back of the harbour is used by the progressive Rush Sailing Club which is trying to improve its facilities for members and tourists.  The Minister should discover <Col N="1984" /> for himself that there is a populated island off the east coast.  It is particularly important that he enter into negotiations with the family as Lord Revelstoke recently passed away.  The Minister of State should enter into negotiations with a view to examining the potential of Lambay for amenity use, for tourism, for its continued use as a wildlife preserve and for allowing it to be opened to the people of the Dublin region and to tourists, to see if it could be utilised for water sports and what use could be made of the island generally without damaging the present environment. It has tremendous potential and now is the appropriate time to consider it.  I congratulate earlier speakers. It is obvious there is a need for a co-ordinating authority to meet the needs of islanders.</P>
    <P>The report contains some lovely photographs in which the Minister of State looks well.  They were supplied courtesy of An Post, Bord Fáilte, Shay Fennelly and Telecom Éireann.  The Minister of State should look again at the list of islands and discover that the good Lord left us a little jewel called Lambay Island off Portrane where I was born.  Like the previous speaker who looked out on an island from where he was reared, as a child I went to bed every night looking out at the island of Lambay.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke referred to the quality of the report.  I thank all those associated with its production to a high standard in both Irish and English.  The work was properly co-ordinated.  That is a good start for the island population.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív was damning in his criticism of the report.  It seems we are at cross purposes.  The objective of the interdepartmental committee was to devise a framework for the future.  The easiest and most efficient way to overcome problems of access is through the island committees established in the counties adjacent to the inhabited islands.</P>

      <P>I had, unfortunately, a shorter period in which to do something. I thank Deputy McGinley for the hospitality shown to me by the inhabitants of Arranmore Island and Tory Island which I visited in recent days. They made me aware of the points raised by Deputy Mary Coughlan and Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher.  Deputy Coughlan focused on the emergency services being sought while Deputy Gallagher referred to the revision of the island fishing fleet.  Deputy Gallagher referred to the island fishing fleet and the question of islanders having their own access to fishing.  I accept they need grant aid to repair some of their small boats.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes queried the publication of the report in Dublin.  We would have liked to publish it on one of the islands, but Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann requested that it be published in Dublin.  I was pleased with the number of people who attended its publication. If we influence those at the centre of power by introducing them to real islanders we will have made a good start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton spoke about the role of the IDA and county enterprise boards who will play a part in the development of islands.  The Leader group has drawn up development plans and we will urge the IDA and county enterprise boards to make a contribution. I will take up the matter of <Col N="1988" /> Coney Island, to which Deputy Nealon referred, with Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, for his compliments and I know his Department will ensure that Comhdháil draw up an effective plan for islands and that this development will progress apace.  I was pleased to hear the Minister of State say that if the plans are effective the Leader group for the islands would qualify for additional funding.  Deputy Sheehan highlighted the high cost of transport to and from islands.  Housing is another difficulty.  At a recent meeting on islands the Cork county manager spoke positively about his expectations for Bere Island.  Many islanders want to own their own houses and are not enamoured with town housing. There are special grants for Gaeltacht islands, but I accept the point about the cost of sites.  This matter could be discussed at island committee meetings and county managers could buy subsidised sites.  Perhaps a subsidy will be provided from the finance envelope.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to introduce this Bill which is long overdue and will bring about a major reform of the legal metrology service.  The primary objectives of the Bill are to update and consolidate existing weights and measures and quality control legislation and to provide the legal framework for the establishment and operation of the new metrology service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measurement is the basis for an extensive range of decisions affecting trade, science and technology, industry, agriculture, health and safety.  It has also made possible the beginning and <Col N="1989" /> development of scientific activities and has fostered the march of civilisation.  In turn, the development of societies has increased the demand for measurement. Industrialisation brought a wider range of technologies and an increase in the number and complexity of transactions; mass production and automation created further demands by requiring interchangeability of components; urbanisation created greater human interaction and interdependency with a consequent need for measurement applied in many aspects of life, such as traffic or environmental control.</P>
    <P>The science of measurement is called metrology, It includes the theory of measurement; units of measurement and their physical realisation; measurement procedures and methods; characteristics of measuring instruments; and persons and organisations who undertake measurement.  Legal metrology entails the laying down of standards which ensure credibility and confidence in measurement results whenever conflicting interests exist, or where incorrect measurement results may adversely affect individuals or society.</P>
    <P>Historical references to measurement are numerous.  For example, the Magna Carta of 1215 contains the phrase:</P>
    <P>Throughout the kingdom there shall be standard measures of ale, wine and corn.  And there shall be a standard width of dyed cloth: namely a width of two ells within the selvage. Weights are to be standardised similarly.</P>
    <P>However, it is only in the last century and a half that the demands of science and industry and the concern of the governments of the more advanced economies have led to the unification and accuracy of measurement systems underpinned by an effective enforcement regime.</P>
    <P>Metrology law falls into two categories. The first body of law, the weights and measures Acts, 1878 to 1961, together with a number of regulations implementing EU law, concern units of measurement, standards through which <Col N="1990" /> the units are realised, organisation of the service and a system of establishing confidence in measuring instruments used in trade.  Measurement of gas and metering of electricity are regulated by means of the gas and electricity Acts, respectively.</P>
    <P>Parallel to these measures, the Packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Act, 1980, gives effect to EU Directives and deals with the control of quantities in pre-packaged goods.  Section 39 of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987 deals with short measure in goods sold loose.</P>
    <P>Thus, the existing legal metrology service is based mainly on 19th century legislation which I am sure the House will agree is no longer suitable for today's technological age.  The existing service has its organisational origins in the last century.  The organisation is fragmented with overall responsibility for weights and measures and quantity control residing with the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Weights and measures law is enforced by Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council staff within their administrative areas and by Garda sergeant <i>ex-officio</i> staff throughout the remainder of the country.  Local authorities are required to provide accommodation and equipment to enable the inspectorates carry out their work. Resource constraints have meant that local authorities, with the exception of Dublin Corporation, have been unable to discharge this duty.</P>
    <P>An inspectorate attached to the Department of Enterprise and Employment enforces the Packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Act, 1980.  Enforcement of the law in relation to gas meters is the responsibility of the public lighting departments of Dublin and Cork Corporations.  Essentially, the Bill will update existing provisions and provide for the establishment of a new legal metrology organisational structure that will be merged with the industrial metrology functions under the operational control of the National Metrology Laboratory of Forbairt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> The legal metrology service at present operates under the overall control of my Department.  The new service being established under the Bill will operate to the higher technical standards necessary to serve the needs of industry and consumers as well as contributing to the establishment of mutual confidence between the metrology services in an open European market.</P>
    <P>Increasingly in recent years, people in business are, on a voluntary basis, seeking third party assurance on the metrological integrity of the measuring instruments that they use.  The House will appreciate that modern economic necessity obliges economic operators to continually reassess their cost structures. Margins are constantly being eroded in the ever increasing competitive trade environment.  Many trading companies see the financial advantages of accreditation to quality production standards, for example, IS 9000, under which certifiable traceable measurements are the foundation of quality in the production of goods and services.</P>
    <P>The Bill governs measurements used for the purpose of trade.  It will, together with the packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Act, 1980, be construed as one Act.  I will be empowered to extend by regulation the scope of application to uses other than trade.  Existing weights and measures law is being repealed. Under the Bill, I will have general regulation making powers, including regulations to implement EU legislation, thus consolidating all regulation making powers in the legal metrology field in one Act.  As at present, the legislation will allow for the charging of fees. Expenses incurred in the administration of the Act shall be as sanctioned by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of a legal Metrology Service within Forbairt and the position of Director of Legal Metrology who will be responsible for management of the service, thus replacing the existing fragmented structures.  An important element in the establishment of the new service entails <Col N="1992" /> the transfer to Forfás, on a voluntary basis, of staff of the existing service.  I wish to pay tribute to past and present staff of the Metrology Service, gardaí, local authority and departmental staff &mdash; who gave a valuable service to consumers and the industry for many years. My Department has been in negotiation with staff representatives for some time on the transfer terms to apply.  I am pleased to say that, through the Garda Síochána Conciliation Council, agreement has been reached with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on the terms of transfers.  Seventeen of the 20 serving officers have applied to transfer to the new service.  Negotiations with the union representing 13 departmental and local authority staff have not yet concluded.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of officers of Forfás or existing inspectors who shall enforce the new legislation. Powers are being vested in inspectors to examine and test measuring instruments and goods to ensure conformity with legal requirements. Provision is also made to avoid employees having conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that bodies, other than the service, to be known as &ldquo;special bodies&rdquo;, may be authorised by the Director and with the prior consent of the Minister, to carry out statutory functions subject to certain conditions. These conditions may include proven technical competency of staff involved; that the measurement standards used be traceable to international standards; that the &ldquo;special body&rdquo; operates its metrological functions in an impartial manner, and that the procedures be adequately documented and open to inspection.  A special body will be subject to regular monitoring and if it does not continue to meet the conditions, its authorisation may be withdrawn.  It is envisaged that this provision will enable organisations such as the ESB or Bord Gáis to be given responsibility for carrying out respective legal metrology functions in relation to meters used for the sale of electricity and gas.</P>
    <P>Suppliers and users of measuring <Col N="1993" /> instruments will be required to ensure that where instruments are intended for a prescribed use, they shall conform to legal requirements.  Extending this obligation to the suppliers of instruments is new.  The existing legal position whereby the user of the instrument is solely responsible for ensuring conformity is unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As we all know, one can buy very little for £1.  However, in the Western Health Board area an elderly person can be looked after for one hour for £1.  For this money home helps will take care of an elderly person, light the fire, tidy the house, buy the groceries and do the washing.  Home helps provide a vital service to patients and the community.  Given that more people now work outside the home, elderly people need someone to take care of them.  We must ensure that they are looked after by people who care about them and who, in turn, are looked after by us.  The service provided by home helps has enabled many infirm and elderly people to stay in their homes and remain close to their relatives and friends.  We all know people who have been moved from their homes to institutions and back again and how confused this makes them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Home helps save the State the enormous costs involved in providing residential care.  Yet in the Western Health Board area they are paid only £1 per hour.  This rises to a miserly £1.46 per hour in the Southern Health Board area which caters for a huge population, <Col N="1994" /> many of whom are elderly.  Home helps visit elderly people even on Christmas Day.  In the Eastern Health Board area the rate rises to between £2 and £4 per hour.  This ignores the saving to the State and the wonderful care given by home helps.  It is estimated that the number of people over 80 years will increase by approximately 23 per cent by the year 2000, thereby placing a greater demand on the services for the elderly.  Home helps are central to this service.  When one looks at Barry Desmond's aspirational document, &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;, one realises the importance of providing care which makes elderly people feel safe and secure in their homes.  We deal with the needs of elderly people in a disjointed way &mdash; for example, in terms of security and free fuel &mdash; but never deal with all their needs.</P>
    <P>Home helps provide a community-based home centred service which enables elderly, ill or infirm people to remain in their home environment.  It also provides an essential element of social contact for many immobile and isolated elderly people who are no longer able to participate in the life of the community.  How often have we heard people say they look forward to hearing the knock of the home help on the door every morning?  Members will be familiar with cases where home helps visit patients not only during work hours but also at night and during weekends to ensure that they are all right.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to standardise the hourly wages paid to home helps and to ensure that they reflect the central role played by them in delivering a community-based health service.  Up to now home helps were viewed as unskilled auxiliary workers and this was reflected in their pay and conditions.  As the number of elderly people in society increases and the concept of community-based health care is developed, the role of home helps should be reassessed to ensure they are fully integrated into the health service and treated the same as other workers.  We <Col N="1995" /> cannot afford to ignore this problem any longer.</P>
    <P>If we are determined to care for the elderly in their homes then we must give recognition to the work done by home helps and ensure they have proper conditions. We should start by paying them a decent wage for a job for which one could probably never adequately be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this matter.  Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide or support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>The home help scheme is operated as a &ldquo;good neighbour&rdquo; scheme.  Volunteers who work as part-time home helps are paid a stipend or gratuity for the service they provide.  As operated in many areas, this is meant only as a contribution, and is not intended to compensate fully for the task undertaken.  The voluntary nature of the service, which involves a large element of social commitment, is underlined by the fact that a significant proportion of part-time home helps are engaged by voluntary bodies.  Indeed, in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>The home help service is essentially a local client-based service.  Details of clients' requirements are issued to the part-time home help by the home help organiser.  These requirements are reviewed from time to time by the organiser, and if the service diminishes or ceases, there is not necessarily a replacement client for the part-time home help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 11,000 part-time home helps involved in the service.  A very small number, approximately 120, are <Col N="1996" /> employed on a full-time basis.  The full-time home helps are paid £199.88 to £211.62 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services to Group 1 non-officer grades.  The rate paid to part-time home helps employed throughout the country varies from place to place and is related to the particular requirements and type of task undertaken in each case.  The current rates vary from £1 to £4 per hour.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, the underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a comunity based good neighbour scheme which would attract people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community services.  The service does not come within the realm of conventional employment.  For example, there is no formal recruitment procedure for part-time home helps, no personal records are kept by the health boards in respect of part-time home helps and there are no formal training schemes for part-time home helps.</P>
    <P>Income in respect of services provided does not come within the scope of the PAYE code.  It must also be noted that income earned by the home help is not taken into account for the purposes of a means test where the home help, or the spouse of a home help, is in receipt of a means-tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>In December 1994, the National Council for the Elderly published a report entitled &ldquo;Home Help Services for Elderly People in Ireland&rdquo;.  I welcome this report and the fact that the research undertaken points to the strength and value of the home help services.  The report records that the satisfaction of the service's clients is overwhelming.  It notes that one of the strengths of the service is the speed and flexibility with which a person in need can be supplied with a home help.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the home help service also came under scrutiny in the council's report and my Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, is currently considering a number of aspects of the <Col N="1997" /> home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the variations from board to board.</P>
    <P>We should not underplay the very real strengths and benefits of the service and I remind the House that in the recently published Health Strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; the role and potential of the home help service in adding to social gain is acknowledged. Indeed, the strategy states that over the next four years priority will be given to strengthening the role of the home help service and I would like to assure all concerned of my continued commitment to this aim.</P>

      <P>The Kelly Fitzgerald abuse case has been one of the most horrific in the history of the State.  The 15 year old died of blood poisoning in a London hospital in 1993.</P>
      <P>She had first come to the attention of the health services at the age of five months when she was taken there as an emaciated and dehydrated infant.  In May 1989, at the age of 11, Kelly was placed on an &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; register because she was considered by the UK authorities to be at risk of emotional deprivation and abuse and, at times, extreme mental cruelty from her parents.</P>
      <P>She went to live with her maternal grandparents, and there was a marked improvement in her physical and mental condition.  Her plight was still being investigated when her family moved to a small farm in County Mayo.  Kelly remained in London with her grandparents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1990, West Lambeth Health Authority sent its child health <Col N="1998" /> files to the Western Health Board.  It also notified the health board in writing of its involvement with the family and outlined concerns for another child in the Fitzgerald family.</P>
    <P>After a two weeks holiday in 1992 with her parents, Kelly sought to move from London to live in Mayo.  She made the move to Mayo to live again with her parents with whom she had not shared a home for three years.  Kelly died in suspicious circumstances five months later.</P>
    <P>After her death an inquiry was set up by the Western Health board although asking the health board to establish an independent inquiry, given that it was the body responsible for Kelly Fitzgerald's welfare, was not appropriate. Inquiries such as this should be undertaken by an independent national child care inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The Kelly Fitzgerald inquiry was completed five months ago but has never been officially published.  Quotes from the report are carried in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Based on the newspaper reports, there appear to have been serious flaws in the manner in which the Western Health Board dealt with the Kelly Fitzgerald case. However, given that only a very small element of the 235-page report is carried in the newspaper, I will reserve judgment on the findings until I have read the full report.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Adjournment is to ask the Minister for Health to explain a number of serious matters in his handling of the case.  Will the Minister explain why he has not requested a copy of the Kelly Fitzgerald report, even though it was completed five months ago.  On 8 February at Question Time in the House I called on the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to immediately seek publication of the findings of the report.  I was told at that stage that the Minister, the Minister of State or their officials had not seen the report. Why did they not move at that stage given that there was such public concern at the delays?</P>
    <P>Up to today neither the Minister, <Col N="1999" /> Deputy Noonan, who has responsibility for health boards, nor the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who has responsibility for children, had requested a copy of the report from the Western Health Board.  This represents a dereliction of duty and it reinforces my view that all the comments from these two Ministers about their concern for children are hollow.</P>
    <P>The Kelly Fitzgerald report is just one of a series of child abuse that have not been published.  The findings of at least two other child abuse investigations remain hidden.  The findings of these investigations are in the public interest and must be disclosed.  If the reports were published, valuable lessons would be learned and a repeat of the tragic Kelly Fitzgerald case might be avoided.</P>
    <P>I remain of the view that until mandatory reporting of child abuse allegation is introduced, procedures and practices in health boards and other agencies will not improve, and we will not have secure consistency in the management of the disclosure of child abuse.  I regard the position paper on child abuse published by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, as nothing more than a stalling tactic.  The document itself appears to offer reasons for not introducing mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>The signals from the Government on the issue of mandatory reporting are most confusing.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, said one thing, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach said another, while the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, said many things, none of which is consistent. His lastest remarks relate to his refusal to establish an independent national child care inspectorate on the basis that his weekly meetings with civil servants have rendered it unnecessary.  I find that a most unusual and implausible reason.</P>

      <P>Kelly Fitzgerald was 15 years old when she eventually died of blood poisoning in St. Thomas's Hospital, London.  From the evidence given at the trial of her parents and the extracts of the report published today, she was systematically beaten and starved by her parents at her home in Mayo.  Following an inquest in London, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board appointed an independent team to examine the health board's involvement with the child and her family because the child had lived with them in Mayo for five months prior to her death.  In 1990 the West Lambeth Health Authority sent files to the Western Health Board informing it in writing that, among other things, Kelly was at risk and that it had concerns about another Fitzgerald child.  As we know, her parents were prosecuted and found guilty, having pleaded guilty to the wilful neglect of Kelly, and were sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.  That sentence is now completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the inquiry into the health board's management of the matter, published in a newspaper, was stated to have been completed five months ago.  I and others have persistently asked the Minister for Health to publish its findings and he has persistently given excuses that the chief executive officer was taking advice on its publication. The extent and transparency of the Minister for Health's flight from accountability to the Dáil and the people for the failure of the Western Health Board to carry out its statutory protection duties is breathtaking.  It is outrageous and an insult to public administration and to politics that extracts from a report of such importance can appear in a daily newspaper before the Minister for Health has seen it.  Worse still, the Minister for Health admitted in reply to a parliamentary <Col N="2001" /> question I tabled that he had &ldquo;not requested to see the report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Details of the report are published under the newspaper heading &ldquo;A tragedy of inaction&rdquo;.  It is an indictment of the health board and its maladministration in dealing with the Fitzgerald family.  It was against this background of maladministration and system failure that Kelly Fitzgerald died and another Fitzgerald child was not adequately protected despite the knowledge of physical abuse of her by her parents.  The report finds &ldquo;lack of leadership and direction&rdquo; by the health board which led to inconsistencies in the board's intervention with the family.  Is this the report after it was filleted by lawyers or did the newspaper reporters see the unabridged version?</P>
    <P>The report found there was &ldquo;an overemphasis on sex abuse compared to physical and emotional abuse and neglect&rdquo;. Its ambivalence on the matter of physical abuse is not confined to that health board.  The same ambivalence is displayed in the discussion document on mandatory reporting published by the Minister for Health last week.  This long awaited document, a masterpiece of long-fingering and revision, is entitled &ldquo;Putting Children First&rdquo;.  It might more correctly be entitled &ldquo;Putting Children Last&rdquo;, having first dealt with everyone else's rights, including the ethical difficulties of professionals.</P>
    <P>This ambivalence is replicated in Chapter IV of the document.  In the course of a litany of issues which it is claimed would need to be addressed before mandatory reporting is introduced, the following stupid question is posed: should mandatory reporting be limited to child sexual abuse or should it extend to other forms of child abuse including physical abuse, non-accidental injury, emotional abuse and neglect?  It asks if there is to be mandatory reporting of neglect, should it extend to wilful neglect only or include unintentional neglect?  That is listed in the course of a range of major issues which, according to the Minister, would justify postponement of mandatory reporting. <Col N="2002" /> Chapter IV incredibly ends with an absurd observation &ldquo;it may be that the legalistic approach inherent in mandatory reporting may not be the best way forward&rdquo;.  Why is a legalistic approach not questioned in the reporting of any other crime?  No such hair splitting or hand wringing is indulged in by professionals or politicians on the reporting of any other crime.</P>
    <P>The 1987 guidelines on the reporting of abuse, so minimally updated by the Minister last year, failed every test to protect children.  We need to legislate immediately for an expressed statutory legal indemnity.  Mandatory reporting has been put on the long finger by this discussion document, as has the consultative process which it involves.  The protection of children from abuse is not something which can be morally postponed. That is what the Minister attempts to do.</P>
    <P>Now that the report is in the newspaper what action does the Minister propose to take?  Will he continue to delude himself that it is not a matter for him or his Department?  Will he continue to have a hands off approach on how health boards perform their statutory duties in the area of child protection?</P>

      <P>Since part of the report is now in the public domain, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has been requested to provide a copy of the report to the Department of <Col N="2003" /> Health, together with a copy of the legal advice in relation to it.  I understand that a special meeting of the Western Health Board has been convened for next Monday, 11 March to consider the report and that the chief executive officer will brief the board on the legal advice received and on the steps taken to improve child protection procedures in his board's area.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the report prior to its consideration by the board on Monday.</P>
      <P>A press statement issued today by the chief executive officer states:</P>
      <P>This statement is being issued in view of the disclosure in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> of details of the report of the inquiry team established by the Western Health Board to inquire into the circumstances of the tragic death of the late Kelly Fitzgerald.  The inquiry team was established by the board on 2 May 1995 and reported on 14 November 1995.  Preliminary examination of the report indicated a number of aspects on which questions arose as to the accuracy of certain statements and also the reasonableness of some of the conclusions drawn.  In view of these questions legal opinion was sought as to the board's position in regard to publication of the report.</P>
      <P>The opinion of the board's legal advisers was received on 6 February, 1996.  Further clarification of certain aspects was sought from the legal advisers and this was received on 5 March, 1996.  On 6 March, 1996 copies of the report were issued to members of the board together with the legal opinion received and my own report to the board as chief executive officer, all of these to be considered at a special meeting of the board to be held in committee on Monday, 11 March, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my report to the board I recommended that, in view of the legal opinion received, the report of the <Col N="2004" /> inquiry team should not be given general publication but that the recommendations, 44 in total, of the team should be so published.  I further proposed that the recommendations of the team in so far as they lay within the remit of the board, should be carefully examined with a view to bringing proposals for action before the board and where extra resources were necessary, to the Department of Health.  Those recommendations whose remit lay outside the board at national level or otherwise would be referred to the Department of Health. No further statement will be issued until after next Monday, 11 March, 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and I are extremely concerned that legal difficulties are impeding the publication of reports of inquiries into child abuse cases.  It has been our position since we took office that as much information as possible should be put in the public domain.  Above all, we are most anxious to avoid suggestions of a cover up in any case involving a health board.  The public interest demands that if mistakes were made they should be made public so that we can learn from them and take appropriate steps to ensure the best posible arrangements are put in place to protect children from all forms of abuse and neglect as far as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>It has become increasingly clear that a change in the law is required to ensure that reports of this nature may be published without fear of legal proceedings. It was for this reason that we decided to establish, on a statutory basis, an inspectorate of social services within the Department of Health.  It is proposed that this inspectorate will have responsibility for quality assurance and audit of child care practice.  Moreover, it will be charged with undertaking inquiries on behalf of the Minister.  It is our firm intention that the enabling legislation will provide for the privileged publication by the Minister of any report <Col N="2005" /> made to him by the proposed inspectorate.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn called today for the immediate introduction of mandatory reporting.

    <P>Mandatory reporting raises major issues which need to be teased out before any final decision is reached on the introduction of such a law.  Indeed, Deputy O'Donnell's party colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, in a recent newspaper article articulated some of the difficulties involved in translating the principle of mandatory reporting into practical law.  When Deputy O'Donnell described the discussion <Col N="2006" /> document as a masterpiece of long-fingering, she also indicted her esteemed colleague&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister for Justice satisfied with the security procedures in place in relation to the storage of drug hauls by the Garda?  It is important that <Col N="2007" /> drug seizures made by the Garda, especially the larger ones such as the 14 tonnes of cannabis seized in my constituency at Urlingford, the cannabis resin seized at Fatima Mansions in January 1995, the heroin seized at Dún Laoghaire in February 1995 and the record number of ecstasy tablets seized last year, are stored and destroyed quickly and securely.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the Minister, the Garda Síochána and the customs services have served with distinction in their efforts to stamp out the evil and deadly trade of drug dealing.  These law officers, by their record seizures of drugs last year and this year, have spared the lives of countless citizens. Their actions in taking on the purveyors of death and destruction have also spared many parents the misery and heartbreak of learning that their children have been preyed upon by these people.</P>
      <P>It will behoves any Member to seek to undermine the trojan efforts of the Garda and others.  I was disturbed to hear a Member attempt, in circumstances where it is well known that the Minister for Justice cannot speak freely about the confidential operation of policing matters, to subvert that good work. All Members know that a Minister for Justice is not in a position to reveal to the House the detailed policing and intelligence information which is essential to the Garda to rid the country of the drugs scourge.  It is also well known that day to day operations are a matter for the Garda Commissioner, not the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy O'Donnell one would think that each morning the Minister decided what each senior Garda Officer should do.  This is the same Deputy who indicated that there was a serial killer at large in County Kildare after a vicious crime had been committed.  She has not apologised to the Minister for that inaccurate information and the fact that there was no evidence of such a killer at large.  In these circumstances, it is cheap shot <Col N="2008" /> politics to attempt to score political points on an issue of such importance and concern to communities.</P>
    <P>It is particularly of concern given that two spokespersons for justice were given a confidential briefing on this issue to help them in their work.  Are we now at the point where hypocrisy has reached the level of demanding that the Garda pull out all the stops to wipe out drug dealing while at the same time coming into the House and asking them to operate with one hand tied behind their back?  I am not interested in knowing about the intelligence the Garda has in their possession.  I am far more interested in learning that the Garda have succeeded yet again in cutting off another drug supply route.  We should be careful that what we say does not jeopardise any Garda action with that objective in mind.</P>
    <P>I seek the Minister's assurance that appropriate measures are in place to provide for the security of drug consignments seized by the authorities.  From my contact with the Department of Justice today, I am glad to hear that there were a record number of seizures in 1995 and indeed, there were many seizures this year.  Given the financial loss which drug barons incurred last year and so far this year as a result of this exceptional work by the police authorities, it strikes me that they would be audacious and arrogant enough to try to retrieve these consignments.  I urge the Minister to convey to the Garda the importance of keeping these seizures secure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for raising this important issue.  I assume that this is a matter which is of concern to his constituents because of the large drugs seizure at Urlingford.  The Garda authorities have assured me that the security measures in place for the carriage, storage and destruction of drugs seized by them are continually reviewed.  A Garda officer not below the rank of inspector is involved in monitoring the destruction of drugs.  It would be contrary to <Col N="2009" /> established practice and the public interest to comment in detail about the security arrangements currently in place.  As regards the drugs seized at Urlingford in November, the vast bulk has been destroyed by the Garda.  A small amount has, of course, been retained for evidential purposes.</P>
      <P>As regards the large drugs haul at Urlingford, I believe that it is important that I should place on the record certain related matters arising in particular from comments made by Deputy O'Donnell earlier this week in the House.  It has been standard practice for Ministers for Justice not to get involved directly in day to day Garda operational decisions.  There are many good reasons for this, the first being that law enforcement is a matter for the Garda authorities, not for politicians.  A second valid reason is it is vitally important that the intelligence and other details essential to carrying out particular operations, especially those where lives might be at risk is confined strictly to those who need to have that information to carry out the operation.</P>
      <P>Because specific questions were directed to my office by the media about the Urlingford drugs seizure and by the Opposition spokespersons I thought it appropriate that I should ask a senior Garda officer, as an exceptional measure, to arrange for Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell to have confidential Garda briefing on the issue of a large drugs haul as raised in their questions.</P>
      <P>My sole purpose was to ensure that they, as principal Justice spokespersons, would know the facts and would not feel impelled, as a result of various other rumours and innuendo, to insist on public debate on an issue which is still the subject of major investigation being conducted at an international level, involving people who are suspected of being top players in the international drugs trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is precedent for the confidential briefing given to principal Opposition Justice spokespersons.  It is <Col N="2010" /> uncommon but, in certain circumstances, I believe necessary.  Deputy O'Donoghue has respected the confidentiality of the briefing given to him which, he can confirm, included a genuinely-held Garda view that disclosure of detail in this instance could put lives directly at risk.  I am extremely concerned, on the other hand, that Deputy O'Donnell has chosen to persist with a line of questioning and innuendo on this matter which not only puts in issue the capacity of the Garda to participate in a major international operation, but also &mdash; this is probably her true target &mdash; seeks to imply that members of this Government were improperly involved in the planning of the operation and are now improperly attempting to cover up.</P>
    <P>First, in relation to the capacity of the Garda Síochána, the Deputy will know &mdash; if she did not, she will know now &mdash; that police forces in other jurisdictions have been highly complimentary about the way in which the Garda has been able to play a part in this operation. They are concerned that the current debate will raise serious doubts on that score.  This country cannot afford to allow doubts of this kind to emerge.  The battle against major criminals whose tentacles stretch across continents, requires that our law enforcement agencies be in a position to play a part and that their capacity to do so be totally beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>As for targeting members of the Government, which appears to have been the Deputy's real purpose, she will be disappointed to hear that she has drawn a complete blank.  At the time this operation took place, that is, in November, 1995, neither I nor the Taoiseach, nor any other Minister or junior Minister knew any of the detail of the operation or the planning of it.  That is perfectly normal.  I wish to state categorically that neither I, the Taoiseach nor the Ministers of State, Deputies Currie and Burton, misled the Dáil at any time. This was the largest single haul of drugs &mdash; 14 tons of cannabis &mdash; ever intercepted by the authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> As to some of the specific questions raised by the Deputy about ministerial involvement, on whether the consignment of drugs in question was imported into Irish territory with ministerial authority, in an operational matter the question of ministerial authority does not arise &mdash; the answer is no.  On the question as to the level at which the importation was authorised, it was an operational decision and did not involve any politicians.  The implementation of any Garda operation is a matter which is the responsibility of the relevant senior gardaí involved in any operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from questions which, in essence, are more in the nature of innuendo, seeking to imply that I and others have been involved in some cover up, the Deputy has raised a whole series of questions concerning, for example, the involvement or non-involvement of the Revenue Commissioners, whether, or even if, a controlled landing might have been permitted and so on.  These I regard as strictly operational matters for the law enforcement authorities.  I will not comment on operational matters of this kind and there is ample precedent for Justice Ministers to take this line. One previous Minister, Deputy O'Malley, when questioned about a high-profile investigation, observed that:</P>
    <P>It is totally unrealistic to expect me to make statements in this House about events which obviously are still the subject of Garda investigations.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly said that it is not open to me to make such statements and, indeed, I regard questions of this kind as an abuse of the processes of this House.</P>
    <P>I do, however, want to comment on three points which are particularly worrying.  First, the impression is being created &mdash; mostly by Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; that the drugs, in this instance, were paid for by the Garda, in other words, by the taxpayer.  That is absolutely without foundation.  The destruction of the <Col N="2012" /> large consignment of drugs in this instance represented a very definite gain for the people of this country, and indeed other countries, and a very definite loss for major criminals and not for the taxpayers of this State.  Speculation about entrapment &mdash; Deputy O'Donnell did speculate to a significant extent about entrapment &mdash; is extremely damaging and out of place.  Entrapment, as that Deputy, being a lawyer, should well know, is a matter of legal interpretation. For a person in Deputy O'Donnell's position to speculate that the defence of entrapment might be open to criminals in this situation is particularly ill-judged.</P>
    <P>The third specific matter I want to comment on are suggestions to the effect that the Garda, in this instance, acted illegally.  I am not aware of any basis for this suggestion, and I am assured by the Garda authorities that they are not aware either of any illegality.</P>
    <P>As regards the confidential briefing given to Deputy O'Donnell and her fear that she may have been &ldquo;entrapped&rdquo; by virtue of the fact that, as Justice spokesperson, she was given special access to information.  I want to assure her now, as I did the day before yesterday, that this was certainly not the intention.  It is outrageous of her to imply that I would have facilitated briefing on a major anti-crime operation of this kind in which lives could be at risk, for base political purposes.  I want to give Deputy O'Donnell another assurance.  As far as I am concerned, she need never again worry that she is being compromised by knowing the truth.  I will certainly not run the risk again of asking the Garda to take Deputy O'Donnell into their confidence.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for raising this issue and assure him that drugs of the nature he referred to are securely and safely consigned to destruction or safekeeping until they are needed for court cases.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 March 1996.</P>

      <P>I have availed of all appropriate opportunities in bilateral contacts with the Turkish authorities to express the Government's deep concern about continued reports of human rights violations in Turkey.  I have strongly <Col N="1903" /> supported the emphasis placed by the European Union on human rights issues in dialogue with Turkey.  Ireland and her partners in the European Union have repeatedly made it clear that respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights will continue to be the basis for the development of our relations with Turkey.</P>
      <P>In present circumstances, we believe that the most effective way to pursue these issues is in the context of the Customs Union between the European Union and Turkey, which entered into force on 31 December last.  The Customs Union is accompained by improved mechanisms for political dialogue with the Turkish authorities which facilitate the European Union's efforts to pursue these concerns with Turkey. The process of completing the Customs Union has already given significant impetus to reform in Turkey including the approval of a number of amendments to the Turkish Constitution in July of last year.  Amendments have also been made to Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law which have resulted in the release of a number of detainees.  These changes are a step in the right direction. Our concern, in common with our EU partners, is to see that these reforms are implemented both rapidly and effectively. The outgoing Turkish Government gave assurances that they would continue the reform process.  We will continue to urge their successors to pursue the same approach and to adopt and implement at an early date the further reforms necessary to ensure full respect for human rights.</P>

These passes are issued in accordance with EC Directive 91/447 of 18 June 1991.

      <P>In the period since its establishment in 1986 to 30 September 1995 the International Fund for Ireland, which is administered by an independent board, allocated £82 million to projects in the southern Border counties.</P>
      <P>Following the original announcement of the paramilitary ceasefires in the autumn of 1994, President Clinton announced his intention of requesting Congress to increase the US contribution to the fund to $30 million per annum for 1996 and 1997.  Against a background of severe budgetary pressure in the United States.  Congress recently decided to contribute $19.6 million for 1996, the same level as 1995. A contribution for 1997 has yet to be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> In November 1994 the European Union agreed to renew and increase its contribution to the fund by pledging 90 million ECU in equal annual tranches over the following three years.  At around the same time, New Zealand pledged a further $NZ300,000 to the fund and Australia for the first time became a contributor to the fund when it agreed to provide $A7 million over a five year period.  All of these enhanced contributions represented tangible support for the peace process and an important vote of confidence in the work of the fund.  In keeping with the terms of the agreement establishing the fund, some 25 per cent of these additional resources would be allocated to projects in the southern Border counties. These resources have been used to support projects and programmes which meet the core objectives of the fund, namely to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland.  Full details of the priority programmes operated by the fund and the projects which they have assisted are published each year in its annual report. I have accordingly arranged that the 1994 and 1995 reports should be made available to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has already reported to the House on Tuesday last on the outcome and his participation in the Europe Asia Meeting (ASEM) in Bangkok on 1 and 2 March 1996.  The Taoiseach has also arranged for a copy of the Thai chairman's statement, at the conclusion of the meeting, to be placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 7 of the Thai chairman's statement, to which all participants subscribed, states as follows in relation to human rights:</P>
      <P>The meeting reaffirmed its strong commitment to the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, to the 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the 1993 Declaration of Vienna and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights, the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and Programme of Action, and to the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action for the Fourth World Conference on Women.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his contribution to the plenary session of the meeting, underlined the importance of adherence to international norms on human rights. He pointed out that a good human rights position will underpin the economic development which is sought by all states.  He, therefore, welcomed especially the commitment by all participants at the meeting to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  Other leaders also raised the question of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> The Taoiseach had a substantive discussion with President Suharto on Indonesia and East Timor.  He indicated the concern of the Government and Irish public opinion at the situation in East Timor.  He also stated that Ireland would do anything it could both during our forthcoming EU Presidency and in any other way to help resolve the situation. The Taoiseach also indicated that he was glad to note the progress which had been made in the bilateral meeting, in the margins of the ASEM, between the Indonesian President and the Portuguese Prime Minister which provides hope for the future.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of Foreign Ministers which took place in parallel to that of the Heads of State or Government at the ASEM, I raised a number of human rights-related issues.  I also met, on behalf of the Taoiseach, with a delegation from Transnational Institute, which included Irish and other participants, accompanied by Ms Bernie Malone MEP, who were in Bangkok for the first Asia-Europe NGO Conference on the Future of Asian-European Relations.  Amongst the topics raised in connection with democracy and human rights were Northern Ireland and former Yugoslavia together with East Timor and Burma.</P>

      <P>The Government continue to be seriously concerned about respect for human rights in Nigeria. In particular, we are concerned about the uncertainty which surrounds the future of the 19 Ogoni activists who <Col N="1908" /> have been charged and are due for trial by a tribunal on similar grounds to those applied to the late Mr. Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants.  The fact that they may now be subjected to an internationally discredited and flawed process and that their case is subject to review by the Nigerian High Court have been a further source of delay and anxiety for the 19 detainees.  These developments have heightened international concern about the functioning of the Nigerian justice system and the lack of respect shown by the military Government for the rule of law and basic human rights.</P>
      <P>Ireland has strongly supported the raising of the cases of the Ogoni 19 by the EU.  In a demarche to the Nigerian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ikimi, in Abuja on 23 January, the Presidency expressed the EU's serious concern that the impugned process which had led to the previous and internationally condemned Ogoni executions was about to be repeated.  It was also recalled that it was the outcome of this procedure which had resulted in the imposition of measures by the EU in its respective common positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware from my reply to questions on 7 December 1995, the existing EU measures against Nigeria contain specific provisions for review.  These include the adoption of further measures, including further sanctions, in the light of developments in Nigeria.  Together with EU partners, we are monitoring the situation closely with a view to maintaining strong pressure on the Nigerian authorities to take specific steps towards an early transition to democracy and to ensure full respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of the Ogoni 19 and other more recent arrests are being taken into account by the Government in its discussions with partners in the context of this review.  With them, we are also supporting a proposal that the Special Rapporteur on the Independence and Impartiality of the Judiciary, who is attached to the UN Commission on <Col N="1909" /> Human Rights, should monitor any further Ogoni tribunal hearings which may take place.</P>

      <P>One of the primary objectives of our diplomatic missions is to advance Irish economic and business interests abroad.  All missions are expected to reflect in their activities the priority which the Government attaches to the promotion of the State's international economic interests.  As a development of this approach, the Government decided that representatives of An Bord Tráchtála should be attached to the diplomatic staff of the three Embassies recently opened in Prague, Budapest and Kuala Lumpur. Representatives of An Bord Tráachtála were already members of the diplomatic staff of our Embassies in Moscow. Riyadh and Beijing.</P>
      <P>In addition to the direct involvement of Embassies in promoting the export of Irish goods and services, there is close co-operation with other Departments and State agencies involved in this area. For example, where there are a number of State agencies located in the same city as an Embassy, the Ambassador chairs a foreign earnings co-ordination committee.  In recent years, the concept of Ireland House has been developed whereby all the State agencies in a particular capital locate their premises in a single building with the Embassy or consulate and, in this way, give greater focus and impact to their combined activities.  My Department will continue to seek further ways of ensuring that the staff of our diplomatic missions abroad are used to best effect in the task of promoting our overall economic interests.</P>

      <P>The countries of Central American have consistently emphasised the importance of the role played by the international community in supporting the economic development of the region and in promoting its peace, freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has strongly supported the countries of Central America in their efforts to consolidate democracy and development.  Through its operational activities and specialised agencies, UN efforts are concentrated in the fields of poverty alleviation, economic reform and public sector policies and management, assistance to refugees, the strengthening of democratic institutions, environmental protection, population related programmes and natural disaster prevention and rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Co-operation between the European Union and the countries of Central America takes place in the framework of the San José dialogue.  This political and economic dialogue was born out of a ministerial meeting in the capital of Costa Rica in September 1984 and was institutionalised at a conference in Luxembourg in November 1985.  A co-operation agreement providing for economic and development co-operation was agreed at the Luxembourg conference and entered into force on 1 March 1987.  Over the past ten years, the increasing volume of Community aid has made the European Community the main donor in Central America.  Total commitments have significantly exceeded one billion ECU and annual commitments in 1994 amounted to 170 million ECU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more ambitious co-operation <Col N="1911" /> agreement covering a wider range of co-operation sectors and incorporating human rights and future development clauses was signed in El Salvador in February 1993.  This however, has not yet entered into force as it has not to date been ratified by all Central American countries.</P>
    <P>The partners in the San José dialogue have now agreed to continue the deepening and enhancing of their relations so as to meet new challenges and priorities. The forthcoming San José ministerial meeting in Florence later this month will review the entire San José process with a view to reformulating the dialogue's basic objectives, refocusing co-operation and reforming its procedures.</P>
    <P>The economic contribution of the wider international community to the peace process in Central America was considered at consultative groups meetings in Paris in June 1995 organised by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the World Bank.  At these meetings, representatives of the international financial institutions and donor countries committed more than $3 billion to Central American countries for economic reconstruction and development over the period 1995-97.</P>
    <P>In respect of Irish assistance, Irish Aid is currently providing funds in support of the Nicaraguan Centre for Development Studies (CEI).  This centre provides courses on negotiating techniques, mediation, human rights and constitutional law.  Additional aid to projects in Central American countries is provided through Irish Aid's NGO co-financing scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current UN statistics on world hunger indicate that almost 800 million people in developing countries today face chronic malnutrition and 200 million children under the age of five suffer from acute or chronic protein and energy deficiencies. At present, as many as 88 nations fall into the category of low-income food-deficit countries, of which 42 are in sub-Saharan Africa and 19 in Asia and the Pacific.</P>
      <P>According to current UN estimates, the world population will increase from the present 5.7 billion to 8.7 billion by the year 2030.  Projections indicate that without action to reverse present trends, the number of chronically undernourished people will continue to increase.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that hunger and malnutrition should continue to diminish the lives and human potential of nearly 20 per cent of the world's population at a time of unparalleled technological progress.</P>
      <P>While food aid can help aleviate emergency situations, it cannot be relied upon to solve the problem of recurring food deficits.  To ensure adequate food security, continuing emphasis must be placed on achieving lasting sustainable development in the poorest countries.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the seriousness of this problem and is determined that Ireland should play a full part in the international efforts to combat hunger.  This is reflected in the Government's commitment to increasing Ireland's official development assistance each year, so as to make steady progress towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's most direct contribution to the fight against hunger is made through the Irish Aid programme, which is focussed on the provision of assistance to the poorer developing countries and to the most disadvantaged sections of their populations.  The Irish Aid country programmes have the objectives of addressing basis needs and local capacity building for sustainable development and involve a significant <Col N="1913" /> emphasis on agricultural and rural development projects.  Irish Aid also contributes directly to the alleviation of hunger through its support for the activities of Irish NGOs in the areas of food aid and agricultural development.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aid Advisory Committee recently submitted a report by Mr. Nick Chisholm of University College Cork which makes a series of recommendations in respect of Irish Aid's involvement in promoting sustainable agriculture and food security.  These recommendations are now under consideration and the Government will ensure that Irish Aid continues to give a clear emphasis to food security as part of our overall policy strategy.</P>
    <P>At the multilateral level, Ireland is involved in the promotion of economic development through its contributions to the development activities of the European Union, the United Nations and the World Bank group.  Of most direct significance to the fight against hunger are our contributions to the UN agriculture and food agencies &mdash; the FAO, the World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development &mdash; which seek to combat the poverty, malnutrition and hunger affecting developing countries through the promotion of agricultural development and the provision of food aid.  In 1995, Ireland contributed over £1.5 million to the World Food Programme, most of which was committed to emergency food operations in Africa.</P>
    <P>A World Food Summit under FAO auspices will take place in Rome at Head of Government level in November 1996.  The summit is expected to renew the international commitment to achieving food security and to adopt a plan of action to eliminate hunger and prevent famine.  The Government intends to play a full part during our EU Presidency in ensuring a successful and substantive outcome to this summit.</P>

      <P>When Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, the Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. The Chinese position at that time was and still is that China included Tibet.</P>
      <P>The Government have taken up the issue of the ill-treatment of Tibetan citizens bilaterally with the Chinese authorities and at the United Nations.  I raised the serious concern of the Government at the Tibetan situations with the Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, during our discussions on 6 October 1995, on the occasion of his visit to Ireland.  I emphasised to him the strength of the concern of the people of Ireland and other EU countries about the situation there.  I also referred to the cases of 50 prisoners which were raised with the Chinese authorities by the EU heads of mission in Beijing during their visit to Tibet in 1993.</P>
      <P>During the visit to China of the EU Troika delegation on human rights from 22 to 24 January 1996, the dispute between the Dalaí Lama and the Central Government over the selection of the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama was raised with a view to seeing if the wishes of the Tibetan people might be respected.  The delegation also separately voiced concerns on other issues relating to Tibet in the course of several meetings with the Chinese authorities, including the population transfer of Han Chinese to Tibet, the issue of religious tolerance, the treatment of dissidents, the status of the Tibetan language and the issue of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish delegation to the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in Geneva last year played an active role <Col N="1915" /> in drafting a proposed resolution on human rights in China and ensured that appropriate reference to the situation in Tibet was included in the text.  The draft resolution, which Ireland co-sponsored, highlighted the inadequacy of the situation of Tibetans, with regard to their ethnic identity, their religious freedom and their own language and culture.  In the event this draft resolution was defeated by the narrowest of margins.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in Tibet and will continue to press for measures to ensure that the human rights of Tibetans are respected.</P>

      <P>We are deeply appreciative of the support, goodwill and commitment shown by the US Administration in their ongoing efforts to move the peace process forward.  This support has been, at all stages in the peace process, generous and impartially available to all sides on an inclusive basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset I have tried to ensure both directly and through our Embassy in Washington that the President and his advisers are kept up to date on the situation in Northern Ireland.  The National Security Adviser Tony Lake and Deputy National Security Adviser Nancy Soderberg who are in regular contact with all of the political leaders involved in the peace process, have played an important role in the efforts of President Clinton and his administration to be a resource and a support for both Governments in their search for political progress.  President Clinton's highly successful visit to Ireland <Col N="1916" /> last November brought the groundswell demand for peace from both communities into sharp focus, and sent an important message to all of the parties concerned that the public wishes them to co-operate to secure political progress. We are also grateful to President Clinton for enabling the appointment of Senator George Mitchell as chairman of the International Body on Decommissioning. The Mitchell report with its shrewd analysis and challenging conclusions provides an excellent road map for all parties to adhere to.</P>
    <P>We are very appreciative of the economic dimension of US support.  Their generous contributions to the International Fund for Ireland total 250 million dollars to date.  The personal initiative of President Clinton in hosting last year's White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland, under the expert chairmanship of Senator Mitchell is a further tangible expression of US support and goodwill.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity to meet President Clinton, Vice-President Gore, and National Security Adviser, Tony Lake and to further brief them on recent developments in Northern Ireland when I visited Washington last month.  My meetings there were very productive and I believe has significantly advanced the prospects for talks, I was shocked and horrified to learn as I was actually flying over the Atlantic that the IRA had broken the ceasefire and had exploded a bomb in London.</P>
    <P>Since my visit to Washington the US Administration have continued to act as a powerful resource in the lead up to the communiqué of the 28 February.  The Taoiseach spoke to President Clinton and I have had direct contact with National Security Adviser Lake.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will be in Washington DC from 13 to 15 March and will have further opportunities to engage directly with President Clinton and his Administration.</P>

      <P>A report on the food and nutrition situation in Iraq, which was published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations last September, estimated that the rate of child mortality had risen fivefold in the past five years.  It reckoned that 52,905 children under five years died in Iraq in 1994.  The figure given for the period January-July 1995 was 31,327.</P>
      <P>While UN Security Council Resolutions have prohibited oil sales by Iraq, the import of food, medicines and other items for essential civilian use is not prohibited by UN sanctions.  Various Security Council Resolutions have set out the conditions which must be fulfilled before action can be taken to ease the sanctions, including the establishment of an effective control system to verify that Iraq meets its obligations in relation to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.  It is a matter for the Security Council to decide when the conditions have been fully met and when the sanctions can be suspended or lifted. In light of continuing non-cooperation by Iraq with UN efforts to establish an effective means of verifying that country's elimination of weapons of mass destruction, it does not appear that sanctions against Iraq will be lifted in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Security Council has adopted a number of resolutions allowing Iraq to export substantial quantities of oil in order to fund the purchase of food, medicines and other items for such essential civilian use.  The most recent such resolution was Security Council Resolution 986 which was adopted in April last and which considerably expanded the terms under which Iraq could sell oil for this purpose.  Like its <Col N="1918" /> predecessors this resolution is intended to help relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.  There have been encouraging indications following recent negotiations between Iraq and the UN that Iraq may be moving towards acceptance of this resolution.  I very much welcome this development.  I have recently written to the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, urging the Iraqi authorities to reach an early settlement on this issue in a way that would enable them to relieve the suffering of Iraq's citizens.</P>
    <P>It also remains a matter of great concern to me that it is not possible for the UN and for other humanitarian agencies to operate throughout Iraq and provide food and other forms of assistance because they are denied access by the Iraqi authorities.  Similarly, the Security Council had to set aside a recent plan to send a special mission to Iraq to investigate the economic and social conditions there and the impact of the deteriorating conditions on the Iraqi people because the Iraqi authorities indicated that it would not permit the mission to enter the country.</P>

      <P>Under Article 2 (b) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement the British Government accepts that the Irish Government will put forward views and proposals on matters relating <Col N="1919" /> to Northern Ireland in so far as those matters are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Article 5 (c) provides that, if it should prove impossible to achieve and sustain devolution on a basis which secures widespread acceptance in Northern Ireland, the Anglo-Irish Conference shall be a framework within which the Irish Government may, where the interests of the minority community are significantly or especially affected, put forward views on proposals for major legislation and on major policy issues.  In the absence of devolved institutions since the signature of the Agreement in 1985, successive Irish Governments have made extensive use of the mechanisms of the Conference to this end.</P>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement also provides, in Article 4 (c), that the conference shall be a framework within which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the modalities of bringing about devolution in Northern Ireland, in so far as they relate to the interests of the minority community.</P>
      <P>It has been generally accepted since the 1991-92 talks that devolved institutions in Northern Ireland will only be agreed as part of a comprehensive accommodation addressing all three sets of relationships and involving arrangements within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between the British and Irish Governments.  This understanding is reflected in the Joint Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.</P>
      <P>The Government is actively engaged in the preparation of the all-party negotiations which are to begin on 10 June and which we hope will result in a comprehensive settlement.  In our exchanges with the British Government on these matters, we continue to make ample use of the machinery set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the precedent established by the previous Government in 1991-92, we accept that matters proper to the <Col N="1920" /> first strand of negotiations, those involving relationships and structures within Northern Ireland, are primarily for the British Government and the parties there, who would be called on to operate those structures.  In the spirit of that precedent, at the summit held on 28 February the Taoiseach, while noting that the question of an elective process and its nature were primarily a matter for the parties in Northern Ireland to determine, indicated that the Government would support any proposal which, it was satisfied, was broadly acceptable to those parties, had an appropriate mandate and was within the three-stranded structure.  The interconnection between an elective process and all-party negotiations is also a matter of direct concern to us, as are the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of negotiations.  These issues are being considered in the intensive multi-lateral consultations which are currently under way.</P>

Subsequently, the Embassy discussed the matter with the Home Office and indicated that we would be taking up with them any additional specific points identified by the family's legal advisers as requiring explanation or clarification. The complex issues involved are essentially matters of law for clarification by legal advisers and, if necessary, by the courts.</P>

Má phléitear an cheist seo ag an CIR, nó i gcómhthéacs aon chaibidlí faoi mhéadú ina dhiaidh sin, agus má tá caoi ann stádas na Gaeilge a fheabhsú sa chomhthéacs sin, tá sé i gceist ag an Rialtas an deis sin a úsáid.</P>
      <P>Seachas an CIR, a thagann le chéile go speisialta chun athruithe do na Conarthaí a phlé, ba mhaith leis an Rialtas dul chun cinn a dhéanamh maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach.  Níl gá le hathruithe sna Conarthaí dona leithéad seo de dhul chun cinn.  Go deimhin, níl ceist chóras na dteangacha leagtha síos sna Conarthaí féin, ach i Rialachán ón gComhairle.  Tá staidéar déanta ag mo Roinn ar dhóigheana praicticiúla chun dul chun cinn don Ghaeilge a bhaint amach.  Tá an staidéar sin seolta go dtí an tAire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta agus tá sé faoi mheas aige faoi láthair.

    <P>Regarding the question of employment discrimination, Irish citizens currently comprise in excess of 2.5 per cent of the staff in the various Union institutions and bodies.  My Department monitors the employment of Irish citizens in the institutions of the Union and is satisfied that Irish citizens are well <Col N="1923" /> represented across the entire spectrum of these positions.  We also monitor language requirements to ensure that due regard is given to candidates for employment with Irish as their first language.</P>

      <P>The Iranian Government is reminded of the importance we attach to a resolution of the Rushdie issue at every meeting that I and other Government Ministers have with them.  The main thrust of our efforts, however, is through the European Union, which has taken up the issue of the fatwa against Mr. Salman Rushdie within the context of its critical dialogue with Iran.  Since its establishment at the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992, this dialogue has provided a mechanism for consultation between the EU and Iran on a range of issue of mutual interest.  The Madrid European Council last December reaffirmed that the EU would keep up its efforts within the framework of the critical dialogue to obtain a satisfactory solution in respect of Salman Rushdie and called upon the Iranian authorities to respond constructively to its efforts.</P>
      <P>The Government's view on the fatwa are reflected in the statement issued by the European Union on 13 February last to mark the seventh anniversary of the fatwa.  This declaration stated that the fatwa was in defiance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principle of the sovereignty of states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union must pursue with Iran the defence of fundamental <Col N="1924" /> rights and freedom of expression, including the issue of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, using the critical dialogue for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The following is the current status of Ireland's diplomatic relationships with the 21 countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and the former USSR.</P>
      <P>Resident Irish diplomatic missions have been established in four countries viz.  Czech Republic (Prague), Republic of Hungary (Budapest), Republic of Poland (Warsaw) and the Russian Federation (Moscow).</P>
      <P>Non-resident diplomatic relations have been established in nine countries viz, the Republic of Bulgaria (from Budapest), Romania (from Athens), Slovak Republic (from Vienna), Republic of Belarus (from Moscow), Republic of Kazakhstan (from Moscow) and Ukraine (from Prague), Republic of Estonia (from Helsinki), Republic of Latvia (from Warsaw), Republic of Lithuania (from Warsaw).  In relation to the latter three, it should be noted that Ireland never recognised their annexation by the former Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Possibilities for the extension of diplomatic relations, both resident and non-resident, are examined from time to time in the light of our national and international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  The extension of diplomatic relations is done only by prior agreement with the countries concerned.

Economic, trade and cultural relations between Ireland and Taiwan are pursued within the private rather than the <Col N="1927" /> public sector.  In these circumstances, attendance by official observers from Ireland to monitor the election which is to be held on 23 March 1996 in Taiwan would not be in accordance with Government policy.</P>

      <P>Peace negotiations between President Cristiani's Government and the <i>Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberación Nacional</i> (FMLN), the left-wing guerilla movement opposing the Government, were successfully <Col N="1928" /> concluded in New York on 14 January 1992.  A comprehensive peace accord (the &ldquo;Agreement of Chapultepec&rdquo;) was signed in Mexico on 16 January 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Peace Accord, an <i>Ad-hoc</i> Investigative Commission on Human Rights was established to investigate the question of human rights violations during the civil war by members of the armed forces.  In its report the commission recommended that the Government dismiss 97 army officers, including seven generals.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above commission, a &ldquo;truth commission&rdquo; was set up under the terms of the peace accord with four main tasks:</P>
      <P>(1)to clarify the worst human rights abuses of the war by all sides;</P>
      <P>(2)to study with special care the impunity with which the Salvadoran military and security forces committed abuses;</P>
      <P>(3)to make legal, political or administrative recommendations to prevent a repeat of past abuses;</P>
      <P>(4)to stimulate national reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The report of the truth commission, which was released on 15 March 1993, found the military in El Salvador responsible for the vast majority of human rights abuses and atrocities.  It also found that the FMLN were responsible for grave acts of violence, including assassinations, disappearances and kidnapping.</P>
      <P>Presidential elections were held on 24 April 1994, in which Armando Calderon Sol of the Republican National Alliance (ARENA) achieved 68 per cent of the vote to beat the left-wing coalition candidate, Ruben Zamora.  In his victory speech President Calderon promised to promote political dialogue with all political factions including the FMLN, which participated in the elections, as part of the left-wing coalition, for the first time.</P>

Currently it is a guerrilla group with strongholds in Pailin and Phnom Malai in the northwest provinces of Battambang and Banteay Meanchey close to the Cambodia/Thailand border.

      <P>There were reports in recent weeks of explosions by home-made Khmer Rouge bombs in Battambang, Cambodia's second largest city, where the provincial hospital was hit but without causing significant damage.  On 21 February 1996, a convoy of cement trucks was ambushed on national route five which runs from the capital Phnom Penh northwest to Battambang in the most serious attack by the Khmer Rouge on civilians so far this year, with the loss of one life and one seriously injured.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the dangers of low-flying helicopters in Border areas.  Incidents relating to helicopters are raised on an ongoing basis through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  In recent months we have raised particular incidents in the south Armagh area.  I have also availed of the meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference to register our concern at such incidents.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that all unauthorised crossings of the Border, including accidental or inadvertent crossings, whether in the air or at surface level, are viewed by the Government as a very serious matter.  I am also fully aware of the concerns of residents in Border areas in this regard.</P>
      <P>All unauthorised overflights of the State are immediately raised through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast. We will continue to impress upon the British authorities the need to take the necessary steps to avoid such incidents in the future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the issue of debt reduction is a complex one and not possible to answer simply.  Third World debt is owed not only to multilateral organisations like the World Bank, but also bilaterally to individual creditor countries and to commercial financial institutions.</P>
      <P>It is as a member of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund that Ireland is in a position to exert influence towards easing the debt burden of poor countries.  As Ireland's representative on the board of governors of both organisations, I have used their annual meetings to call on them to press ahead with work on ways to ease the multilateral debt-service obligations of the countries experiencing the greatest difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that I will take advantage of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union in order to highlight the debt problem of the poorest countries and to seek mobilise commitment from our EU partners and the multilateral institutions to alleviating that burden on optimal terms.</P>

      <P>My Department's priorities in 1996 are to advance towards bringing to fruition the extensive proposals, of a legislative and administrative nature, which the Government is pursuing in relation to equality, equal status and family law matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, in equality matters, I will give special attention to the publication and enactment of the forthcoming Employment Equality Bill which will prohibit discrimination in employment on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnic and national origin or membership of the travelling community.  An Equal Status Bill which will deal with discrimination outside the field of employment, is being drafted at present.  Follow-up <Col N="1938" /> action on the Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community will be determined after consideration by the Government of the report of the InterDepartmental Working Group of Officials and, in the area of disability, I am awaiting the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which is due to be presented at the end of April 1996, to submit specific proposals to Government relating to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to my legislative priorities for family law and other social matters, I have made an order bringing into effect, from 1 August 1996, the Family Law Act, 1995; publication of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill is awaiting the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court of the High Court decision in relation to the challenge to the result of the divorce referendum; the Powers of Attorney Bill is before the Committee on Legislation and Security, having been passed by the Seanad; and regulations are at an advanced stage of preparation to give effect to the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  In course of preparation are proposals for legislation on the law of nullity, guardianship and other matters in relation to children, ownership of matrimonial property and civil liability.</P>
    <P>My administrative priorities include the further advancement in 1996 of the schemes of Civil Legal Aid and Advice and Family Mediation.  Also, further funds will be provided in 1996 for the Pilot Childcare Project, administered by Area Development Management Ltd. in consultation with my Department, and for the scheme of grants to voluntary marriage counselling organisations, which is being extended in 1996 to include the provision of grant aid to those voluntary organisations which provide counselling services for children whose parents have separated.  My Department will continue to be represented at international fora and will be participating in the EU Presidency in the latter half of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning permission, including environmental impact assessment, is required for initial afforestation where the area involved is more than 200 hectares, and for the replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species if the area involved exceeds 10 hectares. Other forestry projects are exempted development for planning purposes and do not need permission.  Where permission is required, it is of course open to the local planning authority, or An Bord Pleanála on appeal, to attach such conditions as they consider appropriate <Col N="1946" /> in the interests of residential or visual amenity.</P>
    <P>Grant-aided forestry development is also regulated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  That Department's planting guidelines include requirements in relation to minimum distances from houses and public roads.  Grant approval may be given subject to conditions or restrictions, and may be refused if it appears that the planting might have significant adverse environmental effects.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the 200 hectare threshold must be reduced substantially and I expect to be able to make an announcement about a revised threshold shortly.</P>

Identify rationalisation and improvement possibilities on this expenditure.  3. In the context of the identified expenditure requirements and aspirations, consider a comprehensive range of options for developing a fair, equitable and reasonable system of local government funding.  4. Identify the funding options which would most likely yield positive results but which require further examination.  5. As part of the study, review previous reports and studies on the financing of local authorities in Ireland and examine local government financing in comparable countries with reference to recent trends in relation to expenditure and sources of income.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The building control system rather than the planning system, is the most appropriate means of dealing with radon risks in buildings and it already contains provisions in relation to the avoidance of such risks.  These require that precautions against the entry of radon must be taken in areas where the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland indicate that elevated levels of the gas are likely to occur.  The provisions apply to the design and construction of all new buildings.  My Department is at present reviewing the building control system, including the provisions relating to radon.  The review is at an advanced stage and I expect that it will lead to the introduction later this year of revised provisions in relation to radon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, as Minister for Justice, I am responsible for a wide brief which includes all aspects of the criminal justice system and I outline my administrative and legislative priorities in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the administrative side my Department continues to be involved in efforts to consolidate and move the peace process forward in 1996, in line with the Communiqué issued by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister on 28 February 1996.</P>
      <P>My other priorities are to ensure that the Garda Síochána have the personnel and resources necessary to meet the demands placed on the force and to ensure that the necessary strategies and administrative structures are in place to enable the gardaí to tackle crime in the most effective manner.  Specific priorities in this regard are: to proceed as soon as possible with the detailed design, build and pilot implementation of systems stage of the Garda I.T. strategy, to ensure that the Garda Síochána have available to them the most advanced and efficient technologies in their fight against crime; to maximise the replacement and refurbishment levels of Garda station buildings under the Garda building programme within the parameters of available finance and to expedite the provision of a central headquarters for the Garda national drugs unit.</P>
      <P>The provision of an efficient streamlined and modern courts service is also an administrative priority to my Department. The Programme for Government &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; gave a commitment to carry out a fundamental reform of the courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 the initial steps in providing a courts service which can meet the needs <Col N="1955" /> of a modern society were taken by the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 in December of that year and by setting up a working group to report to me on the establishment of a courts commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy.  This working group is chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.</P>
    <P>In January of this year I received Government approval to appoint 15 additional judges&mdash;three Supreme Court judges; two High Court judges; seven Circuit Court judges and three District Court judges.  I have requested the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, established under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 to submit to me a list of suitable candidates for the filling of these vacancies.  I will be bringing the matter to Government as a matter of priority as soon as I receive the recommendations of the board.</P>
    <P>I understand that the working group on a courts commission are pressing ahead vigorously with their major reappraisal of the courts and any recommendations thay make to me will be given immediate consideration.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware a major priority has to be to ensure that we have a successful EU Presidency in the Third Pillar, in Justice and Home Affairs area. In this regard I have put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure a strong focus on our priorities, in particular the question of combating the scourge of drug trafficking in all member states.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prison building programme, the provision of 278 additional prison places over a period of 18 months, including 223 additional places to be provided in the current year, is one of my priorities.  In parallel with the provision of extra accommodation, I am continuing with the on-going programme of essential refurbishment, upgrading, expansion and maintenance works in the existing prisons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> The Deputy will also be aware that the Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, promised to bring forward a charter of victims of crime and to review the criminal injuries compensation scheme.  I am happy to be able to say that work on the victims charter is progressing well.</P>
    <P>The review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is under way in my Department at the moment and I expect to receive a report shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to legislation the Deputy will appreciate that I have an extensive programme of law reform under way in my Department.  While priorities can change from time to time for any one of a number of reasons the Deputy can take it that the list of legislation, relating to my Department, contained in the Government's programme, published by the Chief Whip on 17 January last, reflects my current legislative priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>My legislative priorities for 1996, at this stage, are the enactment of the Social Welfare Bill, 1996 and the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1996 which was published on 1 March, includes provisions for a disability allowance which will be administered by my Department in place of the existing disabled persons' maintenance allowance administered by the health boards, a one-parent family payment which amalgamates deserted wives' benefit and lone parents' allowance into a new uniform payment for all lone parents, a fundamental reform of unemployment assistance to make it more attractive for people to take up part-time work, an independent appeals system for supplementary welfare allowance and the availability of the social welfare tribunal at an earlier stage in trade disputes.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the various improvements in the social welfare area announced in the budget including an increase of about 3 per cent in the weekly rates of payment, an overall increase of £5 per week in the personal rate of carers' allowance, a £2 increase in the rates of child benefit, an increase of £10 in the earnings thresholds for family income supplement and for a number of other improvements in the social welfare code.  The Bill also provides for substantial concessions for employees, employers and the self-employed in relation to their PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995 provides for a number of improvements in the Pensions Act, 1990 which regulates occupational pension schemes. These improvements are being made on foot of a review of the practical effects of this Act by the pensions board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the administrative front the efficient and effective implementation of the various improvements being provided for in the Social Welfare Bill will be a priority.  The transfer from health boards to my Department of responsibility for the administration of the disabled persons' maintenance allowance <Col N="1959" /> scheme will, in particular, be a major administrative task for the Department.</P>
    <P>A major priority this year is the development of a national anti-proverty strategy.  The strategy is being prepared in a widely consultative way and the consultation process is continuing.  The feedback from the consultation process will be taken on board in the preparation of a major report for the United Nations to be completed before the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>The work of the Commission on the Family is also a priority for 1996.  The commission is required to improve understanding of issues affecting families, carry out relevant research and report to Government by mid-1997 on measures to strengthen the capacity of families in a changing environment.  A wide ranging consultation process is under way at present.</P>
    <P>Apart from implementing the improvements which have been provided for this year my Department will be continuing the payment of retrospective equal treatment payments which commenced in 1995.  The determination of the balance of arrears due to the women concerned is a major task but one of my priorities is to ensure that this work is completed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of the existing social welfare payments system is of course, inself, a huge ongoing administrative task and a fundamental priority for the Department.  In addition, it is my intention to continue the programmes of action to improve the quality of delivery of social welfare services which are being undertaken with the aim of making the system more efficient, professional and responsive to the needs of these who come in contact with it.  The successful implementation of the new integrated computer system for short-term payments, including supplementary welfare allowance, will be a major development in this regard.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in replies to recent parliamentary questions, my Department has been reviewing the existing arrangements for backdating applications for social welfare payments.  The issues involved in the review have turned out to be more difficult than was originally anticipated.  In particular, it appears that relaxation of the current legislative requirements could have significant cost implications and would have to be considered, therefore, in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>The proposals for primary legislation at present in preparation in my Department with a view to their enactment in 1996 are: Control of Horses in Urban Areas Bill; Bovine Diseases (Levies) (Amendment) Bill, 1995; Legislation to replace the Greyhound Industry Acts, 1958 and 1993.</P>
      <P>The following are the broad administrative priorities of my Department in the medium-term, which, of course, apply also in 1996.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Sectoral Goals</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To promote the growth of a vibrant, consumer-oriented and added-value food processing sector, emphasising safety and quality, and taking account of more competitive international trading conditions.  To ensure that the primary agriculture sector becomes more competitive and market oriented, having regard to changing consumer requirements and more competitive international trading conditions.  To foster sustainable and environmentally friendly development of the forestry <Col N="1963" /> sector.  To support a vibrant rural economy and the maximum number of viable farms through appropriate rural development policies, including income support for farmers.  To foster the development of environmentally friendly systems of production and processing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Operational Goals</i>
    </P>
    <P>To negotiate the optimum framework for the development of the farming, food and forestry sectors at EU and at the wider international level.  To be efficient in implementing EU and national support and development schemes, and to ensure effective controls and accountability.  To achieve the highest possible standards of food safety.  To achieve the highest possible standards of animal health and welfare. To achieve the highest possible standards of plant health.  To improve agricultural structures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Organisational Goals</i>
    </P>
    <P>To develop new management processes to ensure more effective management of the Department at all levels.  To be financially accountable in implementing the various EU and national support and development schemes and policies.  To upgrade the knowledge, skills and professional competence of staff and to improve resource utilisation and organisation structures in line with the achievement of objectives. To provide information technology support for operations, analytical and legal support for policy evaluation and development, and information systems for all levels of management.</P>
    <P>Specific actions being undertaken in 1996 for the achievement of these goals and the implementation of Government policies include: contributing to the maximum to a successful Irish Presidency of the EU in the second half of 1996; implementation of the strategic management initiative including the preparation of a statement of strategy; implementation of the Charter of Rights for Farmers; implementation and efficient operation of new arrangements <Col N="1964" /> for the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes; implementation of the various operational programmes for rural development, agriculture, food and forestry; implementation of the programme of decentralisation decided by Government last July; the continued development of the horse racing industry; and publication of a strategy for the long-term development of the forestry sector.</P>

      <P>Importers of seed potatoes and the farmers' organisation have been alerted by my Department to the outbreak of brown rot disease of potatoes in the Netherlands.  In order to minimise the risk of introduction of brown rot disease into this country, I introduced legislation last December, laying down measures to be applied for the importation of potatoes which originate in the Netherlands.  Under the legislation, mandatory advance notification of proposed imports of potatoes of Netherlands origin must be provided to my Department.  Consignments will not be released until test results of samples, taken at the time of import into this country, show that the potatoes are free from the brown rot organism.</P>
      <P>Traders have been urged to be extremely cautious in dealing with potatoes which originate in the Netherlands and to avoid such potatoes if possible. Two containers of Dutch seed potatoes were recently landed at Dublin port but were re-exported without leaving the port area.  I am not aware of any other Dutch seed potatoes imported since the control measures were introduced.</P>

    <P>The Exchequer grant, together with own resources generated by the fisheries boards, are allocated to meet expenses incurred by the boards in carrying out their responsibilities under the fisheries Acts.  These responsibilities relate to the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible to draw up a list of assets held by the fisheries board. The main categories and value of fixed and current assets held by the boards are, however, shown in the boards' latest annual report and accounts, a copy of which I will arrange to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the overall performance of the fisheries boards a fundamental overhaul of marine policy was initiated last year with a view to tapping the full potential of the marine sector.  This includes a major review of the organisational and management structure of the fishery service.</P>
    <P>This review, which is being undertaken at present by consultants, involves an examination of the institutional framework for the development and regulation of the inland fisheries, sea fisheries and aquaculture sectors and will include recommendations on measures to improve the coherence and efficiency of the delivery of public policies and services to those sectors.  The <Col N="1971" /> central and regional fisheries boards are encompassed by this review.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, following a report on the organisation and management of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, which concluded that the affairs of that board were not being managed effectively, a commission was recently appointed to carry out certain functions of the board.</P>

      <P>An explosion took place on board a vessel called <i>Schiaffino,</i> registered in the Bahamas, while dry-docked in Dublin port on 8 April 1993.  The explosion took place during the course of welding operations which were being carried out on the vessel.  Two persons were injured as a result of this accident.  The vessel was then in the course of undergoing repairs at &ldquo;Liffey Dry Docks&rdquo; (&ldquo;Liffey Dockyard and Ship Repair Ltd&rdquo;).</P>
      <P>A representative from the Departments Marine Survey Office (MSO) subsequently visited the scene of the incident.  As the accident, however, was not concerned with a maritime safety issue, as such, and as ship-repairs and dry docks accidents are properly the remit of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the incident was not pursued further by the Department. Responsibility for any follow-up action, as necessary, was passed to the Health &amp; Safety Authority (HSA) and it is understood that an investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident was in fact carried out by the Health &amp; Safety Authority (HSA).  Any queries regarding this investigation should be referred directly to that authority.</P>

      <P>Following the introduction by the Department of the Marine (DOM) of the &ldquo;Fishing Vessel (Certification of Deck Officers and Engineer Officers) Regulations 1988&rdquo; (S.I. No. 298 of 1988) (which came into force on 1 September 1989) a requirement was imposed whereby certain fishing vessels registered in the State were to be manned by duly certified Deck and Engineering Officers (i.e. be in possession of an appropriate Certificate of Competency (COC) issued under the Regulations).</P>
      <P>Those fishermen, however, initially most affected by the introduction of the Regulations were those who did not then hold formal Certificates of Competency but who were employed at that time (1 September 1989) in jobs on seagoing fishing vessels.  The Department made arrangements to cater for these experienced but uncertified fishermen whereby they could, without recourse to formal examinations, but chiefly on the basis of their experience, and subject to satisfying certain conditions relating to sea-going experience obtain &ldquo;Certificates of Service&rdquo; attesting to that experience which would be regarded as equivalent to Certificate of Competency.</P>
      <P>During the period of operation of this arrangement (which lasted upwards of three and a half years) something in excess of 400 certificates of service were issued to eligible applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arrangement under which certificates of service were issued to experienced officers was terminated and ceased to be available from 31 December 1992 and the fishing industry <Col N="1973" /> as a whole was publicly advised of this fact by way of a marine notice.</P>
    <P>It is considered therefore that ample opportunity was afforded to those officers possessing the requisite experience to avail themselves of the opportunity so provided.</P>
    <P>There are currently no proposals to re-introduce this arrangement in the future and accordingly any fisherman wishing to obtain a Certificate of Competency (COC) must apply and sit for the appropriate examination, subject to having satisfied the necessary examination entry and syllabus requirements.</P>

      <P>As I advised on 13 February last, a three year (1995-98) scientific study on the comparative distribution and migration patterns of grey and common seals in Irish waters which is currently under way.</P>
      <P>The project, which is jointly funded by the Department, BIM and the Wildlife Service, will provide key data on seal population levels and migratory patterns.  The results will enable us to quantify and assess more accurately possible impacts of seal populations on fish stocks around the Irish coast and will inform any future decisions on seal population management.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently contacting the various coastal local authorities in relation to the serious and ongoing erosion problem around our coast.  Given the limited funding available to my Department to assist with the undertaking of coastal protection works, I have requested that the local authorities be asked to consider how local communities or community employment schemes <Col N="1975" /> could be mobilised to help address the problem.  I am conscious of the fact that in many instances protection works are capital intensive and require the use of heavy plant and machinery.  However, there are circumstances where labour intensive works, such as dune management and planting, are required and these may lend themselves to community employment schemes.  In addition, the question of local voluntary supply of raw materials, such as rock or embankment material, should also be examined.  Indeed, I am aware of one particular proposal, Tawin Island, Co. Galway, where should funding become available a joint Council-Community scheme would be organised as local farmers have indicated their willingness to assist and make the necessary local materials available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should opportunities for such joint <Col N="1976" /> schemes be identified by local authorities, the Department of the Marine will, subject to engineering staff resources, continue to provide marine engineering advice to the local authorities.</P>
