Are the proposals for dealing with Item No. 20 agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the Second and remaining Stage of the Borrowing Powers of Certain Bodies Bill agreed?  Agreed.

      <P>In the context of the Turf Development Bill, the affairs of Board na Móna have deteriorated rapidly. It has been going through a fiasco for the past nine or ten weeks.  Will the Taoiseach, in an effort to bring this to an end, intervene personally to arrive at some sort of satisfactory conclusion? The Minister has refused to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are ways and means of dealing with that matter. The procedures of this House are well known.  It can be deal with by way of question or motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not dealt with there will be no point in bringing a Bill forward.  Will the Taoiseach try, over the next few weeks, to bring about a solution? Otherwise the matter will end up in the High Court, which will be unsatisfactory for everyone involved.  We on this side of the House are concerned with one thing only, that is the future <Col N="1328" /> success of an excellent State company, Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise with the Taoiseach the comments made last night by the President of Sinn Féin. Would the Taoiseach agree that the only people who have closed the door on the peace process are those who are continuing to make bombs and mortars, who murdered a member of the Garda Síochána and planted bombs in Mancheaster?  Will the Taoiseach further call on Sinn Féin this morning to use its enormous influence to ensure that the IRA, which is its own paramilitary wing, restores the ceasefire and allows the peace process to develop?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who have slammed the door on the peace process <Col N="1329" /> are those who are making bombs and mortars.  We should be clear about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should, as he did yesterday in this House, call on Sinn Féin to use its influence to have the ceasefire restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Chair does not allow it.  He allowed it last week.  It is an important matter and it is one on which politicians must be together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Things are evolving every day in the peace process and we should not allow people to get away with clogging the air waves to get their propaganda across.  They need to be responded to clearly in this House as the Taoiseach did yesterday.  We should at every opportunity be firm in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond, if I may, a Cheann Comhairle.  The reason lines of communication to Sinn Féin remain open is that Sinn Féin indicated on 20 May that it was willing to make its commitment to the six Mitchell principles absolute.  Those principles involved directly being able to give an affirmative answer to the questions the Government put to Sinn Féin, and we want to see Sinn Féin and the IRA make the commitment that they indicated on 20 May to the Mitchell principles real in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has promised on a number of occasions in this House to introduce the telecommunications Bill for the sale of one third of Telecom Éireann.  I was rather surprised last week to get a reply to a parliamentary question to the effect that the legislation to give effect to this would not be introduced until the end of 1997.  I do not know where the Taoiseach is planning to be at the end of 1997, but is he still intent on proceeding with the sale of one third of Telecom Éireann when his Government will not be here to bring in the necessary legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that there will be more lines on my face and fewer white hairs on my head, but I expect to be in the same place at the end of 1997. Regarding the question, the general scheme of that Bill has to be prepared on the basis of an agreement entered into.  Therefore, the preparation of the Bill attends the completion of that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that it is highly reckless to enter into a sale of one third of Telecom Éireann when the legislation is not promised until the end of 1997.  A deal could not be concluded. It is surely reckless to invite anyone to buy that company in those circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach &ldquo;fas-tracked&rdquo; to 1997 in relation to the telecommunications Bill.  I want to back-track to 1995 for a moment.  On 23 March 1995 the Taoiseach was asked when the employment equality Bill would be introduced, to which he replied that it would be introduced after the summer recess &mdash; that was last year's summer recess.  As we approach another summer recess, let me ask the Taoiseach when this legislation will be introduced.</P>

In light of recent events in Mountjoy Prison and the report of the <Col N="1332" /> Mountjoy Visiting Committee, which was so damning that part was not published, will the Taoiseach outline the Government's intentions to bring abour urgent reform of the prison service?</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for Health and the senior officials of the North-Eastern Health Board on the role they played in initiating a report which clearly shows the inadequacies of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, which has caused considerable problems.  I refer specifically to the section of that Act dealing with the fitness to practice committee under which a Minister is prohibited from advising a health board or the employing authority that they, the fitness to practice committee, should have suspended a medical practitioner.  Will the Taoiseach, as a matter of urgency, bring forward amending legislation to ensure that what happened in the North-Eastern Health Board area will not happen elsewhere?  Will the Taoiseach initiate an inquiry into the Medical Council's role in this case?</P>

He fought for democracy in his country and was imprisoned and torturned several times during his political life.  He was one of those responsible for re-establishing democracy in Greece after the dictatorial regime of the colonels and worked for its integration in the European Union.  In that regard he was a partner for Ireland in many respects.  I had the pleasure of serving with him as a member of the European Council until his recent resignation from office.

Democracy is now firmly established in that country thanks to the contribution made by him.  He also contributed to the European Council, the building of Europe and the parties of European socialism.

As the fourth oldest democracy in Europe, as the Taoiseach reminded us last week at the IBEC dinner, perhaps at times we take democracy for granted.  Andreas Papandreou re-established democracy in Greece and for that deserves all our support and praise.  Democracy may have its inadequacies which we are sometimes keen to point out but it is by far the best form of government and system of administration.  Anyone who plays the part he played in seeking to re-establish democracy certainly deserves the support of all constitutional democrats.  His premature death is a major below to his party and country and it is right and fitting that we should pay tribute to him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Before an authorised officer enters any dwelling house under subsection (1), he or she shall obtain the consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) of any owner or occupier of the dwelling house.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> I acknowledge the underlying principle of consent and the case made in support of Deputy Brennan's amendment on Committee Stage.  Consequently, I undertook to examine the possibility of drafting an amendment for Report Stage which would take account of the principle of consent.  It should be noted that the right to refuse consent was always implicit in this section in its original form, which provided that where an authorised officer was refused entry to any land, the Minister of Board would have to apply to a judge of a District Court for a warrant to authorise such entry, having satisfied the judge that entry was necessary.  Such provisions continue to remain part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The central point of my amendment is to make explicit the principle of consent in response to points made by Deputies on Committee Stage regarding the special position of a person's dwelling. I pointed out that the amendment as proposed by Deputy Brennan would not be acceptable as it would deprive the board of CIE of any power to enter a dwelling if the person who normally resided at that house refused permission for such entry.  An individual, who need not be the owner of the property, could simply refuse entry and the development would be unable to proceed.  To allow such a situation to develop would create the potential to permanently frustrate the project as there would be no remedy for the board in such an instance.</P>
    <P>Clearly, provision must be made for those occasions which may arise when entry to a house or houses would be necessary if the project is to make progress. This may be necessary, for example, to survey a house prior to selecting a route which runs close to that house.  I cannot accept an amendment which forbids entry to any house under any circumstances when such entry could be critical to the progress of the project.</P>
    <P>While the proposed amendment from Deputy Brennan is unsuitable for the reasons I outlined, I am satisfied that my amendment achieves the objectives <Col N="1341" /> of making explicit the need for consent in support of the rights of the owner or occupier while ensuring adequate rights of entry for authorised officers for the purpose of the Act.  I go a long way toward taking the point made by Deputy Brennan but I must balance it by ensuring that if entry to a house or houses is essential for progress, there is a reasonable procedure in place for ensuring it is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment and thank her for taking on board the spirit of what I was trying to do in my amendment.  I ask the Minister to expand on the part of the amendment which states that consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. How will that work in practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is self-explanatory.  If there was a really good reason to refuse entry to an officer of the board, that is a case that could subsequently come out in the District Court and the judge could consider the matter.  If there was a good reason which outweighed the urgent need for progress on the light rail or access to the house to ensure progress, the judge would be in a position to take that into account.  However, I suggest that it would need to be a very good reason before consent would not be granted if the case could be made that entry into that dwelling was essential to the progress of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. The Minister has gone a long way to meeting the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  The point was that the authorised officer should first and foremost receive the consent of an owner or occupier of a dwelling house because the Constitution protects a person's home.  It was very important to assert the rights of the individual citizen as against those of the board, as it seemed to have been in the original provisions of the legislation.  The assertion that an authorised officer shall obtain consent is very positive.  It is natural that <Col N="1342" /> such consent should not be unreasonably withheld, but the authorised officer must now obtain consent and if that is not forthcoming the courts can resolve the matter.  I welcome that and thank the Minister for tabling the amendment.</P>

It should not be assumed from the fact that the Minister introduced an amendment in response to Deputy Brennan's strong and cogent argument on that issue the Government is showing anything approaching flexibility in relation to this legislation; the reverse is the case.  This scheme is going through, no matter what.  We are getting an ill thought out, ill considered and inadequate response to Dublin's traffic problems, solely because there is Euromoney sloshing around in the bucket which must be used.  Nobody listening to this debate or reading the report afterwards should think other than that a bad scheme is being bulldozed through. This scheme will at the end of the day come back to haunt those responsible for the errors being made now and covered up.</P>

It was felt that the Bill as it was, without this amendment, implied <Col N="1343" /> that consent would be necessary, but to put it beyond doubt, because of the very well articulated points that were made on all sides in relation to this matter, I have brought forward this amendment which makes it explicit that consent is needed.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall devise and lay before Dáil Éireann a programme for the construction of a light railway serving the city of Dublin and surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall include in the programme under subsection (1) proposals for the construction of the following light railway lines:</P>
      <P>(a)  from Sandyford to Dublin city centre,</P>
      <P>(b)  from Ballymun to Dublin city centre,</P>
      <P>(c)  from Tallaght to Dublin city centre,</P>
      <P>(d)  any other route within Dublin city and its surrounding area that the Minister deems appropriate.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister shall include in the programme under subsection (1) proposals for the construction of a railway line linking Dublin airport to the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> (4) The Minister shall not exercise his or her powers under section 9 until the provisions of this section have been complied with.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to rehash our debate on Committee Stage, although the opportunity provides itself, but while I thanked the Minister earlier for bringing forward the amendment and I was genuinely pleased to see it, the heart of this Bill is about consultation and routes and what will happen in the city centre. The other matters are ordinary matters of civil liberties which we should deal with and watch out for in all legislation because they can be easily eroded in an attempt to get a project through.</P>
    <P>My amendment calls on the Minister to bring in a programme for the construction of a light railway which will serve the city of Dublin and the surrounding areas.  I have asked the Minister to include proposals for the construction of particular lines in that programme.  I do not seek to set down the precise routes of these lines &mdash; obviously that would be an engineering and technical matter following consultation with communities &mdash; but the termini of those lines.  I seek to include in the legislation proposals for the construction of the following light railway lines: from Sandyford to Dublin city centre, from Ballymun to Dublin city centre, from Tallaght to Dublin city centre and any other route within Dublin city and its surrounding areas that the Minister deems appropriate.  I have also asked that the legislation include proposals for the construction of a railway line &mdash; not necessarily a light railway line &mdash; which would link Dublin Airport to the city centre.  That is something that a modern city needs.  That is the kernel of amendment No. 3.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument that this is enabling legislation permitting the Minister to build lines up and down the sides of the Wicklow mountains or anywhere he wishes.  That is not what the legislation should be about.  It should not enable any Minister at any stage to build lines wherever he <Col N="1345" /> or she wishes.  We are talking about well known lines which were announced in Dublin Castle on 12 December with the aid of videos and all types of public relations personnel.  We are arguing about the city centre and the Kilmainham-Mount Brown area.  If this is enabling legislation, a Minister who may come from a different part of the country such as Limerick city, Letterkenny or Galway city might decide since he has a light rail Bill he might as well issue an order.  While I appreciate that Dublin is included in the title of the Bill, it does not state the Minister shall only issue a light railway order for Dublin, he may issue a light railway order for anywhere he or she wishes.  Given that the whole country has been told of the approximate location of the lines, and given that the Minister did not inform the House of an EU study which is taking place to see which of the three lines is the most suitable, it is disingenuous of the Government to come to the House and to the committee, as it did in the past few days, and pretend no lines have been decided, that it is all still being considered and that this is purely enabling legislation.  To say that is to pretend that the announcement of 12 December in Dublin Castle did not take place and that all the Luas public relations officers were not opened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that is to suggest all the announcements from the Government and the dozens of parliamentary questions to which I have got replies informing me of the suggested routes, did not happen.  The Minister cannot come here and say no routes have been decided, nothing has been happening and the lines can be built anywhere as this is purely enabling legislation.  I am arguing that at least the three routes announced by the Government should be in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 18 specifically asks the Government to bring forward <Col N="1346" /> a detailed plan to integrate the proposed light railway with the DART, Arrow and the mainline railway systems. There is no proposal to integrate the three systems.  My amendment also suggests that no light railway order shall come into operation until the Minister has laid before the Dáil a plan showing how the three systems can be integrated. That is eminently reasonable and most citizens of Dublin would wish that to happen.</P>
    <P>The second part of amendment No. 18 &mdash; subsection (5) &mdash; which deals with costings was dealt with on Committee Stage.  It is eminently sensible that before the Minister signs the light railway order he shall publish and lay before the Dáil costings for alternative methods of construction and operation of the city centre section of the proposed light railway within the functional area of Dublin Corporation.  I asked the Minister on Committee Stage &mdash; and I ask now &mdash; that the costings for the city centre underground proposal be available before we can be happy about the decision to take it overground.</P>
    <P>I have noticed a change in the Government's position &mdash; an underground line was out of the question until Committee Stage.  The Minister is on record at Committee Stage as saying that short sections could go underground &mdash; I accept it is only being considered. This was not possible a month ago for all sorts of technical reasons, costs, etc.  If it is to go underground that would amount to much of the cost and if the line returns overground in a V-shape that seems like a waste of money. If it is meant to go underground it should go some of the way.</P>
    <P>My three amendments, which are critical, seek to put the termini into the Bill, to extend the line to Sandyford taking in Dundrum and to do something for Dublin Airport; to integrate the three systems and to publish the costings of the city centre underground suggestions before light railway orders are signed for the rest of the city.</P>

      <P>It is important that these amendments are discussed.  On the publication of these proposals I was astonished to discover, after it was stated there would be a line from Dundrum to the city centre, that the purpose of the Bill, which is to reduce the level of motor vehicle traffic into the city centre and to speed up people's access to the city centre, would not be fully achieved if the terminus for that line was to be either in Dundrum village or, as now proposed, in Balally opposite the Crazy Prices shopping centre.  I generally support the concept of light rail.  I am pleased this Bill and this issue is before the House.  The reopening of the Harcourt Street line has been discussed for many years.  It is an old chestnut that has been floating around in south Dublin for 20 years or more.  At successive elections my colleague, Deputy Brennan, kept on reopening the Harcourt Street line.</P>

      <P>He has to be congratulated on a number of ghost openings.  It was reopened in so many election pamphlets that I expected one night on returning from a meeting in my constituency at midnight to see a ghostlike train travelling through the line and hopping across roads that no longer have bridges.  The proposal we are dealing with is an important one.  If this system is put in place it is completely inappropriate, if not total insanity, to put a terminus in the middle of a suburban built-up area which is already congested, at a location that cannot provide the parking facilities needed for people using the system, even with the new road plans promised for this area which I presume will be implemented in tandem with the light rail system being put in place.  The terminus for the particular part of the line should be in the Sandyford industrial estate.  Everybody who lives in the south Dublin area and who works in the Dundrum-Sandyford area would be of the view that the Sandyford <Col N="1348" /> industrial estate is the correct location for the terminus.</P>
      <P>I am informed it will cost an extra £15 million to bring the line from Balally to Sandyford.  I do not know if that costing is accurate but if that money is not spent at the time the line is being constructed and is left until some later date we will be told that the costs for such an extension have doubled or trebled.  If it is not done, suburban housing estates adjacent to the line will become basically day time long-term car parks for motor vehicles from the adjacent areas of Stepaside, Kilgobbin, Ballinteer and Mount Merrion.  There will be huge problems in suburban housing estates adjacent to the proposed terminus, apart from the traffic gridlock which will inevitably develop in the Dundrum-Balally area caused by people using the system. It could well be that the impossibility of providing the so-called park-and-ride facility at the common terminus location will, to some extent, defeat the purpose of the proposal. Some people will decide it is not worth a candle to drive that far and try to park their cars and will simply continue to drive to the city centre.  As I have been telling the Minister and CIÉ for some time, it is insanity to proceed with this proposal without extending it to the Sandyford Industrial Estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December it was announced that the Government had made certain decisions in principle, namely, that the two lines, which could most easily be constructed based on current infrastructure, would proceed and that the third line from Ballymun, which is equally desirable, would form part of a larger plan.  Promises were made to my constituents that this line would be reopened.  I poked fun at my colleague, Deputy Brennan, in regard to the Harcourt Street line.  I do not want to have to tell my constituents that the promise I made in good faith about the proposal being implemented in December will not be fulfilled.  It is regrettable that some Opposition parties tried to sabotage that by calling a vote in the House.  It is also regrettable that when <Col N="1349" /> these announcements were made we were not told the European Commission had requested an overall review of the proposal.  That unnecessary oversight should not have happened.  I hope this will not mean the line from Sandyford to the city centre will not proceed because I do not take kindly to being put in the position of conveying information to my constituents without being told the full story by the Minister, particularly on a matter with which I have been involved for many years.  I hope the European Commission review will not result in an about-face and that we are not told in six or eight months' time that the line from Sandyford to the city centre will not be given priority.  I want a reassurance from the Government on this issue because it concerns thousands of people in south Dublin who experience motorised gridlock on a daily basis trying to get in and out of the city centre.  Traffic congestion has a catastrophic impact on Dundrum village. Retailers find it difficult to operate businesses and thousands of people who live in the Sandyford, Dundrum and Balally areas are affected.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but I am dealing specifically with amendment No. 3 which seeks to ensure, by way of statutory provision, that the line will run from Sandyford to the city centre.  I want reassurances on this matter because I am not happy with the manner in which it has been dealt with to date.  However, I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the need to integrate the system.  I also find it difficult to understand why, when CIÉ is effectively being given responsibility for this project, greater thought was not given to integrating the light rail with existing rail systems operated by CIÉ.  It is important that the two lines announced by the Minister on 12 <Col N="1350" /> December are put in place, but it is also important that they are cost effective. We must provide an integrated and coordinated system and in that regard I hope the possibility of linking the light rail with other rail systems is examined in the current consultations.  CIÉ proposes to provide a bus service to link people in outlying areas with the two light rail systems that will proceed following the enactment of this Bill.  That should form part of the public framework document so that the necessary advance planning can be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that it is not possible within the financial framework to put any portion of the route underground. Like other Members, I noted with interest the statement that this matter is being considered further.  If it was cost effective and possible, it would make sense to put parts of the line underground, particularly in the city centre.  However, if it would cost millions of pounds &mdash; which we do not have and the EU cannot provide &mdash; to do so, the line should proceed as envisaged because, ultimately, it will succeed.  If it was financially feasible, it would be preferable to build a portion of the line in the city centre underground to further alleviate traffic congestion problems in the city.  It is surprising that research on this matter is being carried out only now.  I understood such research had been carried out previously and that putting sections of the line underground had been ruled out. Will the Minister clarify that?</P>

If we were all to do as Deputy Shatter did, we would not be able to deal with any more amendments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a Whip to attend meetings to be offered anything. I was not even offered the facility of being able to table an amendment on Committee Stage because of the undemocratic system that prevails in this House on such matters.</P>
      <P>The welcome I extended to the Minister's minor concession and amendment earlier does not take from my opposition to the way the Government has steamrolled the Bill through the House. I oppose Government policy on this issue, mainly because of the lack of consultation with local people and because the scheme as envisaged is ill considered. This amendment which deals specifically with the routes involved is important but I would go further because there is a strong belief among communities along the proposed routes that, while we debate various aspects of the Bill, the real decisions are being made behind closed doors in Heuston Station by the design team, that while we are being assured, even at meetings with the Minister, that serious consideration will be given to alternative routes proposed by local residents, consultation will end as soon as this legislation is passed and the routes preferred by CIE will be rammed through.  I hope that is not the case, but it is a strong concern among local people. Given their experience with the Luas people up to now, they have strong grounds for those concerns.  I hope commitments given to Members from Dublin Central, who met the Minister and technical advisers in the past week, in relation to alternative routes at Arran Quay Terrace and Mount Brown will be honoured and that we were not being misled in an effort to speed through the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this amendment and I share <Col N="1352" /> the view that what is required in the city centre in the long-term is an underground system.  Like other Members, I have not seen detailed and up to date costings nor do I believe they exist.  I do not believe the undergound alternative was ever seriously considered or that it is being considered at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not want to make a Second Stage speech, I would like to make a number of points about Deputy Brennan's amendments, which I and my party fully support.  The reason we support these amendments is that they go to the heart of the controversy over the Luas project.  I am glad my colleague, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is in the Chamber because I was going to refer to her in her absence.  She said on radio the other day that those who voted against the Bill on Second Stage were anti-Dublin.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This legislation and the proposal from CIE is anti-Dublin.</P>
      <P>I noted Deputy Shatter covered his behind, if I may put it that way, by saying he was dissatisfied with and unhappy about certain things.  He found some things insane and others difficult to understand but nonetheless he will support this Bill.  He can vote for insanity if he likes. However, I would say to Fine Gael and Labour Deputies who support this proposition that when the damage is done they alone will be responsible for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan'a amendment will not be accepted, despite the fact that a better system is available and should be put in place, a view which I believe is privately shared by most Dublin Deputies who are closest to this issue and who would say in private that this is a most deficient scheme.  However, the Government and the Minister, who hails from County Tipperary, are committed to it.  The Minister will not be responsible nor will he meet constituents who in five years' time will say they were shortchanged and that this is a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pro a public rail system for Dublin and opening the Harcourt Street line.  I am also pro a line for Tallaght <Col N="1353" /> and a line for Ballymun, which would connect with the airport.  I am definitely pro Deputy Brennan's amendment, which would integrate this system with the rail system, so the Broadstone line, the Arrow Service, the DART, the Harcourt Street line, a line to Dublin airport, other lines and the Phoenix Park tunnel could be used on a single integrated basis to get people around the city.</P>
    <P>The unified proposal people, a group of amateurs, have done us a service by going to people like the Mitsui Corporation in Japan to ask it to price an alternative. Those people deserve our thanks and credit for finding out that it is possible to tunnel under Dublin at a comparatively economic cost of £13 million per kilometre on a turnkey basis.  Of course, the unified proposal would cost more, that is £400 million.  The immediate response will be to ask who are the Progressive Democrats, who are always talking about cutting back public spending, to say that they favour a more expensive option.</P>
    <P>I do not know how precisely the unified porposal could be best financed but if it costs more to get something which is worthwhile, we should go ahead and plan it over five years.  We should not be mesmerised by an available tranche of Euro money which we will use to do a bad or a half thought out job, thus creating more problems.  That is why I support what Deputy Brennan said. While I am completely committed to rail and public transport in Dublin, this proposal is misconceived and will effectively abort the chances of this city every getting what it really needs.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there has been adequate consultation and that all these points should have been made earlier. Why did a few amateurs &mdash; in the sense that they are not being paid &mdash; in county councils outside Dublin Corporation have to go to a Japanese corporation to get costings for a decent alternative to this system?  The reason is that CIE has been handed this task by the Government because of sheer intellectual laziness. CIE has come up with a stand <Col N="1354" /> alone scheme but there is no reason it should be the sole operator of this scheme.  Even if it was retained to be the project managers of the scheme, I see no reason it should operate the system once it is established.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Shatter's misgivings about the park and ride notion at the termini at Tallaght and Dundrum. However, he will not do anything about those misgivings and he will go back to his constituents and say it is not his problem.  The user rates predicted for the Luas scheme are grossly exaggerated. Given that it is a partial scheme which will only go to certain places, and looking at the experience in a city like Sheffield, it is clear Luas will be of no benefit to the majority of Dubliners. The proposal based on particular traffic flow numbers is most unconvincing.  So too are the finances worked out on that basis.  The notion that a lot of people will travel to Dundrum from places like Rathfarnham, park their cars and travel by tram to the city centre is misconceived. That will not happen.  In any event, the experience of Sheffield shows that those who plan these schemes greatly exaggerate the number of people who will use them and they forget that there are competing means of transport in the city.  We will have a similar result to that in Sheffield.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of a rail-based public transport system for Dublin.  It would have been possible, with decent planning, to have had a system which would have been placed underground &mdash; I still believe it is possible.  If developments like that at Jervis Street in the city centre had been integrated into an underground station and if any effect had been made to plan this project properly rather than in this slapdash, crass and superficial way, we could have had something dramatically different. If this Government expects congratulations for doing a bad job, it will not get them from me.  If Fine Gael Deputies come into the House and accuse those who have pointed out the deficiencies in this scheme of being anti-Dublin, they will be missing the point. <Col N="1355" /> These same Deputies should go back to their constituents and say that even though they know there is a lot in the scheme, certain portions of it are difficult to understand, some provisions are insane and unacceptable, that they gave out to the Minister for breaking promises about what would or would not happen in the Sandyford Industrial Estate and that they stoop up for the people's interests, they trooped like lambs throught the lobby to give Dublin what it does not deserve, a bad, inadequate scheme that is under-funded, ill thought out and more likely to increase the problems of traffic in Dublin city centre than otherwise.</P>
    <P>It emerged yesterday during Committee Stage that a great proportion of central road corridors in the city centre will be dedicated to the exclusive use of the DART system.  Some commentators, including Frank McDonald in <i>The Irish Times,</i> whose views I like in many respects and whose courage on some planning issues I admire greatly, say that what is bad for the car is good for Dublin, but that is a very foolish point of view.  We need a system that works for the benefit of the vast majority of Dublin people, a system which, with the Arrow system, can be used by those in Huntstown and Mulhuddard to get to Dundrum.  We need an integrated system, but we are getting an inadequate system.</P>
    <P>If it takes ten or 12 years to put together a worthwhile system it would be much better than spending three or four years devising a system which the city does not need, an expensive toy train set that will damage the city rather than improve it and will make it more ugly than it is at present, leaving the 90 per cent of those who will not live on the Luas corridors more frustrated and angry.  For those reasons I support the amendments.  The House should take this opportunity to turn down a scheme whereby the Government is trampling over everybody and proceeding with a CIE agenda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> People have said that Opposition Deputies are negative.  I organised a seminar in the Institute of Engineers at which views on this matter were canvassed very late in the day but in a very stimulating debate.  It occurred to me then that, instead of engaging in propaganda and giving huge sums of money to Bill O'Herlihy and associates to send videos to Xtra-Vision shops, if this matter had been thought out three or six months ago, if there had been decent discussion of the alternatives and of the unified proposal, if the Mitsui Corporation had been brought in by the State to tender for this project, there would have been a very different result. Instead we have a ministerial agenda. The meeting I referred to was told by a representative of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce that the Minister made it clear that the system would be above ground, it would cost £220 million and there would be two routes; there would be no change from that position.  The Minister, Deputy Lowry, was quoted at that meeting in front of Luas representatives as having outlined those three certainties.</P>
    <P>There has been no consultation process. The planning inquiry is a sham.  It is a sham to try to put a gloss of democracy over what is in effect a <i>fait accompli.</i> I very strongly object to that.  I also object to being told I am anti-Dublin for saying it is a sham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I listen to the discussion on this matter the more I wish we had had a full scale debate on the Dublin Transportation Initiative. Many matters have been raised in terms of a comprehensive transport policy for Dublin which would have been more usefully debated at an earlier stage so that we could have sorted them out and Deputies could have been informed of them earlier.  There was broad representation, including by local authorities, on the DTI and it is against that background we are debating this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three elements in this amendment: the routes chosen, integration of the transport system and <Col N="1357" /> operation of the system in inner city areas.  In terms of routes, I could never understand why two routes were chosen on the south side and one on the north side.  I cannot understand why Dublin Airport, with a throughput of more than eight million tourists last year, was not considered a priority for a public transport system, light rail or underground. The Ballymun line is the subject of a 12 weeks study by Oscar Faber.  I wait in anticipation the results of that study and, considering the terms of reference, I expect there will be a recommendation that the Ballymun route be included as one of the two priority routes.</P>
    <P>It is essential that there will be an integrated system, that the three methods of rail transport, namely, the DART, the Arrow and the mainline rail system, with Dublin Bus, are co-ordinated in terms of Dublin transport policy. The board of CIE has included that in the light rail proposals there will be a provision for linking subsequently with other elements of transportation which will allow for expansion of the system. I hope, even though it is not specified, consideration is given to linking and expanding the system when funding becomes available at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On the inner city element, alternative means of transport through the inner city should be explored.  I referred to the North King Street route on the north side, which would link automatically with Broadstone.  That would add to the opportunities for integration in years to come and there would be a natural linkup to Finglas, Cabra, Ballymun and the airport.  Inner city lines should be planned in such a way that people's homes are not demolished and businesses ruined.  That is a necessary condition. It was also a condition of European funding that employment is created.  I hope that alternative routes are actively considered by the board of CIE to prevent damage to the areas involved.</P>
    <P>These elements are part of the broad issue of a comprehensive Dublin public transportation system and I hope, even if the Minister does not accept the <Col N="1358" /> amendments, that they will be taken on board by CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment on the amendments put forward.  The approach taken by some Opposition Deputies in the debates on the development of the Luas has been, in part, anti-Dublin. Deputies are unwilling to acknowledge the benefits light rail will bring to Dublin and to its suburbs.  In the past the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil have said consistently they support light rail, yet in the debates on this Bill, including the debate this morning, they have exaggerated the difficulties and have not recognised the consultation that has taken place over a long period through the DTI initiative.  Many members of both those parties took part in that consultation process during which local authorities and others were consulted on developing the plan for Dublin.</P>
      <P>Light rail has an important role in managing future traffic in Dublin which does not lie in the unfettered use of cars. I accept it will not be easy for people to give up using their cars and they will not do so until a good alternative is provided in the form of fast, efficient, reliable public transport.  Such systems operate effectively in cities around the world.</P>
      <P>In my constituency the development of the Sandyford to Dublin city centre line is extremely important but that alone will not solve Dublin's traffic problems.  Those of us who meet constituents and residents' associations are aware that the key issue with which they are concerned is traffic and its associated problems including parking and the gridlock that occurs every morning in Dublin.  The building of the Sandyford to Dublin city centre line will encourage people to leave their cars at home.  All of us must become involved in a type of educational process in terms of moving away from the overuse of cars to an efficient public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Bill has not been <Col N="1359" /> balanced and it has not recognised the consultation process that has taken place and which is ongoing.  I accept Deputy Gregory's point that we cannot simply have a consultation process without any follow up but that will not happen. A public inquiry is to be held and an environment impact study will be carried out, both of which will provide opportunities for ongoing consultation. Everybody involved in this process must welcome ongoing consultation, be sensitive to the concerns of residents and make people aware of any possible environmental change, even simple matters such as cutting down hedges at the back of people's houses or making various changes to buildings.  It is extremely important such changes are carefully handled.  The corporate culture in CIE must recognise that and must be extremely careful in consulting people in regard to any possible changes.</P>
    <P>The experience in my area &mdash; and I accept it is different from others &mdash; is that residents' groups have been consulted. They have found an umbrella group and have had an input to the consultation process as a result of which changes they sought were made, although they are demanding further changes.  I am aware that in other areas some of the difficulties are more complex.</P>
    <P>Some of the points made in the debate so far are extremely important. This is a democratic forum and we must allow for a high quality debate.  I do not suggest Deputies should not make their points but some Members have not given sufficient recognition to the fact that we have had 20 years to tackle Dublin's traffic problems We now have a plan supported by the European Union and that must be recognised as an important step forward.  There will be problems outstanding in relation to integration with other services and whether it is possible to build part of the system underground if sufficient moneys are available.  That should be considered but many studies have been carried out in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> There are financial limitations to what can be done although I would ask the Minister to comment again on that. Is more money likely to be made available to build part of this project underground? I understood there were certain parameters in that regard and this plan matches the funds currently available in the most appropriate way.  There are financial limitations to what any Government can do but we must move forward at as fast a pace as possible to solve these problems.  We must recognise also that this plan will not solve all Dublin's traffic problems but that there is potential for building additional lines. That has been done in other countries and we can do the same.</P>
    <P>What timescale does the Government envisage for the development of a third line and for other developments?  We must regard this as a project that will develop over a period but it should be acknowledged that this is a good start. Problems will arise and questions will need to be answered in relation to adequate consultation which must be ongoing.  Consultation should also be monitored and we must have feedback from it.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that major infrastructural changes in Dublin will not be made without some difficuties arising. There will be traffic disruption in certain areas regardless of whether the system is built over or underground.  Shop-keepers and residents will be inconvenienced but that is the price we must pay if we want to tackle Dublin's traffic problems and begin to take positive action in that regard.  We must prepare people for those changes by encouraging them to become involved in the consultation process, the public inquiry and the environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes made in the Bill to date.  This is a worthwhile initiative. It is the end of a long period of consultation but this is the first time a plan has been put on the table with money available to tackle the traffic problems in Dublin.  Other cities are using light <Col N="1361" /> rail effectively although I note the Sheffield experience has been frequently referred to by Deputies.  Particular circumstances applied in Sheffield and we cannot draw lessons from that example. Lessons can be learned, however, from other cities where light rail has worked more effectively.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity to begin to tackle Dublin's traffic problems and that should be acknowledged.  We must be absolutely certain the consultation currently taking place will continue after the Bill is passed.  The Minister should do everything possible to ensure that the quality of the consultation is high, that it is monitored and that it is consistent in the coming weeks and months.  This is a long-term project involving major infrastructural changes but overall it is in the interests of Dublin that light rail is supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will direct my first comments to the amendments and then respond to the other points raised by Deputies.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 18 propose that a programme for the integrated development of the public transport infrastructure in Dublin, including an evaluation of the different options, be brought before the Dáil.  Such a plan already exists and is contained in the Dublin Transport Initiative which has been accepted by two Government as the basis on which to develop our transport infrastructure.  We have spent many millions of pounds and many years exploring different options and developing a strategy.  We now have the blueprint and the opportunity to implement its core recommendations.  A fair point was made by Deputy Costello. He said that the Houses did not discuss the DTI.  If that is the case, it should have been discussed.  I am relying on the Deputy's powers of recall in this instance because I am not sure whether it was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a unique opportunity to benefit from experience abroad and provide Dublin with a modern and permanent state of the art transport system which will also support our economic <Col N="1362" /> development, job creation and urban renewal strategies.  The proposed amendment refers specifically to light rail lines linking the city centre with Sandyford, Ballymun and Tallaght.  This Government is committed to the construction of the full core light rail network, that is, the three lines to Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght.  The Minister said as much last December and much play has been made on his comments.  It is as if his proposals were cast in tablets of stone.  Deputies ask what is the point of consultation when decision have already been made about the route.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not relate to an underground to Holyhead.  The Deputy said that we could end up running light rails to Kerry and over the Wicklow mountains, in addition to other colourful prospects.  I refer the Deputy to the definition section of the Bill.  The Dublin light rail proposal is confined to the three local authority functional areas in Dublin so there is no question of it applying, at the whim of a future Minister, to God knows where else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the definition section lest he is concerned about the activities of future Ministers for Transport, Energy and Communications. The Minister has consistently stated that no final decisions on routes will be taken until the public consultation process has been completed, a public inquiry held on EU approval procedures finalised.  A vital element of the consultation process being carried out at present is that it gives individuals and organisations the opportunity to raise the issue of preferred routes and alternative routes and have their views considered.</P>
      <P>The amendments also make reference to the construction of a railway line linking Dublin Airport with the city centre.  On Committee Stage the Deputy made it clear that it could be a heavy rail line or a light rail line.  This highlights the fact that there are more issues to be considered with regard to a connection to Dublin Airport.  If the option chosen is heavy rail it is not relevant to this Bill.  On the other hand, it would be unfortunate to postpone the development of the necessary core light rail lines while other issues were being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme to be implemented in the immediate future is more clearly specified in the operational programme for transport.  We are committed to the introduction of two of the three core lines by the year 2000.  We are committed to developing the integration of <Col N="1364" /> public transport and to the development of suburban rail.  Deputy Fitzgerald asked when the third line would come on stream.  The first two lines are due to be completed by the year 2000 and it is the Minister's intention that the third line will follow immediately.  It will probably take about two years to complete.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a tragedy to delay and effectively jeopardise the light railway project while new plans are <Col N="1365" /> debated and other options are re-examined. At some point we must decide to act and the time is now.  We have spent long enough looking at possibilities and considering options.  We must make progress towards achieving the key elements of an agreed overall strategy. The LRT is of immense importance to Dublin and we can play a constructive role in achieving the best for the people of Dublin.  For those reasons I cannot accept the two amendments.</P>
      <P>I will respond to the other points that arose during the debate.  The DTI final report, which was the product of more than four years of detailed analysis and extensive consultation, recommended against an extensive underground option for the city centre.  It concluded that the underground option was not viable in economic terms and would have a large negative rate of return.  It also concluded that the distance between the city centre and the western new towns was too short to permit the economic operation of an underground system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody suggested such a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The DTI found that a comprehensive light rail netework could be put in place at far lower cost than the underground option.  It concluded that a light rail network represented a sound investment in cost benefit terms and could provide a better overall response to the wider DTI objectives of shifting commuters from cars to public transport and of increasing priority on the road network for public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just take over the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The on-street light rail system is, therefore, the option favoured by the DTI.  It is a lower cost solution compared to the underground option and will provide a better economic return.  Underground stations are very expensive and less accessible to mobility impaired people.  Light rail will be more <Col N="1366" /> accessible on street than underground. More stops will be possible on street allowing a greater degree of flexibility of service for customers, shop owners and businesses and a greater number of stop locations along routes.</P>
      <P>CIE and its consultants, Semele, are looking at the option of short sections of underground, costing its economic implications and its general viability. There are still major difficulties with short sections underground but, at the request of the Minister, they are looking at that opinion and the report is expected in July.  That report will be published.</P>
      <P>I have covered the points raised by Deputy Shatter.  This is enabling legislation. We are not naming specific routes.  The Deputy said that the sum of £15 million required to extend the line to Sandyford was small in the context of the overall amount available.  Forceful and cogent arguments have been put forward in favoiur of the Sandyford option as distinct from the Dundrum one.  I will ensure that the points made during the debate are brought to the attention of those who will make the final decisions.  The same arguments can be put forward for extending the other routes.  However, we are limited in what we can do by the funding available, £220 million, and we must get the best possible return for it in terms of overall traffic management and accessibility to Dublin city centre.  The sum of £15 million required to solve the Sandyford problem might be small in the context of the overall amount available but the cumulative cost of the many small but highly desirable extensions would be very high.</P>

      <P>This Government, and the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, agreed on the policy framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the points made about integration and the need for every assurance possible to be given that the light rail system will be part of an integrated Dublin transport system.  As I understand it, that is the brief of the DTO.  In the interests of ensuring proper traffic management and access to <Col N="1368" /> Dublin city centre in the future, we should pursue vigorously the proposal for integration.  Governments will have to ensure that sufficient funds are made available to complete the integration programme.  The DTI has proposed an integrated transport system including DART, the light rail system, Arrow, etc. and the brief of the DTO is to ensure this is achieved.  We do not disagree on this point, which is fundamental to the proper management of traffic in Dublin city and the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Oscar Faber report.  The EU asked the Government to carry out further work on the Tallaght-Dundrum and Tallaght-Ballymun options as part of the application process, and the Government has requested Oscar Faber, through CIE, to do this.  It is looking at the socio-economic aspects in particular and will report in mid-August.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct what I said.  We did not go through CIE but employed Oscar Faber directly.  I cannot give the Deputies an assurance on the timetable for construction until we see the Oscar Faber recommendations on the final routes.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept these amendments as this is enabling legislation.  None of the routes proposed in the amendments are precluded by it, but we are not including any specific routes at this stage.  I have indicated how these routes will be chosen and how the decisions will be made in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is of much concern to Dublin Deputies but any <Col N="1369" /> change in the transport system in this city also affects people outside the county.  Any improvements in the traffic arrangements in Dublin will be very much welcomed by the thousands of Wicklow people who travel to Dublin to work, to attend school or to carry on business.  Every day people travelling from Wexford or Wicklow to Dublin get caught in the traffic jam at Loughlinstown. People with businesses in Wicklow and Wexford incur considerable transport costs and they would welcome any improvement in the traffic flow in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and understand the desire of many Deputies to see the light rail system extended to various parts of their constituencies but it will not solve all the traffic problems in Dublin.  The members of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council must give consideration to other forms of transport which would bring great relief to people who regularly visit Dublin.</P>
      <P>The new edition of the Yellow Pages contains 1,350 pages of advertisements by businesses.  Many of the advertisements indicate just how big commercial activity is in Dublin.  These companies provide services throughout the country and the transport facilities must be improved if they are to do their business properly.  Many people use their cars to travel to Dublin and when they get here they would like to be able to park them happy in the knowledge that they will not receive parking tickets or have them towed away.  I know a man who accompanied his brother to the Eye and Ear Hospital and when they were ready to drive home they discovered their car had been taken.  The patient, who had patches over both eyes, had to stand in the rain while his brother tried to find the car.  Many people from the country do not know where to park in Dublin. They do not enjoy the same concession as Deputies who can park their cars in the grounds of Leinster House all day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal more can be done to solve the traffic problems in Dublin city and county.  When I was Minister for the <Col N="1370" /> Environment it was proposed to build a ring road around Dublin but this seems to have got struck on the south side. People living on the south side of the city who wish to travel to the airport, Cavan or Donegal find it almost impossible to get beyond Loughlinstown or White's Cross.  It is almost impossible to get from Loughlinstown, White's Cross or that general area over to the west. Many motorists use a little laneway at the side of the Grange Golf Club, which has been there for centuries.  I fully understand the difficulties of people travelling from the Tallaght area to the Sandyford Industrial Estate in the mornings, coping with the enormous volumes of traffic at the Tallaght roundabout. The problems encountered by people outside the city are enormous, just as they are for those within the city boundary.  Bus lanes were created many years ago to allow the travellers reach the city centre without delay but has anybody ever seen a bus lane without a car or cars parked on it?  Illegal parking in bus lanes exacerbates overall traffic problems.  Local authorities should be involved in preventing it.  There is need for greater parking facilities on the perimeters of the city, to allow motorists benefit from the light rail transport into the city centre.  Many business people hate having to drive their cars into the city centre.  While the new electronic boards indicating parking spaces around the city are of enormous help, more often than not they indicate that most car parks are full.  In addition, anybody unfamiliar with the layout of the city centre will not know where car parks are located.  There is enormous need to accommodate motorists who have to travel into the city centre.</P>

      <P>I, and a few other Members from beyond the city, intervened in this debate to highlight the <Col N="1371" /> problems our constituents encounter on arriving in the city.</P>
      <P>It is my fervent hope that this light rail transport system will relieve some of the city's traffic congestion but it will not resolve its daily traffic chaos on which a broader debate is warranted so that Members could investigate all alternatives. One concrete proposal would be to extend the DART to Greystones, so that many more cars would be taken off the roads and people transported to light rail stations or terminals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I make that point because it would appear that we in Wicklow have been forgotten.  I was merely highlighting the volume of business and commence by no means exclusive to the citizens of Dublin city or county.  To that extent I am glad a light rail system is to be constructed in Dublin, representing a small contribution only to the overall traffic congestion of the city which affects everybody moving through it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will press these amendments but am anxious to deal with others as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the assertion that we on this side of the House are anti-Dublin. Over the years I fought for many changes in this city, as did other Members.  We are not against the principle of light rail but against this disastrous Bill, which contains no provision for consultation or integration and does not specify routes.  The Minister told the country he has routes.  He applied to Brussels for funding for specific routes and then informed this House that routes have not yet been decided. Neither has the Bill any provision for a proper public inquiry system, with the exception of a purely bureaucratic, legalisatic one, or any provision for costings. It does not inform us as to what is proposed for the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> I firmly reject the assertion that anybody who does not go along with this Bill somehow does not have Dublin's interests at heart.  It is precisely because we have Dublin's interests at heart we will not go along with this disastrous Bill.</P>
    <P>During my term in office it did not cost me a thought to tell consultants or task forces to get lost, which I did on many occasions.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  The preceding and present Governments said the suggestions of the Dublin Transport Initiative group were fine in principle but that we must get down to the detail, before going to Europe.  It is when one gets down to that detail a Minister has to step in and call a half to the DTI proposal. To expect us all to follow that through in detail is quite foolish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am for the principle of light rail.  A light rail system could be constructed on the old Harcourt Street line, another line to Ballymun and yet another to Tallaght.  One can produce the costings for its installation in the city centre, show how the various systems can be integrated, established consultative councils to determine its routes but none of that is being done.  Merely because Members generally are in favour of the principle of light rail, the suggestion that they must be in favour of its every little detail is not acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to tackle the Oscar Faber report.  Deputy Molloy asked the Minister at a committee meeting the other day if it would mean dropping the Dundrum line.  The Minister of State responded:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are talking about the same money there will have to be changes. If they recommend Ballymun and not <Col N="1373" /> somewhere else, it must be borne in mind that we have only a certain amount of money to spend and, if the Ballymun option is included...</P>
    <P>The suggestion is quite clear.  The Minister of State told us this morning that the socio-economic term of reference has now been inserted into the EU study.  The EU will in a couple of months reject the proposals for Dundrum and Sandyford and based on socio-economic studies will support construction of a line to Ballymun.</P>
    <P>The Minister or Minister of State cannot have it both ways.  The Minister says he wants to follow the DTI proposal but proposes only to cherry-pick parts of it and to go underground for short sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision has not been taken to go underground for short sections; let us be factual, no such proposal has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Government is considering going underground for short sections.  The DTI did not recommend that.  The point I want to bring home here is that, when it suits, the Government picks parts of the DTI proposal but not others.  This means the DTI report is not the liferaft to which it should cling when putting this Bill through the House.  The Government has quite clearly shown that parts of it are of interest but others are not.</P>
      <P>My three amendments call on the Government to name the routes, to stipulate the costings for the underground portion and draw up an integrated system before signing any light rail orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> As the Minister said, the DTI gave us a blueprint unless, of course, it cannot be a blueprint because the EU says we must carry out a study of the proposal. Are we following the recommendations of the EU on which line should be constructed? A document that was supposed to be sacrosanct, described as a blueprint, is suddenly no longer such because the Oscar Faber report must be considered.  No longer is the report of the DTI such a great document.  We will be told the EU study supersedes it since it will pay the money and we must do what it dictates.  What in God's name was the Minister doing in Dublin Castle on 12 December last?  I clearly remember seeing reports on television and radio and reading them in newspapers when he specifically said the Government would proceed with two lines first, followed by one to Ballymun.  He told us nothing then about the EU study.  That information was not given until Members here dragged it from him, yet the whole project is back in the melting pot.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a disaster for Dublin.  We must construct a sensible light rail system, any underground protion being costed to enable us ascertain whether it can be afforded.  It must be an integrated system following proper consultation with local communities such as those in Kilmainham.  This Bill is a disaster. I make no apologies for voting against every one of its provisions.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 27 to 30 and substitute the following;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(e) a detailed analysis and costing of the main alternatives studied and the detailed reasons for choosing <Col N="1377" /> the proposed alternative, taking into account the environmental effects, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) (e) of the Bill provides for an outline of the main alternatives, if any, studied and an indication of the main reasons for choosing the proposed alternative, taking into account the environmental effects.  My amendment takes that a step further, provides for a detailed analysis and costing of the main alternatives studied and detailed reasons for choosing the proposed alternatives, taking into account the environmental effects.  This could be done by way of appendix to the environmental impact statement or as part of it when the studies exist.  It is simply an attempt to ensure openness and real consultation.</P>
    <P>The background to this proposal is frustration on the part of community groups who have met Luas representatives to suggest alternative routes.  I want to ensure that those alternatives are being seriously looked at because of the perception that up to now community groups and their proposals have not been taken seriously.  One way of ensuring they are taken seriously is to publish the studies of the alternative routes.  Such routes, which would constitute minor alterations in the whole scheme, have been suggested by two communities.  I wish to make the point as strongly as possible that I fail to understand why Luas cannot give those communities a definite response until the middle of July when the legislation has been passed.  There is a great deal of concern in those communities that even where there are meetings between public representatives and the Minister, and between Luas and the local communities, their proposals are not being taken seriously and the consultations are nothing more than a charade, an attempt to see this legislation through the House, and then to proceed with the original route.  The environmental impact statement will contain only an outline of the main alternatives and an indication of the main reasons for <Col N="1378" /> choosing the proposed alternative.  That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>If a route is to be chosen we, the community and their representatives, are entitled to know the reason.  Any participation the community has had in the process has come from them and was not invited by Luas, the Government or anybody who is trying to push through the scheme.</P>
    <P>This is one of a number of amendments I have tabled in response to specific requests from the local community. This amendment relates specifically to the submission from the Arran Quay Terrace community and I know it has the support of the communities in Kilmainham and Mount Brown.  They are very concerned that their proposals, which do not involve the demolition of houses and the disruption of business, are not being taken seriously.  There is no evidence other than verbal commitments, which up to now have proved to be useless, that they are being taken seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Gregory's amendments Nos. 5 and 6. His is a very sensible suggestion and I encourage the Minister of State to take it on board.  Assuming alternative costings, studies and routes, all of which information should be available to CIE, Deputy Gregory is asking that they be taken into account and published.  If we are to construct a major transport system for Dublin, what could be more logical and sensible than to publish the studies that have taken place?  I strongly support what Deputy Gregory wants to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been putting a straight question to the Minister during the past two days to which I have not got an answer. I am disappointed the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, could not be present to take Report Stage of what is perhaps the single most important transport Bill.  I may not be correct but since the Minister came to office I believe this is the only legislation that has come <Col N="1379" /> from his Department.  Given that, it would not be too much to expect him to be present to reply today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an aside and I am not taking from the Minister of State's competence or right to be here. I have no quibble with that.  My quibble is with the absence of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. The reason I am annoyed by the Minister's absence is that during his Second Stage speech on the second Bill he told the Dáil it would cost £65 million per two kilometres to go underground in Dublin city centre.  Where did he get that figure?  That works out at £60 million per mile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat anything I said earlier.  I agree with Deputy Seamus Brennan that what Deputy Gregory is asking for is reasonableness itself and no reasonable person could refuse it.  It is about time we had some token genuflection in the direction of substantial consultation on this matter, giving people who are interested real access to the facts.  I agree fully with Deputy Brennan's remark that it is a pity the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is not present to bear the burden of getting the legislation through the House, especially since he could find the time to come and vote.  As things stand Deputy Bhamjee and he have had about an equivalent input to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Deputy's concern and his desire that the maximum level of information be made available to the public.  I thank Deputy Gregory and the other Deputies who have remained in the House for their ongoing interest and commitment to the issue.  I fear, however, there is a danger that we are confusing many different elements of the approval procedure <Col N="1380" /> with these amendments.  It is being proposed that all options be evaluated under all criteria at each step.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about is the environmental impact assessment.  A two step procedure has been introduced to planning requirements by EU regulations. The developer is obliged to prepare an environmental impact statement and active public involvement in the assessment of EIS is actively encouraged. That has been fully provided for in this case and the section as drafted already includes a requirement that where appropriate an outline of the main alternatives &mdash; if there are any, and there will be &mdash; should be included along with an indication of the main reasons for choosing the proposed alternative, taking into account environmental effects.  The final clause reminds us that we are dealing with the environment and the requirements of the section seek to ensure that an adequate statement of impact on the environment is prepared.  It is essential that the environmental impacts of the proposed alignment be fully and clearly stated so that a decision can ultimately be taken which takes into account the effects that the development would have on the environment.  In doing so it is reasonable to outline from an environmental perspective what other options were considered and why they were not chosen.  It is not reasonable to expect the EIS to set out a detailed analysis and costings of the main alternative study.  The form of words being used here is identical to that used for other major developments where an EIS is required.  It is very similar to other major capital construction projects such as motorways and so on.</P>

      <P>They did detailed costings for the DART going underground because the same debate arose at that stage.  The tunnelling aspect would be similar even though the rail cars may be different.  On the basis of those costings it concluded that an underground DART network would not be economical. The total cost of such a system in the city centre alone was estimated at £600 million.</P>

      <P>That is from where the figure of £65 million for two kilometres came.  Some very good points were made on Committee Stage yesterday. The issue of trespass was discussed.  I will not develop the point but draw the attention of the House to amendment No. 14a which I hope will meet the concerns of Deputies on all sides.  It is an important amendment.  Concern was expressed about the ability of the inspector to ensure that all necessary material will be available to him at the public inquiry.  I indicated my belief that he would be in a position to ensure that adequate material would be available to him but accepted Deputies' strong views that in particular instances there might be difficulties and his legal powers should be strengthened.</P>
      <P>That is the purpose of this extensive amendment.  It will increase somewhat the bureaucratic nature of the Bill against which we have all spoken but the balance of advantage lies in ensuring that the inspector will be able to compel the production of documents and the attendance of witnesses at the public inquiry.  The amendment provides for the payment of expenses where witnesses are compelled to attend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to do so but I have not done most of the talking even though the contributions have been very interesting.  I will clarify that matter in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 15 there was a very interesting discussion yesterday about the public inquiry and equity of access.  I promised to examine the provisions in the Department of the Environment dealing with public inquiries, including motorway inquiries.  The amendment is limited and I do not pretend it will meet the requirements identified whereby all groups and individuals not in a position to fund themselves will be funded in taking on the technical strength of the State at the public inquiry.  Under its minimal provisions the Minister will be able to direct the board to refund after the inquiry any costs incurred by groups which encounter particular difficulties.</P>
      <P>Those are three points on which I said I would come back to the House.  I hope I have strengthened the Bill with these amendments.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister of <Col N="1384" /> State has not answered the reasonable question posed by my amendment which states that any studies undertaken should be published and made available either as an appendix to or as part of the EIS.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that serious consideration will be given to the various alternatives put forward by residents groups.  This will not happen.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that residents groups will have legal and technical representation at the public inquiry on a par with that of the Luas representatives. As a concession, the Minister of State said that if they are granted representation they can look for the money after the event.  That will not work.  It would be impossible to avail of the expertise of professional and technical people on the basis they might get paid after the inquiry has taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the report referred to by the Deputy is the European Commission's report on <Col N="1387" />&ldquo;The Economic and Financial Situation in Ireland in the Transition to European Monetary Union&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the section on &ldquo;Unemployment Trends&rdquo;, the report notes that, in all EU member states, certain groups such as discouraged workers and involuntary part-time workers are not counted as unemployed.  It suggests that the unemployment statistics do not, on their own, show the full scale of the challenge posed by unemployment.  However, the report states that this is a feature of the statistics of all member states and is in no way peculiar to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The definitions of employment and unemployment are complex, affected in recent years by changes in the labour market.  These changes include technical and social progress; greater participation by women in the workplace; more part-time and casual work; and a highly developed social welfare system. Questions such as underemployment of part-time workers, discouragement and potential supply of labour are also important to a complete evaluation of the labour market.</P>
      <P>The labour force survey reports, in addition to giving the standard measures of employment and unemployment, provide a considerable amount of detail on these additional categories of persons.</P>
      <P>I am aware of just one recently published article by an Irish economist, which claims the labour force survey overstates the level of employment and correspondingly understates the number unemployed.  In the article, the author assumes it was a simple matter for persons to misclassify themselves as employed.  I do not agree with this assumption, since it would involve erroneous reporting in the whole range of questions dealing with employment. The Central Statistics Office has contacted the economist in question to inform him of this issue.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister of State that neither Alan McQuaid of Bloxham Stockbrokers nor the EU <Col N="1388" /> Commission agree with the CSO's contention that the labour force survey is the only objective measure of employment and unemployment.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the EU Commission in its report on The Economic and Financial Situation in Ireland in the Transition to European Monetary Union is of the view that the underlying extent of unemployment is not adequately measured by the official unemployment statistics.  Is the Minister of State happy as we move forward to use figures based on labour force surveys, based on what the EU Commission and Bloxham Stockbrokers have said recently?  They are asking whether this is the correct barometer to use for planning and in respect of unemployment figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the EU report I do not accept that the figures give a misleading impression or are inaccurate.  The comments in the EU report on the ILO classification apply equally to all member states, so it does not reflect particularly on Ireland.  The groups highlighted &mdash; part-time under employed workers and discouraged workers &mdash; are relatively small in the context of the overall labour force.  As employment and unemployment is a complicated issue a variety of figures need to be looked at for the various groupings within and outside the labour force.  The necessary figures are those given by the labour force survey.</P>
      <P>We do not intend to move away from the internationally recognised standards for compiling employment figures. However, the CSO is examining the most efficient and effective way in which quarterly multi-purpose house-hold survey might be introduced in mid-1997.  Plans have been prepared for the necessary development work to be carried out and the CSO is attempting to minimise the additional resources required and to dovetail the new quarterly survey with other EU statistical requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the argument put forward about the validity of the assertions by <Col N="1389" /> Mr. McQuaid, the reference to the views of the economist in question is not accepted by the Government or the Central Statistics Office.  The article repeats verbatim the points made in the CSO press statement about the gap between the live register and the labour force survey statistics.  In the article Mr. McQuaid also argues strongly in favour of a quarterly labour force survey and we agree with that.  However, Mr. McQuaid also advances a rather weak argument suggesting that the labour force survey over estimates the true level of employment in the economy. He bases this on an assumption that in the survey &ldquo;there could well be situations where individuals want to maintain a level of self esteem and claim to have a job when, in fact, they do not&rdquo;. This he says would seem to apply to men mainly over the age of 45.  The CSO considers this line of argument to be simplistic and without foundation.</P>
    <P>An official of the CSO telephoned Mr. McQuaid early last week about the article in question and pointed out that to misrepresent their situation in the manner suggested by Mr. McQuaid, respondents would have to give incorrect replies not only to the question about their usual employment but to several other questions about the nature of their employment.  One is not simply talking about one question as to whether one is employed or unemployed. There would be misrepresentation across a range of questions relating to the supposed employment if somebody made a misdeclaration.  During the telephone conversation with the CSO official, Mr. McQuaid did not dispute the CSOs point view on this matter.  Mr. McQuaid went on to say: &ldquo;At a guess I would say that the real level of unemployment in the economy is somewhere between 225,000 and 240,000&rdquo;.  These figures are literally taken from thin air.  There is nothing to support them.  They depend on Mr. McQuaid's argument about employment being over stated and the figures are not based on any official survey or any administrative data.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for giving me so much detail including that of telephone calls.  I am not privy to the phone calls but I am privy to the document by Alan McQuaid of Bloxham Stockbrokers.  He claims the discrepancy between the labour force survey and the live register is high.  The Minister of State attempted to give the CSO answer to Mr. McQuaid's contention that the labour force survey overestimates the level of employment and underestimates the level of unemployment. Irrespective of whether he is correct, he analyses the matter in a fair manner.  If the CSO believes he is wrong, it should publish a document outlining its arguments on the matter. He believes the level of unemployment lies somewhere between the two figures.</P>
      <P>For many years labour force surveys have recorded far more people in employment than the official State statistics.  We cannot have it both ways. The CSO believes that the black economy does not operate here.  The Minister of State claims the labour force surveys are correct.  If that is the case why are they not recorded in official statistics? In my experience, people are usually not willing to give accurate information about their employment status unless they know it is not a social welfare or tax official carrying out the survey. If the black economy does not operate here, the labour force figures should be similar to official statistics &mdash; there should certainly not be such a major difference between them.  If Mr. McQuaid of Bloxham Stockbrokers is wrong, the CSO is obliged to release figures and state its side of the argument. In the absence of detailed figures, will the Minister of State accept that this Government, more than any other in recent years, has tried to use the labour force survey to put a favourable gloss on the continuing high level of unemployment which has deteriorated since the Government took office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the black economy does not operate here.  I gave specific details of direct and indirect gauges and measurements last week.  I stated that the number operating in the black economy was not as high as people assumed, but I did not deny that one does not exist.  I indicated there has always been some difficulty in accurately gauging the level at which it operates, but the indications are that it is relatively low.</P>
      <P>In regard to the validity of the unemployment figures, I stated on many occasions that the labour force survey has been accepted as the internationally recognised accurate gauge of unemployment and employment figures.  That scientific survey gauges employment and unemployment across a range of activities and, from the point of view of synchronising with our EU partners, it is the accepted gauge.  To remove any possible distortions or anomalies and to erase doubts about its validity, we are committed to introducing a quarterly labour force survey and all the necessary administrative procedures are being put in place to do so.  I indicated in my reply that we are moving in that direction.  The CSO is refining its activities and we hope to have the machinery in place to carry out an accurate quarterly labour force survey as and from the first quarter of next year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of people's concerns about the lack of progress in initiating projects under this funding?  The ceasefire was announced in August 1994 but there has been a distinct lack of progress on projects on this side of the Border.  The Minister of State said that ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency are responsible for the allocation of this funding.  Why was it necessary to establish two additional agencies when a multiplicity of agencies already operate in the Border area?  The Minister of State said he does not have responsibility for the allocation of these funds.  Will he interest himself in the matter and ensure the funding is spent on worthwhile projects?  The people along the Border want improved infra-structure to attract investment to the area.  In Strabane an advance factory is being built with similar funding.  We want advance factories, improved roads and sophisticated telecommunications. Will the Minister interest himself in how the £18.7 million is being spent and ensure it attracts investment to the <Col N="1393" /> region?  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that people have not got the investment they expected in the area since the ceasefire.</P>

The major part of the peace programme is being implemented by intermediary bodies with whom the European Commission finalised agreements last December. The Combat Poverty Agency and ADM opened an office in Monaghan last March, projects are coming on stream and funding is being allocated as quickly as possible.  The people administering the fund told me that the original projects were of poor quality but that they have improved in recent times.  I am anxious that most of the £20 million will be committed by the end of the year. We will fulfil the obligations we inherited from Deputy O'Hanlon's Government, which set the parameters.</P>

I do not believe, however, that it would be the best or most efficient use of Question Time to simply repeat or summarise <Col N="1396" /> every utterance I make outside this House.</P>
      <P>However, in my speech I congratulated and thanked the members of IBEC for the enormous contribution that employers, within the framework of social partnership, have made to the prosperity of this country.  This prosperity is a function of many things, not least of which has been the success of our national programmes.</P>
      <P>I pointed to the challenges that faced Ireland when social partnership in its current form was introduced in 1987 and to the fruits that the consensus approach has borne, both in an economic and social sense.</P>
      <P>I highlighted the importance of Ireland's democratic tradition under the rule of law.  It is a matter of legitimate pride that we are the fourth oldest continuing democracy in Europe, and this tradition should not be compromised for any reason.  I referred to our commitment to a democratic and peaceful resolution to the problems in Northern Ireland and looked forward to the economic benefits that would flow from such a solution for all parts of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from what he stated in his address at the IBEC dinner last week on the ending of the term of the presidency of that organisation, does the Taoiseach subscribe to the principles it lays down, that is, that low taxes are more favourable to growth, if it is to be sustained in the long-term? The Taoiseach has not said anything about that in a number of speeches.  Will he agree that the policies devised and the foundations laid over the next five to seven years will be important?  IBEC has consistently called for a policy of lower taxes which will lead to long-term growth not now but over the next five to seven years.  Will the Taoiseach give his view since he did not mention it at the dinner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we get good value for taxation; people should see that the money they pay in taxation is being well used and that <Col N="1397" /> they, or those for whom they are responsible, are getting a return. Obviously, a policy of lower taxes in the absence of increased buoyancy in tax revenue means a policy of lower public spending.  There are inherent difficulties in reducing public spending given the commitments involved in terms of pay, rates of social welfare and levels of service. It is important that those who seek lower taxes have a clear idea on how services are to be reduced to enable it to happen or, alternatively, how revenue is to be made more buoyant without any reduction in the rate of taxation.  What I have said is platitudinous; it is so true, it barely needs to be said.  However, it is an important point in answer to, any suggestions that it is possible to lower taxes without taking difficult decisions on spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument would be true except for the fact that with increased growth, there is stronger buoyancy and a stronger tax take but we are still maintaining the same Exchequer borrowing requirement we had when we had low growth.  Do I take it from what the Taoiseach said that he believes the yield of increased growth, buoyancy and revenue should be spent? That is the only conclusion I can reach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The record shows that there have been significant reductions in taxation in recent budgets, particularly at the lower end of the income scale. There have been increases in the exemption limit and allowances and the standard rate band has been widened. Those on low incomes are exempt from social insurance.  There has been a reduction in the burden of taxation.  I recognise there is a demand for further reductions in taxation and a suggestion that certain taxes should be set aside. That can be done in two ways, one of which is through increased revenue buoyancy.  As a result of exceptional growth in the economy one is enabled to maintain the level of revenue without a reduction in spending.  In the last two to <Col N="1398" /> three years there has been exceptional economic growth which means we have been able to have reductions in taxation without reductions in spending.  That rate of growth, however, will not necessarily continue forever and in the event that growth rates decrease, reductions in taxation would have to be offset by reductions in public spending.  While it is very easy to call for reductions in public spending in the abstract &mdash; such requests slip quite readily off the tongue of many commentators, political and otherwise &mdash; it is not so easy or acceptable to make those reductions in practice in regard to individual programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with the Taoiseach, but since it is Question Time I can only ask questions. What the Taoiseach states is a contradiction because the Government is putting in place spending programmes at a time of high growth when it should be reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  When the present growth diminishes there will have to be spending cuts.  The Taoiseach is not following his own logic.  There have been no rate reductions for a number of years &mdash; the widening of bands and exemption limits in this year's budget were marginal.  Has the Taoiseach abandoned the concept that lower taxes are more favourable to growth than increases in public spending? Will he continue to put programmes in place that will create difficulties down the road for the economy, as he has been doing successfully for the last 18 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  The Government has put in place programmes of expenditure in areas of genuine social need, which have been supported in every case by the Opposition.  I am not aware of any programme of expenditure, for example, in regard to the long-term unemployed, the extension of the local employment service or any other area, that has been opposed by the Opposition.  Without being specific, the Deputy is calling for reductions in spending in general and <Col N="1399" /> asking that spending programmes not be put in place.  If he reflects on the last question that was dealt with, there were calls from a member of his party for an extension of the type and category of expenditure under the Border areas programme to include advance factories.</P>

      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that the Opposition opposes the annual spending of £10 million on programme managers and advisers, which is certainly excessive.  Will the Taoiseach accept that at a time when the economy is growing what is required is controlled spending?  The underlying increase in spending this year over last year is 6 per cent, four times the rate of inflation, but if spending had been controlled we would have had £280 million which could have been applied to tax reform. That would have allowed us either to reduce the higher rate of tax by 8 percentage points or the standard rate by 4 percentage points.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central theme of the strategic management report, Delivering Better Government, is the provision of excellent quality services to the customers of the Civil Service at all levels.  This is based on the devolution of authority and accountability to the most appropriate level, supported by legislative change, human resource management change, new financial management systems and better use of information technology.  The appropriate arrangements for devolving authority and accountability in respect of constitutional and independent office holders such as the Director of Public Prosecutions will be considered in the context of the forthcoming legislation to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 and the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995.  The Government has already announced its intention to table an amendment to the latter Bill which would allow for the compellability of the Director to attend before a committee to answer questions on statistical and general policy issues arising from the annual reports which it is envisaged he will henceforth publish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, in common with other Departments and offices, has already embarked on a strategic management initiative process.  An initial assessment report of the structures, procedures and resources of the office has been carried out by Grant <Col N="1406" /> Thornton Consulting Limited.  In addition, the Department of Finance is carrying out a review of the structures and organisation of the office, which is nearing completion.  These studies will form the basis for long-term strategic decisions regarding the most effective and efficient organisation of the Office.</P>
    <P>The DPP's office was involved in the staff briefings accompanying the launch of Delivering Better Government on 2 May.  I am arranging to send the Deputy the tailored leaflet prepared in respect of the office of the DPP which was circulated to staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  I am interested to hear there is a special report dealing with the response of the DPPs office to the strategic management initiative.  I ask the Minister of State to place that in the Oireachtas Library so that Deputies interested in reform of the DPP's office can have sight of it.  The Minister of State said the purpose of the strategic management initiative is to ensure there is open and transparent delivery of services to our citizens from all the organs of State. Will she agree it is essential that our State prosecution service is included in this new culture of openness and, to that end, will she confirm that an annual report on the DPP's office will be published and laid before the Oireachtas for debate?  On the status of the SMI's ongoing investigation in relation to the DPP's office, is the Director of Public Prosecutions willing to appear before a Dáil committee, not to discuss particular cases &mdash; that would be unacceptable &mdash; but in regard to the functions of his office?  Has the Minister of State had any correspondence on this matter from the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point, I personally have not had any correspondence but I will inquire whether more senior officeholders than I have received correspondence.  It is not my function to be involved directly with the DPP on that matter.  It is envisaged that <Col N="1407" /> the DPP's office will produce an annual report.  When it is published it will be in the public domain and can be debated either by a committee of the House or the House proper, as it sees fit.  We are amending the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions attend before a committee of the House to answer questions on statistical and general policy issues arising from his annual report.  I envisage that any aspect that would not compromise the independence of the Director's position could be discussed by a committee of the House.  All organisational aspects of the DPP's office can be discussed but prosecutorial and other specific issues would not be within the ambit of any committee or group of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to improving accessibility to the DPP's office and the prosecution service generally for members of the public, particularly victims of crime who are currently excluded from the entire prosecution process, will the Minister of State indicate whether it has been considered in the course of the examination of the DPP's office that a victim liaison service should be available, as is the case in Britain, to keep victims informed of criminal prosecutions as they go through the various delays and difficulties that can arise?  Is the Minister of State aware there is a victim liaison officer attached to the Crown Prosecution Service in Britain, in addition to a Freefone number for members of the public who have an interest in a particular case and who want to be kept informed of developments in a particular matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any specific proposals for a victim liaison service but much work is being done in relation to the DPP's office.  Apart from the initial assessment by Grant Thornton Consulting Limited, to which I referred in my reply, the Department <Col N="1408" /> of Finance is engaged in a study which will conclude by the end of July.  The work is completed but the conclusions are currently being cross-checked with the Department of Justice and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  An O and M study of the Chief State Solicitor's office being carried out by Deloitte and Touche is expected to be completed by September.  That is of relevance in the context of the ongoing debate on a unified prosecution service.  In the months ahead a great deal of information will be published in relation to the prosecution service generally and perhaps we will then have a fuller debate on all these issues in a more structured way. I do not have any specific information before me in relation to a victim liaison service but I will inquire for the Deputy whether such a proposal is contained in any of the reports to which I referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for a comprehensive reply.  I am delighted some progress has been made in this matter.  Other Departments which have been part of the strategic management initiative have indicated they will issue a statement of strategy later this year in response to proposals for better Government.  Will the office of the DPP, like other Departments, present a strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual report will be equivalent to a statement of strategy. Many Departments are using this vehicle to publish their statements of strategy.  There are many issues involved but time does not allow us to discuss them in sufficient depth.  One of the critical aspects of the SMI, for example, is the devolution of authority from a Minister to senior management. The office of the DPP is independent and, while we seek devolution of authority, it must be considered in a separate context.  It will happen to the extent that it will not compromise the independence of the office of the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An element of the studies being carried out at present is concerned with coming to conclusions as to exactly what <Col N="1409" /> strategic management will mean with regard to the office of the DPP.  What greater accountability and transparency can we have?  There is no doubt that we need more, but to what extent can one go without compromising the independence of the DPP or the process of fair prosecutions?  There is room for accountability about the criteria on which prosecutions are taken.  If the national airwaves can be used to discuss such matters, this House should be entitled at least to the equivalent, although probably in a more structured way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the chairman of the Competition Authority on 11 June 1996.  Our meeting was an informal, cordial and private one.  We discussed the draft Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, especially concerns which had been raised by a number of senior counsel about the workings of the Bill.  I discussed the detailed legal advice available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters were also raised in the Dáil and, at that time, I dealt comprehensively with them.  Essentially, the matters raised concern the proposed new criminal provisions.  The House should note that the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994 had been cleared by the Attorney General after careful consideration and additional legal advices on the concerns that had been raised were also received.  A considerable amount of time was spent by <Col N="1411" /> the Attorney General and myself in reviewing and addressing these matters.</P>
    <P>I previously informed the House of the following important advices received from the Attorney General's Office: that no authority could be found for the proposition that where an individual set of events gives rise to both civil and criminal liability, the civil claim falls to be determined on the same standard of proof as the criminal claim; that it is important to distinguish on the one hand between matters which are factually complex and which may involve uncertainties in practice and on the other hand the creation of an offence which is vague in its own terms.</P>
    <P>These views are legally sound and robust.  My views are supported by the views of eminent lawyers in regard to the efficacy of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the chairman of the Competition Authority disagrees with the Minister's views on the efficacy of the Competition (Amendment) Bill.  The Minister said that eminent lawyers are in favour of what he has done. However, many eminent lawyers at an open symposium offered the view that this Bill is most unwise and cannot be implemented.  If I were to bet on the matter I would be inclined to bet with the person who is running the authority because he knows his business as he has been running it for some years.  The Minister said the meeting was cordial. Did he persuade the chairman that he was right and the chairman was wrong?</P>

It is significant that the chairman gave the interview before the Report Stage debate, in the course of which I introduced amendments to make the enforcement powers more effective. They also dealt comprehensively with some of the concerns that had been expressed by some lawyers.  I was able <Col N="1412" /> to inform the chairman of considerable legal advices of which he was not aware at the time of the interview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the Deputies are referring to Oldfields and Co. (Ireland) Ltd. <Col N="1413" /> and Fitzwilliam Rating Consultants (Ireland) Ltd.  The activities of these companies should properly be considered in the context of contracts entered into by business for the supply of a service.  They are therefore governed by the law of contract.</P>
    <P>Business organisations constantly argue for less involvement by Government in the affairs of business.  Accordingly, I do not believe that they would welcome my involvement in the detailed discussion and negotiation leading to the finalisation of the multitude of agreements entered into by business on a daily basis.  There is also the practicality of State involvement, including the allocation of resources, in this area.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the losses suffered by individual companies and I consider this an appropriate time to place on record the need for companies to exercise due caution when approached in such instances.  This is clearly a case for <i>caveat emptor</i> on the part of the business community.</P>
    <P>If business people believe they have been the subject of fraud, they should pursue the matter with the Garda Síochána. The Law Reform Commission and the Government advisory committee on fraud have highlighted the need for improvement in the relevant legislation and I understand that the Minister for Justice will be bringing a Bill to Government later this year in line with their recommendations.  In the meantime additional staff resources, including a professional accountant, have been assigned to the recently established Garda national bureau of fraud investigation. Perhaps it would be instructive to put on the record of the House the following summary of the report of the advisory committee on fraud:</P>
    <P>Fraud is by its nature, a peculiarly secretive crime.  This is sometimes compounded by an unwillingness on the part of victims of fraud to report the matter to the Garda Síochána. Institutions which are defrauded may, with a view to their interest which we <Col N="1414" /> feel is misguided and purely shortterm, feel it is better to suffer a loss in silence than to invite public attention to a failure of security, with a perceived risk not merely of embarrassment but also of loss of investor confidence and added encouragement to other fraudsters.</P>
    <P>From what I have already said, it is clear that I do not regard this as a company law matter.  Consequently, I do not intend to make any amendments to company law to regulate activities of such companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from his reply that the Minister is not interested in dealing with this issue through company law.  Some of these companies are proffering an illusion of rates remission and vast sums of gold from Europe. Coincidentally, this morning I received documentation from and spoke on the phone to a person who was approached by the firm referred to in a report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  This firm promised the person to whom I spoke that it would open the doors to Europe and secure vast sums of gold if he paid it money.  There is a loophole in company law.  The company brought to my attention this morning and Oatfields operated in the UK where they also hoodwinked gullible people.  However, they decided there were fresh fields in Ireland which could be tapped and set up here.  The Minister of State should not try to tell me there is not a phoenix-like syndrome where firms close and rise again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The question at issue is not a phoenix-like syndrome or my lack of interest in the company law aspect. <Col N="1415" /> Rather I am saying that in my considered judgment it is not a matter proper to company law but arguably a matter proper to criminal law.  I said that, similar to the legislation in place in other jurisdictions, the Minister for Justice will introduce a Bill on all the different aspects of deception and dishonesty to Government by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>People in business should beware of such firms and have enough wit to examine any promises of gold from Europe.  Conmen who offer a service on these terms are suspect and the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i> applies.  I am satisfied from discussions with the Minister for Justice that the Bill she will bring forward will provide adequate protection, if that is not there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The adage <i>caveat emptor</i> sounds grand but the brochure advertising access to EU moneys has been put together professionally and contains all the relevant wording, symbols, addresses and telephone numbers. A person presented with this brochure by a smart salesman would think there was something in it for him.  It is easy for us to pontificate about how one should not be fooled into going down that path but a small business person hard pressed for money and burdened with bureaucracy could fall for this scam.  Given the complexity of life and the level of bureaucracy, people are grateful for any help they receive in securing grants, etc.  People should be extremely cautious about plans and ideas put to them by a company which is not known to be reputable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the second company to which the Deputy referred is no longer trading and that the first company did not break any law. There was a standard contract for the service they offered and, in so far as the fraud squad can establish, there was no breach of law involved.  It is a matter of prudent caution by small businesses.  If the rumours about another company <Col N="1416" /> offering gold from Europe are correct people ought to be warned to keep their eyes opened.  Gold from Europe does not arrive that easily and the Government has taken good care to produce information and make it available to small companies and others.  For example, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Mitchell, recently produced an elaborate publication in terms of the comprehensive nature of its information.  That is a more reliable source of information than promises of gold from Europe.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with priority questions and it is very disappointing that the Minister does not want to give his views on this issue.  There is no point in putting down questions if the Minister will not give his views on fundamental matters which affect his Department.  Ministers devise policies and too much of this Government's time has been taken up considering reports, many of which are shelved.  The Minister will not give me his views on VAT rates and I cannot ask about a report which has not been published &mdash; I know he will not tell me anyway &mdash; but perhaps I could inquire when it will be published. Will the Minister say whether it remains Government policy, as enunciated by the Minister for Finance, to provide a State printing press?</P>

The Deputy inquired when the report will be published. I will be bringing it to Government at the earliest opportunity &mdash; I am very keen to have it published &mdash; and expect it will be within weeks.  It is not <Col N="1418" /> to belittle its importance that I do not offer a view off the cuff on the issue of competition within the industry, but such a view would prejudge the debate. It is only fair and correct that, having commissioned a detailed study on the subject, I should first take the trouble to go through its recommendations carefully before offering a considered opinion on behalf of the Government. That is only fair and right.  We formed a very good team that engaged in an enormous amount of work under the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay.  That is the reason I will not offer personal views.  I will study its recommendations carefully and consider them with my Cabinet colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>On 6 June 1996, I advised the House of the main elements of the Labour Court recommendations on redundancy terms for the workforce arising from the impending closure of the Packard Electric plant in Tallaght.  I also appealed to both sides to accept the court's recommendation on this matter in accordance with long established precedent in Irish industrial relations.  As indicated to the House on 11 June 1996, I welcomed the acceptance by the unions and the workforce of the court's recommendation and expressed strong disappointment with the decision of Packard management to reject the court's recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through ongoing contact with the parent, Delphi Packard, and General Motors in the USA, we have strongly urged that the recommendations of the Labour Court be accepted with a view to recognising the considerable contribution of the workforce over many years and to facilitating the provision of alternative employment for the Tallaght workforce.  In addition, we stressed that a favourable decision would go a long way to ensuring that Ireland's image as an attractive location for international inward investment could be maintained. They were also made aware that rejection of Labour Court recommendations does not happen, except in a very small minority of cases, and that even in such <Col N="1420" /> circumstances the parties generally discuss the differences and find a resolution, usually with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery. The Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission have a key role in promoting a harmonious industrial relations climate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Following the company's rejection of the LCR on redundancy terms, union representatives met me last week to request that I intervene with senior management in the US.  As a result the US parent wrote to me as follows: &ldquo;As a good faith response to your letter, I have authorised our representatives in Ireland to engage in further discussions in light of the Labour Court's findings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the director of conciliation of the LRC invited both parties to discussions on Thursday, 20 June 1996. Unfortunately, no progress was made and at the request of the company the discussions were postponed until today.</P>
    <P>I had a further meeting yesterday with the European management of the company which addressed the failure of the discussions on 20 June.  The company set out its position on the relevant issues as follows.  The company said it had agreed to put a stay on the sale of the plant at Tallaght and to secure it for two years to allow the IDA to find a suitable alternative industry or replacement industries; the company estimated that it was probable that there would be £1.5 million excess in the pension fund and that the company is prepared to cooperate in the excess being used in the manner deemed most beneficial to the workers.  This excess could be used to lower the qualification age for eligibility for pension entitlement; and the company was now prepared to offer an additional amount of money towards the redundancy package or to offer the same amount towards implementation of the recommendations of the task force, and invited me to decide which was the more beneficial.</P>
    <P>I told the company that the industrial relations issues and the work of the task force were quite separate and distinct. Any moneys available should go <Col N="1421" /> towards an enhanced redundancy package for the workers.  I advised them that the Government was anxious to see an early and orderly resolution of the dispute on redundancy terms so that it could concentrate on the task of finding a replacement industry.</P>
    <P>I advised the company that in my judgment a settlement was unlikely unless the core integrity of the Labour Court recommendation was protected and I appealed to the company to secure approval for sufficient flexibility to achieve that objective before returning to the LRC talks today.  The company executives, whilst not giving any specific undertaking, promised to revert to their US colleagues in advance of the LRC talks being resumed today.</P>
    <P>I met subsequently with the trade unions to brief them on developments and to request them to demonstrate creativity and flexibility at today's discussions. Otherwise a deterioration of the industrial relations situation could only serve to undermine wider discussions that are under way in the attempt to find replacement jobs.</P>
    <P>I hope today's discussions, now under way at the Labour Relations Commission will be successful.  The importance of a successful resolution for Tallaght, as a continuing location for investment, cannot be over-emphasised. The importance for workers, in terms of fair severance terms, is obvious.  My intervention has been guided by those two objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is incorrect to attempt to effect a trade-off between the Labour Court decision on workers' entitlements against the future potential usage of the plant?  To endeavour to find more moneys in the pension fund and ensure a general &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor about Tallaght are very desirable objectives which should be pursued and, hopefully, may lead to more jobs in Tallaght.  Furthermore, does he agree that workers' rights and their awards by the Labour Court are entirely separate and are their due? I am dismayed at the manner in which Packard Electric is treating its workers, even at this eleventh hour, holding out <Col N="1422" /> in a very mean-spirited way to ensure they do not receive what was awarded them by the Labour Court.  As we are all aware, the Labour Court is extremely prudent, if not parsimonious, in its deliberations and decisions and generally does not take profligate decisions in favour of one side or the other, taking a decision midway between the two.  Does the Minister agree that the company's attempts to further reduce workers' entitlements is a very shabby way of treating its workforce, always remembering that the parent company made many a £2 million on the backs of its workforce at that plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Rourke that the industrial relations issues are quite separate and distinct from the question of the future of the plant and other issues to which she referred.  However, in terms of finding a replacement industry, it is important that the future of the plant be secured. In this respect I welcome the company's decision in terms of its positive response to the IDA.</P>
      <P>The pension issue arose by way of a response to a matter raised with the Labour Relations Commission by the trade unions representing the workers where they sought to establish if it was true there were excess funds in the pension scheme, if so, their extent and if they could be used to improve workers' entitlements.  Normal pension age is 65, in certain circumstances it is 60 years and anything that can be done to reduce the qualification age for pension would be of help to a considerable number of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Labour Court recommendation and the central matter at issue, the difference between the court recommending five weeks' pay per year of service exclusive of statutory entitlement and the company offer of five weeks' pay inclusive of statutory entitlement, it is disappointing that agreement has not yet been secured on this.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, it is normal practice &mdash; there are very rare exceptions &mdash; that both sides of industry would give their allegiance to the Labour Court's adjudications.  The Labour <Col N="1423" /> Court is founded on a voluntary principle and, as the Deputy said, its finding is independent.  The workers in this case accepted the recommendation and the company felt unable to do so.  According to the company's figures, the difference is some £2 million.  At the discussions I had yesterday the company indicated a preparedness to make an additional amount of money available towards the cost of the severance terms. I told the company that was not near what was needed to settle the dispute and I asked it to have regard to the necessity to protect the core integrity of the Labour Court's recommendation. Discussions resumed at 2 p.m. today, I can only reiterate my wish that they will be successful and that both parties will agree because the workers are entitled to reasonable severance terms.  It is important that the Government and the agencies concerned proceed with implementing the recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister succeeded in getting a written guarantee from the management of Packard on the disposal of the site at Airton Road?  As the Minister is aware, a verbal undertaking was given some time ago, but it is important that it should be given in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being handled by IDA Ireland and it is appropriate that should be the case.  I cannot tell the Deputy whether the commitment is in writing, but in terms of the IDA's direct discussions with the company it is satisfied with the response that the company has entered into a commitment to secure that plant on a care and maintenance basis for two years and that the IDA is disposed towards accepting that as a reasonable offer in respect of this element of the dispute.  I will establish whether that is in writing. I do not know if the IDA conducted its negotiations with the company on the basis of an exchange of correspondence but, if it has not, I have no doubt that will happen.  The European managing <Col N="1424" /> director of the company told me yesterday that the company had two prospective purchasers for the site to which Deputy Harney referred and it was not amenable towards disposing of the site as requested, that its agreement with the IDA stands, that its purpose is to allow the IDA to introduce an alternative industry and that only then will the terms of handover be decided.  In my judgment that aspect of it is safe and I suspect that the IDA will be successful, but I will raise with it Deputy Harney's specific point about whether there is a written undertaking to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are shocked when we hear of the death of any young person. We are even more shocked when we hear that her death was a result of murder, in cold blood, in broad daylight, on a roadside in Dublin.  What makes it <Col N="1540" /> even more shocking is to hear that the young person murdered was an investigative reporter who was known for her determination to go about her business in a courageous, innovative and committed way.  On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf I extend my deepest sympathy to her husband Graham, to her son, Cathal, and to the parents, family, friends and journalistic colleagues of Veronica Guerin.  I telephoned my sympathy to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and to the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists.</P>
      <P>We in this House knew Veronica Guerin best as a journalist, but some Members will recall her contribution to the Forum for a New Ireland in 1982 and 1983.  That was an early indication from a talented young person of her interest in Irish public life.  Deputies opposite will be especially aware of her work for the Fianna Fáil delegation. Deputies in other parties who attended the forum will recall her tact, friendship and diplomacy as the forum sought to reach agreement, which it did, on a very important report.  That agreement was greatly facilitated by the work of the late Veronica Guerin.</P>
      <P>Her work in recent times established her as a particular gifted and professional investigative journalist.  She wrote about the unacceptable face of life, about murders, drug dealing and crime.  She did so with care and compassion. In doing so she made an important contribution to public life. Without the work she did, much of the recent public debate on crime would not have been as well informed as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her contribution to journalism was recognised not just at home but also abroad.  In December 1995, Veronica won the prestigious International Press Freedom Award, and when it was being conferred on her at a ceremony in New York, she was cited for her fearless courage and determination.  Veronica Guerin was a gifted journalist.  Arising out of the work she was doing, her life was previously threatened, and she was attacked on at least three occasions.  In <Col N="1541" /> February last year she was shot in her home, no doubt to discourage her from a particular line of journalistic investigation. From her hospital bed she said, on that occasion, &ldquo;I won't be intimidated&rdquo;, and she was not.  She was not deterred.  She continued her work undaunted and undiminished in her enthusiasm, despite this bloody intimidation.</P>
    <P>The murder of a journalist in the course of her work is sinister in the extreme.  Someone, somewhere, decided to take her life, and almost certainly did so to prevent information coming into the public arena.  Journalism is a vital and well established element in our democracy.  This country benefits from a strong, free media.  The independence of the media is one of the hallmarks of a strong and vibrant democracy. Journalists must be independent not only of political influence, commercial influence, personal or sectoral influence; journalists must also now be independent of threats and terror from what-ever source.  That a journalist should be callously murdered in the line of duty is an attack on democracy, because it is an attack on one of the pillars of our democracy.  The full resources of the State will be brought to bear in bringing to justice those responsible for today's murder.  Veronica Guerin deserves no less.  Her family and friends, many of them in this House, deserve no less.  Her journalistic colleagues deserve no less. The best tribute we can pay to her life and to her work is to redouble our efforts in the defence of democracy.</P>
    <P>On a personal note, there is little that can be said on this occasion that can be of any immediate consolation to Veronica's husband, Graham, or to her small son, Cathal, who must now grow up to adulthood without his mother, but it may in time be some small consolation to them for it to be recalled to them the unparalleled shock seen on the faces of Deputies on all sides in this House when, some time this morning, the news of Veronica's killing spread through the House.  Members felt this loss in a very personal way.  Those expressions of <Col N="1542" /> utter speechlessness and utter inability to comprehend what had happened speak perhaps more eloquently than anything we can say now of the contribution that Veronica Guerin made during her all too short life, to the public life of this country.  That knowledge may, in time, be of some small consolation to the people who suffer her loss so grievously now and for whom no words of consolation at this stage can serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in this expression of sympathy.  I am profoundly shocked at the murder of Veronica Guerin.  So is everybody in this House.  I pay my respects on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Veronica was a good friend of mine.  I knew her well since we both lived in Artane 20 years ago.  She was an independent-minded and fearless investigative journalist.  Her murder represents a direct attack on our democracy, perhaps more so than other murders, although all of them are an attack on democracy and, what is worse, on the fundamental right to freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>I hope no effort will be spared by the Taoiseach and the Government, the Garda Síochána and those who will be involved in hunting down the killers of Veronica Guerin, in coming to grips with the ruthless criminal underworld which she so ably exposed and which she was, this summer, involved in further exposing.  This event is an indictment of how crime has been allowed to grow rampant in our society for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Veronica Guerin was secretary to the Fianna Fáil delegation to the New Ireland Forum.  Her excellent work with that and other delegations will be remembered by many.  I am glad she was proud of that work which is remembered here today on all sides of the House.  She worked on the notorious fifth floor of Leinster House, the floor of the Fianna Fáil Party.  When Deputy Seán Haughey started out in politics as secretary of Ógra Fianna Fáil in the early 1980s, Veronica was one of our <Col N="1543" /> more active chairpersons.  She was passionately involved in the work in which she was recently engaged.  At a conference on crime held in the Davenport Hotel, which I asked her to attend, she finished her excellent submission by saying she hoped the contribution she was making to exposing the underworld of the city and country would be of some benefit but that she wondered, directing this remark at me and other politicians.  Finally she said she hoped it was not all in vain and a waste of time. I recall those words and remember them more so today.</P>
    <P>I spoke to her about what exactly she meant when I walked with her from the funeral of Detective Garda McCabe at the Holy Rosary Church in Limerick two weeks ago &mdash; I will not detail that conversation but she knew that everybody was not pleased with the work in which she was involved.  No doubt that led to today's tragedy.</P>
    <P>I extend our deepest sympathy to her family, to her husband, Graham and her son, Cathal, to her mother Bernie, to her brothers, Jimmy and Martin and to her sisters Marie-Therese and Claire. They are all friends of mine.  I hope that they can see today that what she did will be of some benefit.  I would like to think that those mourning her today will remember that we have an obligation to do something about it in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is shocked and horrified at the brutal-murder of Veronica Guerin this afternoon. I offer my sincere condolences to her husband, Graham, to her son, Cathal and to her family who have been so cruelly deprived of her love as a mother and spouse and as a sister to many family members.  I express my sympathy to her colleagues in journalism, in the Independent Newspaper Group and also to journalists in all branches of the media.  Her outrageous killing is clearly linked to a series of <Col N="1544" /> highly skilled and penetrating newspaper articles which she has written for the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  That she should have been shot down in this fashion is an attack on all of us and on the values on which democracy and democratic politics is bases.  It is an outrageous attack on the freedom of the press and the invaluable work that journalists do.</P>
      <P>In her work as a journalist, Veronica Guerin specialised in writing about crime and for many years in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> brought to public notice the shadowy activities of the criminal underworld. Her work brought her into contact with criminals and her encounters with them brought her into a high risk area.  She knew that from experience.  We recall that in 1994 we were stunned to learn that she had been attacked and wounded at her own home.  That attack left her hospitalised and scarred but it did not deter her from the fine public spirited work in which she was engaged. She continued to write every week about the figures who control Dublin's drug and crime network, she brought these people to public notice and to our notice and she deserved our thanks for her efforts.  A young woman, a dedicated journalist, she has paid the highest price for committed public service.  The sense of shock and outrage felt by everybody inside and outside this House is palpable.  No effort will be spared in our united determination to track down her killers and bring them before the law.  I too knew Veronica Guerin for many years, particularly when she came to work in the New Ireland Forum and made a very substantial contribution to it.  She was a committed professional back then and she grew in stature and commitment ever since.  On behalf of the Labour Party and on my own behalf, I extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family and friends.</P>

      <P>The murderous attack on Veronica Guerin this afternoon strikes at the very heart of our democracy.  The greatest liberty we have is the liberty of free expression and the greatest guarantee we have of that liberty is the guarantee of a free press.  Veronica Guerin died because she fearlessly pursued the truth. She was no ordinary journalist, she was a woman apart.  Each week in her reports she set new standards of reporting as she pieced together extraordinary information about the <i>modus operandi</i> of the criminal underworld. Today, that criminal underworld decided that in order that they could continue with their criminal activity she had to be murdered.  In a matter of seconds that enormous talent was taken away.  She had no chance because I understand there were two bullets to her head and three to her chest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Veronica Guerin was not somebody that could pick up journalism and put it down again.  For her it was a vocation. She was brave, courageous, a person of conviction.  She genuinely wanted to see something done about crime.  I know that from speaking to her on a number of occasions, twice earlier this year.  This afternoon I went to the Library to read what she had written about in the past fortnight.  She wrote about the vital forensic evidence that identifies the garda killers, she told us about the IRA south side division that approved the murder of Detective Garda McCabe in Adare and the attempted murder of Garda O'Sullivan.  She gave us a unique insight into Mr. Felloni and into the IRA.  I suppose for many, she was making their life unbearable.  She was making it difficult for them to operate and because of that, she had to go.  The murders of Detective Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin strike at the very heart of our democracy. A free press and a Garda Síochána force that can operate freely and without fear must be the bedrock of any democratic society.  The greatest tribute <Col N="1546" /> that we owe to both of those outstanding citizens is to ensure that we spare no effort to bring the killers to justice.  If our laws are inadequate, we change the laws.  As constitutional politicians we realise that we have a duty to ensure the fabric of our society is protected and that the Ireland that everybody cherished is restored.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to awards made to Veronica Guerin.  Last Year she won an award from the US based committee for the protection of journalism and earlier this year she won the Irish award for outstanding journalism. She was a great exponet of journalism. The Independent Group of Newspapers has lost a very fearless and talented journalist.  She is the first Irish journalist to die in the history of the State.  She may be the first but I hope she will be the last.  It may be that, as a result of fearlessly pursuing the truth, she will have helped us, the Garda Síochána and others to bring to justice those vicious people in our society for whom life is of no regard and in the criminal underworld there is no regard for life.  On many occasions we hear that a killing took place because of a falling out among thieves.  This was a different killing, the murder of a woman who was going about her duty as a professionalist. It is one of the most serious murders ever in this country.  We must spare no effort to protect from such attack our society, out liberty and our personal freedom which, if undermined or compromised, set at nought all other rights, even the right to life itself.  The public showed their outrange at the murder of Detective Garda McCabe.  I hope that in this case too there will be support for the Garda Síochána to enable them bring to justice the perpetrators of this most callous crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Veronica Guerin was a young wife and mother.  Her death is a horrific tragedy for all those who were close to her.  She is a grave and sad loss to our society. She was a courageous reporter in the <Col N="1547" /> best traditions of investigative journalism. Her pursuit and exposure of the criminal underworld and of drug dealers, in particular, earned her enormous respect.  In the course of her work she also made enemies in the criminal underworld and among paramilitaries. In the larger community her loss will be felt by everyone who knew her or who knew her through her writing.</P>
      <P>The murder of a journalist represents a fundamental attack on democracy. The press is one of the pillars of a free society.  Those who planned and carried out the murder of Veronica Guerin are seeking to undermine the freedoms of all of us.  We have witnessed the culture of violence which has seen paid hitmen casually murdering people in the streets of our capital city.  We have been confronted with the existence of drug barons and the extent of the human misery they leave in their wake.</P>
      <P>Much of our knowledge about this lethal culture we owe to Veronica Guerin.  As a society, we owe her a debt for her courage, determination, sheer persistence and absolute refusal to compromise with the truth.  Democratic Left, the Government and I believe everyone in this House is determined that those responsible not only for this murder but for all the other acts of violence on which Veronica Guerin reported will be pursued and brought to justice.</P>
      <P>On my own behalf and that of Democratic Left I extend my deepest sympathy to Veronica Guerin's family, friends and colleagues.  While we mourn her death, to honour her spirit we must be more determined than ever to ensure society is subject to the rule of law rather than the gun.</P>

    <Title>Florence European Council and Irish Presidency of the European Union: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased the House has the opportunity today for an <Col N="1548" /> extended debate on the outcome of the Florence European Council and the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  This debate is a timely indicator of the importance of the European Union for Ireland as we stand on the threshold of our fifth Presidency.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the Irish Presidency later.  I will focus first on the outcome of the Florence European Council.</P>
      <P>I was accompanied at the Council by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The outcome is set out in detail in the Conclusions of the Councils copies of which I have had placed in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the lead-in to the Council was overshadowed by the BSE crisis and the related British policy of non co-operation on EU business.  I am glad to say we were able to agree a resolution to this problem at Florence. This resolution is very much to the credit of the Italian Presidency which showed considerable skill in brokering the agreement.</P>
      <P>It is my earnest wish that this episode has done no long-term harm to the Union.  The many daunting challenges facing it will not be successfully tackled unless it operates on the principles of co-operation and solidarity.  I am confident that with renewed goodwill on foot of the agreement at Florence it will be able to put this episode behind it.  The Irish Presidency will work to ensure this.</P>
      <P>Of more immediate concern to this country is the long-term effects of the BSE crisis on the beef industry and the economy.  I am under no illusion that the formula worked out at Florence will automatically see the beef market restored to its pre-crisis levels.  It creates a structure to deal with the various aspects of the UK ban based on science and proper procedures and should help to restore consumer confidence in beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the <Col N="1549" /> special importance of the beef industry for many thousands of farmers and the economy as a whole.  In this regard I am very pleased the Florence summit agreed an increased level of compensation for farmers.  The total package, finalised at the Council of Agriculture Ministers yesterday, amounts to some £85 million for Irish farmers when account is taken of the retention of the beef deseasonalisation premium.  The objective will be to get this assistance paid quickly and efficiently to farmers.</P>
    <P>Compensation, while welcome, is not a long-term solution.  Consumer confidence must be restored and markets for beef regained.  The Government will ensure that all the relevant agencies direct their efforts in a co-ordinated fashion to assisting Irish beef to penetrate European and third country markets.</P>
    <P>One immediate and beneficial result of the ending of the policy of non co-operation by the British was the resolution at Florence of the impasse over the Europol Convention.  Member states will now be in a position to ratify the convention and the Minister for Justice will give priority to the enabling legislation in this jurisdiction.  The establishment of Europol will greatly facilitate the Europe-wide fight against organised crime and drug trafficking, the problems we have been so tragically reminded of the past few hours.</P>
    <P>The Florence Council also discussed at length the situation in the Union.  It had before it the paper from the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, entitled Action for Europe: A Confidence Pact.  On foot of the Santer pact the Florence Conclusions include a number of decisions in regard to the completion of the internal market, adoption of a new action plan for small and medium-sized enterprises and an action plan on innovation.</P>
    <P>Regrettably it was not possible to agree at Florence the Commission's proposals for bridging the funding gap in the development of the Trans-European Networks, TENs.  This issue will be <Col N="1550" /> considered further during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Ireland was in favour of the Commission's proposals on TENs.  Although the projects in question would not directly benefit Ireland we recognise the need for improvements in European infrastructure to enable the Union to compete better in the global market. We will work closely with the Commission during our Presidency to try to resolve the issue.</P>
    <P>The working dinner at the summit was devoted to consideration of the Union's external relations with particular reference to Russia.  The Tánaiste will deal in detail with external issues in his statement.  The general feeling was one of optimism about the durability of economic reform and democracy in Russia.</P>
    <P>The European Council adopted a declaration on Russia which acknowledged that the holding of the first round of the presidential elections in Russia demonstrated a firm commitment to democracy.  This, in turn, provides a better basis for the continued development of relations between the Union and Russia.  These relations will remain crucial to the security in Europe, not least in the former Yugoslavia where Russia is playing an important role in the implementation of the Dayton-Paris peace agreements and through its contribution for IFOR.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Florence European Council considered it would be desirable to hold a special meeting of the European Council in October.  I indicated in the course of the discussions that the Irish Presidency would be very happy to organise and host such a meeting.  The intention was that such a meeting would be particularly useful in order to keep up the momentum of the Union's business in view of the range of issues facing it in the coming period.</P>
    <P>The broad intention of Heads of State or Government is that this special European Council would be a relatively informal meeting offering an opportunity for a strategic think-in on the <Col N="1551" /> major issues facing Europe in the runup to the year 2000 and beyond.  Foreign Ministers will also be present.</P>
    <P>The convening of the meeting reflects to a considerable extent the positive experience of the Formentor meeting during the Spanish Presidency last year at which Head of State or Government had a very useful opportunity to have a free ranging exchange of views without focusing on specific texts or conclusions.</P>
    <P>We will be in touch with our partners about the arrangements for the meeting with a view to confirming a date.  The meeting will offer an opportunity to address the range of issues facing the Union and, among other things, to take note of progress at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is not envisaged that there would be a formal agenda or formal conclusions.  This could be considered later if discussions or progress on one or more of the issues on the Union's agenda should so require.</P>
    <P>The normal ongoing business of the Irish Presidency will be decided at the December European Council.  It is probable that work on many of the key issues such as employment, crime, Economic and Monetary Union, and a draft Intergovernmental Conference Treaty would not be advanced enough for decision for the special European Council.  Nonetheless the latter will, I believe, be a valuable political orientation session which will help the European Council to deal at the appropriate time with the specific challenges and issues raised.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the Irish Presidency of the European Union which will commence on Monday next.  The Presidency will undoubtedly be a demanding one at a time when the Union has a full and challenging agenda.  I can assure the House that planning for the Presidency from both a policy and administrative standpoint has been thorough and meticulous.  The key agency for the administration of the Presidency will be the Ministers and Secretaries Group which I chair.  This will co-ordinate the pursuit of the policy agenda during the <Col N="1552" /> Presidency with particular reference to the priorities we will set.</P>
    <P>There will also be intensive, ongoing consultation at political and official levels during the Presidency with the Commission and other member states.  I have already had a round of bilateral meetings with many of the other EU heads of state and government and with President Santer.  Further such meetings will take place as necessary during the Presidency. There will be a meeting between the Government and the European Commission in Dublin on Tuesday next to discuss the Presidency agenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Secretaries Group will also overse and monitor administrative and logistical aspects of the Presidency.  Co-ordination will also take place at offical level.  In addition all Departments have been engaged for many months in internal preparations for the demands of the Presidency. Overall I am satisfied that the preparations made and the structures put in place will ensure an effective and efficient Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The central requirement of the Irish Presidency will of course be to progress the agenda of the Union.  We will certainly be ambitious in this regard but we will also be realistic.  The six months of the Irish Presidency, no more than any other Presidency, will not see a resolution of all the issues on the Union's agenda.  The Government is however determined that this Presidency will be viewed as significant in terms of a substantive response to the challenges facing the Union.</P>
    <P>In my view the challenges facing the EU and the resultant priority objectives for the Irish Presidency can be summarised as follows: a peaceful Europe in a peaceful world, secure jobs, sound money and safe streets.  The policy agenda which Ireland has inherited and the Presidency priorities we have set ourselves all fail to some degree under one or more of these four headings.</P>
    <P>The objective of a peaceful, secure and prosperous Europe must above all guide the deliberations at the Intergovernmental Conference.  The <Col N="1553" /> Florence conclusions underline this by confirming that the Intergovernmental Conference must bring the Union closer to its citizens through addressing their expectations in relation to internal and external security.</P>
    <P>Citizens are not overly interested in the complexities of matters such as institutional balance, important as they are for the effective functioning of the European Union.  Citizens want to know whether the Union will be equipped to play its role in providing jobs, tackling crime and securing peace in Europe and among Europe's neighbours.</P>
    <P>All the participants in the Intergovernmental Conference must bear in mind that the outcome has to be acceptable to and understood by the citizens of Europe.  The experience of the referenda on Maastricht in Denmark and France is a salutary reminder against complacency in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Florence conclusions have man-dated the Irish Presidency to produce a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties for the December Dublin European Council.  This will be a major task of our Presidency and one in which we will need the support of all member states.  Our objective is that the Irish Presidency will make significant progress on the road to eventual agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference and in a way that will assist public support for the outcome of the conference.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Intergovernmental Conference, tackling the ongoing European agenda in the key areas of employment and crime will be major priorities of the Irish Presidency.  Employment is primarily a matter of national competence. This makes it difficult to agree substantive initiatives at European level.  President Santer is to be commended and supported for his efforts in this regard.  As the Santer paper indicates, the unemployment problem facing Europe is enormous.  The rate of structural unemployment is increasing regularly and since 1991 aggregate employment has fallen by over 4 per <Col N="1554" /> cent in Europe.  It has, incidentally, risen here.</P>
    <P>This European problem demands a co-ordinated European approach.  We will strive to help achieve this during our Presidency.  In particular we will seek to progress those elements from the Santer pact highlighted in the Florence conclusions and we will discuss how this might be done at the meeting between the Government and the European Commission on Tuesday next.  The Dublin European Council will take stock of progress on the Santer initiative.</P>
    <P>The December Dublin European Council will also consider the second annual report on member states' employment policies as part of the procedures agreed at the 1994 Essen European Council.  The key to employment creation is economic growth built on monetary and fiscal stability complemented by moderate income growth and structural measures to boost competitiveness. Ireland's employment creation performance in recent years is testimony to this.  The active commitment of the social partners has also been crucial to our success.  It is significant that the Santer pact proposes a similar strategy for Europe.  President Santer's proposals recognise the need for special measures to tackle long-term unemployment. Ireland has much to offer in this regard, especially from our experience of the operation of local partnerships.</P>
    <P>Achievement of economic and monetary union on time and in line with treaty requirements will be a significant force for the creation of the correct economic climate for employment growth.  It is worth nothing that there is much debate in Europe centering on criticism of the effect of the criteria for economic and monetary union as far as employment is concerned and criticism of the whole concept of economic and monetary union.  The criteria in terms of limits on borrowing, inflation and interest rates are just common sense and are things that any sensible Government would have to do anyway, regardless of <Col N="1555" /> whether we were to have a single currency. The single currency is going to save a very large amount of money in transaction processes and is going to make Europe more efficient by saving much unproductive expenditure in the area of exchange of currencies from one denomination to another.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's policy that Ireland qualify for European Monetary Union from its commencement.  The Government's fiscal and economic policies are and will be built around that objective.  These policies have delivered excellent results &mdash; the highest growth rate in Europe, increases in employment well above the European average &mdash; employment has fallen in Europe where it has risen in Ireland &mdash; and historically low rates of inflation and interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Europe wide fight against organised crime and drug trafficking has been given a major boost by the clearance of the way at Florence for the ratification of Europol.  Deputies will be aware of the priority which the Government intends to give during the Irish Presidency to the drugs issue.  We have already signalled our intent in this regard by tabling proposals at the Intergovernmental Conference for treaty changes to better enable the Union to counter drug trafficking.  The Government has also decided on a number of specific initiatives in the drugs area which it intends to promote during the Presidency, notably, the following: A review by member states of the adequacy of co-operation in protecting the external borders of the EU with particular reference to combating the problem of the importation of drugs by land, sea or air, the introduction of arrangements for co-operation between national forensic science laboratories as an aid to law enforcement in consultation with Europol, a declaration aimed at the introduction of sentences for serious drug trafficking offences in the national laws of each member state, which come within the range of the severest penalties imposed in that member state, a Community-wide initiative <Col N="1556" /> to be launched to encourage member states' customs administrations to enter into memoranda of understanding with relevant trade bodies and companies in the private sector, with a view to enlisting their help in the fight against drugs, and the conclusion of the conciliation process between the European Parliament and the Council of Health Minister to ensure that the Community Action Programme on the Prevention of Drug Dependence in the field of public health (1996-2000), which includes health and education action items is adopted.  In addition we will also seek to advance implementation of the report of the EU Expert Group on Drugs which was approved at the Madrid European Council.</P>
    <P>The priority we attach to the drugs problem stems from our concern at the corrosive effect it is having on European society.  Ireland has not been immune from the havoc and misery which this modern day scourge has wreaked on whole communities across the European Union.</P>
    <P>Clearly action at EU level against drugs raises the issue of more funding for such action at EU level.  Putting it bluntly, given the scale of the European drugs problem the current level of EU spending on direct action against drugs is very inadequate, I would like to see more being done on EU funding for action against drugs and the Irish Presidency will be exploring possibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the external relations front we will be required during our Presidency to progress the structured dailogue process with the applicant states as well as coordinating the Union's position in its various international relations.  In regard to the next enlargement of the Union we will be anxious to ensure that the strategy for accession by the applicant states is kept on track so that the overall scenario for the next enlargement as set out in the Madrid Council Conclusions can be realised.</P>
    <P>The next round of enlargement will for the first time create a real prospect of pan-Continental peace, stability and <Col N="1557" /> prosperity.  Ireland welcomes this prospect and I look forward to meeting the Heads of State and Government of the applicant countries at the December European Council as we met them in Florence last week.</P>
    <P>During the Presidency I anticipate that there will be EU Summit meetings with Russia, Japan and the US.  The outcome will, I hope, be closer relations between the Union and these crucial actors on the world stage.  The goals of peace, security and prosperity are as relevant internationaly as they are to Europe.  Co-operation with the other great political and economic powers is the only way to deal with the challenges of globalisation especially unemployment, social and environmental degradation and the fight against international crime.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to outline in this statement the key priority areas of the Irish Presidency.  As Deputies will appreciate there will be a vast amount of other work progressed through Ministerial Councils during the Irish Presidency. This includes important work in the following areas: The Irish Presidency will concentrate on a number of related topic in the sphere of education, namely school effectiveness, lifelong learning and in-career development of teachers.  As 1996 is the Year of Life Long Learning, particular significance attaches to this topic.  A major objective of the Irish Presidency will be achieving political agreement on the 5th Environment Action programme which involves a review of the Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development.  Deputy Burke will be pleased to hear that as he has raised that topic here every time European matters are discussed.  An important feature of the work of the Irish Presidency will be the finalisation of the Union's 1997 budget.  The Irish Presidency will continue to encourage further debate on the work programme attached to the White Paper for the European Union Energy Policy.  A key issue here will be the development of a <Col N="1558" /> strategy for the promotion of renewable sources of energy.</P>
    <P>Ireland will conduct its forthcoming Presidency, as we have done in the past, in an impartial manner.  It is worth making the point that, as Members know, when one is in the Chair one is not necessarily able to directly promote one's national interests in the way one would be able if one was not in the Chair.  Obviously we are committed to carry through the work of the Union in an impartial way that respects the interests of all countries.  Nonetheless we will be concerned to ensure that the interests of smaller countries and the interests of rural and peripheral areas are adequately protected and in that we will have substantial support.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their patience in listening to this outline of the subject. Unfortunately I may have to leave earlier than I had anticipated and I may not be able to hear all of Deputy Ahern's speech.  I trust he will understand that there is no discourtesy intended in that regard.  Unfortunately tragic events have caused a change in the programme for the Dáil but I hope that my contribution will be useful to the House.  I can assure Members that we will pay careful attention to this more extensive than usual debate.  The Opposition have been calling for some time for a debate on the Irish Presidency and more speakers are being allowed in on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that we have had a debate and an expression of sympathy and I will understand if the Taoiseach must leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council in Florence will be remembered principally for the ending of Britain's policy of non co-operation with Europe and the adoption of a framework for eliminating the BSE epidemic in Britain.  This House should not be greatly concerned with arguments about who won and who lost.  The British policy of nonco-operation was a failed tactic and was wound up in Florence &mdash; I am glad, not least for the sake of our Presidency.  The experience and results will not encourage the British <Col N="1559" /> Government or any other Government to adopt the tactic of systematic non co-operation in future.  Inevitably there is always a price to be paid in terms of loss of influence by the Government concerned which resorts to such tactics.  The red carpet treatment accorded to Tony Blair in Bonn recently tells its own story.</P>
    <P>At the same time, Ireland should be wary of endorsing proposals to systematically bypass or to make next to impossible legitimate opposition by member states in relation to their vital interests.  The larger the European Union becomes, the more costly a stand-alone policy tends to become, and it should be left to each member state to make its own calculations.</P>
    <P>There is a certain temptation that frequently surfaces among some of the bigger member states in these situations, simply to want to steamroll their way through, to establish the conduct of European affairs by big power directorate. That should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government will be attentive to the rights of small member states in the Intergovernmental Conference. Proposals for institutional reform should be carefully reviewed in the light of whether they are intended to enhance genuinely the functioning of the European Union by democratic consensus, or to marginalise the influence of the medium and smaller member states, which are becoming more numerous. A responsible and constructive contribution by a country such as Ireland during our Presidency will help to reinforce the case for maintaining the rights of smaller member states, and not disturbing the institutional equilibrium.</P>
    <P>The Italian Presidency has already come to the conclusion that there is no basis for extending in a sweeping way majority voting.  The small member states do not gang up on the large ones. With the exception of the bilateral Franco-German relationship, most of the shifting coalitions of interest in the <Col N="1560" /> Union are a mixture of bigger and smaller states.</P>
    <P>One of the tasks of the Irish Presidency, it now appears, will be to produce a draft text of a new European Union Treaty.  I hope such text will not be misused as political fodder in the next British general election.  One of the first items &mdash; guarantees of fundamental rights and mechanisms for dealing with a member state that might decide to suspend basic rights &mdash; is important, if the democratic charcter of the European Union is to be safeguarded.  I am glad that the Italian progress report has recommended retention of a commissioner for each member state.  I am also glad the French idea of putting a high representative in charge of the common foreign and security policy, working in tandem with the Presidency, is gaining ground.  My party has no diffculty with the framework proposed for the elimination of BSE.  I fervently hope the heat will go out of the BSE question and that implementation of the framework will be strictly on the basis of best scientific advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have been better off to have stuck to that line always.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  There should be close monitoring of the ongoing incidence of CJD in Britain and elsewhere so that consumers can judge for themselves whether there is any real cause for concern.  While public fears certainly justify the utmost precautions, including the elaborate programme to eliminate BSE, mainly in British cattle, they do not justify a boycott of beef consumption. Irish beef is an excellent product which is benefical to health rather than the contrary.  We must ensure there is no misappropriation of Irish labelling and stand ready to refute the whispering campaigns against Irish and European beef by interests in Britain that have been hurt by this affair, some of whom want to make it as <Col N="1561" /> bad as possible for everyone by suggesting we are all cheating or hushing up the true incidence of BSE.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the British Prime Minister's optimism that the European Union ban on British beef exports will be lifted by November?  I will give him until October to state his views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may not have set one, but somebody has dug a very deep hole.  I hope the Irish Government will be among the first to support the early lifting of the ban on beef exports from Northern Ireland which would save us £400,000 per week in additional surveillance costs.  I am disappointed the Taoiseach, who can be very concerned about other matters relating to Unionists, has shown little interest in the practical concerns of Northern Ireland farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been positively aggressive towards poor Unionist farmers and Deputy Burke and I have been left to defend them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will have found the zealous partitionsim of the Government without any obvious regret in relation to Irish beef from the North distateful.  While I recognise the interests of farmers in this jurisdiction, for whom the Government is responsible must be of paramount concern, we must be more helpful and sensitive towards those in the North who have made a fair case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the autumn there may be serious marketing difficulties for Irish and European beef generally.  The Irish Presidency will be in charge of handling the whole issue at European level. <Col N="1562" /> Restoring confidence in beef between now and then and reopening closed markets will be a major challenge.  Careless statements are capable of causing serious economic damage and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should be aware of that.  We should not have a repeat of defeatist statements from the Minister that in 20 years' time half the country will be under trees or that a mass cull across Europe might be necessary for economic reasons.  If more compensation is needed nationally, the Government should consider converting CAP fines into EU assistance, as Spain was allowed to recently with its £230 million CAP fine.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has adopted a series of snappy sound bites as priorities for the Irish Presidency, a peaceful Europe, secure jobs, a sound economy and safe streets.  I note that a clean environment is not included in his list and this will not be another green presidency.  It will be difficult to fulfil these general aims with real substance.  While the Taoiseach is entitled to be ambitious, he should avoid creating unrealistic expectations of what the European Union can achieve, under the Irish Presidency, in a six month period.  It will be difficult to get things moving until September.</P>
    <P>The lead-in to the Irish Presidency on jobs is not promising.  The substance of the principal employment measure proposed by President Santer, the so-called confidence pact, was rejected, or at least deferred, by the European Council.  On the employment front, the Union has not advanced much since the European Council in Essen in December 1994, before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>I note the European Council failed to agree additional funding for the Trans-European Networks under the Union's employment initiative.  It appears to be Chancellor Kohl's view that employment policy is primarily a matter for national governments and that it is not the task of public administrations to create jobs.  It is also argued that the Union should not spend money freely when most countries are tightening their budgets.  I also note the documentation <Col N="1563" /> published recently is similar to that which has been around for a number of years.  While it may have been compiled in a more comprehensive manner, the contents have not changed much since President Delors' time.  The new documentation merely contains pious aspirations about what can be done.</P>
    <P>The trans-European Networks are relevant to Ireland because of our geographical peripherality and we should support national efforts to bind the European Union through better communications.  One of the stated aims of the networks is to facilitate the development and reduce the isolation of the less favoured regions in the Union, from which we stand to benefit.</P>
    <P>Most of what the European Union can do for employment is indirect.  The flow of Structural and Cohesion Funds was negotiated during my period as Minister for Finance and has contributed to raising the level of employment here.  I note the German Government intends to continue to seek Objective One status for the former east German provinces whose <i>per capita</i> income is well below ours.  That confirms the urgency of developing differentiated regional statistics here before negotiations begin for the post-1999 period. I referred to this matter on a number of occasions during Question Time and I hope somebody is doing something to compile that data.</P>
    <P>The £240 million in support measures from the EU for the peace process, of which the southern Border counties are due 20 per cent, was also tied up before I left office and should create employment in those areas.  This matter was raised by a number of my colleagues on Question Time today.  If the Government can unblock the proposed funding agreed for the Trans-European Networks in the next six months it will have done a good job.  I wish it well in that regard.</P>
    <P>In so far as sound money is concerned, the Taoiseach will again tread in his predecessor's footsteps.  The criteria for such money was established under <Col N="1564" /> the Maastricht Treaty, although that had to be subsequently modified following the currency crisis in the summer of 1994.  The Government inherited a small current budget surplus and an economy that fulfilled that criteria.  All the Government has had to do is to maintain that position and keep public expenditure under firm control.  As far as Europe is concerned, monetary union and a single currency is on track for 1999.  There is a determination to proceed and I am pleased to note American banks are no longer rubbishing the idea of a single currency.  I note from various magazines I have time to read that their view has changed fundamentally in recent months.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency can lead by example.  The recent European Union Commission report on the economic and financial position in Ireland in the transition to European Monetary Union is critical of the pro-cyclical nature of Irish fiscal policies in the 1990s. Whereas the Taoiseach has a habit of criticising expenditure increases for being too high during the international downturn in the early 1990s, the Commission criticises our fiscal management at that time for being too tight and points out that the reversal in the expenditure trend in 1990 to 1994 was modest in comparision to the cuts in the preceding years.  I am glad to note this reflects the policies I advocated.</P>
    <P>The cyclical adjusted deficit improved despite low growth whereas it deteriorated since during high growth.  The report states that in the current strong phase, the expenditure plans of the 1995 budget, together with the post-budget commitments, imply that future revenue growth is being committed.  In other countries this has often proved troublesome. Unfortunately the Taoiseach stated the Government does not believe that.  Its policy is to continue to spend.  I am sure people who believe in tight fiscal control will have something to say when they read those reports.</P>
    <P>The annual economic report for 1996 states that the favourable cyclical conditions and the need to further reduce <Col N="1565" /> the debt ratio warrants greater efforts to reduce the budget deficit.  The stability pact agreed between ECOFIN Ministers commits member states to achieve a budget balance or a surplus in the medium term to allow the automatic stabilisers to work in times of recession.</P>
    <P>The European Council recommended that budgetary consolidation centre on reducing expenditure rather than increasing revenue. That was weaker than the position of the European Social Partners in the Tripartite Conference, which in a document put before the Europe Council, said that lower taxes are more favourable to growth than an increase in public spending.  That is not the philosophy of this Government.</P>
    <P>Two points should be made about this &mdash; the first is a purely political one. Much political comment and comparative budgetary performance under different Governments does not refer to the stage of the economic cycle.  For the Taoiseach to make jibes about the rate of increase of expenditure during a serious international downture under a Fiann Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in the early 1990s is economically illiterate.  The Commission, if anything, is of the view that we operated too tight a regime in 1991-93 and that the present Government is too lax.  This is a precise reversal of the picture which the Taoiseach presents when he is trying to score a cheap policical point, as when he ranted on today despite the Ceann Comhairle's best efforts to control him.</P>
    <P>The more serious and substantial point is that we need to leave ourselves an adequate margin of safety.  The incoming Government in 1997 should not have to face vast IOUs consisting of a lot of unpaid promises made by an outgoing Government, which is what we are seeing at present.  Ministers are racing around the country making promises, knowing that they will not have to deliver.  We all remember the house improvement grant, initiated by a previous Minister from a similar type coalition, which obliged us to spend about £200 million at the end of the 1980s.  The <Col N="1566" /> stability pact proposing a maximum borrowing level of about 1 per cent of GDP in times of prosperity leaves a safety margin for dealing with periods of recession, which anyone running a household or living on small means would understand.</P>
    <P>Another important function of the Irish Presidency will be the setting of the relationship between participants and non-participants in relation to currency. A new exchange rate mechanism is proposed.  I regret the British Government has already ruled out joining it. Article 109 of the Maastricht Treaty lays down that non-participating member states are required to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common concern to avoid any distortion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>We all wish to see secure streets and I welcome the clearance given to Europol. It was ironic that British retaliation in relation to the BSE crisis was holding up joint action in the fight against terrorism, among other things.  I hope Europol will be given sufficient resources, powers and co-operation to become effective.  While a European dimension in the fight against drug trafficking is vitally important, the brunt of the responsibility will continue to fall on national police forces &mdash; the Garda Síochána in our case.</P>
    <P>Last week's conviction of a major drug dealer who received a long sentence is welcome, but its not reassuring to know he was continually out on bail and that this Government had done nothing about the operation of the bail laws.  We do not know how many unresolved crimes have been committed by those on bail.  No amount of European co-ordination will be an adequate substitute for a lack of political will by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the economic sphere, European solidarity can be of great assistance to member states determined to do everything possible.  This was part of the secret of the success of our national recovery post 1987, which people should not forget.  I hope the European fight against crime will go beyond routine <Col N="1567" /> exchanges of information, conferences, documents and the few speeches which have been made <i>ad infinitum</i> over the years.  If people were around as long as I have been, they would get tired listening to them.  I hope it will provide a fast and effective co-ordination of effort and regular human exchanges, which might mean something.  Countries like Ireland which have to police a disproportionate share of European waters relative to population should get some European Union assistance in mounting regular air-sea coastal patrols.  That is a real test for our partners in Europe.  If they believe we should do something about the drug situation, they should help to fund it.</P>
    <P>Like the United States, the EU should vigorously tackle the producer countries in North Africa, the Middle East and the Far East.  Recently I pointed out how drugs are transported across Europe from areas where opium is grown and how the industry operates. The Garda Síochána is very aware of this and I would like to compliment it on its research and the efforts it has made to understand how these third countries operate.  We must see if the political leadership in Europe will do anything other than issue a directive. The EU should work out co-operation programmes with the relevant governments so the problem is tackled at source, with appropriate financial resources if necessary.  This requires active foreign policy.</P>
    <P>As regards a peaceful Europe, this is an area where we must act primarily at home.  The biggest contribution to a successful Irish Presidency would be to secure a renewed end to violence here. Before coming to that, I would like to consider peace in Europe in its general political context.  I have followed closely the debate on the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the Intergovernmental Conference, which is a major concern for a country like Ireland which is attached to its tradition of military neutrality.  I note with alarm pressure coming from the Greek Government for <Col N="1568" /> guarantees of territorial solidarity &mdash; in other words, trying to commit the EU to involvement in future disputes with Turkey even in relation to uninhabited islands.  I do not see why we and our partners should accept an obligation to be drawn automatically into war in such a scenario.</P>
    <P>I welcome the incorporation of the so-called Petersberg task of humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management missions into the EU Treaty.  I have made it clear that Fianna Fáil can support that proposal even if implementation is left to the Western European Unions as long as observer countries can take part on a case by case basis, as we do with the UN.  Ireland has a good deal in common with Britain in terms of our wish not to see the Western European Union annexed by or subordinated in to the EU.  We would prefer necessary co-operation to be on a more arms length basis.  We note that this is strongly the view of the Western European Union Assembly.  I had the opportunity to talk to the President of the Assembly about that and to insist that the Western European Union must remain an autonomous organisation, something with which we agree.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union wishes to define a future European nuclear strategy which is not something in which the EU, as such, should get involved. The smoothness of the EU's future expansion may depend on it not being perceived as a nuclear superpower but as a largely political and economic organisation.</P>
    <P>As regards the White Paper's ill thought out proposal that Ireland should participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace, which represents an astonishing about turn by the Labour Party, I welcome the statement by the NATO Secretary General, Javier Solana, that it wants no new semi-detached members and that the free choice of alignment must be the foundation on which post-Yalta Europe is built.  The Tánaiste, who is seeking semi-detached membership of NATO, through its Partnership for Peace proposal, has made no <Col N="1569" /> commitment to giving the people the free choice of military alignment or non-alignment.</P>
    <P>Europe must use its influence to help the Middle East peace process back on the rails.  I welcome the clear statement by the Europe Council that the honouring of the agreements which underlie the peace process is essential.  We must also ensure that the parties to the peace process are not discouraged.  Any renewed conflict could badly affect vital European interests, apart from any higher considerations.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen the European Council issue a stronger statement on Tibet.  The European Council weakly looked for more committed respect for human rights and fundamental freedom. The Chinese armed occupation of Tibet and its ruthless suppression of the people and religion of that country is an affront to humanity and a flagrant violation of the right to self-determination. I look forward to the day when democracy inevitably comes to China and when the Tibetan people are set free so the terrible injustice of the past 40 years will be partially set right.  Our foreign policy has been far too timid and weak kneed on that subject.  No doubt parties like Democratic Left will oppose any criticism of former Chinese comrades.  We should take courage from the example set by the German Parliament which recently passed on all-party resolution on human rights violations in Tibet.  The German Government was even prepared to sponsor a special conference. Every parliament in Europe, including this one, should pass similar resolutions.  I would like to see Europe under the Irish Presidency taking a far tougher line on this subject, with European solidarity ensuring that the Chinese Government cannot single out any European country for economic retaliation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to distract proper attention from European issues by discussion at length of Northern Ireland, which was the subject of bilateral conversations between the Taoiseach and the <Col N="1570" /> British Prime Minister and would normally be included in a debate such as this.  Like everyone else, I am dismayed by the recent deterioration in the security position and the ill-natured political wrangling of some of the parties in the North at the early stages of the multiparty talks.  I am also depressed by the apparent breakdown in any meaningful relationship between the Government and the Republican movement after recent IRA actions, a relationship which was fundamental to obtaining the August 1994 ceasefire.  Whatever we might say in hindsight, the ceasefire was a huge and inspiring achievement.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach, with help from other quarters, including ourselves &mdash; Deputy Ray Burke, myself and our colleagues have consistently tried to be as constructive and helpful as possible to the Government in these matters and I am glad most serious commentators acknowledge that fact even if the Government refuses to do so &mdash; will be able to persuade the Republican movement to have the ceasefire restored, as is the people's wish, and to further consolidate it if that is possible.  I fervently hope we will not see it finally disappear, as many of us fear.</P>
    <P>As I reminded the Taoiseach yesterday, his predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, denounced the IRA bombing at Heathrow in the strongest terms in this House on 10 March 1994.  He made a demand for a clear decision on peace and for an end to prevarication and procrastination. He stated:</P>
    <P>Democracy is indivisible.  If parties want to play a full part in the democratic process and to take part in direct negotiations, armed struggle by associated organisations must be definitively disowned and ended clearly and unambiguously.</P>
    <P>Despite such clear and forthright statements, which it was sufficient to say once and not endlessly repeat, the lines were kept open, productive contact was maintained and a ceasefire was obtained in August 1994 which lasted for 17 <Col N="1571" /> months &mdash; it should have lasted for good.</P>
    <P>The present political stand-off on all sides is profoundly depressing.  There is no sign of the skills needed to solve serious disputes, of which I have experience in the industrial area, as all sides criticise each other over the airwaves. None of this will be of assistance in the incoming Irish Presidency during which I wish the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers involved every success.  They have a formidable reputation, acquired by the Irish Presidency under Charles Haughey and Gerry Collins in 1990, to live up to.  That is the standard of performance against which they will be measured in terms of issues resolved by the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>As an Opposition we intend to be constructive and helpful during that important period for the country.  I am aware from the Whip that there are about 30 people from here in Europe today and we have not even taken over the Presidency.  There is not much point in having all my colleagues present when half the Government is in Europe. Perhaps the Government will inform the Whip when those people will be back to that we will have a useful sitting here.  We will assist the Government in every way possible, particularly Deputies Ray Burke and Davern who will be primarily involved in European issues in the months ahead.  That does not mean parliamentary democracy will stop functioning.  We will try in the European spirit not to undermine the Government but to encourage and spur it to greater achievement.  We will highlight to our domestic audience and to Europe at large the areas where we believe it is falling down.  It is in the interests of the country that the Presidency is a success.  I hope that matters of the Intergovernmental Conference, employment initiatives and Protocol and justice issues, will be completed before the December summit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In his address to the House, the Taoiseach set lofty, although <Col N="1572" /> not in all cases very defined, objectives for the forthcoming Irish Presidency.  I wish him and the Government well during the Presidency and hope those six months will be fruitful ones for all Europeans.</P>
      <P>Nobody would quibble with his decision to put employment at the top of the European agenda for the next six months &mdash; it should have been there for the last six years.  Equally, there will be general support for the Taoiseach's commitment to tackling the drugs issue on a continent-wide basis.  It is important, however, not to exaggerate the potential of the Irish Presidency, or of any country's presidency.  To Irish Ministers and officials will fall the honour and duty of chairing hundreds of important EU committee meetings over the next six months.  We will not, however, be dictating policies to Europe in relation to employment or any other matter.  Europe's White House will not be moving to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that somebody is not in a position to dictate policies to the Governments of Europe, because Europe is now the disaster zone of the developed world in terms of its employment performance.  The figures speak for themselves.  There are now 18 million people unemployed in the European Union, half of whom have been out of work for more than a year.  Unemployment figures in the major EU economies are truly depressing &mdash; Germany 10 per cent, France 12 per cent, Belgium 13 per cent, Spain 23 per cent.  Of the bigger economies, only Britain at 8 per cent and the Netherlands at 7 per cent have a single-digit unemployment rates.  Contrast that with the position elsewhere in the developed world.  New Zealand is perhaps the most isolated and peripheral economy anywhere on the globe yet prudent economic management and brought its unemployment rate down to a respectable 6 per cent.  Unemployment in the United States is running at 5.5 per cent, half the European average.  In Japan the rate of unemployment is less than one-third of the European average. The message must surely be getting <Col N="1573" /> through to the Governments of Europe at this stage and high unemployment is not some act of God but the inevitable result of pursuing particular policies.</P>
    <P>In an era of global competitiveness over-taxation and over-regulation are indulgences that no country can afford if it is seriously committed to reducing unemployment.  I will give one example. Dramatic improvements in telecommunications, coupled with relatively free international trade in goods, services and capital means that one of Ireland's main competitors for international software projects is not Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, but India.  The implications of this have not yet been taken on board by policy-makers in Europe.</P>
    <P>Jobs are flowing out of the German economy at an alarming rate.  There are four million people out of work in Germany now and the number is rising.  Six years ago Germany was perceived as a free-market economy with a socialist neighbour, the then Czechoslovakia. Today, many Germany industrialists see these roles as having been reversed, such has been the enthusiasm and dynamism with which the new Czech Republic has embraced the free market. German companies are transferring labour intensive manufacturing activities out of their own country into the more hospitable climes of the Czech Republic as fast as they can.  Belatedly, the German Government has come to the painful realisation that its traditional policies no longer work and is beginning to effect a major change in direction.</P>
    <P>Recently Mr. Gunnar Uldall, the economic spokesperson for the Christian Democrats Party, came forward with one of the most radical tax plans Europe has ever seen.  He has proposed a top rate of personal tax a 28 per cent with much lower tax rates applying to annual incomes below £13,500.  These proposals have not yet been translated into practical action but I advise this Government to study carefully the German proposals and the reasoning behind them in the hope it might see the light and follow suit.  If the Germans, the <Col N="1574" /> inventors of partnerships policies, have finally come around to recognising the essential link between high taxation and high unemployment, why is it taking our Government so long to do the same?</P>
    <P>Chancellor Kohl has set in train a major reform of Germany's expansive and expensive welfare state.  He has set in train also tight controls of public sector pay and the liberalisation of its over-regulated labour market.  His target is to reduce unemployment from four million to two million within five years.  It is unfortunate that Ireland does not appear to have any target in relation to reducing unemployment.  I do not wish to be parochial in the context of this debate but in my city unemployment has risen by 10 per cent in the past three years.</P>
    <P>We all wish Chancellor Kohl well in his efforts.  Adding two million people to the German workforce would be the equivalent of admitting a new member state to the Union, such would be the increase in purchasing power it would deliver.  The Kohl initiatives are designed to restore German competitiveness. They would be greatly helped if other European countries, were to set about simultaneously improving their own competitiveness.  That might seem an unlikely scenario but it is already happening.</P>
    <P>The Brussels bureaucracy continues to spew out new labour regulations at an alarming rate.  Those regulations will have the opposite result to what Chancellor Kohl is trying to achieve.  Effectively, this involves imposing on other European economies the non-wage labour costs which are currently crippling the Germans.</P>
    <P>The Social Charter, for example, imposes a considerable burden on European industry and commerce and is bound to have a dampening effect on employment growth in the countries where it is now to be applied.  It is ironic that Ireland, with one of the worst unemployment records in Europe, signed on enthusiastically for the Social Charter while Britain, one of the most successful employment generators in <Col N="1575" /> the European Union, decided to opt out.  The more regulations we impose on industry in Europe, the greater the likelihood of that industry moving elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Companies do not have to move out of Europe to avoid excessive labour regulation.  Employers here can increase their use of casual labour if the State attaches heavy burdens to employing full-time permanent staff.  This is becoming particularly obvious in Ireland where there has been a dramatic increase in the use of casual labour in recent years.</P>
    <P>Ironically, tens of thousands of Irish workers would probably be better off if there were no labour regulations.  These people, working on nine month or on zero hour contracts, miss out on many of the benefits of being in employment. It is almost impossible, for instance, for such workers to secure loans or mortgages from financial institutions.  That puts home ownership beyond their means and makes it virtually out of the question.</P>
    <P>Casual employment in Ireland is no longer confined to traditional service sector areas such as catering or contract cleaning.  Casualisation is now a growing feature of the manufacturing sector also, where the number of casual workers has doubled from approximately 12,000 to 24,000 in recent years.  That is a sad example of the law of unintended consequences at work.  The bureaucrats in Brussels set out to protect and enhance employment but they have achieved the exact opposite.  For those working in the exposed sector of the economy, overregulation can lead to underemployment.</P>
    <P>What kind of policy will the Taoiseach advocate for dealing with the problem of unemployment in Europe? Will he favour tax reform and the creation of an enterprise culture as he did when he was in Opposition or will he favour the high tax high spend approach of the rainbow Government he leads?  Will he tell his European colleagues that the market creates jobs or that government creates jobs?  There is <Col N="1576" /> a fundamental difference between the two approaches.  It would be useful if we could agree on an answer to these questions at home before setting out to tell Europe how to deal with their employment problems.</P>
    <P>One of the most complex issues with which the Irish Presidency will have to deal over the next six months is enlargement. Enlargement will transform the shape of the whole European Union and, in doing so, it will have important consequences for Ireland.  Plans are now well advanced to expand the European Union eastwards and southwards.  This process of enlargement could bring in up to ten new member states, stretching the Union from the Baltic to the Balkans.</P>
    <P>The five countries at the head of the queue for admission are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia, although questions were raised recently about the quality of democracy in Slovakia.  It is estimated that the cost of bringing these five countries into the EU would increase the overall Union budget by over £20 billion per year.  Of this, agricultural spending would account for up to £10 billion.</P>
    <P>Enlargement would dramatically alter Ireland's position in the European league table.  The arrival of the new entrants would push Ireland into what soccer pundits would call a comfortable mid-table position.  As a nation we have prospered by parading our poverty in Brussels but all of the new entrants will be much poorer than Ireland.  In the wealthiest of the five aspirant countries, the Czech Republic, GDP per head is less than half what it is in Ireland; in Poland it is less than one-third.</P>
    <P>These countries are likely to have a much better call on EU Structural and Cohesion Funds than Ireland.  Accordingly, we should now prepare ourselves for a fall-off in European funding.  It is important to realise how dependent our Government spending programmes are on the availability of European money. The Department of Education, for instance, will receive no less than £128 <Col N="1577" /> million to support its spending programmes in the current year.  FAS, the State training and employment service, receives £71 million, or a sixth of its total budget, from the EU.</P>
    <P>In the infrastructural area, the fall-off in funding will have major consequences. The level of EU support ranges from 48 per cent of the total expenditure for developments at commercial seaports to 75 per cent for national roads projects.  Our total net receipts from the EU amount to £1.85 billion.  This is the equivalent of £35 per week for every household in the country, making Ireland the largest recipient in the world of development aid on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
    <P>This money may not disappear entirely when the current round of funding ends in 1999.  However, the prudent approach would be to budget for a significant reduction in the moneys that will be available from the end of this decade onwards.  The taxpayers of Germany largely pay this European <i>largesse</i> to Ireland.  They contribute about 80 per cent of the EU budget, roughly £10 billion per year.  Reunification is already putting a strain on Germany's public finances.  It is estimated that the former West Germany is currently channelling about £85 billion in Government aid to the former East Germany.  The Germans will not go out of their way to pump millions into a developed country such as Ireland, which is constantly boasting about its strong economic performance.</P>
    <P>The implications of a cutback in funding are particularly serious for the agricultural sector.  This country benefits to the tune of £1,400 million per year in agricultural subsidies.  The aspirant member states from central and eastern Europe are substantial food producers and food exporters.  However, farming in those countries is much less developed than it is in Ireland.  Their claim for preferential treatment over Ireland will be strong.</P>
    <P>We must also be conscious of the inexorable drift towards worldwide free trade in food commodities.  Food exporters such as New Zealand and <Col N="1578" /> Australia have already positioned themselves well for this challenge.  Ireland, by contrast, is ill-prepared for a move towards free trade in food.  On the contrary, our food industry has grown inordinately dependent on subsidies and this cannot be good for the country in the long-term.</P>
    <P>In the beef and cattle sector about half of total exports go to heavily subsidised third country markets such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Russia.  It is an artificial trade which would not be sustainable without EU subsidies.  This might be an opportune time for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to set out his strategic view of where the Irish food and agriculture industry is going over the next five to ten years.  It would be unrealistic for the Irish Government to oppose eastward enlargement in order to protect agriculture. It is apparent that the Germans are determined to shift the centre of the European Union eastwards from Brussels to Berlin and I doubt that anything we attempt will stop that process.  It is time our Government concentrated its resources on preparing Irish agriculture for the challenges of enlargement rather than trying to stop the inevitable process of enlargement itself.  Europe is at a crossroads.  During the next few years the Union can go in one of two directions. It can remain a community of democratic, independent nations bound together in a single market or it can develop into a fully fledged federation, the united states of Europe.  Europe is thus on the verge of a momentous decision which will have important long-term consequences for Ireland. However, there has been virtually no debate on that subject in this country. We pride ourselves on being good Europeans and on being enthusiastic supporters of the Brussels agenda.  We look down our noses in a patronising fashion at the truculent British and their endless squabbling over European issues.  A little realism is called for.  Our attitudes to Europe have been heavily influenced by the fact that as one of the poorer member states we have been significant <Col N="1579" /> beneficiaries of European <i>largesse</i> over the past 20 years or more.  What will happen when we cease to be a significant beneficiary of EU funds?  How would be fancy, in seven or eight years' time, becoming net contributors to the EU budget to help finance road building in Bulgaria or education in Estonia?</P>
    <P>It is time we engaged in serious debate about the future of Europe and our part in it.  Are we to be minimalists like the Danes and the British or are we committed to a federalist model with Brussels as the European equivalent of Washington and Dublin the equivalent of Little Rock, Arkansas?</P>

      <P>During the next three years the Taoiseach will face momentous decisions and I wish him well.  However, I am gravely disappointed at the importance the Taoiseach's agenda places on environmental issues.  I had hoped that Ireland's Presidency would act strongly for the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the Maastricht agenda.  One of the greatest problems facing Europe in the next ten years is how to deal with the disposal of nuclear waste.  Ireland as a non-producer of nuclear energy and of nuclear waste should attempt to put the safe disposal of nuclear waste at the heart of its agenda.  It should attempt to establish, in the course of its Presidency, an independent multi-member state agency to supervise the safe disposal of nuclear waste.  I had hoped that would have been sought.</P>
      <P>This Government, particularly its leftwing elements, constantly calls for the closure of THORP.  About 8,000 jobs are dependent on that facility in Cumbria and I do not envisage the British Prime Minister taking such calls seriously and putting all these people out of employment.</P>

      <P>As a realistic first step, we ought to try to put in place an independent inspectorate to police the transport and disposal of nuclear waste.  The east coast of our country is very vulnerable. We should at least attempt to establish such an agency in the course of our Presidency.  It would be a practical achievement for Ireland.  If the Government succeeds in the meantime in getting THORP and Sellafield closed down, I will not shout stop.  We will have squandered an great opportunity if we do not put key environmental issues at the heart of the agenda for the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has placed such huge emphasis on drugs.  It is unrealistic that this country, with such an extensive and open coastline, should be called upon to provide all the resources necessary to prevent the importation of drugs.  The Presidency is an ideal opportunity, which we should grasp, to seek aid from Europe to enable us to play our part in controlling the trans-boundary tranfer of lethal drugs within and outside the EU.</P>
      <P>I hope Ireland's Presidency will be fruitful for this country and for all Europeans.</P>

I am delighted to tell Deputy Quill that contrary to what she thinks there is already a very vibrant and acrimonious debate taking place in Ireland about the future of the European Union, our <Col N="1581" /> future participation in it and the shape of it.  This debate is taking place in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs &mdash; I am sure Deputy Burke, the vice-chairman of the committee, will agree that the debate in this committee is lively &mdash; and in the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  A member of Deputy Quill's party, Deputy O'Malley, is a frequent and valued contributor to that debate.  The Progressive Democrats Party does not seem to be having that debate and I strongly recommend to Deputy Quill that she inform herself about the debate which is taking place. If she does this she will find that there is less reason to feel pessimistic about the shape of the debate and more reason to get involved more deeply in the details of it.</P>
      <P>The other parties are getting on fine with the debate and we would like to have the Deputy participating. Undoubtedly she has a wonderful contribution to make from the equivalent of whatever it is down her scale of estimation from Little Rock, Arkansas.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier the Taoiseach identified the four priority objectives of the Irish Presidency.  He characterised these as a peaceful Europe in a peaceful world, secure jobs, sound money and streets safe from crime and drugs.  I agree wholeheartedly with the identification of those four priorities and hope we will examine them in greater detail during the course of the ongoing debate on these issues.  The House will agree that the Government has taken a constructive step in that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has agreed to make arrangements so that the two Oireachtas joint committees principally <Col N="1582" /> concerned about these matters, the Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs, are briefed regularly by him and his officials on issues arising during the course of the Presidency and in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.  This essential, proper and open approach to the discussion of these issues will help to prepare both parliamentary and public opinion in a much more complete way than was the case on the last occasion we had an Intergovernmental Conference which led to the Maastricht Treaty and what was characterised at the time as the democratic deficit which caused so many problems in several other member states.</P>
    <P>Looking at the priorities as defined by the Taoiseach, we can see there is a good deal more reflection and straightening out of thinking to be done.  The first priority identified by the Taoiseach was a peaceful Europe in a peaceful world.  The first reflection this inspired in me was the simple one that the peace has to be kept.  If we have that as a priority, and I believe that we should, it behoves us to take whatever steps are necessary to prepare for the keeping of the peace for as long into the future as we can foresee.  This means we should be prepared to play a more active role than we have in the past.  I hope that that active role will be supported by the Government acting in its role as President of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Although a debate is raging on those issues, it has not yet come to any conclusions. I find it rather puzzling that a good many Deputies &mdash; many of them on the Opposition side and some of them on the Government side &mdash; have difficulties with the concept of our participation in the partnership for peace. Some Members misguidedly characterise this partnership as being in some way a back door entrance into NATO. However, the contrary is the case as the partnership for peace has the potential to turn into a partnership which will avoid the isolation of Russia &mdash; let us call a spade a spade &mdash; by creating the occasions and means by which that <Col N="1583" /> country can work with its neighbouring states in a mutual enterprise to improve its security.  It is all very well to say we can work together in the UN and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, but we know perfectly well that neither of those organisations has any executive means at its disposal to make sure the peace is kept, other than the means that members agree to make available at any given time.</P>
    <P>The partnership for peace is conceived as being a framework within which there can be co-operation for peace on a far wider basis than is available in NATO and which can make of that organisation and its members a clear and constructive tool in maintaining and enhancing security The great strength of the formula put forward in the partnership for peace is that Russia has already joined in and is working with countries which were in an opposing military bloc to the Warsaw Pact in operations which it can select, the scope of which it can define and work in a mutual endeavour to enhance security.</P>
    <P>That is a very laudable development and it would be a great pity and mistake if Ireland, for totally artificial and utterly cosmetic reasons, were to be led to stand aside from that very reasonable process which aims to bring together elements of what were previously two opposing military blocs.  I hope that those Members who were misguided enough to wrongly characterise the partnership for peace as an abandonment of anything we ever held precious will think again and see the strong merits in it.</P>
    <P>I am confirmed in that view by the many discussions I have had with politicians and other people from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe which have applied to join the European Union and who see in their membership a continuing political guarantee of their independence and new-found freedom.  They want a real guarantee of security from the West.  They do not regard as real any guarantee that does <Col N="1584" /> not include the Americans, which is why they all want to join NATO.  If they all join or have a very close association with NATO, there will be an immediate reaction from Russia.  If NATO can design a separate framework for mutual security operations, which will include rather than exclude Russia, that is a formula that should commend itself to all who want to see a peaceful Europe in a peaceful world, one of the priorities set out by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Later the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>On the external relations front, during our Presidency, we will be required to progress the structured dialogue process with the applicant states as well as co-ordinating the Union's position in its various international relations.</P>
    <P>That is true.  There is one point of the Union's external relations I suggest the Taoiseach and Government take up during the course of its Presidency.  It has to do with a structured dialogue with Cuba.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs recently sent a delegation to Cuba in reciprocation of a visit here last year by a delegation from the Cuban Parliament, when we continued the discussions we had been having with its Members.  My colleagues on that committee would agree, that one of the most satisfactory, achievements of that committee was to persuade our Government to vote against the continuation of the United States embargo against Cuba at the last General Assembly of the United Nations rather than simply abstaining, as Irish Governments had done up to then.</P>
    <P>Having had two discussions with Members of the Cuban Assembly and participated in the visit to Cuba, I can say without the slightest hesitation that the continuation of the United States embargo on that country is utterly unjustified, without any political foundation and is an act of the gravest injustice against the 11 million people who live in Cuba who are not a political threat to the United States or to any of its neighbours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> For some time the European Union has had a kind of &ldquo;on again&rdquo;&ldquo;off again&rdquo; relationship with Cuba.  I would like to see the European Union, under the Irish Presidency, bringing that dialogue into a much more active phase, taking the kind of steps the European Union is in a position to take, both in trade and political relations, to end the unjust isolation of 11 million people from the world trading scene and from world politics outside of the sphere of the former communist regime.</P>
    <P>The second priority the Taoiseach identified was that of secure jobs, with which we all agree.  His statement on this subject was most important:</P>
    <P>The key of employment creation is economic growth built on monetary and fiscal stability complemented by moderate income growth and structural measures to boost competitiveness.</P>
    <P>To my mind, that says all about employment growth.  However, I am not so sure that is exactly what President Santer of the Commission or various other people have in mind when they say they want to incorporate an employment Article or reference into the Maastricht Treaty. I am not against doing that but, in all the discussions I have had here, in Brussels and elsewhere since that idea was first mooted, I have come across something that worries me.  People readily admit this is cosmetic, a matter of perception. They say they want to insert some provision in the treaty so that they can be seen to be concerned with employment.  If that is all it is, it is not worth the bother.  If it is to be a kind of umbrella under which we bring within the scope of the treaties and Community funding, a whole series of measures to merely massage away some of the unemployment figures, it will not be worth the paper on which it is written. I was about to say &ldquo;it would not be worth a penny candle&rdquo; but that phrase has been thoroughly discredited.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, the key to employment creation is &ldquo;economic growth built on monetary and fiscal <Col N="1586" /> stability complemented by moderate income growth and structural measures to boost competitiveness&rdquo;.  Anything more amounts to pure cosmetics.  I do not mind the cosmetics but, after a while, they tend to get in the way and must be paid for.  The process of paying for them destroys moderate income growth and reduces the chances of taking structural measures to boost competitiveness. When we look at South East Asia, Japan, even at the United States, we see that whenever cosmetics get in the way of boosting competitiveness, they create an injustice for people currently unemployed within the European Union or its citizens who will seek jobs in the near future.  I strongly counsel the Government and others involved against inserting provisions in the treaty for cosmetic reasons because very often they are a snare and a delusion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach identified sound money as another of his objectives, with which I agree.  The late Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan would have been delighted to have seen that as an objective of an Irish Presidency of the European Union.</P>

      <P>The Deputy reprimanded me because I did not advocate spending or borrowing twice as much.  We have <Col N="1587" /> been around that track so often, I will not bother with it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the drugs problem and its resolution as being one of our priorities.  I entirely agree with him.  It is significant that the Florence Summit managed to overcome the difficulties obstructing the ratification of EUROPOL.  Within the Irish Presidency, I hope we shall be able to build further on that.  I invite Members on all sides of the House who fundamentally agree with that objective to go one step further, to agree with the proposition &mdash; this will be important within the context of the Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; to bring the measures and areas of activity required to combat drugs and other crime from what is now called the third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty into the first pillar.  It is a pity Deputy Quill did not remain to hear that.  We should federalise the powers at our disposal within the nation states to combat crime.  The criminals do not worry about frontiers, they do not ask whether the next place they will go, or the next customer to whom they will sell drugs was party to the Schengen Agreement.  They do not ask to see a passport or identity card.  All they want to know is whether one has the money or necessary resources to buy drugs; now the only true federalists are criminals.  Until we properly federalise law enforcement and the activities of our law enforcement agencies we will not have any chance of matching them at European level.</P>

      <P>We debate the future position of democracies within the <Col N="1588" /> European Union, the outcome of the Florence Summit both very important issues, democracy being vital to the future of all our people, on a day on which there has been a savage attack on democracy.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a constituent and a friend, Veronica Guerin, who lost her life today.  I extend my deepest sympathy to her husband, Graham, her son, Cathal, her mother, Bernie and the rest of her family on her murder.  She was a fearless journalist. Democracy depends on a fair, balanced, informed and fearless Fourth Estate, the journalistic profession, of which Veronica was a fine example.  She was wounded and threatened in the course of her work as a journalist, but she continued her work and her murder is a great loss.  I extend sympathy to her colleagues in the Independent Group, in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and to members of the NUJ generally.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the newly elected Italian Government on the successful conclusion of the Italian Presidency at the Florence Summit.  It is a tribute to the negotiating skills of the Italian Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister that we have seen an end to the British policy of non co-operation and a European support package in response to the ongoing crisis in the beef sector.  Now that the EU is hopefully on an even keel it should be possible to address the challenges facing Europe.</P>
      <P>A degree of political uncertainty in Italy and Britain's obstructive approach has meant that many issues were not fully addressed during the Italian Presidency. As a result Ireland has inherited a formidable agenda from our Italian colleagues and much is now expected of us by our fellow member states.  Critical issues such as crucial talks on the proposed enlargement of the EU and on Europe's tactics to fight the growing crime wave were again relegated and treated almost as peripheral issues by the attendant politicians and, as a consequence, by Europe's media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the wake of Britain's use of vetoes <Col N="1589" /> in recent weeks, the Florence Summit at least agreed that a special summit will held in Ireland next October.  I hope the agenda will have moved on by the time we approach the latter quarter of this year.  It is critical for the future of the EU that the agenda moves ahead with renewed pace and vigour with the attendant hope and will that issues affecting all Europe's citizens will be effectively and efficiently tackled.  It is important that issues such as social welfare, the fight against drugs, the Maastricht Treaty Review Conference and preparations for the World Trade Organisation's ministerial meeting in December will be addressed in Dublin in October.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Irish Presidency can be seen as twofold: it allows Ireland to put its stamp on the future direction of the EU and to play a central role in devising fundamental EU policy; the Presidency offers us the opportunity to illustrate to our partners Ireland's particular interests and concerns.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency will witness the countdown towards completion of the path towards economic and monetary union.  It is anticipated that the December Summit will bring to finality single currency technical preparations, which include the design of legal tender for the Union.  On the monetary union front, the Florence Summit gave EU leaders an opportunity to reaffirm their determination to meet the timetable for the launch of a single currency on 1 January 1999, not much more than two years hence.  While the Florence Communiqué indicated that technical preparations may well be brought to a conclusion in December, there was little mention of countries which may opt in or out of the single system.  Will such decisions be resolved in Dublin in December?</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the gravity of this question for our EU partners, that is one of the critical questions on which businesses, unions and employees would like a definite answer by the end of the year.  Will Britain join the European Monetary Union?  What are the real <Col N="1590" /> implications for Ireland of a British decision?  Does the Government propose any back-up or contingency plans if a decision requires them?  The proposed European Monetary Union is fast looming.  Two years is a short period.  Is Ireland prepared for what lies ahead?</P>
    <P>Florence bore witness to the Taoiseach expressing the hope that Europe's escalating crime and drugs problem would be tackled during Ireland's Presidency. The lifting of the British veto in Florence on the role to be played by the EU Court of Justice has once again laid the foundation of inroads to be made in establishing a firm basis for Europol.  As part of our Presidency, Ireland must ensure that all member states ratify the Europol Convention as a first step.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that we achieve EU funding to protect our exposed coastline, a matter raised by a number of Members.  While it is laudable that Europe's crime and drugs wave is being tackled, it is regrettable that the Government continues to refuse to take some fundamental justice-related decisions here at home.  I refer, in particular, to a referendum on bail.</P>
    <P>Continuing high levels of unemployment must be urgently addressed, not least in Ireland.  There has been little concrete action at EU level and that must change.  The political effort harnessed to create the Single Market must now be applied to job creation policy and it will be the task of the Irish Presidency to act as a catalyst for this major change.  We firmly believe it is the Government's duty to ensure a positive outcome from the Irish Presidency and the Intergovernmental Conference for all member states of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht process, while it was enthusiastically endorsed in Ireland did not secure as much confidence as it should have with the electorates of other member states.  Subsequently there has been something of a lack of direction at EU level and it is now time to bring this period of introspection to a close.  The Forence Summit has charged Ireland with the objective of preparing a draft treaty for the Intergovernmental <Col N="1591" /> Conference and that is undoubtedly an onerous task.  We must ensure that any future treaty agreements bridge the gap between the citizens of Europe and the decision-making institutions of the European Union.  If Europe is to continue to grow and develop, we need the confidence of all our citizens.  We must strive towards a jargon-free Europe.</P>
    <P>A positive outcome from the Intergovernmental Conference must not result in any dilution of Ireland's position on military neutrality.  This side of the House firmly believes that military neutrality does have a value today. While we recognise that many of the old Cold War arguments no longer exist, nonetheless military neutrality is still an important signal that a small country such as Ireland is not motivated in its international activities and in its relations with third countries by any selfish, strategic or economic interest of its own or of the EU to which it belongs.</P>
    <P>As I stated during recent months, Fianna Fáil believes that the Irish Defence Forces should be at the disposal of the EU under the auspices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy for the purposes of helping in peace-keeping and crisis management, but such involvement should happen only on a case by case basis and never as a standing concept that would demand automatic involvement.  We utterly reject and will continue to reject any arguments that edge Ireland closer to full participation in any existing military alliance, NATO or the Western European Union.  We strongly oppose membership of the partnership for peace and believe that joining it would amount to second class membership of NATO.</P>
    <P>In recent months the Tánaiste presented a thinly veiled proposal to pursue a policy of involvement in the nuclear weapons based armed forces of NATO through the Partnership for Peace.  The Government attempted to reassure the public that there are no implications for our neutrality and while that may be technically true at this point it will undoubtedly be seen by other <Col N="1592" /> countries as a gratuitous signal that Ireland is moving from its neutral status towards gradual incorporation in NATO and the Western European Union in due course.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding about Fianna Fáil's position, we are not isolationist.  We want to involve ourselves fully in Europe, but we do not see any need to join NATO, the Partnership for Peace or the Western European Union.  We are willing and keen to participate, as we have at UN level, in the EU through the Common Foreign and Security Policy on tasks, such as peace-keeping and peace enforcement, without getting involved in standing arrangements.  Let us look at each task on a case by case basis.  We are in favour of the tasks laid out in Petersberg but not their implementation as a full member of the Western European Union. Deputy Davern is an observer at the parliamentary tier of the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's approach to this core aspect of our foreign policy could, most charitably, be described as misleading. The proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference should not be clouded in any such misleading statements. It is the bounden duty of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to ensure that, in the interests of all Irish citizens, the positive value of Irish military neutrality is maintained.</P>
    <P>We firmly believe that the EU must be a union of nations open to new members with a generous and, where appropriate, flexible approach to the needs of applicant countries.  This enlargement must proceed at a pace which not only reflects the interests of the EU but those of would-be members.</P>
    <P>We fully support the present institutional balance within the EU.  We also believe that the retention of a Commissioner from each member state, even in the context of further enlargement, is essential to the continued confidence of the Irish people in the European Union.</P>
    <P>This matter is of common interest to all the smaller member states of the EU. It is the duty of this administration, <Col N="1593" /> therefore, to ensure that, at both the special October Summit and the December Summit in Dublin, the confidence of the Irish people is maintained and that critical issues, such as the retention of a Commissioner, are vigorously pushed by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Presidency will also offer Ireland the opportunity to lay down a marker regarding future allocations of Structural Funds post-1999 &mdash; the high Irish rate of unemployment must be taken into account in future allocations of funding to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fishing sector also needs critical handling.  This sector has been asked to cut its fleet by 40 per cent, a harsh and utterly unacceptable proposal.  Ireland's Presidency should be used to close off this proposal, once and for all.</P>
    <P>The beef debate has not gone away. A support package has been put in place that will give some help to the sector but much more is required.  This will include ambitious ongoing action at EU level to restore consumer confidence in beef.</P>
    <P>An EU Presidency demands decisive, cohesive and clear-minded chairman-ship and guidance.  Anything less will mean failure.  Much work lies ahead over the next six months, Which will be crucial to the Union, Ireland and all its citizens.  I wish the Government well in its endeavours in the months ahead and I will support it in every way possible while at the same time retaining the democratic right to criticise it in this House when necessary.  It is important, in the interests of the people, that the Government succeeds in the task ahead of it.  We will give it every support and encouragement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important upcoming event for the Government is the drafting of a new treaty for Europe. When we last debated the European Union.  I spoke of the need to humanise the Union.  There has been a movement from people, a feeling that the European Union is only about regulation.  A recent survey carried out in my constituency of a number of school children <Col N="1594" /> found that most of them thought Mr. Santer was a striker on the Spanish or South American teams or connected with the recent Eurovision song contest. Students knew every striker and mid-fielder playing in the 1996 European Championship, but they did not know who Mr. Santer was, an unelected person who has tremendous power within the European Union.  It is sad he should have such power without having the confidence of the people.  There is a danger that the Union and the Government are moving away from the people. I would like to see people for Europe and a Europe for people as a very strong part of the new treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his address the Taoiseach said he was not so naive as to think last night's Luxembourg Agreement would solve the beef crisis.  That crisis will haunt the Government's Presidency.  It is not just a disagreement with Britain but the failure of the Government to grasp the real problem, which is the continuing confusing figures and statements.  Unless there is massive intervention there will be a disaster in the beef industry in September here and throughout Europe. The £18 million paid today is but one third of the losses incurred by the farming community.  Lest anyone thinks I am talking about losses to farmers only, we are talking about 15,000 people employed directly in the industry, in the truck industry and in the factories throughout the Republic.  We are merely tinkering with the problem by paying some moneys in compensation. What will we do with the animals ready for slaughter next September?  Who will buy the finished animals and the young stock with any degree of confidence? None of this has been thought out. Nothing has been done by the Government during the past six months except to pander to what was a British problem, and by doing that the Government has made their problem our problem; when French television broadcast that British beef was being labelled as Irish beef that was not corrected.  I spoke to Irish people in the Parisian community who will not buy beef labelled &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;<Col N="1595" /> because it might be British and, therefore, infected.  No Minister has gone abroad, except to Egypt and Libya.  Our markets in the Third World countries have been taken by Australia and recently in Libya where 20,000 cattle and 500,000 sheep were agreed to be sold.  That market will, therefore, be filled for some time to come.  The Egyptian market is filled.  In places where we had a good name, except in Russia, we lost it because of lack of concentration by the Government.</P>
    <P>This is not the only area where there is a problem.  There will be pressure for a widening of the European Union by bringing in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and other countries.  This will put pressure on funds, and the present dissemination of funds does not allow the less well developed countries of Europe such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, to some extent, and Ireland to catch up with the others.  We will be talking about a three speed Europe in the future consisting of the well developed countries, the ones lagging behind, like Ireland, and the new ones about to join. Funds will have to be disbursed to them on a fairly large scale.</P>
    <P>I note the question of drugs is the last item the Taoiseach mentioned and that he did not mention the environment. The Minister of State must take responsibility for not including environmental policy.  He did not think of Sellafield, or of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.</P>

How can we presume to lecture Europeans on what we have failed to do ourselves?</P>

      <P>The agenda facing Ireland when it takes over the EU Presidency next Monday is formidable. Members may have different emphases but we hope that our points of view will be taken up by those with greater influence than ourselves.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency will be involved in preparing a draft treaty for the Intergovernmental Conference; completing the technical work on the single currency; preparing a major report on EU co-operation in the field of drugs and crime and preparing a review of EU taxation systems with a view to possible harmonisation.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has summed up the priorities of the Irish Presidency in a few words &mdash; peace, jobs, sound money and safe streets.  Those are the priorities not only of the Government but of the people as a whole.  I know they are also the priorities of the Deputies opposite. I hope Fianna Fáil will co-operate fully in facilitating the work of Government Ministers during the Presidency, both at home and abroad.  We should remember <Col N="1597" /> that as Ireland holds the Presidency the majority of business will be done here.</P>
    <P>The main news to emerge from the Florence Summit was the ending of the UK's policy of non-co-operation following agreement on the beef ban.  The great British beef war was, or course, just the latest skirmish in the UK's longrunning battle with the European Union.  Unfortunately, further tension has already been indicated over the 48-hour week and in the run up to the general election in the UK it is likely that the Prime Minister, John Major, will seek new pretexts to pander to his Euro sceptic lobby.</P>
    <P>The lifting of the non co-operation policy meant that the Florence Summit was able to progress the Europol Convention. The fact that the Treaty and Protocol can now be ratified is good news for all those involved in the fight against drugs and international crime. The seriousness of the crime problem has been brought home to us today in a way that was not expected, with the callous murder of Veronica Guerin, a brave, diligent woman who was an excellent journalist.  I am glad the decision on Europol has been under-pinned by the decision to hold a major review of the drugs and crime issue at the Dublin Summit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to establish a European centre to monitor racism and xenophobia.  The Council of Ministers had been asked to work on a budget for the centre and I hope it will be possible to complete work on this during the Irish Presidency.  Immigration into the European Union is, of course, inextricably linked with conflicts and human rights crisis outside the European Union.</P>
    <P>In defining the objectives of the Irish Presidency, the Taoiseach referred to peace, jobs, sound money and safe streets.  In its widest context these are all human rights issues, the right to a job, the right to economic survival, the right of Europeans to live in peace and free from fear are all fundamental rights which must be vindicated by Europe's Governments.  I welcome the emphasis <Col N="1598" /> that will be placed on jobs during the Irish Presidency.  It was obvious that the priority of the previous speaker was the farming community.  Farmers have been dealt with very favourably by the European Union.  Having received £85 million from negotiations in Luxembourg early this morning, a sum we could not have expected to get, it is still not enough for Irish farmers.  I believe the reason the farming lobby gets so much is that it says it is not enough.  Perhaps other sectors should learn from that. Perhaps workers who lose their jobs as a result of changes in the marketplace or because of competition from outside Europe should start saying it is not enough and they should be compensated for any bleep that occurs in life, but of course they are far more reasonable in that.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that nearly 20 million Europeans should be consigned to a life on the economic and social margins. Employment has, of course, been on the EU agenda before.  The Delors White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment contained numerous innovative proposals.  Their implementation, however, has been long-fingered by EU governments during the past two years.  The Florence Summit endorsed the Commission's proposal for a proemployment &ldquo;confidence pact&rdquo; and a major report on unemployment throught the European Union will be considered at the Dublin Summit towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>One of the central planks of the EU jobs strategy is the trans-European network. I regret that a decision on funding of the project has been postponed.  I hope it can be resolved during the Irish Presidency.  However, the Irish Presidency should focus not only on the needs of European citizens but also on the development of a progressive common foreign policy which is guided first and foremost by consideration of fundamental human rights.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Ireland is determined to use its Presidency to advance <Col N="1599" /> co-operation in a variety of foreign policy areas.  At the Florence Summit, the Council expressed justified concern regarding the extra-territorial effects of recent US legislation regarding Cuba.  I hope this will continue to be the focus of EU foreign policy during our Presidency. As the Tánaiste has said, it is essential that the actions and initiatives of individual member states be co-ordinated with those of the EU Troika.  All too often in attempting to make a constructive attempt to address human rights crises throughout the world the EU was held hostage by vested interests of individual member states, in particular those states which export arms or which have strong trading relationships with various repressive regimes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Irish Presidency will mark the beginning of a concerted effort by the EU to address the ongoing human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Indonesian regime in East Timor and in Indonesia.  In this regard I hope that it will be possible to press for the following action to be taken at EU level &mdash; I have written to the Tánaiste about this &mdash; the establishment of an EU human rights office in East Timor to monitor the human rights situation there and the examination of the possibility of the EU establishing a sworn commission of inquiry into events in East Timor during the past two decades.  Such a commission of inquiry would for the first time enable evidence to be gathered in a quasi-judicial manner that would provide the international community with a factual basis from which to operate. This is essential if we are to find out exactly what is happening there.  Concerted action on the part of the European Union is especially urgent in view of some of the most recent reports of atrocities coming out of East Timor.</P>
    <P>East Timor is not the only place where human rights are being trampled underfoot.  Fifty-one years after the establishment of the United Nations the international community seems as powerless as ever to secure the most basic civil and political rights of people <Col N="1600" /> living in large areas of the world. Human rights abuses are commonplace in areas ranging from Nigeria to Chechnya.  In too many cases these abuses take place with the military or economic connivance of elements in the developed world.  As well as addressing the specific concerns relating to East Timor which I have outlined, I hope the EU will finally grasp the nettle of arms exports.  Let us not forget that the people of East Timor may find themselves looking down the barrel of a Belgian gun while a farmer in Angola may step on a landmine wholly or partly manufactured in the United Kingdom. In the global economy we must be prepared to assume global responsibility. The EU could make a start by taking a closer look at the European arms industry and devising stringent mechanisims to ensure European arms are not used to perpetrate human rights abuses elsewhere in the world.</P>
    <P>There is a need to review the EU position on Nigeria in view of the continuing human rights abuses in that country.  There is a strong case to be made for the imposition of an oil embargo unless meaningful reforms are undertaken within a specified timeframe. The concessions announced recently by the junta amount to little more that a cosmetic PR exercise.  International monitors, whether from the Commonwealth or the Oireachtas, have been prevented from visiting the country to assess the situation.  Numerous human rights activists are still detained without charge or trial.  The interaction group comprising eminent statesmen such as Helmut Schmidt and Pierre Trudeau recommended the imposition of an oil embargo in April.  The reasons for that recommendation remain valid.  We should follow suit.</P>
    <P>In focusing on human rights during the Irish Presidency the Government will be reflecting the concerns of the people.  It should also keep to the forefront the needs of those less fortunate than ourselves.  We have a huge contribution to make in this respect.</P>

      <P>We should remind ourselves that the European Union is about peace, stability and prosperity.  I hope the issues that will emerge during our Presidency, apart from the employment issue on which a report will be presented to the European Council in December, will include the issue of local development of which we have much experience which we can usefully bring to the assistance of Europe.</P>
      <P>On the drugs issue, the Government has a number of proposals to co-ordinate the approach to the problem in Europe.  Although member states are primarily responsible for dealing with it there is a need for the European Union to co-ordinate its approach.  To date this has been feeble and we will try to change this.</P>
      <P>Further moves towards economic and monetary union will be on the agenda as well as the completion of the internal market.  The historic Intergovernmental Conference is not only looking at the institutions of the European Union, including such crucial questions as the future composition of the Commission and size of the Parliament, but the thorny issue of a common foreign and security policy.  It is also looking at the treaties which form the basis of the European Union.</P>
      <P>While I welcome Deputy Ahern's offer of Fianna Fáil support for the Petersberg Tasks whereby each matter will be decided on a case by case basis I was mystified by his comments on the partnership for peace.  It seems he is in danger of adopting the Tadzhikistani rather than the more traditional European role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a heavy external relations agenda ahead of us.  The Taoiseach mentioned the summits likely to take place.  These include summits between <Col N="1602" /> the EU and Russia, Japan and the US. Following on the Barcelona conference the Mediterranean process will have to be advanced as will the Middle East peace process now that there is a new Prime Minister in Israel.  The peace accord in the former Yugoslavia will require much attention given that elections are to be held in Bosnia in September. In addition, the World Trade Organisation is to meet in Singapore, there is the ASEM process and the need for co-ordination at the OSCE and the UN.</P>
    <P>Based on this synopsis it would seem that the external relations agenda of the Irish Presidency will be far heavier on this occasion than in 1990.  This will present a great challenge not least because of the need to keep those countries which have applied to join the European Union involved and informed about the process and progress made.</P>
    <P>There will be two meetings of the European Council, one in October or November and the other in December. We will be working on a treaty outline so that we will have some idea at the Dublin summit of the form it may take in the future.</P>
    <P>Since this will be the first small state to assume the Presidency after four large states &mdash; Germany, France, Spain and Italy &mdash; we will be the focus of attention.  We will be assuming the Presidency for the fifth time after little more than 70 years of independence at a crucial and historic time.  This is a great honour.  We will have a huge amount of work to do, a duty we will accept with some satisfaction.  This will present not only a great challenge but a great opportunity. More than 300 civil servants or 10 per cent of our diplomats have been redeployed to meet the challenge facing us.  We are proud to be Irish in Europe, proud Europeans and proud to be part of the process.  The foundations have been well laid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing his time with me.  Time does not allow me, unfortunately, to make the contribution I wanted to <Col N="1603" /> make.  A range of issues have been dealt with by other speakers, including the BSE crisis in agriculture.  I wish to deal with the unemployment crisis which, as we all recognise, Europe has to face in a far more realistic manner than it has to date.  I urge the Government to keep that issue at the top of the agenda during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>In early May I had the great honour to represent my party at a public hearing in Brussels on the Structural Funds. In the course of my contribution I dealt with the question of unemployment and stated:</P>
      <P>Indeed, while most of the recent economic indicators for Ireland can be presented in a positive light the single most important indicator, the unemployment rate, indicates strongly that the benefits of economic growth are still not being felt by a large percentage of the labour force who are still without access to employment opportunities.  Ireland, clearly, has a long way to go before unemployment levels are reduced to the European average, particularly if one adds the large number of people who are not included on unemployment lists solely because they are engaged in short-term training and social employment schemes.</P>
      <P>The persistent failure to reduce unemployment levels by significant amounts, despite the apparent positive results in Ireland's level of prosperity compared to the European average, suggests that there is a strong case for reviewing the methods used by the Commission to compare the relative prosperity of different regions of Europe.  In this context the eligibility criteria for qualifying for Structural Fund aid should be reexamined before 1999 so that employment-unemployment ratios are given more weight than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that Chancellor Kohl in talking about the former East Germany clearly indicated that it will retain objective one status.  I can understand that a <Col N="1604" /> large number of factors are involved there, but unemployment levels are clearly significant factors in the current crisis in that area.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency must look at the issue of eligibility criteria.  I know the Minister for Finance has taken up this point and we have discussed it.  Employment to unemployment ratios should form part of the eligibility criteria beyond 1999.  My party sees this as fundamental to our future negotiations.  I wish the Government well in making inroads on that issue and achieving some discernible changes in the criteria to ensure the consideration of employment figures is central to the Irish Presidency, for the sake of all European citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement the Taoiseach covered a range of issues addressed by the Florence European Council, all of which have implications for our Presidency.  I propose to address other issues which were considered by the European Council.  All of the matters discussed at the Florence European Council have implications for our Presidency of the Union and many will feed into the Dublin European Council in December.</P>
      <P>Ireland's Presidency of the European Union begins next Monday.  The Florence European Council had a special significance for us as it has, to a degree, set the agenda of the European Union for the next semester.  In particular it was the sense of the Florence European Council that it would be desirable to hold a special meeting of the European Council in October.  As the Taoiseach has indicated, we will be in touch with our partners about arrangements for this meeting.  I would like to convey my thanks to the Italian Presidency for the effort it put into making the Florence European Council a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular I would like to commend the Presidency and the Commission for their successful efforts to solve the BSE issue.  The adoption of a framework and the lifting of the non co-operation policy <Col N="1605" /> is to be very much welcomed.  The outcome allowed all the participants to show both generosity and solidarity.  As the incoming Presidency we will seek to move further the process to ensure that full consumer confidence in beef is restored as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the markets for Irish beef.  The beef crisis has affected all member states of the Union, not least Ireland.  Contrary to the impression given by the Opposition, I and my Department have been very active in protecting the continued access of Irish beef to export markets.  Where restrictions have been imposed my Department has pressed to have them lifted.  Within the European Union, Irish beef is of course sold freely, in accordance with EU regulations, although consumption of beef is still rather depressed.  Our embassies in the Union are co-operating with An Bord Bia and the other State agencies and bodies.  The embassies have also been active in countering misleading media information generated by the crisis.</P>
    <P>Markets outside the European Union, the so-called &ldquo;third-country&rdquo; markets, are of vital importance to the Irish beef industry.  Egypt, Iran, Libya and Russia have been significant importers of Irish cattle and beef in recent years, and other countries, especially in the Middle East, have also been purchasing significant amounts.  Ireland's position in these markets must be protected and developed.  The ambassadors to these countries accord the highest priority to this task.  Our embassies are maintaining constant contact with the relevant authorities to reassure them in regard to the high quality of Irish beef and the priority attached to animal health in this country.  Where restrictions were imposed on imports, the Department of Agriculture in Dublin has been kept informed of developments and has provided detailed information on Irish veterinary controls.</P>
    <P>In Iran and Egypt our embassies have arranged for high-level delegations from the Department of Agriculture to make early visits in order to meet their <Col N="1606" /> counterparts and discuss control and certification arrangements.  Similarly in the Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, our ambassador made contact with the Minister responsible.  He also arranged meetings with specialists, at which he was accompanied by a senior veterinary officer of the Department of Agriculture.  In all cases, our representatives abroad stress that Irish cattle are essentially grass-fed, that beef exported from Ireland comes from herds which are free from BSE, that the European Union has placed no restriction on the sale of Irish beef and that the Irish veterinary authorities maintain the strictest control on the quality of the product.</P>
    <P>Import restrictions originally imposed on Irish beef in Egypt, Kuwait and Lebanon have now been lifted.  Egypt has introduced a new certification procedure to verify the health status of imported beef and cattle; the embassy in Cairo is co-operating with the Egyptian authorities and with the Irish exporters in its implementation.  Saudi Arabia has also brought in new certification requirements and I am confident Ireland will be able to meet these requirements.  In Iran restrictions have been imposed on imports of beef from Ireland as well as from other EU countries and we are working to have them lifted.  I have been in direct contact with my Iranian counterpart to urge that the Iranian authorities send a delegation to Ireland to examine the measures we have taken to counter BSE.  I am glad to say that a delegation will travel to Ireland next week.  This is a very important development and I will be monitoring the outcome to ensure that it leads to a resumption of trade.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Intergovernmental Conference, the Florence European Council marked the first opportunity for heads of state and government to review progress at the Intergovernmental Conference, which was launched at the Turin European Council on 29 March and which has been meeting regularly since then both at the level of Foreign Ministers and at the level of their special representatives.  The Florence <Col N="1607" /> European Council had before it a progress report prepared by the Italian Presidency.  The Presidency attempted in its report to reflect the views of all member states on the issues before the Intergovernmental Conference but it was not in any sense binding on member states or limitative in relation to the future work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The report will be useful to us as the incoming Presidency in helping us to progress and shape the negotiations in the period ahead.  The European Council in Florence noted that the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference under the Italian Presidency had served to bring into focus the main issues at stake.  That first stage essentially involved member states setting out their broad national positions on the major issues before the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>There was general recognition in Florence of the need for a decisive change in the pace of discussions at the Intergovernmental Conference as it moves into the real negotiating phase. The European Council set a challenging mandate for the Irish Presidency in providing that it should aim to bring forward for the Dublin European Council in December an outline or framework for a draft revision of the treaties.  The European Council expects that its meeting in Dublin in December will mark decisive progress in the negotiations.  As a result the Intergovernmental Conference should complete its work by the middle of next year to coincide with the conclusion of the Dutch Presidency.</P>
    <P>Different aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations are interlinked.  At the end of the Intergovernmental Conference a single package will be adopted.  Unanimity will be required to achieve a final outcome. In view of this it is inevitable that the outline for a draft revision of the treaties will contain many options and issues which are still under discussion.  Nevertheless the European Council has expressed a clear wish and given a clear <Col N="1608" /> mandate to carry forward the negotiations rapidly with a view to completing the Intergovernmental Conference during the Dutch Presidency.</P>
    <P>As incoming Presidency, we will not be lacking in our ambition to carry forward that mandate in the interests of the European Union as a whole.  The three main areas of work to be tackled by the Intergovernmental Conference are in essence to bring the Union closer to its citizens, to strengthen and enlarge the scope of the Union's common foreign and security policy and to assure the good functioning of the institutions while respecting their balance and the efficiency of the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>At Florence the Taoiseach took the opportunity to highlight once again the need for the Intergovernmental Conference to address the concerns of ordinary people.  In particular he stressed the need to address issues such as unemployment and the fight against international crime and drug trafficking.  Our view is that while institutional questions are a very necessary part of the Intergovernmental Conference's agenda, the people's verdict on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will be governed by the extent to which it addresses and is seen to address their direct concerns.  I am glad to say that the conclusions of the European Council reflect this real concern with the need to reflect the actual concerns of citizens in areas such as employment, the environment, transparency and the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The European Council also identified and reaffirmed a number of points to be taken into account by the Intergovernmental Conference in its work in other areas, including its aim of strengthening and enlarging the scope of the Union's common foreign and security policy. The Irish Presidency has indicated that it will seek to work actively for practical and sustainable ways of improving the operation of the Common Foreign Security Policy at the Intergovernmental Conference.  In line with the conclusions of the European Council, issues <Col N="1609" /> which will be considered in this context include, for example, institutional questions, decision-making procedures, coherence between the economic and political aspects of the Union's foreign policy, Common Foreign Security Policy financing and in particular the possibility of including the Petersberg Tasks in the Treaty objectives.  It was also decided that the relationship between the EU and Western European Union should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>On a practical level, the mandate given to the Irish Presidency means it is now essential that all delegations should move towards the real negotiating phase.  It is our view that in some areas further carefully prepared conceptual discussion is now required before moving to the examination of detailed Treaty texts.  In other cases, the state of discussion would appear to be already ripe for the Intergovernmental Conference to move straight to the discussion of texts.  The Florence European Council has, as I have indicated, helped to reaffirm some of the main priorities for the Intergovernmental Conference. As Presidency, however, it is our view that the Florence mandate implies that the Intergovernmental Conference must examine all issues on its agenda in the course of the coming period with a view to submission of the framework which has been requested for the December European Council in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is clear we are facing into a very intensive programme of work at the Intergovernmental Conference at every level.  The ability to realise the goal set at Florence will depend, of course, both on the ambitions and efforts of the Irish Presidency and on the willingness of all partners to aim for the goal which has been set and on their efforts to attain it. It would be foolish to underestimate the magnitude of the challenge which Florence has set for the Irish Presidency and for our partners but I have full confidence that we can and will together rise to the challenge.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned BSE, the Intergovernmental Conference, employment and a range of <Col N="1610" /> internal issues the European Council in Florence considered a number of important current international issues. It adopted declarations on Russia, the Middle East Peace Process, and former Yugoslavia.  Transatlantic relations, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and developments in Asia, Africa and Latin America were among other subjects discussed. Foreign Ministers had an informal exchange of views, at their dinner discussion on Friday evening, of the problems currently facing the United Nations.  This did not lead, however, to any formal conclusions.</P>
    <P>With regard to Russia, the European Council stressed the firm determination of the European Union to continue to support the reform process.  The holding of the first round of Presidential elections was welcomed, and the Council looked forward to the successful completion of the elections.  The consolidation of democracy in Russia will contribute to strengthening peace, stability and security in Europe, and will provide a better basis for the continued development of relations between the European Union and Russia.  The European Council also emphasised the importance of the full involvement of Russia in the development of a comprehensive European security architecture.  It expressed satisfaction with Russia's co-operation on European and International issues, including implementation of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreements.  The development of EU-Russia relations in coming months will be an important objective of the Irish Presidency, building on the interim agreement which came into effect earlier this year, and the action plan which was adopted last May.</P>
    <P>The European Council reviewed the prospects for the Middle East Peace Process in the light of recent developments, notably the formation of the new Israeli Government.  Peace in the Middle East region is a fundamental interest of the European Union; it is the only path to security and peace for Israel, the Palestinians and the neighbouring states.  The EU encourages all <Col N="1611" /> parties to re-engage themselves in the peace process, to respect and implement fully all the agreements already accepted by all parties under the Madrid and Oslo frameworks.  The aim of the European Union is that Israel and its neighbours may live within secure, recognised and guaranteed borders and that the legitimate rights of the Palestinians should be respected.</P>
    <P>The European Council stressed the essential principles on which conclusion of negotiations should be based, set out in Security Council Resolutions 242, 338 and 425, and including self-determination for the Palestinians, with all that that implies, and land for peace.  The Council expressed the EU's commitment to do everything possible to ensure that the work already begun is pursued and brought to its conclusion.</P>
    <P>On former Yugoslavia, the European Council reviewed the progress made in the first six months of implementation of the Peace Agreement in Bosnia-Hercegovina, including the considerable contribution made by the European Union and Individual member states. The Council supported the recommendation of the recent meeting of the Peace Implementation Council that the elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina should take place on 14 September, subject to the decision on certification to be taken by the OSCE.  The Council called on the parties to adopt the necessary measures, notably as regards freedom of movement and access to public media, to ensure the conditions for free and fair elections.</P>
    <P>The European Union will make an important contribution, under the Irish Presidency, to the electoral process, through the EU Monitor Mission and on the basis of the joint action for the supervision of the elections adopted on 10 June.  Successful elections will allow the establishment and development of new political institutions in Bosnia and Hercegovina.  This process is essential for the consolidation of a united, and democratic State of Bosnia and Hercegovina. The European Council stressed <Col N="1612" /> that the Federation is an essential element of such an objective and rejected any attempt to revive Hercegovina-Bosnia governmental structures, since these would run counter to the federation.</P>
    <P>The European Council stressed the need for full co-operation by the parties with the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia.  The peace agreement excludes those indicated by the Tribunal from running for office.  The Council stressed the need for Mr. Karadzic to remove himself from the political scene.</P>
    <P>The European Council reiterated its intention to continue to support the economic recovery and rehabilitation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, emphasising that no party would be discriminated against in this respect, provided that it fulfilled its obligations under the peace agreement.  The economic development of the countries of former Yugoslavia is an important factor in the achievement of stability and post-conflict reconstruction and the Irish Presidency attaches great importance to the measures being put in place by the European Union in this regard.</P>
    <P>The European Council expressed serious concern about the continuing violence in the Great Lakes Region of Africa, and in particular that which is taking place in Burundi.  It stressed its unequivocal support for the ongoing peace efforts of the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other mediators such as former Presidents Carter and Nyerere.  The European Union will continue to seek the establishment of a lasting peaceful and political framework to settle the crisis of the region through the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region. During its Presidency, Ireland will work closely with the Special Envoy in the pursuit of these objectives.</P>
    <P>In the area of EU-US relations the Irish Presidency will build on the progress achieved during the Italian Presidency. The priorities for the next six months as outlined in the report of the <Col N="1613" /> senior level group to the EU-US Summit which took place earlier this month in Washington are, I believe, generally realistic and achievable.  The Irish Presidency attaches importance to EU-US relations.  We wish to see the effectiveness of our dialogue with the US enhanced and to use it to promote the interests of the European Union.  We will continue to work to strengthen relations between the European Union and Canada.</P>
    <P>The first Ministerial Review Conference of the World Trade Organisation will take place in Singapore next December.  A key priority of our Presidency will be to ensure that the Union makes an effective contribution to the conference so as to consolidate and develop the multilateral trade system. Accordingly, we are organising an informal meeting of EU Trade Ministers in Dublin next September to develop the Union's negotiating stance.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the European Union's relations with the third countries of the Mediterranean.  The Euro-Mediterranean Process launched in Barcelona in November 1995 established a comprehensive partnership between the EU and 12 Mediterranean partners through strengthened and regular political dialogue, the development of economic and financial co-operation and greater emphasis on the social, cultural and human dimension.  The Irish Presidency will seek to advance this initiative in preparation for the next meeting of Foreign Ministers scheduled for the first half of 1997.</P>
    <P>A list of priority activities covering the three chapters of the Barcelona Process has been drawn up and several very constructive meetings have already taken place between the EU and its Mediterranean partners.  Activities envisaged during Ireland's Presidency include a series of conferences at ministerial and official level involving the European Union and its Mediterranean partners.  These include ministerial meetings on justice and home affairs matters and on fisheries conservation in the Mediterranean, together with <Col N="1614" /> experts meetings on such topics as economic transition, maritime transport, and culture.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has underlined in this statement the importance of the enlargement process and the priority enlargement will be for our Presidency. I will not dwell on this issue now other than to say that the Irish Presidency will seek to ensure a constructive engagement with the countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus and Malta with a view to ensuring that the problem of enlargement can progress smoothly.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Taoiseach referred to the practical and organisational arrangements that have been set in place to ensure that Ireland's Presidency is both efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>To assist Deputies in knowing the details of at least part of that planning I have been lodging in the Oireachtas Library on a regular basis updated copies of the Calendar of Council meetings and the calendar of meetings that will be held in Ireland during the Presidency. I will continue to supply updated information of this nature on a regular basis.  It is important that the House continues to take a full and committed interest in EU affairs, in particular over the next six months.  I welcome the positive comments made by previous speakers and the support which they have offered to the Presidency effort.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the meetings of COSAC the Conference of the European Affairs Committees of the National Parliaments which will be held in Ireland during our Presidency and which is being organised by the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I expect we will be able to avail of that valuable opportunity to brief national parliamentarians from throughout the Union of our Presidency concerns.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to other matters which have been mentioned in the course of the statements.  The House will be aware of the importance the Government attaches to the environment.  The <Col N="1615" /> partnership for peace was also mentioned. Our position in relation to that was made clear in the White Paper. There will be full consultation with the parties, with this House and also with the Oireachtas committees on foreign affairs, on any decisions that have to be made.  I thank Deputies who wished the Government well during our Presidency which is for the benefit of the Irish people and the European Union.</P>

      <P>Once again the Government is rejecting an Opposition Bill which seeks to provide something that it has neither the imagination nor the inclination to do.  I congratulate Deputy Quill on her initiative and work in drafting the Bill, especially when one considers the lack of resources available to Opposition Members in this regard. When my party returns to Government in the very near future I will do my best to ensure that is dealt with in a professional manner.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill last night Deputy Quill stated:</P>
      <P>This is the first major conservation Bill since the foundation of the State. Its purpose is to give proper protection in law to our built environment. The provisions of this Bill extend not only to buildings of particular architectural importance but also to buildings of historic, cultural and artistic significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By any standards this is a worthwhile Bill and deserves support.  The arguments put forward by the Minister of State last night were weak.  I could not help smiling when I heard her make the usual reference to the Government's plan to address the matters in the Bill. <Col N="1616" /> If the Opposition introduced a Bill to outlaw growing beards or to ban smoking in a cigarette factory, the Government would reject it on the grounds that it had a similar and better Bill in preparation.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks and months the Taoiseach has responded to almost every question about promised legislation with the words, &ldquo;it will be published in October or November&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Dea recently reckoned that at least 18 Bills will come before the Dáil at that time, but during the past week or two that figure increased to approximately 24.  Next October and November will be an exciting time in this House.  It is important that any civilised nation should guard its heritage to the best of its ability.  My party can be proud of its record in this area, especially under the stewardship of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach.  The preservation and restoration work in the Temple Bar area is a good example of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the cost to local authorities of implementing some of the provisions in the Bill.  Successive Governments, including the present one, frequently enacted legislation which requires local authorities to implement various provisions without any commitment on funding from the Exchequer.  Only last night we passed Second Stage of the Control of Horses Bill which will require local authorities to provide all facilities, including pounds, for stray horses.  The Litter Act also passed the buck to local authorities. There is no reason the suggestions made could not be incorporated in the planning regulations.</P>

      <P>Before the turn of the century there were more than 2,000 stately homes in this country, there are now only 50.  There are three or four in Connacht and Westport House, one of the <Col N="1617" /> finest estates in the country, is located in my constituency.  The estate hopes to welcome its two millionth visitor this year.  For the past 35 years the Browne family have exhausted much of their own money in promoting the estate all over the world.  Lord Altamont has invested millions of pounds in the estate and the Browne family has done more than the Government to promote tourism and stately homes.</P>
      <P>The Government and Mayo County Council plan to locate a sewerage plant in the middle of the estate.  Lord Altamont, the Browne family and the people of Westport want a sewerage scheme but not in the middle of the Westport House estate.  The family have offered an alternative site.  Locals can visit the estate any day of the week and the people do not want this estate destroyed or vandalised.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State discuss this matter with the Minister for the Environment to ensure that Westport House does not become another statistic, like the many other stately homes that have been destroyed since the turn of the century?  The cost of using the alternative site would be minimal and would prevent the destruction of this beautiful home.  I call for the support of all Members in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know a great deal about stately homes.  I came into the House to contribute to this debate because I love Westport House and enjoy taking my children through its grounds on a Sunday. I compliment Lord Altamont and the Browne family for investing in their home and on opening it to the public. It is pointless bringing legislation before the House if the people in power do not want to protect this beautiful site. Instead of putting a sewerage plant in the middle of the estate we should offer the Browne family millions of pounds to fund their initiative.  Bord Fáilte has not given them any assistance.  Lord Altamont has done more for Westport than Bord Fáilte.  I do not want this heritage house destroyed and the alternative site should be used to save this stately home. I ask the Minister and the Government <Col N="1618" /> to provide assistance so the public may visit this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Ring that I support this objective and that of Lord Altamont.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I congratulate Deputy Quill for bringing it forward and I compliment her on her efforts in preparing it.  Its aim is to strengthen the protection offered to listed buildings under planning legislation and to introduce the concept of conservation areas.  We are all aware that the present system of protecting buildings under our planning Acts is totally unacceptable and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  This Bill, warts and all, affords us an opportunity to begin this debate, which is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The Government in its programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> commits itself to improving the protection for listed buildings and to introduce incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings.  In the context of this commitment, I was pleased to hear the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, say the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht had established an interdepartmental working group to examine the complex issues involved.  I was particularly pleased to hear its findings have been presented to the Ministers in the past few days.  I do not want to see this report gather dust on a shelf in one of those Departments.  Action is required and I hope another planning Bill will be introduced during the life of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism has the potential to play an even more significant role in the future growth of our economy.  We all recognise this country is not a sunshine holiday destination and we must plan accordingly.  One of our strengths is the attractiveness of Ireland as a scenic and cultural destination, particularly for continental visitors.  In this regard, the preservation of listed buildings has an important role to play.  Listed buildings, <Col N="1619" /> which range from great houses and gardens to traditional cottages and other stone buildings such as mills and barns, etc, are under threat.  Most local authorities have buildings listed in their development plans.  For instance, the former Dublin County Council development plan listed thousands of buildings, most of them in private ownership.  Notwithstanding the listings, we have witnessed the scandal of buildings being allowed to fall into disrepair to the dismay of the relevant local authority and activists.  We have seen bulldozers come in overnight to knock down some of these buildings.</P>
    <P>As the Minister outlined, the issue of funding for the protection and maintenance of listed buildings must be addressed.  I accept her assertion that the Bill is defective in this area.  I was interested to hear that Bord Fáilte, in its tourism development plan, referred to a property owning trust along the lines of the National Trust in England which involves business sponsorship and public funding.  Perhaps that is something which can be discussed at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The thatched cottage is part of our heritage and is a tourist attraction.  I am aware of a dedicated group of volunteers in my constituency, known as the Thatched Cottage Preservation Society of Fingal, who restored old thatched cottages as a pastime.  There is a grant scheme to preserve the thatched cottages, but there is a specification that the dwelling in question must be occupied prior to a grant being provided.  I urge the Minister to review the scheme to facilitate groups like that to which I referred who wish to rethatch buildings not to provide living accommodation but as an addition to our heritage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the financial support provided to local authorities though the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Renewal Development. In my constituency two villages, Lusk and Rush, have benefited from the village renewal scheme.  The £200,000 grant provided in 1995 for Lusk highlighted the cultural and tourist potential <Col N="1620" /> of the village by promoting and enhancing its history and buildings.  Furthermore, it is proposed to refurbish McCullin's church, which is also a listed building.  This year's allocation of £170,000 for Rush will make a huge contribution to the conservation of the village and its buildings.</P>
    <P>I am aware the future of urban renewal is being considered by the Minister and the Government.  This scheme, which offers incentive by way of tax relief and remissions where work on urban renewal is carried out on buildings located in areas designated by the Minister for the Environment, has been very successful.  The Minister will be aware that Balbriggan Town Commissioners and the Balbriggan Chamber of Commerce have made a submission to the Government outlining a case for designated area status for Balbriggan town.  Balbriggan, which was once an industrial town and has tremendous potential for growth, requires the benefit of urban renewal status and I urge the Minister to use his influence to secure this designation.</P>
    <P>I hope another planning Bill will be enacted during this Dáil.  With that in mind, I will make a few recommendations which, although outside the remit of this Bill, should be addressed in the context of any reform of our planning laws.  Since the 1993 Dublin County Council development plan, we witnessed the introduction of a new ploy by some developers and landowners.  They used the legitimate needs of voluntary, sporting and community organisations for pitches and halls as a lever to influence their case for rezoning.  Legislation should be enacted to counteract this and to enable the planning authority, if it so wishes, to put conditions in planning permission requesting that a contribution be made to amenity and recreational programmes in the area of the proposed development, something which is not provided for at present.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of planning which needs to be addressed is the problem and scandal of unfinished housing <Col N="1621" /> estates.  It is unacceptable that individuals and couples who have saved and mortgaged themselves to the hilt should have to wait ten to 15 years for their estates to be taken in hand and for the dedication of open spaces.  This problem is prevalent in my constituency and is caused by a minority of cowboy builders. To deal with this and to restore confidence in the planning code, I recommend to the Government that new planning legislation be enacted to enable the previous track record of builders to be taken into account when considering planning applications.  It is scandalous that builders can submit further applications while residents and mortgagees must live in unfinished estates for ten to 15 years.  Something must be done about that.</P>
    <P>Another issue which should be considered is the role of An Bord Pleanála and the fact that it does not have to abide by development plans drawn up by local authorities when considering planning appeals.  Given the importance of the issues raised during the debate, I hope the Government will give them the priority they deserve.  In the context of the promised legislation, I hope the broader planning issue which I raised will be addressed to ensure the planning system operates to the benefit of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter and I compliment Deputy Quill on bringing it to our attention.  I am aware that the Minister has proposals on our built heritage, of which we are the custodians. We have a rich built heritage of castles and country homes &mdash; some describe them as stately homes, but some of those buildings are falling into disrepair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately there is an element of vandalism involved in that the buildings are gutted and the slates, generally Blue Bangor which are not available today, are used in the building of modern homes.  Much of the stone work in these buildings is also irreplaceable.  There should be a preservation order on all <Col N="1622" /> such buildings, whether occupied or not, so that nobody interferes with them without the permission of the local authority. It would not be possible to deal with this matter at a higher level; it must be done at local level.  There is a belief that all such buildings should be preserved.</P>
    <P>In some cases these buildings are sold to people who use the materials in modern constructions.  That is outrageous and we will be failing in our duty if we continue to allow that to happen.  Those buildings were handed down to us and we should preserve them for future generations. We have the craftsmanship to restore them, although I thought at one time that we no longer had those skills. Young people are trained under FÁS schemes to carry out restoration work in graveyards, old buildings and mills.  I am amazed at the improvements that have taken place in that regard.  I am delighted that crafts are still practised and they should be fostered.  There should be no cutting of corners by Government agencies in terms of funding. The necessary funding should be made available to restore buildings and preserve them for future generations.</P>
    <P>I support the case made by Deputy Ring for a stately home and estate which is being desecrated by a local authority.  That is unacceptable.  Local authorities should not be allowed carry out the type of work proposed for that estate, which will destroy it forever. That is an illustration of the damage done by local authorities and Government agencies.  I hope the Minister and his officials will take note of this matter.</P>
    <P>Many fine houses, castles and stately homes were built 200 or 300 years ago. There was great foresight in the building of those premises and in the landscaping, which took years to bring to fruition. That work should not be destroyed with one fell swoop of a chainsaw or bulldozer.  We will never be forgiven if we allow that to happen.  I am sure that as a result of the efforts of people such as Deputy Quill and the Minister such buildings will be preserved. The Minister, Deputy <Col N="1623" /> McManus, for whom I have high regard, is committed to this matter and has shown that interest on a number of visits to my county relating to housing schemes and inquiries about old buildings, of which she was aware.</P>
    <P>Five years ago Cavan County Council debated the question of the courthouse in Cavan town, a magnificent building which was greatly in need of restoration. The argument arose as to whether the building should be restored or demolished and replaced by what some engineers from the Office of Public Works term a purpose-built buildings.  The restoration programme was estimated to cost £3 million while the purpose-built building was estimated at £1.5 million. Other important works in the county, such as road improvements and so on, were the subject of public debate over the years and it was difficult to convince councillors that restoration work should be carried out on the courthouse.  I commend everybody involved in the decision, which was not an easy one, to restore the building.  When the President recently visited the area she admired the building, of which we are proud.  That is one example of what can be done if the will is there and the people are prepared to support such projects.</P>
    <P>I regret I have not more time to speak on this matter.  I commend Deputy Quill on bringing forward the Bill.  I fully support the programme of work proposed and I will be interested to see whether the proposals are set down in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who has had the opportunity to visit our offices in Kildare House, across the road from Leinster House, will have seen a plaque on the wall stating that Sydney Owenson &mdash; Lady Morgan &mdash; lived on that site.  People who ramble through the city will be aware that there are countless such plaques throughout Dublin.  In many cases the original buildings have been demolished.  There is widespread agreement in this House and elsewhere <Col N="1624" /> that the current system of preserving our built heritage is inadequate.  That concern is reflected in the Programme for Government which includes a commitment to place the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis and to introduce incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of these buildings.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister, Deputy McManus, outlined some of the progress made in this regard.  The report of the inter-departmental working group is currently under consideration.  The urban and village renewal sub-programmes address some of the issues involved in the decline of our built environment.  Much more needs to be done, however, and I look forward to the introduction of an integrated package of measures which will conserve what remains of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct that we should not introduce legislation until the whole range of related measures has been finalised.  Anybody who takes a casual stroll through the streets of Dublin's inner city will realise the need to conserve what remains of our capital's built environment.  Approximately 200 years ago the finest examples of Georgian architecture outside Bath in England were to be seen in Dublin, but much of that grandeur was deceptive.  Behind the very impressive facades of St. Stephen's Green, Mountjoy Square, North Great George's Street, Henrietta Street and so on lay a world of great prosperity and alongside it abject poverty and exploitation; they existed cheek by jowl.  Dublin consisted of the inner city and suburbs such as that where I live in Terenure were little more than outlying villages.  The trade needed to support the capital was carried on within the inner city area, in the Liberties, Smithfield and in the docks area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must preserve not only the Georgian and Regency architecture for which Dublin is famous but also the vernacular architecture, including the artisan houses and cottages &mdash; one of which I grew up in &mdash; which have an important <Col N="1625" /> architectural lineage in regard to the history of the city.  Those houses made the city what it is today.  We must also conserve examples of industrial architecture which are unique in our city.</P>
    <P>The architectural decay we are debating is not a recent phenomenon. Around the middle of the 19th century the administrative, cultural and commercial centre of Dublin moved south of the Liffey, abandoning the Georgian squares and avenues of the north city to rack-renting landlords who gradually turned some of our finest buildings into tenements.</P>
    <P>In this century Dublin has had to contend with examples of depressingly designed architecture which produced monstrosities.  We are all familiar with Liberty Hall and O'Connell Bridge House.  One side of St. Stephen's Green was sacrificed to the mania for mirrored glass and brick and the first phase of the civic offices is now known to a generation of Dubliners as &ldquo;the bunker&rdquo;. Those buildings were erected on a unique archaeological site at Wood Quay.  I acknowledge that the second phase of the civic offices is a welcome addition to Dublin's streetscape and I would like to see more buildings of such an exemplary quality.  It is a magnificent development that should be applauded.</P>
    <P>We do not need pastiches of our past but an innovative cultural and architectural excellence which will produce a legacy of fine buildings, such as the second phase of the civic offices, we can pass on to future generations.  We must ensure that the architecture of today will be worthy of conservation in the future.</P>
    <P>When I speak of conservation I do not mean simply putting a blanket preservation order on every structure built 100 or 200 years ago.  The Georgian and Victorian eras were as prone to architectural lapses as our own generation and the challenge facing us is to achieve harmony between the past and the present.</P>
    <P>Dublin is not the only city or town that has suffered from examples of ill considered development.  I understand <Col N="1626" /> Drogheda Corporation is proposing to allow a shopping centre to be built on a medieval and archaeological site against the advice of the Office of Public Works.  Conservation means more than simple architectural preservation; it means preserving buildings and monuments which have particular historical and cultural associations.</P>
    <P>I find it profoundly depressing that there is a proposal to demolish the James Joyce home in Drumcondra and replace it with an apartment block.  I hope that plan will not come to fruition and the house will not only be preserved but restored to its original grandeur.</P>
    <P>We urgently need to devise a simple non-bureaucratic mechanism under which the local authority preservation lists can be added to as required.  A great deal of procedure must be gone through when one discovers that a building cannot be protected because it is not listed.</P>
    <P>Much of the damage to which I refer has been passive rather than active.  For every building of debatable architectural merit erected in recent decades, a dozen buildings of real value have been allowed to fall into decay.  As a member of Dublin Corporation I see the evidence of that neglect on a regular basis. The civic offices which I praised a moment ago were built beside the Casey house, the oldest continuously inhabited building in Dublin.  It was built in the 17th century and it stands on its own supported on either side by wooden buttresses and is now steel framed to keep it standing.  That is one of the many buildings waiting for politicians to finally take action and call a halt to this type of neglect.</P>
    <P>Much of the architectural vandalism, active and passive, was perpetrated on our capital city while Fianna Fáil was in office.  I welcome its belated conversion to the cause of conservation and look forward to its co-operation when this Government introduces measures to address the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a shock because I do not believe it will happen. I welcome the Bill because it addresses many important issues in the planning and heritage areas.  I congratulate Deputy Quill on introducing it.  I am sure the Deputy, like all of us, will accept that the Bill is not perfect.  No <Col N="1628" /> Bill that comes before this House is perfect but listening to the Minister of State last night one would think that every Bill must be perfect.  Bills are not always perfect when they come before this House but our work allows us to perfect them.  I am certain this Bill can be amended and improved in committee and we would all like to participate in that process.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had a Bill in preparation which addressed some of the issues dealt with in Deputy Quill's Bill.  We would be happy for that Bill to go into committee and for our amendments to be considered, rather than a separate Bill being produced.  In other words, the two Bills could be married.  I look forward to the Government accepting this Bill and sending it to a special committee so that we can consider amendments.</P>
      <P>A number of issues need to be addressed, some of which are mentioned in the Bill.  We favour the idea of preserving streetscapes rather than single buildings.  Listed buildings should be put on a statutory footing, a move we support and will pursue.  Heritage officers should be appointed to continually police the use of listed buildings and ensure they are not totally neglected or destroyed, as has happened to many buildings.  We are all aware of examples.</P>
      <P>We favour the imposition of severe penalties for neglect of listed buildings or actions that lead to the destruction of such buildings.  In particular, we should use the planning code in a more effective way by applying severe penalties for planning breaches where listed buildings are involved.</P>
      <P>The Grammar School in Drogheda is an example of the type of destruction that can occur under our planning code. They are some of the areas we would like to see addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy McManus, said last night that if we enact legislation without the necessary administrative and financial support we only bring our legislation into disrepute. I am delighted the Minister of State has <Col N="1629" /> been converted to some form of rational behaviour.  Her party in Opposition had instant answers to everything, but in Government, it appears to take a different approach to this and many other issues.  The Minister of State appears oblivious to the fact that the Government's failure to act in the past 19 months by not addressing the issues in this Bill has brought the Government and its promises into disrepute.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents all-party concern and consensus about the problems with our built heritage.  The Minister of State, in her remarks last night and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, injected an unnecessarily partisan and shrill tone to the debate.  Her facetiousness was underlined by the paucity of the Government's record over the past 19 months.  The Government has produced nothing in this area except an unpublished report.  It will not be published but circulated to Ministers so they can prevaricate for another period of months, perhaps for as long as they remain in Government.  The Minister of State should announce tonight that the report will be published in tandem with Committee Stage consideration of this Bill.  The only acceptable alternative to this legislation is a better proposal from the Minister of State and that has not been forthcoming.  I hope this Bill will be allowed to go to committee.</P>
    <P>In listing the shortcomings of the Bill, the Minister of State highlighted the extent of her activity over the past 19 months.  The Government's response was churlish and unfortunate.  The Minister of State has successfully undermined whatever credibility this Government had on the conservation issue.  My colleagues, Deputies de Valera and Ryan, have set out in detail the Fianna Fáil response to the Bill and our general policy on built heritage.</P>
    <P>I will briefly underline the many positive aspects of this Bill.  New and valuable legal definitions of what constitutes built heritage are introduced.  Sections dealing with the interiors and surrounds of houses afford, for the first time, legal <Col N="1630" /> protection to this part of our built heritage. The exclusion of demolition of listed features from the planning process will be ended.  The Bill provides for mandatory listing of all buildings constituting the built heritage.  These provisions must constitute the basis of any effective programme of action in this area.  The Minister of State last night identified these measures as essential. However, in pointing out the problems that would be encountered in implementing the Bill the Minister of State, perhaps without meaning to, offered a litany of the actions the Government has failed to take on this issue in the past 19 months.</P>
    <P>The destruction of our built heritage continues apace.  There were many references in this debate to 15 Usher's Quay, location for James Joyce's short story &ldquo;The Dead&rdquo;, which is practically derelict.  We can offer many other examples of neglect throughout the country.  There are also many examples of built heritage that are under immediate threat.  Relentless pressure from commercial forces is more corrosive than the preceding years of neglect.  It is extraordinary that the Government, whose programme included an explicit commitment to protect our built heritage, opposed this worthwhile measure while failing to bring forward even one positive Government proposal.  That the responsible Minister of State choose to oppose it in a gratuitously partisan fashion has added insult to injury.  She added further injury through her attitude on the radio this morning.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year my colleague. Deputy Ryan, produced a Fianna Fáil policy paper on Georgian Dublin.  It set out a comprehensive policy for the preservation and rejuvenation of our Georgian heritage.  Before the publication of this Bill, Fianna Fáil was working on its own Private Members' Bill to deal with listed buildings and their interiors.  It is unacceptable that the Opposition parties, despite their paltry resources, can produce programmes and Bills while the Government can produce nothing in a period of 19 months.  It underlines the <Col N="1631" /> fact that there is no real commitment to this issue on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The carping response by the Minister of State has effectively ended the previous bipartisan and constructive approach of all parties to this issue. Fianna Fáil is no longer prepared to accept the bona findes of the Minister of State and her colleagues on heritage issues.  I view with suspicion the failure to produce the interdepartmental report on preservation.  This Bill was published weeks ago and there is no good reason the report could not have been available by now.  There is also no good reason it should not be made available to the public.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Quill on her work.  The Government's response has been disgraceful.  The Minister of State could offer nothing positive but excuses about needing time to study the report which is already on hand.  She had not studied the report although I would have expected somebody who had the task of responding to this Bill to have at least studied the report in great detail. The arrogance displayed by the Minister of State would do credit to somebody who had been in office for at least a decade and who had totally lost touch with reality and the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the Government will not produce a Bill on this issue.  The report is now being studied by a number of Ministers and, as I know from my experience as Chief Whip, it will take a considerable period for even heads of a Bill to be produced.  A Bill will not be produced by this Government before it leaves office.  Is it not ironic that last evening a Democratic Left Minister of State, in an effort to postpone doing <Col N="1632" /> anything about conservation, should have spent time defending the rights of speculators and property owners, indicating another U-turn on the part of Democratic Left?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State present, Deputy Carey, and his colleague in the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jim Higgins, who I gather will be addressing the House later, not to oppose this Bill.  A couple of weeks ago people on the Government side of the House accused us of opposing the principle of light rail because we voted against a Second Reading of the earlier Bill.  We have explained why we did so, which I hope is accepted.  Despite the fact that there are many other ways in which they can prevent the progress of this Bill, if members of the Government parties troop through the lobbies and vote against the principles of this Bill this evening they must acknowledge that they are voting against the preservation of our heritage, something for which the public will not easily forgive them.</P>

      <P>I join my party colleagues in complimenting Deputy Quill on her initiative on having had this worthwhile Bill drafted and introduced. Deputy Eoin Ryan, who published our party's policy position for Georgian Dublin, committed us in Government to the implementation of measures to rejuvenate Dublin's inner city.  Such measures must not be confined to Dublin. The implementation of similar schemes in provincial and other towns, regardless of size, would be of major benefit in their regeneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the present requirement for the listing of buildings is inadequate, in addition to not providing the necessary practical protection.  There is also renewed interest in and appreciation of conservation and preservation of our heritage <Col N="1633" /> and culture.  Two important Bills were put through both Houses by the previous Government &mdash; the National Monuments Bill and the Heritage Council Bill &mdash; representing a further important administrative landmark in the identification, cultivation and preservation of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>There is recognition that all of our citizens should have easy access to arts activities, that areas of cultural and heritage value should receive the attention and care they merit.  Hopefully, future generations will not look back to this one and claim that we did not adequately protect our heritage, but rather will be in a position to say that in this respect adequate care and attention was exercised.</P>
    <P>The restoration of many buildings to a proper state of repair is beyond the means of many property owners who, if not given grant assistance or tax relief, will have no option but to allow them continue to deteriorate.  In such instances State assistance would be more than justified.</P>
    <P>Our school and educational institutions have a vital role to play in the nuturing and preservation of our heritage, providing young people with plenty of opportunities to engage in projects highlighting the heritage of their localities.  These projects give much greater meaning and historical relevance to them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps none of us attaches sufficient significance to the work of the many historical societies who have carried out important work and contributed so much to the preservation of our heritage. For example, I am aware of the very valuable work undertaken by societies such as those in Breffni in Cavan and Farney in Monaghan and the Armagh and Donegal societies.  In many instances these are the only vehicles creating an awareness of the richness of our heritage while simultaneously highlighting the need to maintain and preserve those riches.  Voluntary local groups can play a key role in the preservation and management of our rich history. The villages and towns urban <Col N="1634" /> renewal scheme provided the Minister for the Environment and his Department with a valuable opportunity to carry out much needed improvements to regenerate our many towns and villages.</P>
    <P>In the course of marking the 150th anniversary of that unfortunate, desperate period in our history, the Great Famine, I appeal to the Government to pay special attention to the many workhouses, particularly those that remain intact, which should be identified and sensibly restored.  In my home village of Bawnboy in County Cavan the local authority is anxious to undertake restoration work but has not the necessary resources.  It would be a worthwhile exercise on the part of our Department of the Environment, with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, to engage in a joint programme on the conservation of buildings and other artefacts of historic or heritage value throughout this island. We should remember that we share the heritage of this island, something which could be usefully built on within an all-Ireland context.</P>
    <P>Prominent buildings do not represent the only features of our heritage in need of protection.  Sites and, in some instances, semi-derelict buildings of historic and heritage value need to be identified and protected.  This could lead to many other worthwhile developments.</P>
    <P>One of my hobbyhorses is the development of monastic sites from a tourist point of view.  The development of island monastic sites on the River Erne would create an alternative tourist amenity based on two central features &mdash; their location on major navigational waterways and rich, historic and archaeological content.  While endeavouring to promote alternative tourist attractions and amenities, the Government should give such proposals adequate consideration. I have in mind St. Mogue's Island, Drumlane and Trinity Islands in my own county and Boa, White and Devenish Islands in the neighbouring county of Fermanagh.  The similarities and differences between such monastic sites would be an interesting theme to <Col N="1635" /> develop and provide a useful alternative tourism product within the South Ulster region.  A survey undertaken of holidaymakers to this country some years ago indicated that 65 per cent visited historical sites, further underlining the importance of our heritage and the need for its preservation and enhancement.</P>

      <P>Ag an am chéanna dúirt an tAire Stáit, An Teachta McManus, gur Bille maith é agus go bhfuil gá leis.  Chuala mé ar an raidio ar maídin go bhfuil An Taisce an-shásta leis chomh maith.</P>
      <P>It appears the Government has forgotten its <i>raison d'être</i>, which is to prepare and introduce good legislation and work in a democratic manner with other parties whenever good ideas emerge rather than oppose them merely for that sake.</P>
      <P>We heard a spokesperson for An Taisce questioned about this Bill this morning when he pointed out that it was good, that he could not see anything wrong with it but that it was important that the necessary resources should be made available to ensure its successful implementation, something to which the Government should be devoting attention. It appears the Government does not want anybody else to have the credit for its introduction.  This is very shortsighted and counter-productive since it will postpone the introduction of another Bill which we shall await with bated breath.  Yesterday we debated the Control of Horses Bill which had been in course of preparation since the Minister for Social Welfare was a member of The Workers' Party.  In the event of the Government rejecting this Bill, I hope it will indicate some deadline for the introduction of an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> I compliment those organisations that have exerted pressure on Government to ensure that a Bill would be introduced. An Taisce is one of those organisations but, as Deputy Brendan Smith said, many historical societies around the country have done trojan work in reawakening citizens to the heritage disappearing before their very eyes.  I also compliment Fingal County Council on some of its restoration work.  This must be contrasted with its plans for the town park in Swords on which it is proposed to erect a county hall.  This is a travesty of urban planning.  No doubt An Taisce would agree.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this Bill will be dependent on the necessary resources being made available.  Dublin is cited as an example, but it is important to compare Dublin with other cities.  A friend who returned from Lisbon told me that although there are many old buildings there they are inhabited and the people there respect their heritage.  The city had a lived in feeling, which is an attraction.  Too often Dublin has been associated with a large number of derelict buildings and many of them have remained derelict for too long.  That needs to be addressed through legislation.</P>
    <P>In the past there was a lack of appreciation of our built heritage, particularly the interiors of buildings, and the substance of this Bill, in essence, addresses that area.  I hope the message will be heard and that this area will be addressed in legislation.  Too often the owners of high quality heritage property have relied on tax incentives, which are limited in scope.  Such incentives have encouraged large corporations to become involved in property speculation for the sole purpose of tax benefits without any great appreciation of the built heritage.  Many old buildings that were supposedly refurbished, have been gutted.  The facades have been left standing starkly like a skeleton and the interiors have been <Col N="1637" /> torn apart and rebuilt similar to a Legoland structure.  That must stop as it is making a mockery of our built heritage.</P>
    <P>Anomalies in legislation, such as stamp duty charged on old buildings, must be addressed.  New house buyers enjoy a first time buyer's grant and given an incentive to buy a new house rather than encouraged to buy and sensitively restore an old one.  That must change.</P>
    <P>Another factor that discourages people from making use of old buildings is that while many of them probably housed the nobility in the past, present day owners who wish to subdivide them to make them practical living quarters must pay extra stamp duty.  If one subdivides an old building one must pay double the stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Many organisations, housing associations and charitable trusts are very keen to take charge of old buildings, but they are dealing with an unfair system. Large corporations and venture capitalists, who arguably do not have any great appreciation of the built heritage, can buy up old buildings and need only comply in a minimalist fashion with the rules.  Organisations, which do not have the necessary funds and cannot avail of tax incentives, but whose members have the necessary expertise, but not the finance, are discriminated against and the old buildings suffer as a result.  It is important that point is made.  Until we change the law, we are writing a charter not for protecting our heritage, but for speculators, large property developers and people who pretend to care for their heritage, but take advantage of it for tax reasons.</P>

    <P>D'eist mé le an-chuid de na Teachtaí <Col N="1638" /> a labhair inné agus inniu agus glacaim len a lán de na bun-phrionsabail a luaigh siad.  Caithfimid céimeanna a thógaint mar fhreagra ar na ceisteanna a d'árdaigh siad.</P>
    <P>Contributors from all sides of the House during the past two days spoke of the need to better protect our built heritage.  I and the Government share their concerns.  We have given a commitment in our policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to improve the protection of listed buildings, to introduce incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of these important buildings, and we will fulfil this commitment. We should respond to the anomaly that arises in respect of a listing that describes the external appearance of properties while internal aspects have been allowed to be defiled.</P>
    <P>To ensure a coherent and comprehensive approach to the important question of strengthening the protection of our architectural heritage, I and the Minister for the Environment jointly established an interdepartmental working group to look at all aspects of the matter and to make recommendations.  The group presented its report within the past few days.  This will now be examined urgently by other Government Departments and the Government will then consider the matter and publish its proposals.  Deputy Dempsey said he did not believe the report would be published and he challenged the Minister to give a clear undertaking that it would.  It will be published but it is reasonable that we should have an opportunity to reflect on it and prepare our response. That publication with one on our architectural heritage could probably be published together to inform the debate and encourage a proper response.  I said I am not hostile &mdash; and neither is the Minister for the Environment &mdash; to the spirit of this Bill or its intention.  I welcome the concern that motivates it.  The structure of the Bill and the constitutional problems it throws up as well as administration problems, including its implications for planning law and some other legal aspects, deserve attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> I will concentrate on the question of the inventory of the architectural heritage. It is well accepted internationally that an inventory is an essential prerequisite to taking action for the protection of the architectural heritage, the baseline for initiating policy.  An inventory is the basic management tool for any resource and it facilitates the formulation and implementation of policy with respect for the preservation of cultural property.  Only after a systematic programme of identification, classification and evaluation of the architectural heritage has been carried out, can informed judgments be arrived at and a planned programme of preservation put in place, using a combination of legislative safeguards and financial incentives. I listened sympathetically to the points made and acknowledge that a combination of these two factors will probably achieve the best result.</P>
    <P>International recognition of the importance of an inventory is expressed in the European Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage, usually referred to as the Granada Convention.  In response to the commitments of the convention, the Office of Public Works undertook to establish a national inventory of architecture, commencing in 1991.  Complementing the Archaeological Survey of Ireland which uses 1700 AD as a rough cut-off point, the National Inventory of Architecture concentrates on recording post-1700 buildings and structures.  As a national survey, compiled by a single central authority, the initiative is attempting to achieve a standard of consistency that will remain uniform throughout the country and which can be relied upon to give clear and impartial guidance to those involved in the preservation of the architectural heritage.  The success of the aforementioned Archaeological Survey of Ireland is testimony to the value of undertaking a full inventory.  The publication of the Sites and Monuments Record has seen the information collected from that survey used to enhance the value of the archaeological heritage <Col N="1640" /> and save it from destruction.  Responsibility for the archaeological and architectural inventories has now been transferred to my Department.  That baseline archaeological survey informed the legislation.  It set out the field that had to be addressed by way of legislation and it will inform policy which, in turn, will be a mixture of legislation and incentives.  When one knows the state of the field and has a consistency of practice, one can aim for best practice, which is very important.</P>
    <P>The completion of an architectural inventory will necessarily have a long timescale.  The inter departmental working group suggested that even if the full target is to be achieved within a reasonable timescale, for example 25 years, the resources available need to be increased substantially.  The figure of 25 years may appear unduly long, but I am told it is comparable to that required in other countries for such an inventory.  Clearly, we will need to adopt a two-speed approach and this view is supported by the working group which recommended a preliminary listing survey.  We should set a target of about three years for the completion of this preliminary survey which would identify most of the buildings that deserve to be listed and preserved, provided adequate staff and financial resources can be made available. This must be done without compromising the high standards set for the National Inventory of Architecture.  In doing that, I and the Minister for the Environment, are sensitive to the anomaly that has been thrown up in a listing that describes the external physical structure of a building but seems to omit the integrity of the interior.  Members have given examples of how that anomaly can lead to the destruction of an old building and we are <i>ad idem</i> in trying to address that.</P>
    <P>I regard the carrying out of this preliminary survey as an essential element of the package required to ensure the protection of the architectural heritage. I hope that real progress will be made on this and on the other elements, that <Col N="1641" /> is the enactment of appropriate legislation to which the Government is committed and the provision of financial incentives in the light of the report which we have received from the working group.  It is my intention and that of the Minister for the Environment to publish the report to inform the debate in the period prior to the Government introducing legislation.  We will have an opportunity to consider it in detail. Other implications arise.  The working group's report clearly lays down the implications that arise for local authorities. It is important that any measures take into account the different levels of responsibility and implications for the State, the local authorities and private owners, and that we end up with something that is cohesive.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose this Bill in principle but in terms of the practical issues it throws up of a constitutional, legal and administrative kind.  When we bring forward legislation, financial incentives and codes of practice based on the inventories, the partnership we have with the Heritage Council will be very important.  Rather than risking the Bill being challenged on the basis of individual or collective constitutional and property rights, we should seek to address that possibility by structuring the Bill to protect it from such a challenge. In the context of best practice by planning authorities, it would be best if in matters of heritage, the Heritage Council, supported by legislation and an incentive scheme, was able as much as possible to work hand in hand with local authorities to achieve the best result.</P>
    <P>I reluctantly oppose the Bill on the basis that the legislation could be made more certain in some areas.  I appreciate the motivation and the spirit of its introduction, which I share.  I assure the House that many of the contributions made here will be taken into consideration in bringing forward the legislative implementation of the Government's programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nothing less than contemptible that a Cabinet Minister would <Col N="1642" /> come here this evening and not address a single feature of a Bill which has been under consideration by the House for the past two evenings.  The only direct reference to the Bill was when the Minister said there were features of it which might be unconstitutional.  He did not say what those features were.  He did not even do me the courtesy of telling me where this Bill might be found to be unconstitutional.  I regard this as a pathetic performance by any standards. However, I am heartended by the contributions of every other Member of the House who spoke this evening.  Having heard their contributions, their clear understanding of what now needs to be done, their commitment to the built environment and to the environment generally, and their deep knowledge of environmental issues, my deep regret is that this Bill will not now go to committee so that the experience and commitment of those Members could be harnessed to improve the Bill where it needs improvement.</P>
      <P>I support what was said by Deputy Michael Ring in respect of Westport House.  It is little short of an outrage that a local authority would propose to put a sewage treatment scheme in the heart of the grounds of Westport House, thereby constituting a gross interference with the integrity of the parkland that is an integral part of that fine house.  If this Bill was in place that could not happen, because my definition of what constitutes a building that must be conserved includes the concept of the curtilage or surrounding of that building, and that buildings must be judged in their natural and historic setting. This Bill would have prevented what is happening at Westport House.  I still hope that, with the commitment of people like Deputy Ring, what is proposed for Westport House will be averted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputies Boylan, de Valera, Eoin Ryan, and all the other Members from all parties who spoke in support of the Bill last evening.  I found it most heartening, and I am sorry that their expertise cannot be engaged in a more <Col N="1643" /> systematic way in the future shaping of our built environment.</P>
    <P>I listened with absolute disbelief, however, to the Minister of State, Deputy McManus in this House last evening and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning.  What she had to say on this Bill filled me with sadness more than anger.  It is patently obvious that the protection of our built environment is not a priority with this Government.  It is clear the Government has no legislation of its own at this point.  The Minister of State said so on radio this morni ing, there is no prospect of any Government legislation on this matter this side of the next general election.  In the full knowledge of this I brought forward the legislation which the Minister of State, and the Ministers here tonight, propose to vote down this evening.  I can say with absolute confidence that this is a good Bill.  It was carefully drafted and painstakingly prepared.  During the course of its preparation I consulted widely and repeatedly with bodies who have an interest and expertise in this area.  I studied legislation from other jurisdictions.  Expert opinion has assured me that my proposals are the correct onces.  Having said that, I do not claim this Bill is perfect.  That is why I said in my opening speech that I would very much appreciate it if the Government could see its way to puting the Bill into committee where it could be perfected as all Bills are in this House, whether they spring from a Government or an Opposition source.  That could and should have been done.  The Minister of State, Deputy McManus, in an unchallenged free run on radio this morning, accused me of not saying where the moneys could be found to finance this Bill.  That was her main argument for not supporting it.  In response let me say it is not permitted in the context of a Private Members' Bill to make proposals that put a direct charge on the Exchequer.  The Minister knows that. Had I so done, she would have had acceptable grounds for voting down this Bill.  It was dishonest of her to make that <Col N="1644" /> criticism on radio when there was nobody to contradict her statement.  My only response is that it was difficult for her to find any more substantial reason for voting against this Bill.  The poverty of spirit shown by the Government parties in regard to this Bill chills me.</P>
    <P>Money spent on conservation projects in other countries was considered a worthwhile investment in the cultural, social and economic well being of society.  In Northern Ireland about £10 million per year was spent on incentives for conservation purposes.  On this side of the Border it has been demonstrated repeatedly that moneys spent on good conservation projects have given a solid return in terms of tourist revenue.  The town of Kinsale, recently declared Ireland's best kept town, is a classic example.  There a number of beautifully restored 18th century buildings blend perfectly with a well maintained streetscape to give a distinctive style and ambience, making Kinsale a magnet for money spending visitors, Irish and foreign. All of this has been brought about because of the healthy interaction between an innovative county architect and an enlightened commercial community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and good support from central government.  There are several examples of towns being enlightened enough to carry out such conservation projects.  Their argument, unlike that made by the Minister of State, Deputy McManus this morning, is that we cannot afford not to do conservation work.  It is very sad to see this Government lagging so far behind the thinking of our citizenry.  We have a mature, well educated citizenry.  We can afford better standards of environmental protection than this Government is prepared to advance.  Even as we speak there is widespread destruction of so much of the rich heritage of our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> Our biggest single problem, as outlined tonight by Deputy Sargent, is the silent insidious gutting of the interiors of buildings that goes on week after week unmonitored and undocumented for two reasons.  First, we have no mandatory listing system; second, interiors of buildings are not included in the current optional listing system.  We have proposed two ways in the Bill in which those loopholes could be rectified but the Bill will be voted down tonight.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow, the following day and the day after, fine squares such as Merrion Square, Mountjoy Square and St. Stephen's Green will be insidiously destroyed.  As we speak Nos. 82 and 83 Merrion Square are under threat and wholesale demolition is under way behind the facade of the birth place of Edward Carson.  In the next few weeks we will see the demolition of the Light House Cinema and three other buildings in Abbey Street.  The Adelphi Cinema will be replaced by yet another high rise carpark.  I spoke last night, and Deputy Dempsey spoke this evening, about the tall gaunt house at 15 Ushers Island where James Joyce set his poignantly beautiful story &ldquo;The Dead&rdquo; which subsequently became a film.  That building has now been thoroughly vandalised. That is happening daily.  Blatant breaches of planning permission go unpunished.  For example, Dublin corporation has a backlog of 1,200 enforcement complaints.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives amended and extended powers to local government and were set in the context of what we believe to be imminent local government revitalisation. The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, had promised the same.  Listening to the obstacles the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, put in place last night it is obvious there is no urgency about reforming local government.</P>

      <P>That was one of the reasons this Bill was acceptable to a number of people.  People took the Minister at his word and believed he would devolve the function and finance to enable local government to undertake the type of work I outlined in this conservation Bill.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say there may be a prospect of implementing some of the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In our Bill we propose a carefully balanced mix of planning controls and tax relief type incentives.  This prescription works elsewhere and it would work here, of that I have been assured, but it is clear to me from what has been said this evening by a Cabinet Minister that it will take three years before we have the inventory in place, before we can begin to frame this type of legislation.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister clarified that point.  In the Bill we propose that every local authority should carry out an audit in its own area.  That would certainly shorten the time span and we could use where necessary the expertise of the newly appointed heritage council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of what has been said by Deputies from all parties the Minister should change the decision announced in the House and not vote down this Bill.  If Members defeat it they too are voting against conservation. If the Government decides to vote against the principle of conservation then let it be on the heads of its members.  If this Bill had been proposed by a member of the Labour Party or the Democratic Left Party in Opposition and had been voted down by the then Fianna Fáil Party in Government, I can imagine the howls of <Col N="1648" /> derison from spokespersons from Labour or Democratic Left.  They would say that members of Fianna Fáil were no more than speculators, a party of gombeen-men. We know who are the gombeen-men.</P>

      <P>If the Government votes down this Bill this evening that is what will be said of it.  This is good legislation and there is no alternative or prospect of one on the Government's list.  This is the best available Bill.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister not to vote down this Bill but rather to support it and let it go to Select Committee where it can be improved and perfected.  That can be done in the coming months and we can then give to the built heritage the kind of protection for which people have called.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for agreeing to consider this Bill at such short notice and to taking all Stages today.</P>
      <P>This is a short, essentially technical Bill which has the main objective of confirming the powers of State bodies to engage in capital financing transactions, including, in particular, finance leases. Its provisions and the background to it are summarised in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill for the convenience of Deputies.  Before addressing the Bill, it would be useful if I said a few words about the wider context.</P>
      <P>Over the last decade or so, there has been phenomenal growth in the area of financial services both at home and abroad.  That was the result of many factors, including the world-wide liberalisation of financial markets and of international payments and capital movements.  Helped by constantly improving technology, it has been accompanied by an ever-increasing sophistication in the financial instruments developed in response to the requirements of market participants to reduce the costs of borrowing and to minimise the risks caused by fluctuating interest and exchange rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has benefited from these developments as witnessed by the growth of our own financial sector and <Col N="1651" /> the success of the International Financial Services Centre.  In regard to the latter, the direct incremental employment created by the IFSC now stands at over 3,000, most of it highly paid, and many more jobs have been created in ancillary areas such as accountancy and law.  The growing complexity and sophistication of the financial services area, with its potential for achieving savings, was one of the reasons for the Government's decision in 1990 to establish the National Treasury Management Agency with the specific purpose of exercising the borrowing and debt management functions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The private commercial sector has been very quick to exploit the potential benefits of new financial instruments for their capital financing needs.  However, our big commercial State bodies have been equally adept in this area.  Indeed, given their need to finance sizeable capital programmes, these bodies have developed a particular expertise and sophistication in the use of capital financing instruments.  One of the mechanisms they use to this end is the finance lease.  A finance lease is a contract under which an asset is purchased by a party other than the user, usually a financial institution, which, by availing of capital allowances etc., can reduce the cost of financing to the user, that is, the lessee.  The lessee, in such an arrangement, assumes all the risks and rewards of ownership, other than legal title to the asset.  Such leases are commonplace and are widely used as an alternative to direct borrowing to acquire assets because it is more cost-effective.</P>
    <P>A number of State bodies have acquired assets in recent years by way of finance leases.  The total value of outstanding finance leases for commercial State bodies was £575 million at the end of 1995.  Of this, £72 million carried a State guarantee.  I now come to the purpose of this Bill.  The existing powers of State bodies to borrow funds are for the greater part enshrined in the laws governing the operations of these bodies.  In 1992, however, the Oireachtas passed <Col N="1652" /> the Financial Transactions of Certain Companies and Other Bodies Act which confirmed that State bodies generally could effect contracts involving instruments such as swaps and options, or derivatives.  This Act was necessary because a ruling in the UK on the use of derivatives by local authorities cast doubt on the powers of our State bodies to trade in derivatives.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar situation has now arisen in relation to finance leases. While some State bodies have explicit statutory authority to contract finance leases, others do not.  It is the authority of the letter to engage in such leases which is now in question.  Up to recently, no doubts were ever raised about this issue nor about the powers of the Minister for Finance to provide State guarantees in respect of these transactions.  The consensus of all interested parties, including the financial institutions, was that this power was implicit in existing legislation governing the borrowing powers of the State bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>Recently, however, doubts were expressed about the powers of a particular State body to contract a finance lease and about the applicability of a State guarantee to it.  Because of these doubts, financial institutions are reluctant to conclude any more finance leases with certain State bodies until the legal position in regard to their borrowing powers is clarified.  In light of this, my Department consulted the Attorney General's office who advised that express statutory power is required for State bodies to enter into finance lease agreements and that the Minister requires a similar power if he wishes to guarantee the resultant obligations of State bodies.  The implication of this advice is that existing finance leases contracted by State bodies, which do not have the necessary express statutory powers, may be <i>ultra vires</i> and so may any related State guarantees.</P>
    <P>Urgent action needs to be taken to rectify the situation I have just outlined because it is necessary to remove any doubt about the validity of the finance <Col N="1653" /> leases which certain State bodies have already entered into and of any associated State guarantees; State bodies should be able to access the range of commonplace capital financing instruments available to the private sector, and it is desirable to remove inconsistencies in the treatment, in existing legislation, of the borrowing powers of State bodies and of State guarantees.</P>
    <P>In addition to such action, I wish to avert the recurrence of a situation in which legal doubt may be cast in future over the powers of State bodies to engage in other normal capital financing transactions such as note issuance facilities, commercial paper etc.  At the moment, these instruments are considered by all parties, including financial institutions, as borrowing within the legal meaning of the term.  This is reassuring but only up to a point because, heretofore, finance leases had also been so regarded.  In view of this, I want to avoid a situation in which a future Minister for Finance has to come back to the Oireachtas with further primary legislation to clarify the borrowing powers of State bodies.</P>
    <P>I am not talking of anything of major significance here.  This Bill has very limited application and is doing no more than confirming that State bodies have the powers which a private sector company could assume by simply altering its memorandum and articles of association. Moreover, the Bill will not allow any of these bodies to engage in transactions unrelated to their statutory functions. The powers being confirmed by the Bill will only be exercised in accordance with specifications issued by the Minister for Finance following consultation with the relevant Minister, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Against the background I have sketched, the aim of the proposed legislation is to remove any ambiguity in the meaning of the term &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; or inconsistency in the treatment of borrowing in respect of common non-controversial capital finance instruments currently in use.  Having regard to the <Col N="1654" /> continuing evolution of financial markets and instruments, State bodies should, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners, have the legal authority to have recourse in the future to new financial instruments which become commonplace in financial markets.  To all these ends, I seek the approval of the Dáil to the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is intended this Bill will apply to bodies whose borrowing powers are subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, whether the consent of another Minister is required.  While there are more than 50 such bodies, the range of capital finance instruments most of them use is very limited.  The number of State bodies likely to make use of the powers confirmed by this Bill is quite small and mainly confined to the commercial State sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase in the limit on the borrowings which ACC Bank is permitted to undertake. This limit stands at £1,400 million and it is proposed to raise it to £2,400 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was established in 1927 to cater for the special funding needs of agriculture, in particular by way of the provision of long-term credit which was not readily available from other sources.  This narrow sectoral remit, and the economic difficulties of the early 1980s which adversely affected the agricultural sector, had very negative consequences for the ACC. Bad debts and increases in arrears reduced the profitability of the corporation, culminating in heavy losses in 1987.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1988, sought to redress the situation, in particular by granting powers to the corporation to broaden the base of its operations to reduce the risks of a loan portfolio based on a single sector.</P>
    <P>In the following years, the ACC turned the corner and is now heading for its ninth successive year of increasing profitability.  This process of recovery was aided by the passage of the ACC Bank Act, 1992, which removed <Col N="1655" /> entirely the remaining restrictions on lending outside the agriculture sector. That Act also changed the name of the organisation to ACC Bank plc to reflect the more diversified nature of the corporation's business.  It also increased the authorised share capital from £35 million to £50 million, and raised the limit on borrowing from £800 million to £1,000 million.  Finally, the 1992 Act brought ACC Bank within the prudential supervision of the Central Bank. This means that ACC Bank is now subject to the same rules as apply to the other credit institutions supervised by the Central Bank.  These rules relate in the main to capital adequacy, liquidity, categories of exposure, permissible charges, and deposit guarantee.</P>
    <P>As regards the purpose of the increase in the borrowing limit, it has to be borne in mind that the term &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo;, as it applies to banks, means the sum total of the deposits placed with them in addition to all other forms of borrowing.  Thus, when ACC Bank accepts a deposit from a customer, it increases its borrowing and its capital base at the same time.  This enables the bank to increase its lending and thus to expand its business.  In recent years, the bank has been attracting substantial deposits and growing at a strong rate.  In the past five years, retail deposits have more than doubled, from £443 million at 31 December 1990, to £964 million at end-1995.  The bank's total borrowings at 31 December 1995 amounted to £1,229 million, just £170 million short of the present ceiling on borrowing.  Business has continued to grow significantly in the current year with the strong probability that this ceiling will be reached towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Against that background of rapid expansion and without an increase in its borrowing limit, the bank would have to cease increasing its deposits and adding to its other forms of borrowing.  This would correspondingly limit its capacity to expand and could, thus, significantly <Col N="1656" /> damage its credibility.  It is now proposed to raise the ceiling to accommodate the operational needs of the bank.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the limit amounts to £1,000 million.  At the average rate of growth which has obtained in recent years, this should cover the bank's requirements for the next four to five years.  The reason for this major increase in the borrowing limit has to do with the bank's success in attracting new business particularly in the home and commercial mortgage sector.  However, unlike more established mortgage providers, ACC Bank does not have a portfolio of retiring mortgages to offset against new mortgage growth.  That all mortgage business undertaken by the ACC tends to be new business contributes to a higher rate of asset growth and, obviously, as the asset base grows, the underlying capital base must also rise.</P>
    <P>The performance of ACC Bank over the past few years, in an increasingly competitive market, is due in no small measure to the commitment of the board, the management and the staff of the bank and I take this opportunity to commend their efforts and congratulate them on their continuing success.  That I should have to come to this House today to seek such an increase in the bank's borrowing limit is a reflection of the extent of that success.</P>
    <P>In preparing this legislation, my Department had detailed consultations with a wide range of organisations likely to be affected by it.  These included the State bodies mainly concerned, the Irish Bankers' Federation and the Irish Finance Houses Association.  All have expressed agreement with the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is essentially a technical one. It has been modeled on the Financial Transactions of Certain Companies and Other Bodies Act, 1992, which confirmed the powers of State bodies to trade in derivatives.  Section 1 is a standard provision related to the necessary definitions to be included in the legislation. As the definition of &ldquo;capital value&rdquo; relates to section 7, it would be best to elaborate on it when dealing <Col N="1657" /> with that section.  Section 2 defines the bodies to which the Bill applies.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 3(1) confirms the powers of the bodies concerned to engage in the specified list of capital financing transactions and enables the Minister, after consulting the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners, by order, to prescribe other capital financing transactions which these bodies may conduct.  The latter provision is designed to take account of the continuing development of financial mechanisms and the possibility that State bodies may, in future, wish to avail of an instrument not yet invented.  Subsection (2) enables the Minister, again after consultation with the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners, by order, to amend or revoke any previous order made under this or the preceding subsection. Subsection (3) relates exclusively to the class of transaction known as finance leases and is designed to give the Minister the authority to take account of any changes in definition which may be made to it as accountancy practice evolves.  Subsection (4) defines the terms &ldquo;finance lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;body&rdquo; for the purposes of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives the bodies concerned the power to charge their assets, or to provide indemnities, in respect of any of the specified transactions.  Section 5 provides that all existing provisions in respect of borrowings and guarantees, including requirements in relation to ministerial consent, will apply to all the transactions authorised by the Bill.  It also enables the Minister, after consultation with the relevant Minister where necessary, to determine the terms and conditions under which a State body may engage in any of the specified transactions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 extends all existing guarantee powers, rights and obligations of both Ministers and State bodies to the transactions specified in the Bill. Section 7 specifies the manner in which the borrowings of State bodies, and any <Col N="1658" /> related State guarantees, are to be calculated for the purposes of the statutory limits imposed by the Oireachtas.  These limits set ceilings on the financial exposure of State bodies, in the case of borowings, and of the State, in the case of guarantees.  To this end, it is necessary to ensure that any financial exposure or potential liability arising from a transaction authorised by this Bill is recorded by the State body concerned as borrowings for the purposes of the statutory limits on its borrowing and any related State guarantee.  The Bill relies on a specific definition of &ldquo;capital value&rdquo; in this regard, namely, the total value of the transaction less any inherent interest amounts and any amounts which do not constitute a legal liability on the body concerned.</P>
    <P>Finance leases do not consist of separate principal and interest payments as in the case of a normal term loan. However, in pricing a leasing contract, there is effectively an imputed or inherent interest element included in the payments.  For the purposes of determining the level of borrowing under this Bill, it is proposed that the amount borrowed will be calculated by reference to the nominal value of the payments less the inherent interest amounts.</P>
    <P>In the case of certain structured finance leases, a State body, as lessee, may secure its payment obligations to the lessor, by making a deposit with a third party who undertakes to make the necessary payments to the lessor. However, these structures may not allow the lessee to assign its legal liability for the lease payments to the third party.  In that situation, the liability to make the payments would fall back on the lessee, if for any reason the third party were to default on its payment obligations.  The Bill requires that any such potential liability or exposure be recognised for the purposes of both the borrowing limit and, where appropriate, the guarantee limit.</P>
    <P>Section 8 confirms that State bodies may contract leases other than finance leases.  The leases in question are <Col N="1659" /> operating leases which relate mainly to normal rentals such as office space and equipment.  As such, the section exempts them from the requirements which the Bill lays down for finance leases and other capital financing transactions.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for an increase in the borrowing limit of ACC Bank to £2,400 million from its present level of £1,400 million.  Section 10 is a standard provision in Bills which alter the powers of State bodies.  Sections 11 and 12 are standard to all legislation.</P>
    <P>I again express my thanks to Deputies for agreeing to deal urgently with this Bill which I now commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy agreed to take this Bill because of the necessity to clear up the confusion about the matter but, unfortunately, he is unable to be here this evening.</P>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises because some people have become so mesmerised by the words &ldquo;finance lease&rdquo; that it is regarded as a term of art and, as such, capable of being distinguished from the sort of transaction we would traditionally describe as a borrowing transaction. The Bill is full of vague attempts to pin down the term &ldquo;finance lease&rdquo; for fear that when this House gives it its imprimatur, some many headed hydra will emerge claiming the benefit of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draftsman failed to formulate a satisfactory definition of the term &ldquo;finance lease&rdquo; and has fallen back on a feeble substitute of what normal accountancy practices regard as a finance lease.  That is not acceptable.  If we are being asked to confirm existing types of transactions, let us do so more explicitly.  The combined effects of sections 3 and 8 leave everybody under the impression that not only must a Minister give consent to the transaction but he must also make an order under subsection (1) and-or (3) of section 3, specify terms and conditions under section 8(3) and-or requirements under <Col N="1660" /> section 5 (2) only after consultation with other relevant Ministers, and attend to any other matters that require attention before a ministerial guarantee is in place.</P>
    <P>Is this bureaucracy gone mad?  Who is questioning the extent of the borrowing powers of these bodies?  Who is querying the Minister's statutory power to guarantee?  My understanding of the legal position in regard to such powers is that the courts will always interpret powers specified in statute very widely to include, where not expressed by implication, everything that is incidental or consequential to the power itself. <i>Acts Reasonably Incidental</i> states:</P>
    <P>A statutory authority endowed with statutory powers has, as already mentioned, no common law powers at all: it can legally do only what the statute permits and what is not permitted is forbidden.  This is the strict doctrine of <i>ultra vires,</i> and it applies in full force to most of the organs of government.</P>
    <P>A statutory power will, however, be construed as impliedly authorising everything which can fairly be regarded as incidental or consequential to the power itself; and this doctrine is not to be applied narrowly.</P>
    <P>For example, a local authority may do its own printing and bookbinding; buses may be run a short distance beyond the end of the authorised route if there is no other practicable way of turning them around; housing authorities may charge differential rents according to their tenants' means, may subsidise their tenants, and may insure their effects; a Board charged with the organisation of the totalisator may make contracts with firms for the collection of off-thecourse bets, but may not subsidise one of the firms.  Statutory powers therefore have considerable latitude, and by reasonable construction, the courts can soften the rigour of the <i>ultra vires</i> principle.  Although this book contains so many instances of <Col N="1661" /> that principle being infringed, it must be remembered that the courts intervene only where the thing done goes beyond what can fairly be treated as incidental or consequential.</P>
    <P>Apart from the attitude of the courts regarding the actual statutory wording of the Act, can anybody doubt that the transactions of these statutory bodies in the ownership of the State will be honoured? Is it seriously being suggested that a ministerial guarantee does not mean what it says, that it is not worth the paper on which it is written?  Lawyers are being a little unreal in their analysis of this area of legal doubt.</P>
    <P>The bona fides of these bodies and of the Minister in these transactions can never have been in doubt.  I hope the provisions of this Bill do not mark the beginning of a number of corrective Bills on the basis that parties cannot rely on the intention and bona fides of a Minister.</P>
    <P>How often do the statutory bodies with which we are concerned use these finance leases?  Have there been difficulties with any of those transactions?  Is there a problem with any specific statutory body that has engaged in finance leasing?</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo; is used in sections 2 and 3 and it is defined in the definition section.  Are there any bodies established by or under statute whose power to borrow money is not subject to the consent of the Minister?  It is surely these bodies which have the problem the Minister described because where the Minister has consented in any other case, the third party from whom the body borrows has the assurance of a fall back position in as much as it may be assumed that the Minister, in consenting, is not disputing the body's power to borrow &mdash; quite the reverse.  It is almost a principal-agent relationship since presumably the Minister is the nominee shareholder and the owner of the body in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we find a ministerial guarantee underpinning the liabilities of <Col N="1662" /> the public body which is borrowing. There can be no room for doubt in such a case.  The Bill may open up a problem by limiting its provisions specifically to bodies borrowing with the consent of the Minister.  If any bodies are empowered to borrow without such consent, this Bill will not advance their legal position.</P>
    <P>As regards section 3 (1), will the bodies be deemed to have, and to have always had, the power to engage in the listed transactions without the consent of the Minister, which is how it reads to me?  The phrase &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo; is included by way of identifying the bodies concerned with the Bill.  If the Minister is saying the phrase &ldquo;in so far as they relate to borrowing or capital financing&rdquo; means that the permitted transactions must be in the nature of a borrowing transaction and, therefore, as before, subject to ministerial consent, I would disagree because capital financing is a much broader concept.  The Minister may say section 5 covers that point but I will argue later that it is the Achilles heel of the Bill, defeating the intention to retrospectively validate transactions which are now thought to be of suspect validity.</P>
    <P>The ministerial order mentioned in section 3 (1) and (2) is unnecessary if we refer back to the Statutory Declaration Act, 1938 which states that the power to make includes the power to unmake. Section 3 seems to duplication section 3 (1) and (2) in that &ldquo;a class of financial transactions&rdquo; is a sub species of finance lease.  This causes needless complication of section 3 (4) which defines the words &ldquo;finance lease&rdquo;.  Could we now define the words &ldquo;finance lease&rdquo; as a lease of capital equipment and leave it at that? The finance aspect relates to the tax affairs of the lessor-owner-financier.  It may affect the cost of leasing to the lessee but it does not affect the nature of the letting transaction which is what the Minister is trying to define.</P>
    <P>As regards section 5, inserting the consent of the Minister requirement <Col N="1663" /> into these transactions means that transactions in the past without such consent are not being retrospectively validated or confirmed by the Bill.  This legislation is not empowering; it is confirming power which already exists.  It is making an implied term express.  One cannot confirm an existing power and then add preconditions.  In most cases, the consent precondition is already in the bodies' empowering Act and this section will cause problems.</P>
    <P>As regards section 7, are these transactions not already counted as borrowings on the balance sheets of these bodies?  If not, how are they being treated by the accountants?  Is the Minister increasing the national debt by redefining these transactions as borrowings? How much is involved?  Are the other leases referred to in section 8 not borrowing transactions?  If not, what are they?  This section has not been well considered.  Why query the bodies' power to enter into leases where no borrowing is involved?  Has the Minister received legal advice on the validity of such leases?</P>
    <P>Three types of order are referred to in section 3.  The section should be dropped because there is no doubt about the power to lease premises, etc. The query raised is about &ldquo;finance leases&rdquo; with which this Bill should deal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to extend the borrowing limit of the ACC Bank, which will allow it to continue to grow and develop as it has done successfully over the past number of years under the leadership of the former chairman, Mr. Dan McGinn, who recently moved from that position.  I take this opportunity to commend him on the excellent work he did in turning around the bank and under whose guidance the bank grew to be strong, credible and profitable.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the Government's policy as regards the rumoured involuntary redundancies of staff of 50 years of age or over who have been responsible for turning around the fortunes of the ACC Bank.  Natural justice would dictate that there should be no <Col N="1664" /> forced redundancies.  Will the Minister elucidate the present policy position of the three Government parties as regards the third banking force?  Does the ACC Bank have a future in those plans?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation which appears on the surface to be simple and straightforward. However, there is a substantial element of retrospection which is not wise and it may be found to be unconstitutional. The Dáil should not give State companies retrospective powers.</P>
      <P>It is less than ten years since the jewel of our State trading companies, Irish Shipping, disappeared under an ocean of debt.  We are all aware of the hardship suffered by those involved for many years until my party dealt with the situation.  It appeared that the management did not believe it necessary to get board approval for leasing commitments, although it did have to revert to the board on capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>The board of a State company is seeking an urgent meeting with the Minister whose Department appointed it. Members of the board have told him they are only directors and they do not know about anything which any curious person would ask.  They have threatened to seek indemnity for doing something or for doing nothing.  I refer to the board of Bord na Moná which is still in the dark as regards the salary of its chief executive.  Directors of all State companies should be aware of the situation in relation to chief executives.  Perhaps it should be written into legislation.  This should also apply to the private sector in which inflated salaries are paid to people.  Certain people have been sacked and demoted.  This is a minefield not alone in this country but in the UK, from which we have learned.  There must be some change in salaries if the system is to operate properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the explanatory memorandum, one of the purposes of this Bill is to provide for finance leases.  If State companies in the trading sector made cumulative profits, which would not be an unreasonable request, they could <Col N="1665" /> avail of their own capital allowances and there would be no need for this Bill.  Is it the case that State bodies exceed, directly or indirectly, their borrowing powers without the Minister's consent, knowledge or approval?  Why did the Minister not find it necessary or desirable to introduce this Bill last year or in previous years?  The question of finance leasing goes back to the regin of the late Mr. George Coolley as Minister for Finance. State companies are protected to a considerable extent from the real world. This Bill, if enacted, would sanction further subsidisation, that would be acceptable if it is what the Oireachtas wishes, but we should be clear about what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is aware that implementation of this Bill would further facilitate financial institutions and other companies in reducing the amount of corporation tax they pay. Small companies find it much more difficult to get in on the act at times such as this.  Once again I ask the Minister to reduce the rate of corporation tax on small business instead of sponsoring this Bill, which will favour the big boys, however embarrassed they might be to avail of the Labour Party tax policy at the expense of the small business community. This Bill reinforces the influence of the Department of Finance in the running of State companies which come under the auspices of other Departments.  Should we not strive for the opposite, or does the Department of Finance believe that other Ministers are not to be trusted?  Is the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications happy with the further curbing of his powers?</P>
    <P>ACC, which was set up as an agricultural bank in difficult times, is today in limbo and a decision must be taken on its future.  I am critical of that institution because it is not interested in the borrowings of small farmers or small communities. In the last four or five years it was not interested in financing dairy farmers.  Its job should be to assist developing farmers who wish to improve their income and status in life, <Col N="1666" /> but it has failed in that regard.  The ACC bank has too much political influence, and political uncertainty is not good for society.  Last year there was great uncertainty when directors, who had a statutory right to be on the board of the bank, were threatened with removal.</P>
    <P>It is time the position regarding ACC was sorted out.  Consideration should be given to its amalgamation with a large agri-bank on the Continent, two of which, Casse Nationale de Credit Agricole in France, a very large bank, and RABObank in Holland, are interested in an amalgamation, merger or takeover. That matter should be considered.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about people who have accounts with the ACC, many of whom experience difficulty in clearing cheques.  It takes five days and sometimes longer to have a cheque cleared by ACC as against cheque clearing with Bank of Ireland of two days and with AIB, which has introduced an electronic system, of only one day.  There is need for change in that regard and an electronic system should operate across the board.</P>
    <P>The Government has put forward the idea of a third banking force, a bungled idea from three parties that do not know what direction to take.  Suggestions have been made with regard to the Trustee Savings Bank, a niche bank which has served the small borrower and investor and has a future role in Irish society.  The question of a third banking force is creating great uncertainty in the banking world.  I do not expect the Minister to deal with this matter because it is a matter for Cabinet. There is no room in society for a third banking force.  There should be no more talk about a third banking force resulting in cheaper money.  I know quite an amount about banking because I am in the borrowing business and I would prefer to deal with our two major banks than with ACC whose treatment of people in terms of security, borrowing and so on is unacceptable.  A third banking force will not improve the system.  At the end of the day it would <Col N="1667" /> probably result in a more expensive banking system.  It is time the Government clarified the position.  There should be a clear statement of intent in terms of the future of the banking system.</P>
    <P>As I said, I would welcome a merger between ACC and another European bank, but it should not be done at the expense of the taxpayer.  I have been very much to the forefront in making statements on this matter.  At the time the late George Colley was Minister people experienced great difficulty in getting mortgages from building societies and the Trustee Savings Bank came to the rescue.  That bank, which has 100 branches, provides a very good service to the man in the street.  There is a role in society for that bank and it should not be interfered with.  It would be unacceptable if one of our assets was sold to the National Irish Bank, an Australian based bank, which would reap the profits.</P>
    <P>We have been told that a Bill will be introduced shortly dealing with credit unions, a matter in which I, as spokesman on that matter, have an interest. That Bill is long overdue, as credit unions have played a major role in Irish society.  We are now being told they will have an expanded role but I do not believe they will take over the role of the banks.  Some credit unions have assets in excess of £20 million.  That is an enormous amount of money and in addition they have substantial borrowings. I accept there is room for legislation but I do not want to see credit unions compromised by the introduction of a third banking force which has been mooted to satisfy the Government which will soon face the electorate.  The reality is there are no free lunches when it comes to the banking business or interest and deposit rates.</P>
    <P>If legislation is put in place to regulate the whole area of money transmission it will alter the cost of money to the ordinary borrower.  I am open to correction on this but I understand it takes five days for a cheque to be <Col N="1668" /> cleared by the ACC Bank, two days by the Bank of Ireland and one day by the AIB through its new electronic system.</P>
    <P>The ACC Bank has done a good job but it should cater more for the small agricultural borrower.  The Minister of State comes from an agricultural county and I know she has a keen interest in this matter, but if it was not for the other banks, small agricultural borrowers in her county would not be in business.</P>
    <P>The ACC Bank should recognise there is little point in going after the big boys.  They are already experiencing difficulty because of the beef crisis.  I understand substantial losses have occurred in the area of finished cattle while farming is doing reasonably well. This whole area should be assessed.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister of State to respond to all my points because she may not have access to all the relevant information.  The Minister for Finance should be here to answer the questions I have raised because this is comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for a director of a State company not having all the relevant information about the chief executive of his company when he joins the board.  The director is responsible for running the company.  If people knew where they were going we would not have had the recent charade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed.  I assure the House I have taken notes of their comments and will respond to them.</P>
      <P>As I indicated at the outset, this is largely a technical Bill which confirms the power of State bodies to employ modern capital financing instruments. Effectively it is to make explicit what we have assumed was implicit and to add for future requirements.  This is something any private company can do simply by changing its Memorandum and Articles of Association.  In the case of most State bodies, however, their powers are established in statute and as such require a change in statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> The reason for this Bill is not that the specified transactions are <i>ultra vires</i>&mdash; the State cannot tolerate State bodies being a little bit <i>ultra vires</i>, as suggested by Deputy Ahern; if he thinks about that he may agree with me &mdash; but that there is a question of legal doubt specifically over the issue of finance leases. The existence of this doubt has resulted in a situation whereby financial institutions are reluctant to conclude any finance lease contracts with State bodies who do not have explicit statutory power to engage in finance leases in their own legislation.  The purpose of the Bill, therefore, is essentially to reassure the market and to put the question of the scope of the borrowing powers of State bodies beyond question.</P>
    <P>As I already indicated to Deputies, the bodies mainly involved are the large commercial semi-State companies. Given the demand imposed on these bodies to become more efficient, to improve performance and customer service and to deliver services more cost effectively, it would be unacceptable that they could not take advantage of the full range of capital financing instruments available in the market and others that may become available in future.  Cost effective capital relies on matching the needs of the investor and the borrower and access to these transactions will enable State bodies to continue to secure capital financing at an attractive price.</P>
    <P>With the total indebtedness of commercial State bodies amounting to £5.8 billion.  It is essential that they manage their debt in a manner which minimises the capital carrying cost.  Notwithstanding that this is a technical Bill it is of considerable importance to the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>These types of financial instruments are particularly important in accessing the international capital markets.  The removal of restrictions on capital movements between EU member states and between member states and third countries has significantly improved the availability of capital in this country. <Col N="1670" /> Moreover, the EU second banking coordination directive established the principle of the single banking licence and home country supervisory control with effect from 1 January 1993.  Under this directive banks in any member state can establish branches or provide services in other EU countries without the need for a physical presence.  To date, 11 credit institutions from other countries have set up branches in Ireland and almost 50 provide deposit taking and other services without a physical presence.</P>
    <P>The development of the International Financial Services Centre has also had knock-on effects in that it has brought Ireland to the attention of financial institutions worldwide in a manner which makes it easier for Irish companies seeking funds to tap into a much bigger pool of resources than heretofore.  It has also contributed to the development of professional and sophisticated treasury management operations domestically. Our large semi-State companies have excellent treasury management departments which have been able to exploit the benefits of more liberal international capital markets and the increasing knowledge of Ireland as a world class financial services centre. This Bill will enable these bodies to continue securing cost effective capital to meet their capital financing requirements.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that the inclusion of a guaranteed provision in the Bill does not commit the Minister to any increase in State guarantees, nor is it intended to provide any increase in the current level of guaranteed debt&mdash;I believe Deputy O'Keeffe made that point.  The present policy is that State guarantees are given only where the body in question would otherwise be unable to secure access to credit or where the cost of credit would be prohibitive.  Since 1991, the percentage of commercial semi-State debt guaranteed by the State has fallen from 90 per cent to 60 per cent, or from £4,700 million to £3,500 million.  It is expected this trend will continue in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> In relation to finance leases and any liability arising from them, these are already treated as borrowings for the purpose of the borrowing limit.  The Bill simply recognises and regularises the current position.</P>
    <P>I know Deputies will join me in congratulating the ACC Bank on the major turnaround it has achieved in the past number of years.  The increase in the borrowing limit will enable the bank to continue to grow profitably and to provide excellent service to its increasing customer base.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern made a point about redundancies in the ACC Bank.  The ACC Bank informed me yesterday that its current rationalisation programme will not involve any reduction in overall employment.  Moreover, certain functions are being maintained in the Tuam area office to secure the employment of staff there.  Concerns were expressed in that regard.</P>
    <P>The ACC Bank's profit enhancement programme resulted in significant reorganisation of the bank which was considered necessary to respond to the changing market and to control costs. Most of these changes will not be apparent to the general public except in the form of improved customer service and continuing growth in its profitability. Examples of the changes are the separation of the sales and credit function at area level; the centralisation of back office processing; the reorganisation of the bank's legal and collection department; the establishment of a credit control unit at head office and the reduction of the number of areas in the bank from four to three.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the area structure has aroused public comment.  Previously, the bank had four areas &mdash; the Dublin area, east area, western area and the south &mdash; and the four area offices were located in Dublin, Navan, Tuam and Cork.  As a commercial semi-State company, ACC Bank must compete in the highly competitive banking market on the same basis as every other bank and financial institution.  This involves <Col N="1672" /> constantly improving its services and processes and keeping tight control on costs in the interest of delivering quality service and value to their customers. With the advent of new technology and vastly improved communications systems it was considered no longer necessary for the bank to maintain four area administration centres to support its business.  However, the ACC informed the Government no later than yesterday that the current rationalisation programme will not involve a reduction in overall employment.</P>
    <P>I note the Deputies' comments about the third banking force.  The case for a third force, originally contained in the previous Government's Programme for Government, was related to the need to generate a more vibrant and competitive market in retail banking services. At the time small and medium sized enterprises were having great difficulty in securing access to credit and were incurring significant costs on banking services.  The absence of alternative credit providers and the dominant position of the major banks in Ireland were a major contributory factor to the hiatus in the market.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the retail banking market has been transformed in the past four years with the emergence of the building societies as a major player in the provision of banking services and the moves by the banks into the home mortgage market.  I also referred earlier to the liberalisation of capital markets and the EU directive on banking markets which have also had an impact. These developments in banking services are set to continue and there will be increasing competition based on telecommunications, information technology and the emergence of the credit unions as a credible alternative for many people.</P>
    <P>The Cabinit sub-committee is also looking at the future role of An Post and its branch network in service delivery. Deputies will be aware that the first phase of computerisation in An Post, involving the computerisation of 600 counter positions, is almost complete. <Col N="1673" /> The second phase will involve the computerisation of a further 900 offices. While I appreciate that this issue has been ongoing for some time, the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the sub-committee are continuing to examine all the options to identify the solution which best addresses the needs of all stake holders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern suggested we should have a simple definition of &ldquo;finance lease&rdquo;.  If we follow his suggestion we would capture ordinary operating leases and make them subject to the requirements of the Bill.  That would be contrary to his suggestion to drop section 8 which relates to operating leases. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to retrospective powers for State bodies and asked if it was wrong to give such powers. There is no question of giving retrospective powers.  The Bill clears up any ambiguity in the term &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; in existing legislation; that is, it confirms that the bodies always had the power to borrow.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to treat finance lease transactions as borrowings and replicates the provisions currently applying to borrowing in legislation.  At present all borrowing is subject to the terms and conditions specified by the Minister for Finance and any other relevant Minister.  If a commercial semi-State body is involved, for example, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications would also be involved.  There is no change in this requirement in the Bill.  That is how all borrowing requirements operate for semi-State companies and it would be inappropriate for it to be otherwise.</P>
    <P>It was suggested we might create a monstrous bureaucracy.  I do not agree. This Bill simply carries forward what is the practice already.  The specification of conditions by the Minister is designed to safeguard the interests of the State.  It is a power that will be used sparingly.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered the points raised by the Deputies.  I thank them for their contributions and thank the House for agreeing to take all Stages of this Bill at such short notice.</P>

      <P>This section refers to foreign borrowings.  This is a dangerour area.  I am aware that foreign currencies are relatively cheap at present and there are no uncertainties in many of the more stable economies.  However, there will be difficult days again.  Is there a ceiling on the level of foreign borrowings undertaken by the ACC?  In the past such borrowings proved very expensive.  We are approaching the establishment of a single currency and that will change matters.  However, before that day arrives there could be hiccups in the economies of some European countries from which we have previously borrowed.  We have borrowed Japanese yen and German marks, both of which have proved to be expensive because of the strength of our economy. There have been exchange losses and <Col N="1675" /> there are always exchange risks.  Who will carry the exchange loss or risk in the case of foreign borrowings and is there a ceiling on the level of foreign borrowings that can be undertaken by the ACC?</P>

      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency is a very efficient body.  It is important to point out that it was established by the 1987 Fianna Fáil Government led by former Deputy, Charles J. Haughey, and has proved a very valuable mechanism in <Col N="1676" /> directing State borrowing.  If the Minister of State is allowed to respond, will she inform the House of the implications of the provisions of this Bill on that agency?  In addition, will she say whether it has any influence over semi-State bodies who borrow in foreign currency and on the domestic market? Since it has proved a very efficient vehicle with regard to State borrowings, if it does not have influence over those semi-State bodies, it should be in a position to deal with them bearing in mind that, over the years, that sector has become a high risk involving, as it does, huge borrowings.</P>
      <P>We saw what happened in the case of Irish Shipping Limited which was established before the National Treasury Management Agency, on whose success all financial commentators have commented. While it took some time to get off the ground, those who established it are worthy of commendation.  Its chief executive is Mr. Somers.  Indeed people like Mr. Dermot Desmond, much maligned in this House in the 1988-89 period and thereafter, was the brains behind many successful ventures, of which this agency is one, a vehicle which has led to very favourable State borrowings at cheap rates thus relieving our overall national debt, justifying its role within the semi-State sector and its borrowings.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is of a technical, complex nature, in the not too distant future some Members may well be discussing another Bill of a technical nature.  I should be grateful if the Minister will respond to the points I have made.</P>

One of the functions exercised by the Minister is the co-ordination of the borrowing activities of the State on which he regularly consults the National Treasury Management Agency.  It should be noted that the Minister is not precluded from further consulting the NTMA and this Bill will not change those powers.  The agency <Col N="1677" /> already has a role in advising the Minister in relation to the debt of semi-State bodies, specifically provided in the National Treasury Management Act of 1990.  I concur with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's complimentary remarks in regard to that agency.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I made available to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas a copy of a report on the investigations into the various operational failures in the 1995 leaving certificate art examination.</P>
      <P>This investigation and report represents the most comprehensive and thorough review of central aspects of the national certificate examinations ever carried out.  I greatly regret the circumstances which led to the review. Nonetheless, the work carried out by Price Waterhouse provides an opportunity for an objective appraisal of the system and provides a detailed blueprint for action to ensure that the kind of failures which occurred never recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any consideration of this report should reasonably take place in the context of the enormously complex operation that is the annual certificate examinations. Price Waterhouse themselves set out this context in the early pages of <Col N="1678" /> their report and it may be worth repeating some of the statistics.  Over 130,000 students sat the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations in 1995, producing scripts totalling almost 1.3 million.  Almost 5,000 people were employed in 1995 in superintending the examinations and over 5,500 people were employed in marking the examinations. These people brought enormous dedication to their involvement.  They included many teachers, some of whom acted as superintendents in examination centres, and who made up the core of the examiners.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret that confidence may have been damaged by the operational failures in the 1995 Art examination which culminated in issuing incorrect results to some students.</P>
    <P>Students who sat the examinations deserved better.  Their parents and teachers deserved better as did the many people who put in long hours and tremendous dedication in schools and in the examinations system generally.  It is because I believed they deserved better that I commissioned this report by independent consultants.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that this report and the actions which my Department has already taken and will further take will restore any confidence lost and provide a better examinations system.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference given to Price Waterhouse required that they investigate the reasons for operational failures in the 1995 leaving certificate Art examination. In carrying out its investigations according to the terms of reference given to it Price Waterhouse conducted interviews with parties directly involved and with senior officials of my Department. It also received submissions from staff unions and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>In its report Price Waterhouse sets out in detail the background to the various examinations processes, indicates areas where deficiencies occurred in the 1995 art examination and makes recommendations to address these deficiencies. Within the time available I would like to outline to the House findings and recommendations identified by Price <Col N="1679" /> Waterhouse.  It is clear from the Price Waterhouse report that no one reason caused the operational failures in the 1995 leaving certificate art examination. One of the central conclusions of the report is that many errors and failures occured and the reasons for their occurrence are complex and multi-faceted.</P>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse report deals with the factors which gave rise to the upgrading of 359 candidates arising from the remarking of the work of one assistant examiner.  In doing that Price Waterhouse identified a number of areas where deficiencies occurred in the paper setting process, the marking scheme, the marking process and the remarking.  It concluded that the situation was unique and there was no precedent for the arrangements which were made.  In reviewing the Department's response Price Waterhouse concluded that while there was a strong <i>prima facie</i> case for remarking, nonetheless the arrangements put in place were hastily conceived.  It stressed that this judgment is made in hindsight and that the time pressures involved were intense.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the deficiencies which Price Waterhouse identified in the various stages leading up to and including the remarking of the scripts marked by an assistant examiner, it concluded that there was no inherent widespread inconsistency in the marking standards originally used in 1995 and that there is no reasonable case for remarking all candidates in that year.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse made a number of recommendations to address the particular issues raised by the remarking of papers in 1995.  The priority recommendations have been put into effect for this year's examination.</P>
    <P>The failure to credit candidates with marks for missing components was brought to the Department's attention by a telephone call from a parent concerning a letter relating to an appeal, which had not been replied to.  The examinations branch discovered that a <Col N="1680" /> number of candidates had not been credited with marks for the craft or design component of the examination.  Following a process of investigation which included a review of the marking sheets of all 11,000 candidates a total of 47 upgrades were awarded.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse reviewed the following aspects of the work of the examinations branch in the course of its investigations into this matter: &mdash; the recording of attendance at the craft examination and the forwarding of the craft pieces to the examinations branch for marking and their receipt there; the storing of craftwork; the marking of craftwork and the keying of the marks into the computer; the marking conference; finalisation of examiners' work and the keying of results; the totting check process and the generation and follow up of queries; and the issuing of results and the appeals process. Deficiencies in processes and procedures were found under these headings and I would like to outline for the House some of the deficiencies set out in the report.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse found that the inability to record receipt of boxes on an individual basis in the examinations branch was a significant weakness in the system.  It went on to say that any solution in this area must balance the very large volumes involved and the need to ensure that delays do not arise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the storing and opening of boxes of craft pieces the report found that attendance rolls for three of the schools, including the Ursuline College, affected by missing components have not been traced; the attendance roll for one of the schools affected indicates that the process for ticking off pieces on the attendance roll may not have been fully complied with in 1995; the master list of schools with craft candidates cannot be located and it is not possible to establish how or when it went missing; there is no record that the Ursuline College was contacted during this period; and An Post stated that a package bearing the same reference number as the package of craftwork from the Ursuline <Col N="1681" /> College was signed for as having been received by an employee of a company in Sligo but it has not been traced.</P>
    <P>In the marking of the craftwork Price Waterhouse found that no marking conference was held prior to the marking. There was no follow-up action at this stage on left-over marking cards.  Having keyed the marks into the computer system no report is generated comparing candidates to whom craft marks have been credited with the entry list of all candidates.  Although clear written instructions were given to assistant examiners at the marking conference, regarding the completion of marking sheets, some assistant examiners incorrectly completed the sheets by inserting a figure for total marks, thereby overriding a significant control point in the system.  Cases without a total, such as cases with components missing, would otherwise have been dealt with as queries. The totting check process was also not conducted in a fully accurate manner in 1995 leading to the failure to generate appropriate query sheets.</P>
    <P>In the generation and follow-up of queries Price Waterhouse found a number of deficiencies, including the introduction of a new query sheet which, in some respects, was not as clear as the previous version; queries were not properly processed; and the processes for dealing with queries remaining unresolved and were not formalised.</P>
    <P>These deficiencies in the follow-up of queries were not noticed at the results issuing stage as the computer reports, because of the various failures and system deficiencies that had occurred earlier, did not reflect the true situation.</P>
    <P>In the normal course, unsatisfactory processing of cases with queries would be resolved at the appeals stage. However, here too critical failures occured, as established by Price Waterhouse. Other than the chief examiner, none of the team of examiners dealing with the appeals was familiar with the detail of the appeals process, never having previously worked on appeals.  The chief advising examiner was not involved, as he had been in previous <Col N="1682" /> years.  The chief advising examiner had long experience with the processing of appeals and Price Waterhouse concluded that had he been involved he would most likely have identified the missing component problem in the cases of candidates who appealed.</P>
    <P>In addition because of the earlier incident involving 359 upgradings the chief examiner sought to strengthen the appeals process by having all scripts and marking sheets returned to her.  No copies of the marking sheets went to the administrative staff.  An assumption on their part that all aspects of the appeals were being dealt with by the chief examiner and art inspector and poor communication led to the false belief that queries had been dealt with.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the response of my Department to the missing components issue, Price Waterhouse examined a number of issues.</P>
    <P>They reviewed the possibility that efforts were made to conceal the failures and errors which occurred.  They noted that several important items of documentation were missing, that their loss could not be explained and clearly was unsatisfactory.  They concluded this did not constitute evidence of a deliberate concealment of material information and stated they did not uncover evidence of such concealment or of deliberate destruction of documents.</P>
    <P>The consultants examined the activities undertaken from the time the problem was identified to the time it was brought to my attention.  They concluded the steps taken during that time were reasonable and necessary to establish the extent of the problem, to try to locate key documentation and craft pieces before declaring them to be irretrievably lost, to establish the causes of the many errors which occurred, to assess the impact on the candidates concerned and to decide how to address the position of candidates who did not appeal.</P>
    <P>They reviewed the procedures used in carrying out the check on all 11,000 candidates in the period 15 to 20 December 1995.  They concluded this check was <Col N="1683" /> undertaken by a team experienced in missing components issues and was carried out in the manner which queries, properly handled, would normally be processed.</P>
    <P>The report explains the confusion which arose as to whether 46 or 47 was the final total of upgrade cases from the various checks carried out.  The existence of one case was overlooked when the original figure of 46 candidates was reported as the candidates in question was upgraded from a Grade F to Grade E.  This was still a failed result and did not affect the candidate's CAO/CAS offer.  Notification of the up-grade to the candidate was not affected by this overlooking of the case.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse reviewed the methodology used in awarding marks to candidates for the missing components. Two approaches were used.  In the case of the Ursuline College and the Vocational School in Navan, both of which had a number of students affected, the Art teachers were asked to give an assessment.  In all other cases the final grade was arrived at by assuming a candidate would have achieved the same average mark in craftwork as in the other three components.  Price Waterhouse recommend that a uniform methodology be used in any future cases of this nature.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in dealing with the schools, candidates and parents affected was examined and the report sets out the action taken by the Department in December 1995 and January 1996 involving visits to the schools most affected and the holding of a public meeting in Sligo.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse conclude that no further checks need be done on the work of the 1995 candidates in relation to missing components and that no further clerical and &mdash; or administrative checks are needed.</P>
    <P>The consultants refer to two particularly significant changes which when implemented will do most to prevent a repetition of the events which occurred in 1995.  These are the marking of <Col N="1684" /> craftwork in schools and the modification of the computer system to ensure the system will automatically generate error reports when marks for all components are not recorded.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware I announced my decision to implement both of these recommendations for the 1996 examinations at the teachers' conferences earlier this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, other recommendations of Price Waterhouse have already been implemented or are in course of being implemented for the 1996 exams.</P>
    <P>These include: a new and strengthened examiner structure for art; an improved marking scheme and more precise instructions at marking conferences allied to enhanced monitoring of the re-marking process; new query resolution processes and sign-off procedures; enhanced processes for dealing with art appeals; and an improved results issuing process.</P>
    <P>Overall, Price Waterhouse conclude there was no single cause for the errors and failures which occurred, that the reasons for their occurrence was, in most cases, complex and multi-faceted. I take no comfort from the fact they also concluded that any system depending on human input is prone to error or that in a system the size of the examinations system problems will occur.  I greatly regret that problems occurred, and procedures were not followed as they should have been.  The fact remains that students did not get credit for the work they had done and I apologise to the students affected, their parents and their schools.</P>
    <P>Having received the Price Waterhouse report it is my intention that any damage to confidence in the examinations system generally and in the art examination in particular should now be repaired.</P>
    <P>Any objective reader of the report will be struck by the extent to which the consultants found the art examination to be unique both in the procedures adopted and in its inherent complexity. It is important to stress in the interests of fairness and objectivity that the State <Col N="1685" /> examination system generally remains a fair and effective method of assessing students' knowledge and abilities as they leave second level education.</P>
    <P>I welcome today's statement by the ASTI that by any reasonable measure the Irish examination system is successful. It processes huge amounts of material from more than 130,000 candidates each year with relatively few difficulties. Given that 1.3 million items have to be accounted for in a short timescale, statements which suggest that the examinations system is a shambles are opportunistic and unfortunate.  As for the art examination, I now have available to me, in Price Waterhouse's report a very detailed programme for improvement. It is important to stress that many of the recommendations have already been implemented, including the key recommendations of marking craftwork in schools and improving the computer system to ensure that a repetition of these failures cannot occur.</P>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse report not only sets out recommendations but also priorities those recommendations and identifies and implementation structure designed to ensure the orderly implementation of those recommendations which are of a medium-term nature.</P>
    <P>I have made copies of the report available to all members of the Oireachtas so that the issues raised in it can be fully and publicly debated.  It was always my intention that the failures in the art examination would be fully investigated and the results of that investigation openly and publicly debated.</P>
    <P>It was also my firm resolve that the investigation would be an external and independent one as this independence was and is essential to the maintenance of confidence in the examinations system. Price Waterhouse acknowledge they had the full co-operation of my officials and full access to all documentation and records requested.</P>
    <P>In the course of their investigations Price Waterhouse indicated to my Department that while they would <Col N="1686" /> make their report to me, they had concerns about widespread publication of the report and could not make their report available if such publication was contemplated.  Given the widespread public interest in the matters which are the subject of this report, I felt obliged, notwithstanding the concerns of Price Waterhouse, to ensure that its contents could be publicly debated.  By providing the full report to Members of the Oireachtas, the concerns of Price Waterhouse have been met and my objective of public scrutiny and debate achieved.</P>
    <P>Given the legitimate concerns of many interested parties I have arranged for officials of my Department to meet and appropriately brief those parties. including in particular those concerned at the Ursuline College in Sligo.</P>
    <P>I welcome tonight's debate as a means of ensuring that concerns can be fully articulated and reassurance given. I hope the debate will be conducted in a spirit of constructive criticism.  I reiterate that the students and their parents at the centre of the problems with the art examination deserved better.  Similarly students generally, their parents and schools deserve better than that this report should be used for partisan purposes. Regard must be had for the impact such an approach would have on confidence in our examinations system and the motivating of young people to give their best.  The examination system is fundamentally sound and the failures which occurred in the art examination have been and will continue to be addressed by me and my Department as a matter of the utmost priority.

      <P>I sought a debate because we have only eight or nine days left.  The Minister for Education said that students and parents deserved better. With respect, what they deserve is a copy of the report, which they have not got to date.  They deserve greater respect than they have received to date. The National Parents Council, not the Department, has provided a helpline for students and parents.  By any objective standard that is not the way to treat an important report.  I hope the Select Committee on Social Affairs will have the opportunity to go into the report in greater detail.</P>
      <P>I wish to express my dissatisfaction with the manner in which the report has been treated by the House.  The Minister was fundamentally wrong in the route she took in circulating the report. She should have published it and, at the very least, insisted that the Government would make time available in the House yesterday, simultaneously with the circulation of the report to Members, so that the report could have been read on to the record during the debate.</P>
      <P>It seems bizarre and extraordinary that the consultants who were hired and paid from taxpayers' money should have the ultimate say in determining the mechanism by which the report is made available to Members and to the general public.  It is a totally unsatisfactory situation. Clearly the Oireachtas should establish proper procedures to facilitate the publication of reports of significant public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should place before the House all correspondence between her Department and her office and Price Waterhouse.  I made this request on the Order of Business and I received a communication from the Taoiseach's office that there was no such correspondence between the Minister's office and Price Waterhouse.  Yet in the preface to the report there is a letter from Price Waterhouse to the Minister stating: &ldquo;Dear Minister, The report is being <Col N="1689" /> made available to you subject to the condition that publication will be limited to Members of the House of the Oireachtas as set out in the terms of your letter to our solicitors dated 11 June 1996.&rdquo; I want that letter laid before the House in the Oireachtas Library.  I wish to see the terms to which the Minister agreed.  The official in the Taoiseach's office said there was no such correspondence, but Price Waterhouse obviously referred to particular correspondence and that should be put before the House.  It is of general importance to the way the Government conducts business in terms of reports of this kind.</P>
    <P>The report is comprehensive and deals with two substantial issues in relation to the leaving certificate art examination in 1995.  The first section of the report deals with the 359 upgrades arising from the remarking of the work of one assistant examiner.  The second section deals with the 47 upgrades arising from the failure to credit candidates with marks for certain components of the examination which went missing.  Of course, there are a number of other sections also dealing with the error arising from the incorrect processing of an appeal and other general issues and the 100 recommendations that flow from it. It represents an important analysis of the manner in which examinations are processed and marked.  The report makes for disturbing reading.</P>
    <P>Prior to the report's publication, the central focus was on the missing craftwork which was submitted by students from Sligo and elsewhere and for which those students did not receive credit.  However, I urge people to pay particular attention to the first section of the report which deals with the 359 upgrades arising from the re-marking of the work of one assistant examiner.  The following perhaps represents the essence of what exactly took place.  One of this morning's newspapers refers to a catalogue of errors.  If it were not so serious, we might talk about a comedy of errors.  This whole catastrophe, however, has affected the life chances of <Col N="1690" /> young people.  It has caused untold worry and anxiety to them, to their parents and families and also to their schools and teachers.  In more general terms, the series of mistakes, incompetence and procedural inadequacies which gave rise to this report seriously undermined the confidence which the education service and the public generally have in the leaving certificate examination, an examination for many years regarded as the gold standard in the public examination process.  It is imperative that confidence is restored now.</P>
    <P>The account given in the early sections of the report on the marking and later on the appeals procedure in the art examination in 1995 reads like a Feydeau farce.  What went wrong? There was no detailed marking scheme. There were no sample answers to be worked through at the marking conference. The questions were ambiguous. The people who composed the questions had no input into the marking scheme.  That is only the start.  The marking conference began on the morning of 4 July 1995, but the break up of the scripts was not done until after lunch.  They were keying craft marks into the computer, so there were no marking sheets with the scripts.  The marking sheets arrived at 3.30 p.m.  The whole process was over by 5 p.m.  This is a key point.  The chief advising examiner in art and design spent part of the day going the work of a clerical assistant, photocopying marking schemes and instructions.  There seems to have been total confusion regarding the marking of the infamous question number four on art appreciation, where the question Jack B. Yeats was to be divided into two, marked down or left to the discretion of the assistance examiners.  In all this confusion, it was discovered that one third of the samples taken had at least one of the four components of the examination missing, raising major questions about the administration of the examination and skewing the statistics generated as part of the marking conference.  The marking conference is the key because it has implications for <Col N="1691" /> the marking of the 11,000 scripts.  To a certain degree, Price Waterhouse fudged that issue in their conclusions. At that stage of the year the Minister was busily drafting her &ldquo;time in school&rdquo; circular and cutting back the part-time teaching hours, the leaving certificate results were out and the CAO had issued its first round offers.  A school in the north east discovered that its art results were seriously below its expectations and the principal wrote to the Department to complain or appeal.</P>
    <P>On 24 August 1995 at the examination branch in Athlone the officer responsible for dealing with post result inquiries received the letter and headed to the stores to retrieve the papers.  The purpose was to check the tots, and if they were correct the principal would be informed that the only option was to make individual appeals.  In the stores the officer found a new art inspector on what seemed to be a work experience project familiarising himself with the way exam work was marked.  The person searching for the scripts casually showed the letter from the school to the new inspector who, incidentally, had no responsibility for the appeals process and said something to the effect that the numbers looked familiar.  He also said he thought the same person had marked all the papers and that they should approach the head of the examinations branch, which they did.  The head of the examination branch in turn made contact with the chief examiner for higher art who started re-marking papers with the new inspector.  They went through papers and out of the 30 they looked at they decided there should be 27 upgrades.</P>
    <P>They went back to the head of the examination branch on the Friday and decided to mark all the work of the so-called hard examiner before the CAO second round offers were made.  They rounded up a posse of examiners from the Department's list, including a teacher from the same school as the so-called hard examiner.</P>
    <P>Today I met an art inspector who was <Col N="1692" /> involved in the process of re-marking but who, for some strange reason, did not receive an invitation from Price Waterhouse to present evidence to it. Will the Minister clarify why he was not contacted?  What worries me is that many more questions will arise as time goes on.  He informed me that there was a sense of panic and chaos within the Department about this issue at the time.</P>
    <P>As the examiners arrived in Athlone they were put to re-marking.  There was no conference before they started and they gathered their job was to upgrade the marks of candidates before the Tuesday evening.  On the Jack B. Yeats question the marks of one candidate were increased from 15 to the maximum of 50.  A total of 359 upgrades were granted and the disk was sent to the CAO for the second round offers.  The examiners went home tired but happy, tuirseach, traochadh, taréis an lae.</P>
    <P>It now transpires the papers may not have been marked too hard.  Nobody spoke to the assistant examiner in question. Some students may have been offered third-level places to which they were not entitled while others may have been deprived of what was rightfully theirs.  There is also the question of the missing rolls and other documents.  Price Waterhouse clearly suspected a coverup but could not prove it.</P>
    <P>What is extraordinary is that there was an ongoing series of errors in the re-marking process.  For example, the drafters of the 1995 history and appreciation of art paper had no input to the development of the marking scheme. They were not requested to provide sample answers and were not in attendance at the marking conference to give guidelines on the interpretation of questions and the acceptability of particular answers.  In other subject areas drafters of papers normally have an input through the provision of sample answers at a minimum.</P>
    <P>On page 15 the report highlights the significant and serious deficiencies in the art marking conference held on 4 July 1995.  The break-up team did not commence the preparation of the bags <Col N="1693" /> of scripts until the morning of the conference. The marking of the sample 20 papers did not, therefore, begin untill after lunch thus constraining the valuable time available for the important task of standardising the marking scheme.</P>
    <P>As the registry section in the examinations branch was not requested to photocopy any material for the conference, there is no record of any material being distributed at the conference. The chief advising examiner personally copied and distributed the outline marking scheme and the instructions regarding the filling up of marking sheets.</P>
    <P>There was considerable confusion in relation to the marking of particular questions.  The chief examiner and the chief advising examiner are adamant that in relation to question No.4 assistant examiners were instructed that if Jack B. Yeats was used by candidates as an example of a contemporary Irish figurative painter the answer was to be allowed but the marks awarded were to be divided by two.  The use by candidates of an essay on Jack B. Yeats had arisen and been addressed on a number of previous occasions.</P>
    <P>The other art inspector who attended the conference has no recollection of this instruction.  I can reveal that a further art inspector whom I met today who was at the conference but not contacted by Price Waterhouse at any stage during the investigations has no recollection of this instruction either.  The recollections of the assistant examiners interviewed by Price Waterhouse differ. Some agree that the instruction was given, some believe that the instruction given was less definite and others that it was left their own discretion.</P>
    <P>All four components were available only in 170 of the 260 sample 20s marked on the day of the conference. This is extraordinary and disgraceful. The Minister should clarify whether she was aware of this and aware at any stage of the re-marking process heavily criticised by Price Waterhouse.  I have information to the effect that the Secretary <Col N="1694" /> of the Department was contacted about this error early in the process.</P>
    <P>In some cases the craft marks were missing and in others the history and appreciation of art papers were not, contrary to the instructions given by superintendents at examinations centres, in candidates' envelopes with the other two dimensional work.  The absence of these components in a significant number of cases calls into question the validity of the statistics generated at the end of the process of marking the sample 20s.  We understand it is rare for history and appreciation of art papers to be separated from the rest of the work and that the administration side of the examination board had not been informed that this has been a problem in other years.</P>
    <P>Not only am I dissatisfied with the manner in which the report has been circulated, although comprehensive in its analysis of the art examination correction process in 1995, it fudges key issues.  It is clear from the first section of the report that Price Waterhouse is extremely critical of the procedures involved in re-marking the work of one assistant examiner.  Despite this it states there is no reason to remark the entire 11,000 papers.  I question this.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The general circumstances giving rise to the remarking of one assistant examiner's work have already been set out.  There was an immediate time pressure because of the impending second round CAO offers.  [I dispute this as there is an appeals process and third round offers.  There was also a strong case for remarking.  However, the arrangements put in place were hastily conceived.  We stress that this judgement was made in hindsight and that the time pressures involved were intense.  As far as we can ascertain the circumstances which give rise to the remarking in this instance were unique and the procedures and processes put in place for undertaking the remarking and grading the 359 upgrades were unprecedented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> The language used is generous.  What Price Waterhouse is saying is that the process was fundamentally wrong or irregular.  That is the key point.  How many times was the report drafted? Is this the final sanitised version and the only draft the Minister received?</P>
    <P>It further states:</P>
    <P>There are precedents for removing examiners found to be experiencing problems during the marking process and for redistributing their work for marking or remarking as appropriate. However, we were informed that such instances which are rare have occurred during the marking and monitoring process, and not after the issuing of results as happened in the case investigated by us.</P>
    <P>The decision to re-mark was based on the identification by an art inspector who had no formal role in the process and the chief examiner for the subject of a problem with the marking of papers of candidates in one particular school on foot of a letter received.  While other factors were taken into account, including the fact that the statistics relating to the number of candidates marked at the various grade levels by the assistant examiner in question were out of line with the average, there was no indication that sufficient sampling was carried out prior to the decision of re-mark to establish whether and to what extent the perceived problem extended to candidates' work in other centres.</P>
    <P>Insufficient care was taken to protect the identity of the assistant examiner in question which was evident to those involved in the re-marking.  In addition, insufficient care was taken in selecting the assistant examiner in the re-marking resulting in an assistant examiner from the same school as the person in question being involved in the re-marking of his work.  While there is no reason to believe that these factors were a problem in this particular case, the inherent risk in this situation is that extraneous factors arising from the identity of the assistant examiner being known might <Col N="1696" /> affect the re-marking process or might be perceived to have done so.  The chief advising examiner was not involved in the decision to re-mark nor in the re-marking process.  He was on holiday at the time.  Attempts by the assistant chief inspector to contact the chief advising examiner failed, even though he had left a contact number in the examinations branch for his holiday location and he had been contacted at this location in previous years to deal with less significant problems.  The chief advising examiner is the main contact point for the assistant examiners during the marking process and is responsible for monitoring their work.  He would have had an important contribution to make in the decision to re-mark and in procedures to be adopted if a problem with re-marking was substantiated.</P>
    <P>No attempt was made to contact the assistant examiner involved or to establish if he had any information or options which might need to be taken into account as the situation unfolded.  This is extraordinary.  Neither briefing session or a mini-marking conference was held to give instructions to the assistant examiners undertaking the re-marking. Each was met on arrival at Athlone and based on individual recollections, were given different instructions.  The art inspector I met today confirms that. They were told to increase the marks on the papers.  They were not told to mark them objectively or to re-examine the papers from the beginning.  They were told, before they began to re-mark, that the papers had been marked too severely and the marks must be increased. This is an extraordinary process.  This procedure is fundamentally wrong and is contrary to all known procedures in the Department for many years.  It should be dealt with by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It appears the problems considered to exist with the system used in the case of the particular school which brought matters to a head, quickly became known among the examiners re-marking the papers.  In this regard most of the assistant examiners involved <Col N="1697" /> believed there was a general expectation that it would be necessary to grant a significant number of upgrading during the re-marking process.  I can confirm this, having met an art inspector who was involved in this process.  They were all told that the marking had been very severe and papers consequently had to be upgraded.  That was the general thrust of the instructions given to the assistant examiners.</P>
    <P>The chief examiner and two other art inspectors were directly involved in re-marking. The assistant examiners involved were allowed to allocate marks and grades without any monitoring or approval process, as would be the case if the re-marking had been treated in the same manner as normal appeals.  Significantly the report says the chief examiner did not upgrade certain papers during the upgrading.</P>
    <P>The new art inspector, who was originally assigned to observe the examinations process in his first year, actually did some of the re-marking.  He had no previous formal experience as an examiner for State examinations.  He is however, a qualified departmental art inspector, with many years' experience as a teacher and preparing pupils for State examinations, and has considerable postgraduate qualifications.</P>
    <P>Two of the assistants involved in re-marking were subsequently found to be overgenerous in their marking at the appeal stage.  Assistant examiners had a number of upgradings proposed by them overruled by the chief examiner at the appeal stage in a situation where unlike in the re-marking process, there was supervision of marking standards. The report goes on to say that one of the upgradings awarded at the re-marking stage was also the subject of an appeal at the formal appeal stage.  Significantly the script concerned was marked down again during the appeals process.  This did not, however, affect the candidates concerned, as the re-marking was allowed to stand.  This is also extraordinary.  Was the Minister aware of all of this as it was developing within the Department?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> The key question of the lack of clarity on how to mark certain questions which dated back to the marking conference surfaced again at this stage.  It is a potentially significant issue.  There are indications, for example, of different standards being applied by individual re-marking examiners to the Jack B. Yeats answer to question 4 on the History and Appreciation of Art paper.  There was at least one script where this question was marked up from an original 15 marks to 50 marks, the maximum marks allowed for this question.  The volume of scripts marked by most assistant examiners was high even allowing for the fact that most of the administrative work was done for them in advance and they had already had experience of marking scripts during the normal marking process. Most assistant examiners mark between 40 and 60 scripts in one day.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the chief advising examiner and the assistant examiner concerned both first became aware of the suspected problem and its resolution through the news media. Both considered, having been directly affected by the outcome, that they should have been contacted directly by the Department and not have learned of these matters through the news media. It suggests considerable personality problems within the Department and within this section.  The chief advising examiner was concerned that his non-involvement in the re-marking process and subsequently his exclusion from the appeals process as detailed in section 4 could be interpreted as a commentary on his performance of his professional duties.  The matter has not to date been resolved to his satisfaction.</P>
    <P>When the assistant examiner concerned was contacted it was through the deputy chief inspector.  The assistant examiner involved was shown a number of scripts originally marked by him which had been re-marked, one of which was marked up from a C2 to A1 grade.  On the basis of the re-marked scripts seen by him he believes a different standard was applied to the re-marking than that applied by him to the original marking <Col N="1699" /> based on his understanding of the marking guidelines.  He has not to date been afforded any opportunity to discuss these matters formally with anybody from the art inspectorate.  That is a disgrace. He considers the professional marking issues involved had not been satisfactorily addressed with him.  The art inspector whom I met today feels a terrible injustice was done to this assistant examiner and he was not given fair play.</P>
    <P>Six months after all this, the Price Waterhouse report indicates the Department should now, based on the outcome of its investigation, address these matters with the individuals concerned. It is rather late in the day for this type of development and the Department should have done so a long time ago.  Clearly, as the report says, there was a predisposition to the view that upgradings were necessary in respect of the candidates work marked by this assistant examiner.  The conclusion reached from the reviewed scripts from this school was not tested by representative sampling of other cases.  If such sampling had occurred it is possible the initial conclusion would not have so strongly influenced subsequent events.  The report comments on the lack of experience in appeals marking of the assistant examiners who carried out the re-marking, the absence of supervision of the new marks being awarded and the subsequent finding of two assistant examiners who were over generous in their marking at the appeal stage.</P>
    <P>The extracts from the report show an extraordinary sequence of errors and irregular procedures adopted in the marking of these papers.  It represents an appealling indictment of this process and raises questions as to whether these papers should have been re-marked in this fashion.  The report's exposure of the farce which was the marking conference on 4 July raises a very serious question about the marking of the 11,000 art candidates in 1995.</P>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse report suggests <Col N="1700" /> there is no reason to re-mark the entire work of all 11,000 candidates on the grounds that the 750 appeal candidates were representative of the marking of all the assistant examiners, therefore the standard of marking and the interpretation of marking guidelines used had been subject to an extensive recheck.  I have questions about this.  While the prospect of having to re-mark the entire 11,000 candidates would be a horrendous one with appalling implications for all concerned, if this report was to be truly independent, objective and consistent in its investigation, it should have raised this possibility.  Having looked at it as objectively as I can, it seems to me there is a case for considering this horrendous proposition, because the marking conference was a farce and it determined the way in which all 11,000 art candidates were marked.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second section of the report and the 47 upgradings arising from the failure to credit candidates with marks on certain components, again we read an extraordinary catalogue of errors.  However, the key issue is the missing documentation.  It is extremely disturbing that the craftwork concerned is still missing.  What we should remember is that some of the craft work missing was actually ticked as being received by the Department.  Page 31 makes clear that:</P>
    <P>Apart from those cases affected by missing attendance rolls it has been possible to establish during the investigation that ticks exist opposite 17 of the 49 candidates not credited with a craft mark, indicating that the pieces were received.</P>
    <P>Then the report goes on to say that &ldquo;With the exception of four pieces which was located during the many searches for missing pieces the remaining pieces have never been located&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>From this it seems that certain craft work was received by the Department but was not marked or found.  Other items of craftwork submitted do not seem to be ticked as being received and <Col N="1701" /> no one seems to know where they ended up.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that Price Waterhouse did not follow up this issue. I asked a Dáil question endeavouring to find out when Price Waterhouse contacted An Post about this or indeed when Department personnel contacted An Post.  I was told answers to these questions would be in the Price Waterhouse report.  They are not in the report and I ask the Minister to clarify these two points.  When was An Post first contacted about these packages, particularly the packages submitted from Sligo?  This is a key issue.  If the report confirms the packages in Sligo were signed for by an employee of a company whose premises are in Sligo, was any contact made with that company or were any of the personnel in the company interviewed?  There is no detail about this in the Price Waterhouse report and this failure is a major deficiency.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I do not have sufficient time to debate the entire report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Price Waterhouse report.  This comprehensive and lengthy report deals in a painstaking way with the so-called operational failures of the administration of the 1995 leaving certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister has chosen to make the report available only to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Full publication would have been a much better option.  I wonder whether our antiquated libel laws prevent full publication.  Why did the Minister agree to the terms laid down by Price Waterhouse?  How many reports have now been commissioned, some at enormous expense, which the Government subsequently tell us cannot be published due to legal constraints? As the Minister said, the failures in the system should be seen in the context of the scale and complexity of the examination. Nevertheless, failures and errors have occurred and it is important that <Col N="1702" /> confidence be restored to the examination system.  One student quoted in today's newspapers said the most important thing is that what happened to him must not happen to anyone else. We cannot forget the human cost in all of this.  The Minister has rightly apologised for the anxiety and distress caused and we should not minimise the effects. Has the Minister any intention of compensating the students involved?</P>
    <P>We have learned that of the 14 students affected at the Ursuline College in Sligo, eight have just repeated their leaving certificate and several more who have taken jobs might have gone on to third level, according to their art teacher.  Others have emigrated to England.  The same teacher has expressed surprise that those most affected by the errors were not being provided with a copy of the report.  She makes the point that an independent inquiry should tell everybody, but this report is being issued to a small number of people.  The teacher also states that the worst thing is that the events have placed doubts in students' minds about how the system works.  I ask the Minister to accept it is not the Opposition who have placed doubts in students' minds, it is the events that occurred last year.</P>

I note that in its reaction to the proposal that the 100 recommendations of the report be implemented immediately, the Public Service Executive Union warned that its members in the Department's examinations branch would not co-operate in implementing the recommendations until the report was released to the union.  The Minister has spoken about the importance of implementing the recommendations, as have we all, but how will she go about dealing with this. In addition, the assistant general secretary of the Civil and Public Service Union said it was outrageous that his union was not being given a copy of the report.  Why was an undertaking given that the report would be made public if that was not feasible?  The Minister said this evening that her officials would brief the parties involved but I do not believe that will be acceptable.  What they want is full publication of the report.  The Minister should not have given an undertaking if she was not able to follow it through.</P>
      <P>The most important issue arising from this fiasco is that procedures should be put in place immediately so that full confidence in the examinations system can be restored.  That is why I want the 100 recommendations on the operation of the examinations branch implemented.  The fact that such a huge number of recommendations have been made is indicative of a serious administrative problem in the section.</P>
      <P>One of the most worrying aspects of the investigation was the revelation that the discovery of problems with the art paper, which had been harshly marked, was purely fortuitous.  It is incredible that if the art inspector had not accidentally bumped into the officer dealing with the letter of complaint from a school in County Louth and had not already seen the papers the official had gone to retrieve and recognised them as ones he has considered to have been harshly marked, we might have had an even worse situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given what Price Waterhouse said, <Col N="1704" /> the 359 students, unaware that they had been harshly marked and that the whole chain of event that brought those matters to light might not have happened, were extremely lucky to have their scripts reviewed and upgraded.  Without the chance meeting we would still be no wiser about the errors surrounding the examination.  Notwithstanding the inconsistencies involved and the debate on the marking of conferences horrendous difficulties were encountered.  The report points to the lack of consistency in marking throughout the country with different examiners working to different standards.</P>
    <P>We have heard about Jack B. Yeats a few times this evening and the scope for interpretation as to what would constitute valid answers to questions in the history and appreciation of art paper. These deficiencies were particularly relevant to the examination last year.  The fact that Price Waterhouse made more than 100 recommendations on the operations of the examinations branch indicates the potential there must have been for error.  It cites missing records, craftwork gone astray, internal misunderstandings and poor communication among staff.  Each one of these on its own would give cause for misgivings. We have seen from the report that time and again there were many opportunities to spot the errors but exam work and check sheets went missing and the checking systems failed.  The failures are catalogued: failure to follow up on missing components of submitted examinations; failure of totting checks to detect missing marks; failure to carry out necessary checks in appeals cases; failure of supervision in relation to queries; failures of communication relating to the appeals process; intense time pressures and absence of desirable procedures or controls.  It was only through a fortuitous meeting and the complaints of teachers and parents that the catalogue of errors in marking was revealed.</P>
    <P>The most worrying aspect is that it was only through the persistence of parents, students and teachers, members of <Col N="1705" /> the Opposition, in pursuing the rights of students that the mistakes in respect of the students at the Ursuline College in Sligo came to light.  It is disturbing that we still have unanswered questions about the Ursuline College blunders. Where is the missing letter which was sent on 7 October?  Why was the school not contacted?  Why did a query sheet have the word &ldquo;cleared&rdquo; written across the top?  Who is responsible for that purported clearance which enabled marks to be keyed in for those candidates with a mark for the component of the examination not having been credited to them?  We do not know because that letter was unsigned.  Where is the master list of all schools with candidates entered for craftwork?  Where is the attendance roll which recorded the names of students from the Ursuline College in Sligo who took the craftwork paper?  Where are the missing craftwork pieces?  No conclusions could be reached about a cover up.  We cannot say whether there was a cover up because there is no evidence.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am getting cynical as a result of my time in this House.  If there was no evidence one would think it was because people were trying to cover up.  I hope that is not the case in this instance but I am suspicious.  I am concerned about reports of stock answers to examinations questions which indicate the level of cramming among leaving certificate students.  The Department must examine this issue.  Is it presiding over a proper examination system or a pressurised ritual, more concerned with students' ability to memorise information than establishing their standard of education?</P>
    <P>My confidence in the appeals system has been shaken.  The report states that there is not a standard nationwide response to requests for appeals.  The manner in which complaints about the State examinations system were handled is ridiculous and appeared to depend to a large extent on where the students lived.  I hope that will change following <Col N="1706" /> the identification by Price Waterhouse of that inconsistency.</P>
    <P>It is alarming that an investigation into one leaving certificate examination should show more than 100 areas where improvements could be made, particularly bearing in mind that subsequent flaws were uncovered in other examinations. The Minister welcomed the ASTI statement.  Of course there will be human errors, but sufficient checks and balances should be in place to minimise them.  The checks and balances were not adhered to in this case.  It is essential that the relevant methodology is in place to implement the system.  A thorough overview of this creaking system must be carried out.  The Minister must heed the calls of the National Parents Council for the immediate establishment of an independent appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the report paints a less than flattering picture of the examinations branch &mdash; missing records, craft work gone astray, internal misunderstandings and poor communication among staff.  Deputy Martin said that there may be personality problems, but that will be the case in any administration. The necessary checks and balances must be put in place to ensure that personalities do not interfere with the proper operation of the system.</P>
    <P>A management survey of the examinations branch is currently under way, but it is being carried out by the Department of Education.  Is it wise to proceed in that way?  The Price Waterhouse report highlights the problem of dual hierarchies in many Government Departments, including the examinations branch.  There are poor contact and reporting arrangements between the general service and specialist staff. This must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Price Waterhouse report is very detailed.  Its recommendations are reasonable and appear to address the difficulties in the system.  It is disingenuous to pretend that the Opposition is inferring there is something wrong with the examinations system and undermining confidence in it, when it <Col N="1707" /> has taken 100 recommendations to address the difficulties in the system. However, I am pleased the matter has been examined and I welcome the report.  It is unfortunate it took so long to publish it, but that may have been because of its detailed and lengthy nature. It was foolish of the Minister to say she would make the report public merely to show the attempts were being made to ensure that such errors would not recur.  As promised on her behalf in this House last February, she should make the report public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to participate in the debate on the Price Waterhouse report on the various operational failures which occurred in the 1995 leaving certificate art examination. While the report cannot undo the damage caused and distress suffered by students, parents and teachers in Sligo and elsewhere, it provides a detailed blueprint for action to ensure that the type of failures which occurred last year do not recur.  It outlines the reasons for the numerous failures in the 1995 leaving certificate art examination and represents the most comprehensive and extensive review of the national certificate examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should note that it was only as a result of complaints from parents, students and teachers that the long list of mistakes was discovered.  If it were not for the persistence of the Ursuline College in Sligo, and one parent in particular, the long list of errors might not have been uncovered.  The management and staff of the college, particularly the art teacher, were shocked at the results of the leaving certificate art examination last August.  On 1 September the principal of the Ursuline College wrote to the Department of Education asking for a review of the art results of all students who took the craftwork option in the leaving certificate because their results were consistently and considerably lower than expected.  The principal gave a list of student involved and the grades <Col N="1708" /> expected by their teacher, along with the grades received.  The school was informed by the Department that this was not sufficient and that each pupil had to apply individually and pay the £25 fee, but the grades of those who applied for a review were not changed.</P>
    <P>The board pointed out that at no time during the period was the college contacted by the Department to say that any of the craftwork was missing.  It also stated that it was difficult to understand why the letter from the principal and the request for rechecks did not bring the mistakes to light in time to allow students take courses in the 1995-96 school year.  In early October a parent of one of the Sligo students wrote to the Department expressing her disappointment with her daughter's original result and the unsuccessful outcome of her appeal.  Having received no response to her correspondence she telephoned the Department in late November to know why she did not receive a reply.  The Department official who received the telephone call requested the parent to forward a copy of the original letter.  On receipt of that the official had the case investigated and within weeks it became obvious that a litany of errors had occurred and many students had lost out as a result.</P>
    <P>Having been alerted to the deficiencies discovered by the initial investigation, the Minister for Education responded speedily and gave an assurance that a comprehensive and independent investigation would take place. The appointment of the Price Waterhouse firm to carry out the investigation was widely welcomed.  I pay tribute to Price Waterhouse for its detailed and objective assessment of the system.</P>
    <P>As a result of the report being distributed to every Member of the Oireachtas, the issue raised in it can be debated in the House and its contents can be the subject of public scrutiny. The report outlines that to date the original letter to the Department from the parent in Sligo is still missing.  The report indicates that no trace could be <Col N="1709" /> found of attendance rolls for the Ursuline College which would have established whether students had sat the craft option of the art examination.  It points out that the master list of schools with craft candidates could not be located, but that An Post has stated a package bearing the same reference number as the package of missing craft work from the Ursuline College was signed for as having been received by an employee of the company in Sligo.  It further states that the package itself has never been traced and it is, therefore, not possible to say with any clarity what was the ultimate fate of this package.</P>
    <P>The report also points out that due to misunderstandings and failed communications nobody ever followed up on the queries generated by the appeals examiners on the appeals marking sheets.  It states that this was an unfortunate omission in that most of the 14 appeal candidates, including those from the Ursuline College in Sligo who were subsequently found to be missing marks for a component of the examination, were identified as queries on the appeals marking sheets by the appeals examiners.  No action was taken in these cases.</P>
    <P>The report states that the query sheet noting the absence of a craft mark for candidates from the Ursuline College was incorrectly marked &lsquo;cleared&rsquo;.  The absence of documentation relevant to key stage in the process and the apparently negligent completion of the query sheet are clearly unsatisfactory and cannot be explained.  It is also worthy of note that Price Waterhouse clearly points out that these aspects do not, in its view, constitute evidence of a deliberate concealment of material information and, in the course of its investigations, it uncovered no evidence of such concealment or of deliberate destruction of documents.</P>
    <P>The consultants also indicated that when the Department became aware of the deficiencies in late December 1995 and early 1996, it apologised to the schools and candidates for the errors which had occurred.  It informed the candidates of the effects of regarding on <Col N="1710" /> their applications for places under the CAO-CAS system and assured candidates and parents that any claim for compensation arising from the errors which had occurred would be dealt with fairly and reasonably on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Department visited the Ursuline College in Sligo in January and that meeting was attended by representatives of the board of management, school management, the art teacher and the parents of the students affected.  In essence, the report points out that the Department of Education responded quickly to the case when it came to light.  The school, the candidates and the public were quickly informed of the problem and of the actions taken to deal with the case.</P>
    <P>The report clearly points out that the leaving certificate art examination is one of the most complex, if not the most complex, examination subject in terms of administration and issue of results. This inherent complexity and the use of non-standard processes and procedures, not applying to other subjects, were major contributors to the errors and failures which occurred.  Many of the recommendations contained in the report are aimed at bringing the administration of the art examination more into line with the systems and procedures used for other subjects.</P>
    <P>The report indicates that many errors and failures occurred in relation to the 1995 leaving certificate examination and it states that there is no single cause for these errors and failures.  The reasons for their occurrences are, in most cases, complex and multifaceted.  However, it also points out that in the majority of instances no satisfactory excuse other than time pressures can be advanced as to why these largely avoidable errors occurred.</P>
    <P>While any system depending on human input is prone to error, the reality is that in 1995 there was a degree of error which would be totally unacceptable in any national examination system.  The Minister was right to <Col N="1711" /> appoint an independent group of consultants to investigate the numerous operational failures and to make recommendations to prevent reoccurrence. The report in its findings clearly justifies the Minister's decision to have the system fully and independently investigated. I welcome the fact that the most important recommendations contained in the report have already been implemented in respect of the 1996 certificate examinations.  While the Department has again expressed its regret for the anxiety and distress caused to the students who were affected and to their parents and teachers, students should now receive fair compensation from the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have obtained this report at long last.  If I were Minister for Education, which I hope I will be, I would be quite upset about it.  I know the Minister was genuine when she said students deserve better and that she hopes to repair any damage done to confidence in State examinations.  People reading about this in the newspapers would be very concerned. This report has opened a Pandora's box and raises more questions than it answers.  My colleague referred to the 359 upgrades which arose from a letter written by a principal in a school in the north east.  If that person had not written the letter, we might never have discovered that there was a need to recheck those marks.  I am sure the Minister is as concerned as those of us on this side of the House about that.  If, as Deputy Bree said, the principal, teachers and parents of pupils in the Ursuline College and those in the school in Navan had not pushed, we might not have known about this.  That is a profound problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a problem in her Department.  I do not believe she has confidence in it or that her staff are particularly happy.  Obviously, the Department of Education's examinations branch is understaffed.  The report states that a static number of <Col N="1712" /> staff have been available in the examinations branch and that there has been a decrease of 33 per cent in permanent clerical level staffing since 1990. Although temporary staff are available at examination times, the Department is understaffed and there is panic when something goes wrong.  Everybody seems to be under pressure, especially in relation to second round CAO offers. One of the problems the Minister faces is financial and it needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There were guidelines but they were not clear in relation to the art examination. It reminds me of debates in the House about guidelines which are breached or variously interpreted.  It is obvious from the report that the preparatory work for the art examination was sloppy.  It states that only 170 of the 260 sample twenties marked on the day of the conference had all four components of the examination present, an area where there were no checks and balances.  If the four components of the art examination were not present it should have clicked that there might be a problem which should be checked out.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to question 4.  I am not an art student and, although I appreciate art, I could not draw a straight line.  However, if an answer is right it is right and if it is wrong it is wrong.  If we are to give an alternative interpretation to right and wrong, it should be standard so everyone knows where they stand.  The report also states that somebody was upgraded from a fail to a pass &mdash; to 50 per cent &mdash; in one question.  I am concerned about objectivity as regards remarking.  If there is no objectivity in a subjective academic subject, there are problems.  The inconsistencies by the Department in dealing with letters is unacceptable because inconsistency breeds suspicion.  In 1994 there were 5,000 appeals while in 1995 there were 8,400, an increase of more than 3,000.  There must be a proper system with sufficient staff to deal with that matter.  In the Ursuline college in Navan there were two rechecks and a teacher was consulted about the matter whereas in other schools an average mark was <Col N="1713" /> used, but that is no solace to the children and teachers involved.</P>
    <P>We have all looked forward to this report.  If I was an art student in the Ursuline college I would like to know what happened my craft work, but unfortunately we have not been able to find out.  It is unacceptable that four items still have not been addressed &mdash; the attendance roll and master list cannot be found, in the absence of a craft mark for candidates from the Ursuline college, Sligo, the matter was incorrectly marked &ldquo;cleared&rdquo; and the letter of 7 October from the parent cannot be found.  The report states that that is unsatisfactory and cannot be explained. If I was an Ursuline student I would like to know what happened my craft work and would be concerned that an answer has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to the departmental staff.  If I was running a business and a problem arose I would ask the opinion of those working for me, otherwise I could be brought before the courts.  It is almost unbelievable that, even though the Department went to some expense to have this report carried out, the people involved are still unhappy.  The report states that, based on the outcome of the investigation, the Department should address the matters with the individuals concerned. Obviously the chief examiner is concerned because he or she was not involved in the re-marking.  There was no contact with the original art inspector who marked the examination papers too harshly &mdash; I would even question whether they were marked too harshly because there are no basic standards and no system of checks and balances.</P>
    <P>There are 100 recommendations in this report, which shows that problems existed in the system.  Two of the recommendations have been taken on board, one of which is that the craft work should be examined in the school.  That will, however, give rise to security and accommodation problems &mdash; most schools already experience problems with accommodation.  I am sure teachers will be concerned about that matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> I am unhappy with the lack of clarity in regard to the loss of craft work from the Ursuline college in Navan.  There was a problem with rechecking prior to the second round offers being made and we would not be aware of it if it had not been for the fact that the matter was pushed on an alternative agenda, which was available to the media and the Opposition.  I hope we will reach a position where there is complete confidence in the system, but that can be done only by reviewing the entire system.  We are talking here about only one subject, art. For genuine concerns to be addressed, there must be independence in the system. I have tremendous regard for the examinations section of the Department and am aware of the work done by teachers in setting and correcting examination papers, much of which is not recognised, but independence is essential. Given that this problem arose with art, it could also happen with another subject.</P>
    <P>Too much emphasis is placed on pushing children into taking subjects such as science, mathematics and so on. There should be a degree of flexibility in that regard.  As a result of the problem in this case I hope children do not turn away from art, music and other academic subjects.  There are many questions to be answered and much work to be done to ensure young people are happy with the system.</P>

      <P>I believed from the beginning that this was a serious matter requiring an independent investigation, the result of which was laid in Deputies' pigeonholes yesterday.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with an education system where there is 82 per cent participation in examinations, with most students completing the senior cycle and sitting the leaving certificate examination while many go on to third level education or post-leaving certificate courses.  The importance of their examination results increase each year. Approximately 1.3 million objects, papers, practical or craft packages, are involved in marking the examinations of 135,000 students.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputies who expressed concern about the different aspects of the 1995 examination system, I repeat that two particularly significant changes have now been implemented. Marking of the craftwork in the 1996 examinations will take place in the schools and, more importantly, the modification of the computer system wil ensure that we will be automatically alerted to error reports if the marks are not recorded at the time.</P>
      <P>It is important also to repeat the announcement I made at the teacher conferences about the computer and setting up a helpline in the Department of Education on the day the results are made available.  There will be much more information on the paper giving students their results and they can be assured that the results will be appropriate to the examinations they sat.  If there is any doubt in that regard, however, an examination helpline will be opened that day in the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A list has been drawn up of procedures to be put in place to ensure these errors never happen again.  On <Col N="1716" /> each occasion I have spoken about this matter I have apologised to the students, their teachers and schools who experienced a failure in the system in 1995.  I am conscious also that we must retain confidence in the examination system and I say to those who began the round of practical examinations at Easter and who have just completed the written and art examinations that measures have been put in place for the 1996 cohort.  These include a new and strengthened examination structure in art; an improved marking scheme; more precise instructions at marking conferences; enhanced monitoring of the marking process; query resolution processes; signing of procedures and enhanced processes dealing in particular with art appeals.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse has advised that we establish an independent implementation group in the Department to put in place the other recommendations. That group will be made up of representatives of senior management in the Department of Education, the inspectorate and the examinations branch.  I have already committed myself to the implementation of the group's recommendations in addition to the measures already in place which Price Waterhouse assure me will alert us to any human error.  In that way no student will be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Keogh for her acknowledgement of the painstaking way in which this report was compiled and the information contained therein. I would have welcomed full publication of the report but given the advice I had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Ireland is the only country in the European Union which does not have a national <i>conservatoire</i> for music.  I first raised this matter in the Dáil on 14 February 1996 but I did not get a reply from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite national pride in our musical and theatrical traditions we do not have a national academy of stage craft or acting. Many young performing artists are forced to pursue their undergraduate studies abroad and they usually stay abroad when their studies are completed. Why can we not draw all these strands together under the third level institution for the performing arts?  Such an institution would provide departments for classical music, opera, jazz, popular music, drama and traditional music, as well as allied subjects such as <Col N="1719" /> music technology, recording techniques and film, television and video production. The conservatoire could provide valuable training for conductors. At present there is no full-time course for conductors in Ireland.  This would subsequently benefit our solo performers, composers and orchestral musicians.  The centre for the performing arts could also provide full-time training for opera singers.  There is no such full-time training available in Ireland despite the country having produced many wonderful voices.</P>
    <P>The Government is seeking a millennium project.  A building already exists which could appropriately house such a venture with little cost to the Exchequer for refurbishment.  That building is in Earlsfort Terrace.  There is already a decision in principle that UCD will move out of that building.  The National Concert Hall is located in Earlsfort Terrace and the rest of the site could become the Irish academy for performing arts and a source of national pride.  I understand that if drama were included in the curriculum the Abbey Theatre might be interested in cooperating with the project.  Co-operation might also be forthcoming from the Arts Council in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The idea would be to include all aspects of music, not just classical music. Employment in music has grown substantially over the past ten years.  Apart from traditional jobs in performance and teaching there is a huge growth in jobs in CD production, pop music recordings, music technology, traditional music composition and music for film and TV.  Centralising the teaching of all these aspects of music makes economic sense, as well as allowing music students to have the widest possible education which would help break down traditional barriers between classical, pop, traditional, jazz and other types of music.  The resultant growth in the employment possibilities for <Col N="1720" /> students of a national conservatoire would be enormous.</P>
    <P>The PIANO report, published at the end of January 1996, refers to the need for a national music conservatoire and the problems caused by the lack of a musical educational policy.  The report also refers to the need for the establishment of an Irish academy for the performing arts.  Such an institution is &ldquo;needed as soon as possible because of the increased demand and rising standards among our young people&rdquo;.  I ask for a positive decision on this matter from the Minister for Education and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. In February this year I raised this matter in the Dáil with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  He said he wished to wait for more submissions and consultations to be completed. Over 16 weeks later we need positive action rather than prevarication.</P>

      <P>The PIANO report which was submitted to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht earlier this year dealt extensively with the issue of musical education, an issue strictly speaking outside its formal terms of reference. However, as the Minister indicated at the time the report was presented to him, he was grateful that the committee thought this issue to be of such importance as to warrant inclusion regardless of their terms of reference.  The chairman of the committee, Dr. John O'Conor, in his forward to the report, acknowledged that many of the report's recommendations in this area would be proper to be pursued by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with me as Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that report a case is made for the establishment of an Irish academy for the performing arts, based at the existing premises at Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin which is currently occupied by <Col N="1721" /> the National Concert Hall and departments of University College Dublin. The report visualises that such an academy would not only serve classical music, which is what the term &ldquo;Conservatoire&rdquo; implies, but would serve all of the performing arts.  Departments within the academy suggested in the report include a department of classical music, obviously, and departments of opera, drama, traditional music, popular music and jazz, music technology and recording techniques, dance, film, video and television and applied arts.  The reports argues it is important that the suggested academy serve all the performing arts as the possibilities for crossover between departments will increase the eventual employment possibilities of the students.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that the most economical way of setting up such an academy would be to amalgamate the third level sections of the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Dublin Institute of Technology College of Music.  The Deputy will appreciate that the recommendation contained in the report raises many complex issues, including the issue of the use to which the Earlsfort Terrace site is to be put when it is possible to move the departments of University College Dublin, currently housed there, to the Belfield campus.</P>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has already been in correspondence with me regarding my reaction to the recommendations in the PIANO report that impinge on the responsibilities of the Department of Education, including in particular the recommendation in relation to the establishment of an academy for the performing arts.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and I will be in further consultation with a view to coming to a conclusion on the relevant recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> It would be unfair of me, however, not to conclude on a note of caution. The establishment of an academy for the performing arts clearly has major implications for current and capital expenditure.  A preliminary estimate of the cost of converting the Earlsfort Terrace building prepared by the Office of Public Works amounts to in excess of £11 million.  This figure does not include the cost of rehousing the departments of UCD that would be moved to the Belfield campus.  Clearly any decision to be taken by the Government regarding the establishment of an academy would have to have regard to implications for existing providers of music education as well as budgetary implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue at this ungodly hour.  The Minister will be entitled to double overtime.</P>
      <P>The concerns I voice this evening arise from the large number of fish kills in our rivers and lakes in recent years, particularly this year, and the resultant damage to water quality.  There have been five major fish kills already this year and that must be a cause of great disappointment to all Members.  Strenuous efforts have been made by the agricultural sector in recent years to improve installations, procedures and practices to eliminate the type of pollution that leads to fish kills.  In the past five years more than £60 million has been invested by the Government to assist farmers in carrying out these improvements.  In addition, a number of farmers have spent a great deal of their own money on such developments.  The IFA has set up a special committee on this issue while Teagasc continues to give advice and assistance where possible. Despite all this work, the fish kills continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not all fish kills can be traced to agriculture. The most recent fish kill in the <Col N="1723" /> Dodder river was attributed to industrial pollution.  I raised this issue in a priority question to the Minister for the Environment on 13 June.  About ten days previously a senior environmental officer in Teagasc had warned that 1996 would be a vulnerable year for fish kills due to the unusual rainfall patterns during the year.  He said that our rivers would be a time bomb as a result of those rainfall patterns.  We were warned in advance and one would have thought that greater precautions would have been taken.  Significantly, however, on the day I raised this issue there were two major fish kills in Country Cork. One occurred on the River Martin, a tributory of the River Lee when more than 4,000 lovely, young brown trout and salmon were killed.  Significantly, the drinking water of the city of Cork escaped poisoning and contamination by a whisker, it was as near as no matter that this poison almost entered the treatment plant for drinking water.  It is a very serious issue both in terms of the damage it does to fish and our rivers but also its potential damage to public health and drinking water.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline what action has been instituted in respect of that fish kill?  I should also point out that in 1995 there were approximately 85 different fish kills in this country, in respect of 71 of which the regional fisheries board had informed me that it initiated prosecutions. I do not know what happened subsequently but I want the Minister to inform me.</P>
    <P>As legislators, clearly we cannot determine whether the provisions of our anti-water pollution Acts are being properly implemented.  We cannot properly monitor their enforcement without knowing how many prosecutions are taken and the outcome of each.  Though one should not draw conclusions without appropriate evidence, it is logical to conclude that the fines being imposed <Col N="1724" /> are not high enough to act as a strong deterrent.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister please inform me of the outcome of the 71 prosecutions initiated last year, in how many cases the maximum fine was imposed and generally inform us how the provisions of the anti-water pollution Acts are being implemented by our courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>The Minister for the Environment, who is unable to be here this evening, asked me to say that he shares Deputy Quill's deep concern over the recent incidents in Cork and Dublin and other recent fish kills. Unfortunately, the Cork cases are a reminder of what can go wrong when good farming practices are not followed &mdash; agricultural effluent was involved in both cases.</P>
      <P>Because we are not entering the peak risk period for our waterways, when low water levels and flows are combined with high water temperatures, it is vital that increased vigilance is observed in guarding against water pollution. For this reason and because of the Minister for the Environment's concern at the damage caused in recent years, the Minister issues a statement on 11 June calling for extra vigilance at this time.</P>
      <P>It is important that extreme care is exercised in particular by the agricultural and industrial communities in relation to all waste handling and disposal activities.  Irresponsible actions by a small number can, as we have seen, have serious consequences for the wider community through disruption of water supplies and damage to the ecology of our rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers for the Marine and Agriculture, Food and Forestry are equally conscious of the increased potential for water pollution during the summer months and of the need for greater efforts at ensuring that pollution threats are minimised.  Much work has been done in recent years to promote <Col N="1725" /> greater understanding by farmers, industrialists and the public generally of the importance of our water resources and of the need for effective pollution prevention arrangements.  Particular attention has been focused on the farming community which regrettably was responsible for the recent Cork incidents. Local authorities and the agricultural advisory agencies have carried out extensive farm surveys while initiatives to promote environmental awareness by a range of agencies, including farmer representative associations, have also given important assistance.</P>
    <P>The proper management of farm wastes is central to continuing efforts at reducing the potential threat from agriculture. This requires having sufficient storage facilities for the individual farm needs and the landspreading of farm effluents in accordance with good agricultural practice.  In the case of the fish kill in the River Martin, where, I understand, more than 3,000 fish were killed, it is clear that the pollution was a direct result of poor farm practice.  It is essential, therefore, that all agencies &mdash; local authorities, fishery boards, agricultural advisers and farmers representatives associations &mdash; intensify their efforts in the promotion of practices which are conducive to sustainable agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is not, of course, the only threat to our waterways.  Industry is also implicated and it is important that effective waste management practices are also observed in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and fishery boards have primary responsibility for pollution prevention and fishery protection in their areas.  Extensive powers are available under the Water Pollution Acts and fisheries legislation to take effective action against those responsible for pollution and fish kills.  In the case of the recent incidents in Cork, I understand that, following full investigation of the circumstances involved, the South Western Regional Fisheries <Col N="1726" /> Board are considering taking legal proceedings in respect of the River Martin fish kill with the full support and assistance of Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>I understand that legal proceedings are also being considered in the case of the Owenacurra River incident, where it is understood about 200 fish were killed as a result of seepage of silage effluent into the Leamlara, which is a tributory of the Owenacurra river.  It is understood that a factor in this case however is that the pollution arose from new installation designed to prevent pollution and that remedial action was taken by the owner as soon as the problem arose.</P>
    <P>The practice of investigating fish kill incidents and considering legal proceedings is followed by the relevant local authority or fishery board for all fish kills.  Only in abnormal circumstances should the Minister for the Environment become directly involved, as happened in the case of the fish kill which occurred in the River Lung in 1994 when the then Minister asked the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out a special investigation.  In general, action is taken at the local authority/fishery board level where well-established co-operation between the agencies results in effective sanction against the polluter.</P>
    <P>In view of the functions assigned to local authorities and fishery boards in this area, it would be inappropriate and impractical that the Minister for the Environment should answer to the House in relation to the particular circumstances of each fish kill.  Adequate powers are available to local authorities, under the water pollution Acts, to deal with incidents such as happened in Cork in recent weeks and appropriate followup is taking place.  The Minister for the Environment will, of course, keep the situation generally under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for extra places for business studies students who <Col N="1727" /> want to attend a fourth year degree course at Cork Regional Technical College. The students at that college, who have completed their diploma, and their parents hope that the Minister's response will be positive.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that three years ago additional places were provided in the business studies course at Cork regional technical college, in line with Government policy to ensure that additional third-level places were made available to meet the demand.</P>
      <P>It is to the credit of those students who began their business studies course that year that 84 graduated, receiving a merit or distinction in their diploma examination.  It is only logical, the natural progression, that the vast majority of them want to continue their studies and obtain a degree.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware also that 35 places only exist for this degree course which means that, if the current position is allowed to continue, some 49 students will be disappointed, apart altogether from students from other regional colleges who may wish to attend the Cork regional technical college to pursue a degree course there.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that students, already on their summer break, having finished their examinations, continue to feel stressed and very insecure, because they may not be given an opportunity to finish their education while having earned the right to do so.  They have done everything asked of them and ask the Minister to follow through on the commitment she gave at the time they embarked on this course.</P>
      <P>Is it not logical to conclude that if, in the first year, an increased intake is approved by the Department of Education, the Minister should take cognisance of the need for increased places down the line and that her Department be in a position to meet that extra demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not that the Department has been unaware of the position, given that last year it was signalled to the Minister <Col N="1728" /> when the college management included this as a requirement when presenting its programmes and budgets for the following two years?</P>
    <P>It is natural that Cork regional technical college management immediately require approval to enrol an additional 40 students on the final year degree course.  I trust the Minister will formally give that permission tonight.  As Minister for Education she will appreciate it is extremely late in the day and the college authority needs to plan for such an additional intake.  Granting such permission would alleviate the stress of parents and students concerned.</P>
    <P>Additional resources would be required to enable the college provide additional lecturers and class resources to meet the exigencies of such an additional intake.  Having worked in the college for many years, I consider such an increased additional intake of students would be cost effective as the necessary technology is available in the college.  As the Minister is aware, the class sizes in many of the subjects would not be a major problem, given that the students would be attending lectures.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that we encourage students to remain in college as long as possible and to attain the highest possible level of achievement.  We tell them that is imperative to obtain meaningful employment.  We also tell them that it is in line with Government expressed policy that students should attempt to attain the highest qualifications because the availability of high calibre graduates for this type of industry helps attract international mobile investment.</P>
    <P>The case speaks for itself.  I recognise the humanity within the Minister and the appeal to her tonight is on the need to cater for these students.  The college is willing and able to cater for the additional places and I ask her to give a positive message so that the necessary preparations can be made and such an additional intake can proceed.</P>

      <P>I am happy to have this opportunity to respond to the Deputy and to clarify the present position in regard to course provision including additional student places on existing courses in the regional technical college sector generally and in the regional technical college Cork in particular.</P>
      <P>The question of programme developments and the delivery of such programmes is a question which is considered by the individual college management in the context of overall college policy, priority requirements and available resources, including physical resources as provided for under the terms of the regional technical college Act, 1992.</P>
      <P>The provision therefore, of additional places on the Bachelor of Business in the regional technical college, Cork is an issue for the college management in the first instance and in deference to the College authorities, this question might have been addressed to the colleage at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that many students expressed their concerns about the provision of additional places on the Bachelor of Business Studies degree programme for the next academic year in the college.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the college has addressed this issue in the discussions which have taken place between my Department and the college authorities on this operational programme for the academic year 1996-97. These discussions included the question of the provision of additional places on the business studies degree programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Final decisions with regard to course provision for the regional technical college-DIT sector are now being taken having regard to available resources. Letters will issue shortly on new courses <Col N="1730" /> and alterations to existing programmes for the sector which includes the regional technical college, Cork.</P>
    <P>Cork regional technical college operates a ladder system of qualifications in business studies, with qualifications at progressive levels of national certificate in business studies, national diploma in business studies and bachelor of business studies.</P>
    <P>During recent years the number of students entering the national certificate course has been increased with an intake in the current year of 166, and the number in second year of 132.  The numbers at the diploma stage have also increased.  In the current year there are 106 students registered on the two streams of this course.  This compares with 67 registered in the last academic year.</P>
    <P>Demand for places on the degree courses comes from a variety of different sources: those students who wish to proceed directly from the diploma to the degree stage; students who obtained their diplomas in previous years and who now wish to return to education and students who obtained their diplomas in other colleges and for whom degree opportunities appropriate to their needs are not available in their home colleges.</P>
    <P>The number of students registered on the bachelor of business studies course in the current year is 41.  Because of the increased numbers in the diploma, and because of the demand in the economy for graduates with the BBS qualification, Cork regional technical college indicated to my Department that the numbers in the degree course should be increased for the forthcoming academic year.  As I explained to the Deputies, the college will be informed of the decisions taken in regard to course provision for the next academic year very shortly.  Approval for new courses or increases in numbers on existing courses will only be allowed provided it is <Col N="1731" /> understood that any resource implications will be met from within the 1996 college budget as sanctioned by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently persons on remand are being kept in our prisons and are taking up space required for convicted persons.  There is need for separate remand centres where those persons could be retained and kept securely away from the prison population. Their needs and requirements are different from those of convicted persons.</P>
      <P>When I tabled this motion I did so as part of an overall package, including the provision of a night court to respond to the ever spiralling lawlessness in our city.</P>
      <P>However, in the wake of the assassinations of Garda McCabe and today, of Veronica Guerin, to whose family and colleagues I extend my deepest sympathy, we must look very carefully at suspending some civil liberties in the pursuit of maintaining our very basic right to live our lives free from threats of violence and intimidation.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the need to establish a separate place of detention for those on remand.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled, I was informed that on 24 May 633 men were in custody in Mountjoy, of whom 102 were on remand, and of the 39 women in custody in Mountjoy ten were on remand.  The absence of a separate remand centre was criticised by the subcommittee of the Council of Europe reporting on penal regimes in what is known as the CPT document, published in the past 12 months.  It was also a key criticism in the Whitaker committee report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that many prisoners serving sentences are also categorised as being on remand, there is a <Col N="1732" /> significant number of such persons occupying much needed prison places. In the context of the revolving door policy it is the convicted offenders who are released to make prison space available, not the remandees.</P>
    <P>Recently we witnessed two tragic suicides which must indicate the stress experienced by those on remand given their status as detained but not convicted prisoners.  In prison, remand detainees are not kept separately but intermingle with those serving sentences. Work is not allocated to them, so they have nothing to occupy their time.  The age of Mountjoy Prison and its function as a place of detention and remand for Dublin, Leinster, Connacht and Ulster, underlines the need for a separate place of detention for those on remand and to make available some of the extra prison places required to deal with current levels of crime.  Towards this end I suggest that the prison population of Wheatfield be transferred to other places of detention and that it be used as a remand centre.  That would be an inexpensive solution to an urgent problem.</P>
    <P>The frustration of the Garda Síochána and judicial personnel at the inadequacy of some of our places of detention is well publicised.  We need to embark on a programme of developing our custodial regimes to deal with the dual roles of rehabilitation of offenders and protecting the public from dangerous individuals.</P>
    <P>There is the added anomaly of St. Patrick's Institution being the place of detention for young persons aged 16 to 21 years, yet there have been cases of persons as young as 15 years being held on remand in Mountjoy.  I strongly urge the Department and the Minister to move swiftly on this issue and to provide the extra prison places and separate remand centre needed to effectively punish the criminal.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent suicide of a constituent of mine, I would like to <Col N="1733" /> quote from an article in the Garda management journal, <i>Communiqué</i> written by Mr. John Lonergan, the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, about dealing with remand prisoners.  He said:</P>
    <P>The second problem is lack of information on incoming prisoners. At present the only information received with a new committal is that contained on the legal warrant plus whatever information the prisoners themselves choose to provide.  This presents a serious handicap for prison staff particularly late at night or over weekends when it may be difficult either to get information or to have information checked out.  A proper assessment process prior to committal would help the situation enormously.</P>
    <P>In other words, there should be psychiatric examination of people held on remand so that prison staff and remand staff know the importance of checking prisoners and keeping them under constant watch.  I thank the Chair and I am grateful that the Minister with responsibility for those Departments is here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scope for providing a separate remand assessment centre for persons recently remanded in custody, awaiting trial or who have recently commenced custodial sentences is a matter continually being considered by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and her Department.  Such a centre would obviously be located in the Dublin area in view of its proximity to the courts and the homes and families of the majority of the offender population. However, the Minister's priority is for the provision of extra prison spaces to alleviate the pressure on existing accommodation. At present there are 2,210 custodial places available in the prison system.  The number currently in custody is 2,250.  While a number of institutions, notably Portlaoise Prison and <Col N="1734" /> the open centres, are currently below capacity due to operational reasons, committal prisons such as Mountjoy and Cork are overcrowded on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>At the end of January last, the Minister announced plans for the provision of an additional 278 prison places.  I am pleased that these plans are being advanced satisfactorily, that already 33 additional places have been brought into use in St. Patrick's Institution and that a further 38 places, which were out of use in Mountjoy due to extensive fire damage last December, will be ready for reoccupation shortly.</P>
      <P>The Minister's second priority is the implementation of the Department's prisons buildings programme for the refurbishment of existing buildings which was announced in 1994 in the Department's policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i>.  It is generally accepted that the conditions in some of our institutions are not satisfactory and, in some cases, lacking basic facilities and must be upgraded as a matter of urgency.  As well as this, the upgrading of services and facilities at all institutions in the context of the implementation of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course, approximately 10 per cent of all persons in custody at any given time are held on remand.  In Mountjoy Prison, where the majority of these are accommodated, the current arrangements provide for separate accommodation and recreational facilities for most remand prisoners at the prison's B wing.  Also, the B wing in St. Patrick's Institution, where a young man died last Sunday, is used to house the remand prisoners committed there.  It is only fair to point out that most remand prisoners have multiple previous convictions and have served previous prison sentences.  The Minister is, however, fully aware of the desirability of separating remand and recently convicted prisoners, especially those who require <Col N="1735" /> assessment, from other prisoners.  I assure the House that every effort is made, within the confines of the existing system, to keep remand and convicted prisoners apart or at least to minimise the opportunities for contact between <Col N="1736" /> them.  The Minister will be keeping the matter under active review as more prison places become available.</P>

      <P>The director's report, which I published on 22 April, concluded that, <i>inter alia,</i> the single biggest factor influencing the price differential was the differential VAT treatment of magazines in Ireland and the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the report also concluded that VAT does not fully explain the price difference.  Two other factors are at work: sterling/punt conversion; and <Col N="1425" /> what is known in the trade as a margin for &ldquo;uplift&rdquo;, which is designed to cover distribution and other costs associated with the sale of British magazines in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A formula for this uplift was agreed with the now disbanded National Prices Commission back in 1983.  It was fixed at 5 per cent at a time when the Irish pound was worth only 85 pence sterling. In the meantime the importers have, to their own benefit, increased the 5 per cent uplift to effectively 10 per cent. There appears to be no justifiable reason for this and it means that Irish prices are higher now than they would be if the original National Prices Commission formula of 5 per cent was being adhered to strictly.</P>
    <P>In addition, the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs referred to procedures whereby the importers make available to retailers a ready reckoner or conversion tables, which result in the same Irish retail price for the same UK cover price on a uniform basis throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report I have considered the matter in some detail.  I have met the two main importers of British magazines, Easons and Newspread.  They have also made written submissions and supplied further information.  I have also met, and have had detailed and extensive discussions, with the two bodies representing the newsagents in Ireland, the Irish Retail Newsagents Association and the National Federation of Retailed Newsagents.</P>
    <P>The Director recommended that the matter be investigated by the director of Competition Enforcement to be appointed under the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994.  The Second Stage of the Bill was taken in the Seanad on 5 June and the Committee Stage in the Seanad will be taken tomorrow, 27 June.  It is the intention to appoint the director as soon as possible and the arrangements for pricing magazines will constitute a priority task for the director.</P>
    <P>In addition I am advised that I have the power to make a maximum prices order under the 1972 Prices Act.  I have <Col N="1426" /> decided to make such an order, fixing the wholesale price of British magazines according to the formula:</P>
    <P>UK Sterling Cover Price ÷ rate of exchange of purchased currency plus 5% + VAT = Irish selling price.</P>
    <P>Further I have asked the consultancy unit in the Department to advise me as to the question of appropriate margins having regard to the findings in the report of the director.</P>

      <P>I confirm that the Office of Public Works has secured a lease on Parnell House, Parnell Square, Dublin 1, as the new location for the Companies Registration Office. This building will also house the Registry of Friendly Societies, the Competition Authority and elements of the Patents Office.</P>
      <P>Work is currently in progress on the planning and design stage in association with the Office of Public Works.  I expect that the building will be ready for occupation in early 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that this date shows slippage on the target date I gave in January.  The planning, design and actual work on the Companies Registration Office premises is, however, a complex process as the fit-out is not simply a matter of partitioning and furnishing the offices.  There are unique requirements in the case of the Companies Registration Office which include the provision of a public office, extensive storage requirements and specialised IT requirements.  All this <Col N="1427" /> process will take some time.  My Department is pressing the Office of Public Works to complete the work as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The move of the Companies Registration Office from its current inadequate accommodation will (a) permit the deployment of essential additional staff for the office, (b) facilitate the full implementation of process and procedural changes recommended by a business process re-engineering study carried out late last year and (c) improve customer service and the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the office.</P>

    <P>In practice, selling prices at individual stations will deviate from above, depending on the level of competition in a particular area and the marketing <Col N="1428" /> policies of individual operators of filling stations and distributors.  As I indicated above, the selling prices at stations vary and I urge motorists to shop around for the cheapest prices.  In this connection in the recent report on the Statoil/Conoco case, the Competition Authority noted that, in some instances, the difference between the highest and lowest price for a particular brand and grade can be as low as 0.3p per litre or over 9p per litre.  The cheapest price for one brand and grade can be 10p per litre or more below the highest price for the same grade of another brand on the same date in different parts of the country, although local price differentials tend to be much lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only too well aware of the unemployment problem in Dublin.  The current level of unemployment and in particular long-term unemployment is unacceptable and this Government has singled out the issue for priority treatment.  In particular, the long-term unemployed have been targeted for special measures.  I have already outlined on several occasions in this House the initiatives involved.  These include the development of more friendly taxation and social welfare regimes and the introduction in this year's budget of a series of precisely targeted employment measures: the splitting of the Community Employment (CE) programme into two distinct targetted options; introduction of a new pilot whole-time jobs option in Dublin, Cork and Limerick; introduction of a new recruitment subsidy scheme called &ldquo;Jobstart&rdquo;; introduction of a new work experience programme called &ldquo;Work-Place&rdquo;; and introduction of special measures for <Col N="1429" /> 18/19 year olds and the retention of certain benefits for those returning to work.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the local employment service represents an important component of the Government's response to tackling long-term unemployment.  The local employment centres are being established in the northside, Finglas-Cabra, Dublin inner city, Tallaght and Ballymun.  As such five out of the initial 14 that are being established nationwide are located in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The distinctive additional elements of this service, in providing an individually tailored progression path towards employment for its clients and in ensuring that there is a well co-ordinated employment delivery service at local level, should yield real benefits in terms of securing employment for long-term unemployed persons, as the service develops.  This innovative approach is being launched initially in 14 key areas, including the major unemployment black-spots &mdash; in other words, targeted where it is most crucially needed.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the above measures together with the ongoing work of IDA Ireland, Forbairt and the Community Enterprise Boards in attracting jobs to the country will have a considerable impact on improving/ enhancing the employment prospects of unemployed people in Dublin as well as other areas/regions.  In this regard I would draw the Deputy's attention to the IDA Annual Report which was published this week.  This report shows record job creation by overseas companies in Ireland during 1995, resulting in IDA Ireland achieving their three year net jobs target one year ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin, in recent times there has been an explosion of jobs created.  In this regard I was pleased to announce a few weeks ago a major expansion of Gateway 2000 involving the creation of 1,200 new jobs for Dublin's northside and which will bring total employment by the company in Ireland to 2,300.  This is remarkable given that their Irish <Col N="1430" /> operation was only established in 1993. Also Deputies will be aware that IBM yesterday announced the creation of 750 new jobs as a result of their decision to set up a customer support centre in Blanchardstown to provide both technical support and customer services for their organisations in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government I would like to take this opportunity of paying particular tribute to all in IDA Ireland, for their achievements in recent times, which represents a doubling of job creation levels in overseas companies compared with a decade ago.  For the information of the House a total of 11,500 new jobs were created and filled by IDA supported companies during 1995, compared with 9,800 in 1994.  Over 10,100 of these new jobs were first time jobs and the remaining 1,400 were the recovery of jobs previously lost.</P>

      <P>The unit for partnership in enterprise, which was established in my Department, in March last year, is currently examining how partnership at the level of the enterprise might be encouraged.  The unit is being assisted by an advisory group on partnership in the workplace, which is considering ways and means of encouraging more co-operative employment relations through greater involvement of employees in the maintenance of competitiveness in the enterprise in which they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater involvement of employees requires improved information and consultation between management and employees.  However, in the interest of competitiveness and more co-operative <Col N="1432" /> employment relations in individual firms it is important that flexibility be afforded to management and employees to develop communications and consultation arrangements which best suit their particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the context of the proposed European Company Statute and associated incorporation mechanisms, discussions are ongoing at EU level on the question of information and consultation of employees.</P>
    <P>Also, ICTU and IBEC have published documents about the development of partnership and improved communications at the level of the enterprise.  It is evident that employee involvement, including information and consultation of employees, is likely to feature in any discussions for a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the question of information and consultation of employees, including works councils, is very much on the agenda of the Government, the social partners and the European Union.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>Both Jobstart and Workplace are new programmes which I launched at the end of May.  The objective of Jobstart is to increase the number of jobs filled in the economy by the long-term unemployed against a background where such persons are often by passed when it comes to job selection.  Workplace is a work experience programme aimed at placing unemployed people with employers on a trial basis with no obligation about subsequent recruitment.</P>
      <P>Up to 5,000 opportunities will be available on an ongoing basis under both of these programmes and I am confident these opportunities will prove significant for unemployed people in their efforts to enter or re-enter the workforce.  It is too early to provide statistics on the specific take up rate of either of these programmes but the projected take up rate by the end of the year is set at 2,000 for Workplace and between 1,200 and 1,500 for Jobstart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> While some concerns have been expressed the Jobstart may be abused, the terms of the programme have been agreed with IBEC, ICTU and the INOU and agreed monitoring procedures have been put in place to ensure that any abuses that may arise will be quickly dealt with.</P>

      <P>As I already informed the House on 17 April last, my plans for 1996 are that the local employment service should be consolidated in these 14 areas.  I believe it is preferable to assess the progress of these 14 areas before we consider undertaking further expansion.  In this regard it is proposed that an evaluation of the service will commence later this year.  What we learn about the current phase will be of benefit to other areas in establishing the service in the future.</P>

      <P>The Forfás report Shaping Our Future presents a wide-ranging examination of long-term strategy at a time when the Irish economy is progressing well on all fronts.  As a framework document, it sets out what we as society can achieve in terms of economic and social development over the next 15 years if we adopt the right policies.</P>
      <P>The report is a valuable contribution to policy development in a wide range of areas which span several Government Departments &mdash; including the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Shaping Our Future gives a structure for consideration of long-term objectives and the impact of decisions made in relation to the choices facing Government in the short to mediumterm.</P>
      <P>Shaping Our Future catalogues where we are and sets out principles to guide the development of policy in important areas such as enhancing competitiveness, realising the potential of the services sector, research and development and the information society.</P>
      <P>In adopting any new policies or altering existing ones it would be my intention to use the Forfás report as a key input and indicator.  We will also be using their analysis in framing my Department's policy papers on human resources, enterprise policy and the services sector.</P>

      <P>The Consumer <Col N="1437" /> Credit Act, 1995 which entered into effect on 13 May 1996 regulates all forms of consumer credit and enshrines a statutory pro-consumer codes of rules which applies to all providers of consumer credit.</P>
      <P>The Act defines the true rate of interest as the APR as the total cost of credit to the consumer expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of credit granted.  In simpler terms, APR is the true rate of interest.  All charges as well as interest are included in APR. APR is therefore considered to be the best means of comparing the cost of different types of credit.</P>
      <P>In the area of housing loans, the Act sets out detailed rules for a common method for calculating the total cost of a housing loan.  This method comprises interest and all other associated fees and charges.</P>
      <P>Before the consumer enters into a loan agreement, lenders are required to supply details relating to the amount of credit advanced, the number and amount of repayment instalments, the total amount repayable, the cost of the credit and the APR.  This enables the consumer to compare with confidence and assurance the various range of products on offer as well as giving a clear picture of the total financial obligations and required outlays.</P>
      <P>Section 132 requires the consumer to be informed of all administration, acceptance, valuation and legal fees payable in respect of a housing loan. Details of such fees must be included in information documents, application forms and loan approval forms, thus ensuring that such fees are not hidden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 131 contains wide-ranging regulation-making powers which allow for the drawing-up of comprehensive detailed transparency requirements in the respect of the disclosure of all fees, charges, and commissions in connection with a housing loan and any associated insurance policy, particularly endowment mortgages.  I am consulting with my colleague the Minister for the Environment on how best to achieve the disclosure and transparency objectives of <Col N="1438" /> the Act.  I am confident the disclosure regime that will be put in place will be the most advanced of its kind and will provide the consumer with a meaningful basis for making an informed choice.  It will be based on regulations and will serve consumer interests best because: it will be prescriptive; it will avoid the lack of flexibility inherent in primary legislation which is neither practical nor suitable in dealing with complex disclosure issues, such as when commissions are paid by way of benefit in kind; regulations will allow for the drawing-up of a comprehensive range of detailed transparency requirements, which can be adapted from time to time to deal with potential circumvention in addition to any anomalies which may emerge; and equal disclosure obligations will apply to both the mortgage lender and the intermediary, which was not the case previously, thus the principle of equity of treatment is being respected.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act contains comprehensive provisions under which banking institutions must lodge with the ODCA the slate of charges to customers on the provision of certain banking services.  The section furthermore requires the banks to notify the office of the director of any proposals to increase charges, to justify their proposals and to seek the sanction of the director &mdash; who may or may not approve &mdash; for their proposed course of action.  The cumulative effect of all of these measures is to ensure that all customers will have full information on all fees and charges associated with the provision of credit and other financial services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 26 and 40 together. A number of programmes and initiatives are operated by the industrial development agencies, my Department and the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs and Environment designed to improve the infrastructure of the Border areas and to attract and encourage an increase in employment in overseas and indigenous industry in the region.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland have developed the following programme for the Border region:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to facilitate the construction of a 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>&mdash;to identify and acquire a substantial landbank in Drogheda for a new industrial park.</P>
      <P>&mdash;to identify and acquire a site in Cavan Town for the construction of an advance factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" />&mdash;to review the availability of suitable industrial sites in North West/Donegal region.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to develop a business park in Letterkenny.  It is envisaged that a private developer will provide a 25,000 sq. ft advance factory on this site and it will be vigorously marketed.</P>
    <P>Agreement has already been reached with a Sligo based developer for the provision of a 25,000 sq. ft. factory at Finisklin Industrial Estate, Sligo.  Forbairt are actively promoting their total range of programmes and initiatives in the Border region and have been working closely with firms in the region with a view to increasing their sales and employment levels.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Washington Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland, Forbairt have assisted the US Embassy in arranging a programme for 16 US companies to visit Northern Ireland and the Border region.  Approximately 78 appointments were arranged for companies in the Border counties and other parts of Ireland.  Negotiations on new business partnerships have taken place as a result and are still ongoing.</P>
    <P>A number of pan Atlantic partnership programmes have been funded through the US Department of Commerce, the International Fund for Ireland and Forbairt with the objective of helping Irish firms, particularly in the Border counties, to grow through technology acquisition and/or strategic alliance with US partners.</P>
    <P>The programmes, which include the Forbairt/IFI North American Partnership Programme, the Forbairt Small Business Administration (US) Partnership Programme and the American Management and Business Internship Programme (AMBIT) were all launched during 1995.  I anticipate that they will contribute to the growth of participating companies from the Border region in the medium to long-term. Under the North American Partnership, the first phase of which was launched in April 1995, it is expected that 900 new <Col N="1441" /> high tech jobs will be created from the nine partnerships already formed.  It is anticipated that ten companies per annum from the Border counties will participate in the AMBIT programme over the next three years.  The county enterprise boards from the six Border counties have approved 682 projects worth £6 million in grants, of which almost £3 million was drawn down by the end of 1995.  A further 81 projects worth £648,526 in grants have been approved so far in 1996.</P>
    <P>The European Union through the Structural Funds supports a number of major programmes which apply throughout the Border region including the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-99 and the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme 1994-99 under which the county enterprise boards are supported.</P>
    <P>The EU also supports the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG programme.  Out of a total of £96 million available to Irish Border counties, £36 million has been specifically earmarked for the Department of the Environment to part fund the provision/improvement of roads and water and sewerage works.  The improvement of such basic infrastructure is a prerequisite for the expansion of industrial development in the Border counties, as industrialists are most likely to choose to locate in areas where good infrastructural facilities exist.</P>
    <P>Additional funds have also been made available under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation for the provision of suitable industrial infrastructure.  The administration of these funds is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I would refer the Deputy to the response given to a parliamentary question from Deputy O'Hanlon by the Minister for Finance on 21 May in this respect.</P>
    <P>Finally I am aware that the International Fund for Ireland has contributed to the provision of community and workspace in the Border region. Administration of these funds is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology secured additional funding of £4 million in this year's budget to begin working on the implementation of the recommendations of the Tierney report on Science, Technology and Innovation published last year.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology, Deputy Rabbitte specifically allocated £600,000 to Ph'D's Support.  This has resulted in doubling the support rate for 160 PhD students per annum.  In addition he introduced a new post-doctoral fellowship scheme.  Funding of £200,000 has been provided for ten fellow-ships in 1996.  The Minister also established a fund for international collaboration which enables researchers, most of whom are post-graduates, to develop bilateral research contacts for which a sum of £200,000 has been provided.</P>
      <P>A further £1.4 million has been allocated to research programmes in the third level sector &mdash; viz. the Basic Research, Strategic Research and Applied Research Programmes.  These programmes also support research at post-graduate level.</P>
      <P>In general, research projects from post-graduate students are in the science and engineering disciplines.</P>

      <P>The statement in question was made by the Director of the NMRC at the launch of the centre's annual report for 1995.</P>
      <P>All responsible commentators have been saying for some time that technological innovation underpins international competitiveness and that we must re-double our efforts to better exploit and harness knowledge for the betterment of society in general and industry and services in particular.</P>
      <P>The message is not new.  It comes across in the Culliton report, in the STIAC report and as recently as the Forfás report <i>Sharing our Future</i> which says that our success as a country in the coming decades will depend on our ability to adapt to a variety of high skills and specialised knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of upgrading the technological competence in Irish industry is something that spans the entire industrial and scientific policy area.  The responses to this challenge range from: (i)  generating greater collaboration between universities, research institutes and industry to (ii) promoting greater <Col N="1444" /> participation by Irish companies, particularly SMEs, in the research programmes of the European Community to (iii) creating greater linkages between technologically advanced companies in Ireland and smaller sub-supply companies to (iv) creating a more positive attitude towards issues relating to Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>The STIAC report addresses the whole issue of science, technology and innovation in a comprehensive way and has made a series of recommendations. Provision was made in the 1996 budget for an extra £4 million to start the process of implementing these recommendations. Of this £250,000 has been allocated for a dedicated, professionally-managed awareness campaign intended to improve the perception of science, technology and innovation in the media, among the public and among opinion makers.  A three year programme is being finalised by Forfás with the intention of augmenting the ongoing awareness activities carried out by various agencies, both in the public and private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the figure of 6,000 emanates from a recent report in a sunday newspaper, which quoted the Small Firms Association as stating that there are shortages of available staff to fill vacancies in both the highly skilled and blue collar sectors of Irish industry.  I am not aware of the methodology that was used in arriving at this figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> With regard to possible shortages in the highly skilled areas, I recently pointed out to this House that the availability and quality of skills of our labour force is one of the key competitive advantages that we have in attracting inward investment.  It has a central influence on investment and location decisions of overseas companies and so it is imperative that this competitive advantage is maintained.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned that in the light of the pace of technological change, the difficulties which accordingly arise in making accurate and timely forecasts of manpower needs, skill shortages can develop.  At present, for example, there are world-wide shortages of software skills and of experienced electronics engineers and technicians.  Potential difficulties in these areas in this country have also been identified and my Department is taking steps, in conjunction with the Department of Education which has primary responsibility, to ensure that the future needs of industry for these types of skills will be met through the universities and the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of a shortage of language skills in the area of telemarketing operations.  Steps are being taken to address this by the relevant State agencies. It will continue to warrant focus by both the education and the training systems to improve standards in this area.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, although the number of vacancies notified by FÁS has increased substantially over the past year, the FÁS Employment Service is continuing to achieve a very high level of success in its endeavours to assist employers to fill such vacancies.  FÁS has informed me that it is continuing to monitor very carefully, in conjunction with the various interested parties in industry, any possible emerging skills shortages over the next few years. Where any such instances are identified, FÁS will tailor its programmes to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government is continuing to improve the after-tax income of workers and, in particular, workers on low <Col N="1446" /> incomes.  In this context, the general tax and PRSI position of the low paid has been improved in recent budgets.  A range of reforms have already been implemented, which include: exempting low incomes from health and employment levies; increasing standard rate income tax bands; increasing personal income tax allowance and introducing, in the 1995 budget, a PRSI allowance of £50 per week for full rate contributors so as to focus relief on low income earners. This allowance threshold was increased substantially in the 1996 budget, to £80 per week.</P>
    <P>As well as seeking to improve the after-tax income of low paid workers, the Government has made considerable progress in reducing the cost of employing people and, thus, easing the competitive difficulties of business, through the introduction of a lower contribution rate for employers' PRSI in 1994, which has been improved in the 1995 and 1996 budgets.  Following this year's budget, two-thirds of all jobs will now be subject to the new low rate of 8.5 per cent.  This Government will make further progress in the area in its next budget.</P>
    <P>I recently launched a major policy document on the labour market which clearly acknowledged the importance of tax reform as a central policy instrument to achieve our labour market goals.  The strategy paper, in addition, specifically highlighted the priority areas for action which are aimed at improving the after-tax income of workers, particularly those on low incomes, and reducing the cost of employing people.</P>
    <P>In addition to tax and PRSI improvements, the Government in its 1966 budget placed a clear focus on improving the benefits of working by implementing measures aimed at easing the transition from unemployment to work.  This is being achieved by a combination of improved child benefit and improved FIS which is tilting the reward to work.  These measures are being reinforced with further pro-employment initiatives such as the potential for the long-term unemployed to retain the <Col N="1447" /> medical card for three years and child dependant allowance for 13 weeks after securing employment.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that the shortages to which I referred earlier are the most pressing at present, I would also be concerned about the emerging skills and needs of the future, and I am concerned that this major strategic issue should be tackled.  This subject will be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper on Human Resource Development.</P>

      <P>I understand that the decision to close Donegal Rubber was taken despite intensive top level meetings in Germany between the company's senior executives and IDA representatives.  The closure of this enterprise was unfortunately part of an overall restructuring plan which also included substantial job cuts at other sister plants in Germany.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has an intensive promotional campaign under way to attract new industry to the town as quickly as possible, not only for the Donegal Rubber plant but also for a number of 3,000 sq. ft. units, together with an 11 acre serviced site in Ballyshannon, which taken together or separately will assist in the marketing of the area for industrial development purposes.</P>

    <P>These prices are &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; prices supplied by the oil companies.  Actual prices charged by individual wholesalers and retailers will vary from the above depending on competition, marketing policies and practices etc. of wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in petroleum products noted in May 1995-96 the bulk of the increase is the result of the rise in crude oil on international markets.  The increase announced in the budget and the consequently higher monetary amounts of applicable value added tax have also contributed to the increase.</P>
    <P>For the manufacturing industry energy expenditure represents about 1.80 per cent of gross output.  For industry overall, energy expenditure represent about 2.91 per cent of gross output. Petroleum oils on their own represent about 0.62 per cent.  In this context, the price increases experienced in oil products over recent months would not, in general, have a significant effect on Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Some industries have, of course, above average energy usage.  Examples include manufacture of non-metallic mineral products and mining and quarrying.  These sectors would be more affected by oil product price increases.  It is difficult to be precise, however, about the significance of that effect.</P>

      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the reply given by the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology to Deputy Lynch on this subject on 17 April 1996, as reported in the Dáil Debates, volume 464 No. 1, columns 148-149.</P>
      <P>In that reply the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte indicated that the Intellectual Property Unit of this Department was engaged in a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law, which was taking account of:</P>
      <P>I.  Our international obligations under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Rome Convention for the protection of Performers, Producers and Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations;</P>
      <P>II. EU legislation on, <i>inter alia</i>, rental and lending, cable and satellite broadcasting, databases and duration of copyright together with proposals for EU legislation on resale rights and private tape levies.</P>
      <P>III.  Technological developments;</P>
      <P>IV.  The legitimate interests of both suppliers and users of copyright material; and</P>
      <P>V.  The need to ensure that copyright law does not impede legitimate creative activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department received a substantial number of comprehensive written submissions from interested parties on many of these subjects and afforded each party the opportunity to make an oral submission in support of its material.  The IP Unit recently completed this phase of the review process and it commenced drafting heads of <Col N="1451" /> consolidating legislation in this extremely difficult and technical area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that copyright involves private property rights and that any piece of legislation that expands the rights of one group will lead to additional demands from, and upon others.  Accordingly, there is a need to ensure that the Bill, when complete, will strike a balance between the interests of rights owners on the one hand and users on the other, whilst ensuring continued creativity in all spheres of economic life.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring forward this legislation as soon as possible but the Deputy will appreciate that given the difficulties and technical issues involved, the importance of the legal rights provided for and the nature of our international obligations, we must proceed cautiously.  The Deputy will wish to be aware in this context that quite an amount of work in this area at the international level will be completed at a Diplomatic Conference to be held in Geneva in the latter part of our presidency of the EU.  The decisions taken at that conference will also impact on our new Copyright Bill and will have to be incorporated into that Bill.  The Deputy can be assurred that there will be no delay in processing the legislation and that the Minister of State concerned will make every effort to expedite it.</P>

    <P>In drawing up the steering committee <Col N="1452" /> my aim was to cover a broad range of interests while at the same time keeping the committee to a manageable size. The information society is very broadranging and many sectors have legitimate interests.

    <P>Submissions have been invited by way of direct mailing and advertising in the national newspapers and a significant number have already been received.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the views of all relevant interest groups will be taken into account by the committee in the course of its deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be chairing the Industry Council.  My main priority will be to see to it that European action to improve the competitiveness of industry will be pursued on several fronts.  I will ask industry ministers to take stock of the subject on the basis of the Commission's First Report on Competitiveness of European Industry.  I intend to pursue initiatives such as the development of a bench-marking programme designed to monitor competitiveness policies in member states and the results of those policies.</P>
      <P>Another priority will be the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which play a key role in jobcreation; it is my intention to complete work on two important programmes in favour of SME's and in so doing to press for appropriate provisions on the role and needs of very small enterprises. Third, I believe that the effective adaptation of European business to the information society is vital for its future competitiveness.  Given the pervasive influence of modern information technology, a response at the level of the European Union is essential.  The issues posed are many and complex.  I will pursue industry-related aspects of the information society in the industry council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, will be chairing the Research Council.  The main priorities of this council will be the mid term review of the fourth framework programme of activities in the field of research and technological development and the establishment of the foundation work for the fifth action programme.  Research Ministers will also prepare the ground for the adoption of an action programme on innovation. Another important aspect is enhancing the participation of SME's in the European Union's research and technology activities.  Research Ministers will also advance the discussion on <Col N="1455" /> the Commission's Green Paper on Innovation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology will also chair a meeting of the Consumer Affairs Council where the priorities include advancing as far as possible Commission proposals for new European Union legislation in the matter of access to justice; consumer credit; after sales service and guarantees.  The protection of consumers in the information society is an important emerging theme which will also be addressed.</P>
    <P>The main item of the Social Affairs Council, to be chaired by Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, Minister of State, with responsibility for labour affairs is the preparation of a major report to the Dublin European Council, based on member states multi-annual employment programmes, deepening the strategy decided by the European Council at Essen and focusing on long-term unemployment, youth employment and women.</P>
    <P>Other priorities are to conclude the work on the directive concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services; a directive on carcinegens; a new directive on burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex.</P>
    <P>We will advance Commission proposals for the revision of EU legislation on equal treatment between men and women as regards occupational social security schemes and positive action.</P>
    <P>The Social Affairs Council will also examine the manner in which social protection systems can contribute positively to the fight against unemployment.  In addition, it will explore other facets of that debate including how to meet more fully the requirements of women and the lessons that can be learned from various new approaches being developed throughout the member states.  In the context of these exchanges, Ireland will seek to explore with member states how the important problem of social exclusion can best be tackled.  Many of these are of course the <Col N="1456" /> responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will see that the work programme of the Department of Enterprise and Employment during the Presidency covers a broad spectrum of policy areas spanning the four Councils listed above and including also issues which are the responsibility of other Ministers.  The programme has been designed to give prominence to issues of employment, competitiveness, small and medium sized enterprises and the information society and myself and my colleagues the Ministers of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology and for labour affairs will be co-ordinating our work across the various Councils to ensure that effective progress is achieved in these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to two separate but related matters &mdash; whether financial allocations to the county and city enterprise boards represent a good use of taxpayers money and, more generally, whether current institutional arrangements for the delivery of Government job creation policy are appropriate.  I propose to address these questions in turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the sum of £18.75 million mentioned by the Deputy as having been allocated to the county and city enterprise boards in the current year, I should point out that this consists of an aggregate £14 million in small enterprise <Col N="1457" /> grant approval capacity, and £4.5 million in respect of projected expenditure on indirect supports to small enterprise development, including the provision of business advice and counselling, mentoring services, assistance with management development, and the promotion of an enterprise culture at local level.  I am satisfied that these allocations are required to enable the boards in the current year to discharge the broad responsibilities for local enterprise promotion assigned to them by the Government, and under the Local Enterprise Sub-Programme of the EU Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994 to 1999, and that they represent good use of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>A review of the operation of the county enterprise boards as part of the brief of the external evaluator appointed under the Operational Programme has now commenced.  This review will be undertaken at two levels; assessing the progress achieved at the overall level of the Local Enterprise Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme; this will be complemented by review activity undertaken by each county enterprise board.  The review will examine the success of the boards in achieving the aggregate quantitative and legislative targets set out in the operational programme and in the enterprise plans prepared by each board.  This review will also contribute to the mid-term review to be carried out under the community support framework. The key areas of job creation, and the sustainability of the jobs created, will be most carefully assessed and monitored to ensure that public funding allocated to this area continues to be deployed efficiently and to the greatest effect.</P>
    <P>On the question of streamlining our job creation agencies, I assume that this refers to the option of consolidating the functions in this area in national bodies smaller in number and more generally focused than the range of initiatives currently active in the area.  The policy of the present as well as the previous <Col N="1458" /> Government has been to accentuate the specialised approach to enterprise development policy, principally through the establishment of the separate remits of Forbairt and IDA Ireland in the industrial development sphere, and the establishment of the county enterprise boards to address the problems of enterprise development at local level.  I do not believe that it would be useful or productive at this time to reverse this policy.  For example, any move to discount the initiative, energy and enthusiasm which have been harnessed by the county enterprise boards at local level through a transfer of responsibility for local enterprise development activity to a national agency could deprive the enterprise development effort of those clear benefits, and would run counter to sentiments expressed by many Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Current organisational arrangements for the promotion of employment through enterprise are, of course, kept under ongoing review by my Department. I am also most anxious that the greatest possible complementarity is achieved in the operations of national and local enterprise development initiatives to ensure that the resources available for this purpose are optimally employed.  Complementary operational practice between the national agencies and local initiatives is therefore strongly encouraged.  The county strategy groups, established under the Department of the Taoiseach, are an example of an institutional instrument with the specific objective of securing such complementarity at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The central policy consideration of this Government is the need to create employment and provide opportunities for those seeking work.  At national level a wide range of initiatives have been implemented to encourage the recruitment of additional workers and create the environment within which this can most effectively happen.  I draw the Deputy's attention to my recently launched Growing and Sharing Our Employment strategy paper which has two clear overall objectives i.e.: to set a policy framework to increase employment and the employment intensity of growth; and to bring back into the mainstream of the labour market those currently excluded.  Also, the last budget focused particularly on the long-term unemployed and those who are most marginalised on the labour market.</P>
      <P>Severe unemployment problems are also affecting other member states of the European Union and these are informing the deliberations of all Council of Ministers meetings.  The Irish Presidency in the latter half of this year will ensure that political concern at European level continues to focus on the central problem of unemployment and that all policies are informed by the need to create work for those currently unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> The Irish Presidency will put particular emphasis on ensuring that the strategy decided at the European Council in Essen in December 1994 is followed through with determination.  This focuses on ensuring that there is increased investment in vocational training, on improving the employment intensiveness of growth, on the reduction of non-wage labour costs, on greater effectiveness of labour market policies and on the implementation of specific measures to help groups particularly affected by unemployment.  In this respect we will be working to ensure that the single report on employment to the Dublin summit in December, which is to be worked out jointly by the Social Affairs Council, ECOFIN and the European Commission, will focus on long-term unemployment, youth employment and equal opportunities for men and women.</P>
    <P>The European Pact of Confidence on Employment recently proposed by Commission President Santer has further concentrated attention on the importance of the issue of employment. This seeks the active involvement of Governments and the social partners in agreeing policy initiatives at European level which will further facilitate higher employment growth levels in member states.  The Irish Presidency will support positive developments in this context, and these will be informed by the convergence criteria which have been established for membership of the European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>There is general acceptance that, given the scale of the problem of unemployment and the urgency of effective policies to address it, the intergovernmental conference should also consider this issue.  Ireland has always insisted, and with considerable success, that the European Council should seriously focus on employment and support policy proposals to effectively address this central problem.  In this vein, the Irish Presidency will also be actively involved in the intergovernmental conference in exploring the scope for constructive treaty amendments so as to improve the <Col N="1463" /> effectiveness of the employment policies of the European Union and their impact &mdash; in particular on those member states, such as Ireland, which have higher than average levels of unemployment.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a similar question on 13 June 1996, a sum of £250,000 is being made available this year from the science and technology budget in my Department for a dedicated, professionally-managed awareness campaign intended to improve the perception of science, technology and innovation in the media among the public and opinion makers. This programme has been prepared by <Col N="1464" /> Forfás and is intended to augment the ongoing awareness activities carried out by the various agencies, both in the public and private sector.</P>
      <P>The programme approach is to work with organisations already active in the area of science, technology and innovation awareness; to that end, Forfás liaised with a wide range of groups in recent months with the objective of building on what is already happening and adding value to what is already in place.  This consultation process is almost complete and I expect that details of the programme will be announced by Forfás in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem raised by the Deputy.  The figure mentioned by him corresponds to audio-visual industry estimates submitted to my Department and, if accurate, is deeply disturbing.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to address this problem and, in the context of the comprehensive review of copyright being undertaken by my Department, will examine the penalties for copyright infringement and their effectiveness in inhibiting unlicensed copying for gain.  It may well be that the existing penalties are far too low and need revision so that pirates regard the penalties as serious inhibitors to crime rather than slight impediments to their activities as they appear to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criminal provisions outlined in section 92 of the Trade Marks Act, 1996 would appear to provide a useful template in this regard.  The Government is also examining tightening up the existing copyright law to ensure that those <Col N="1479" /> engaged in unlicensed copying and the distribution and sale of unlicensed copies for profit will not be able to use the law and its current requirements that knowledge of an offence must be proved in order to escape legitimate penalties.</P>
    <P>The Government regards the eradication of unlicensed copying in all sectors of the economy, not just the audiovisual sector, as a priority.  The negative impact on legitimate traders, and the revenues lost to the Exchequer, form the basis of our need to deal with this matter urgently.  The new Copyright Bill, which will have to be discussed in both Houses of the Oireachtas, will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the activity of large-scale unlicensed copying for the purpose of profit is halted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the analysis to which the Deputy is referring was based on statistics published by Dun and Bradstreet Limited in respect of liquidations in 1995.  In publishing the statistics, Dun and Bradstreet Limited indicated that the number of business failures in 1995, at 571, was down by 10 per cent on the previous year.  The press release went on to say that the decline in the number of business failures reflected the strong performance of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering that since the services sector represents the largest sector of employment in the economy, <Col N="1480" /> 61 per cent in 1995, according to the labour force survey, it is reasonable to assume that the highest number of liquidations would be reflected in this sector. Nonetheless, one of my principal concerns is to ensure that help is available to business to enable them to survive and develop to their full potential.  A range of measures are already in place for this purpose and further measures are in the process of being implemented to improve the overall operating environment for small business and services.</P>
    <P>In regard to the service sector, I am currently working on a services policy statement.  This document will review the impact and growth of the services sector on the structure of production and employment in the economy and examine the factors which affect the growth and development of services.  It will also review the balance and types of State supports to ascertain whether these are appropriate and adequate. The policy statement will be aimed at redressing an imbalance in policy which has existed against services for some time, with the objective of creating substantial additional employment.</P>
    <P>An area to which I attach special importance is the financial environment for small business.  The £208 million access to finance scheme is providing fixed interest rate loans for the creation of jobs and to increase the commercial viability of small business, many of which are services.  I extended this scheme to include the services sector for the first time.  This scheme, which carries a 6.5 per cent subsidised interest rate, was created to provide long-term, low rate finance to small business and service firms.</P>
    <P>This Government has an ongoing commitment to help small business and services in the creation of enterprise and employment.  This commitment is reflected in many aspects of Government policy.  For example, the 1996 budget reduced the rate of corporation tax, which was of particular benefit to the services sector.</P>
    <P>The agencies which come within the responsibility of my Department, <Col N="1481" /> including FÁS, Forbairt and Shannon Development, provide a range of support measures to assist enterprises and help them to survive and develop.  These measures include training, management development, advisory services and mentoring programmes.  The nation-wide system of 35 county and city enterprise boards is designed to assist small and micro enterprises at start-up level through the provision of direct financial assistance, e.g. grants, or indirect financial assistance, including business advice, information, mentoring and management development assistance.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he envisages as a means of tackling the high level of unemployment in Cork city, as evidenced in recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office showing a 10 per cent rise in the number of jobless in the past three years.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Live register figures for the past three years do not show an increase of 10 per cent in the level of unemployment in Cork city but in fact show a more modest increase of 5.4 per cent.  I am only too aware of the unemployment problem in Cork.  The current level of unemployment and in particular long-term unemployment is unacceptable and this Government has singled out the issue for priority treatment. In particular, the long-term unemployment have been targeted for special measures.  I have already outlined on several occasions in this House the initiatives involved.  These include the development of more friendly taxation and social welfare regimes and the introduction in this year's budget of a series of precisely targeted employment measures: the splitting of the community employment, CE, programme into two distinct targeted options; introduction of a new pilot whole-time jobs option in Dublin, Cork and Limerick; <Col N="1482" /> introduction of a new recruitment subsidy scheme called Jobstart; introduction of a new work experience programme called Work-Place; introduction of special measures for 18-19 year olds and the retention of certain benefits for those returning to work.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Local Employment Service represents an important component of the Government's response to tackling long-term unemployment.  The service is being established in Cork by Cork City Partnership Limited and the distinctive elements of this service, in providing an individually tailored progression path towards employment for its clients and ensuring that there is well co-ordinated employment delivery service at local level, should yield real benefits in terms of securing employment for a long-term unemployed persons as the service develops.  This innovative approach is being launched initially in 14 key areas, including the major unemployment black spots, in other words, targeted where it is most crucially needed.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the above measures together with the ongoing work of IDA Ireland, Forbairt and the community enterprise boards in attracting jobs to the country will have a considerable impact on improving-enhancing the employment prospects of unemployed people in Dublin as well as other areas-regions.  In this regard I draw the Deputy's attention to the IDA annual report published this week.  This report shows record job creation by overseas companies in Ireland during 1995, resulting in IDA Ireland achieving their three year net jobs target one year ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Government I take this opportunity of paying particular tribute to all in IDA Ireland, for their achievement in recent times, which represents a doubling of job creation levels in overseas companies compared with a decade ago.  For the information of the House a total of 11,500 new jobs were created and filled by IDA supported companies during 1995, compared with 9,800 in 1994.  Over 10,100 of these new <Col N="1483" /> jobs were first time jobs and the remaining 1,400 were the recovery of jobs previously lost.</P>

      <P>The Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994 is currently with the Seanad where Committee Stage is scheduled for 27 June.  The Bill provides for the introduction of public enforcement of competition rules, by giving the Competition Authority the power to investigate anti-competitive activity, either on its own initiative or as a result of third party complaints, including the power to take court actions.  The Bill also provides for the appointment of an Authority member, to be known as the Director of Competition Enforcement, who will have principal day-to-day responsibility for enforcement.  In addition, the Bill introduces criminal offences for breaches of competition law and provides that the courts may impose stiff penalties on those found guilty of such offences.</P>
      <P>I believe the introduction of independent public enforcement of competition rules in the pro-active manner provided for in the Competition (Amendment) Bill, together with the threat of stiff fines and imprisonment for serious breach of the law, will make the enforcement of competition law much more effective than has been the case to date.  I expect to have the Bill enacted soon.</P>

      <P>Allocation: 12.5 mECU.</P>
      <P>Delivery Mechanism: Local authorities are responsible for sub-programme 2(c) &mdash; urban and rural regeneration.</P>
      <P>ADM Ltd. is responsible for implementing measure 2, communityled development.</P>
      <P>This sub-programme involves the promotion of wide-ranging local development and of social and economic regeneration.  It covers the improvement of the social and physical environment of the worst affected areas, urban areas, towns, villages and rural areas.  Such actions can include: landscaping and clearing of derelict sites; community development and the provision of facilities for small businesses; rural infrastructures; and the development of social and cultural activities, in particular where these are the results of local partnerships implementing integrated local development plans. Measures can also include: training and capacity building for regeneration; pedestrianisation and the provision of parks and playgrounds; and the support for the modernisation of small businesses both in urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Sub-programme 5: Productive investment and industrial development.</P>
      <P>Allocation: 7.5 mECU.</P>
      <P>Delivery Mechanism: Measure 1, investment promotion is presently being handled by Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Measure 2, new industrial development services and measure 3, trade development are handled by ADM Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative aims to enhance existing facilities and to promote productive <Col N="1485" /> investment, industrial development and services, particularly the development of SMEs.  In recognition of the benefits of closer co-operation between SMEs and larger companies as a motor of growth, specific measures have been implemented to improve the linkage of firms and SMEs and promote local supplier networks.  The initiative will also support marketing efforts in SMEs, development strategies to strengthen RTD and interest subsidies through the EIB.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a charge to tax will depend on the particular circumstances. A charge will not arise on a mobile phone provided by an employer to an employee for business purposes only.  In other circumstances a charge will arise on the element of the costs met by the employer which relate to private use. These costs will usually relate to the cost of private phone calls where these are not reimbursed by the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the employer, a sole trader, has a mobile phone the usual rules as <Col N="1486" /> regards the allowability of business expenses for tax purposes apply i.e. only those expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in connection with the business are allowable.  Costs associated with the private use of a mobile phone are not, therefore, allowable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The BTSB has informed my Department that the prevalence rate for hepatitis C in the donor population between 1991 and 1992 was 0.08 per cent and in 1995 had fallen to 0.01 per cent in the donor population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The likely incidence of hepatitis C from blood transfusions can be calculated from the national operational testing programme.  Of approximately <Col N="1487" /> 11,000 persons who were recipients of blood and blood products and who have come forward for testing under the optional testing programme the incidence of hepatitis C antibodies is 0.3 per cent.  However, this rate may change significantly when more persons are tested as it is probable that those persons who had high exposure may have presented under the operational testing programme at the early stages of the programme for testing.  It must also be borne in mind that a number of persons who have been tested under the national optional testing programme had other risk factors for hepatitis C besides transfusion of blood or blood products.</P>
    <P>The targeted lookback programme is tracing blood transfusion recipients of potentially infective blood/blood products. Of the recipients tested to date 58 per cent have evidence of previous hepatitis C infection and while testing is not complete for hepatitis C virus from the results to date it is expected that 35 per cent to 40 per cent will have evidence of continuing infection.</P>
    <P>In relation to children who received potentially infected blood transfusion prior to October 1991, the results to date indicate that 78 per cent are free from hapatitis C virus.</P>
    <P>Both the targeted look back programme and the national optional testing programme are ongoing.</P>
    <P>The precise number of blood transfusions that take place annually in Irish hospitals is not known.  However, the number of units of issues from the Blood Transfusion Service Board to Irish hospitals in 1995 was 217,535, of which 5,773 were returned.  Therefore, the number of transfusions per annum is estimated to be in the region of 212,000. However, it must be borne in mind that one patient may receive more than one transfusion.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned the total number of blood transfusion/blood product recipients who have been tested for hepatitis C under the national <Col N="1488" /> optional testing programme is approximately 11,000.</P>
    <P>For the first three months following the launch of the programme when the largest turnout would have been expected the number of people attending was an average of 2,000 per month.  From December 1995 to May 1996, the number of people attending each month has ranged from 587 to 723 per month, with the excess of 600 persons attending each month since January 1996.  Therefore the number of people attending per month during 1996 has not declined.</P>
    <P>I am not currently considering placing further advertisements in newspapers but I will continue to keep the programme under review on a monthly basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the initial phasing of the scheme persons aged 65 years and over were indentified as a priority group and additional resources have been made <Col N="1490" /> available to health boards to enable them to provide dental treatment services including dentures for this group.

    <P>Full dentures will be provided to all edentulous persons with medical card entitlement.  These dentures will be mainly provided at health board dental clinics.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 to 61, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As part of an ongoing development programme, additional funding of £12 million has been made available in 1996 for the continued development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>A sum of £3 million of the £6 million revenue funding is being used to meet the 1996 cost of the additional services which were put in place in 1995.</P>
      <P>The remaining £3 million is being used to provide additional services in 1996 including: 265 additional day care places, around 70 additional residentialrespite places and further extension of the home support services.</P>
      <P>Of the £6 million capital funding which is being made available, £2 million is being used to support the general service developments associated with the additional revenue funding and £2 million to develop training facilities for persons with mental handicap as part of the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further £2 million capital funding is being made available to the Eastern Health Board in respect of the provision of additional residential facilities for persons with a mental handicap.  This <Col N="1492" /> funding is being made available over a two-year period.  A sum of £1 million is being made available in 1996 with a further £1 million at the beginning of 1997.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £44.58 million was invested in the development of the services in the period 1990 to 1995 which has enabled the health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this additional funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services.  However, I am aware that more needs to be done. The Government's commitment to the continued development of the services, as resources become available, is reflected in my decision, with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to prepare a five-year development plan to meet the needs identified by the new national mental handicap database.  I expect this plan to be ready later this year.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the official launch of the national mental handicap database will coincide with the announcement of the five year development plan later this year.  I will forward to the Deputy a copy of a preliminary report from the database which was published recently.  This is the first public release of data in relation to the database.</P>

      <P>Last week the Bill passed all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas and I am now in a position to finalise negotiations with professional groupings to put in place the necessary administrative arrangements for the delivery of the health services set out in this Bill.  I do not anticipate any undue delay in this regard.  It is proposed in the Bill that eligible persons will enter the dental treatment service scheme (DTSS) as a new cohort and can access emergency dental treatment by attending the dentist of choice from the list of constractors (of which there are 600 nationwide) held by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any person with hepatitis C being denied dental treatment.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and he will let <Col N="1496" /> me have the details I will investigate the matter and respond to the Deputy directly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The initiative is <Col N="1499" /> in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers, and particulary those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all the schools in question, inviting their application. The centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information currently available to my Department, the school in question would be eligible for consideration for support under the scheme and will have recently been invited by the Education Research Centre to submit an application for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit a five year development plan.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problem of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>
    <P>The school in question currently has the services of a shared remedial teacher.  I am not in a position at present to make an additional remedial teacher post available to the school.</P>

I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in <Col N="1503" /> this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.

As part of this process, consideration is currently being given to how my Department can best respond within available resources to the range of special needs presenting for the forth-coming school year, including those relating to remedial and resource teacher support.  It is my intention that this consideration be completed as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend the pilot scheme of grantaid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.  In 1995, I allocated a sum of £150,000 for <Col N="1505" /> the pilot phase of this scheme.  All applicants for support under the scheme were carefully considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>It was decided that the pilot phase should focus on the following areas: services conveying children to special schools for the physically handicapped, and to provide assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for the hearing-impaired and visually impaired who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.  In 1996, a sum of £150,000 has also been made available for the operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to fully evaluate the operation of the pilot phase before considering any modification or expansion of the scheme.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the children attending the special schools in question will be given every consideration in the event of any further expansion of the scheme being undertaken. The School Transport Review Committee, established earlier this year, has been asked to review the arrangements for pupils in special schools.  The provision of escort services will form part of this review.</P>

      <P>Detailed information on expenditure on rent and mortgage interest supplements on a health board basis was provided for in 1994, following the introduction of a new system for the collection of data relating to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Information prior to 1994 is estimated and is only available on a national basis. The available information on expenditure on rent and mortgage interest supplements for the years in question are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1994, following concern caused by the escalating costs in relation <Col N="1513" /> to rent and mortgage interest supplements, the above group was established by a Government decision to report to the Minister for Social Welfare on the role of SWA in relation to housing. The group was comprised of representatives of the Departments of Social Welfare, Health, Environment, Finance, health boards and local authorities.</P>
    <P>The report outlined the origins of rent and mortgage supplementation under the SWA scheme and identified the possible factors underlying the increased expenditure on the supplements in recent years.  It also looked at the broader social housing picture, including voluntary housing and its interaction with the SWA scheme, and examined issues arising in the use of SWA as a housing support.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years, SWA has become a major form of housing support. Between 1989 and 1995, the total expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements increased from £7 million to some £60 million.</P>
    <P>During 1995 the average number of households in receipt of payments in any month was in the region of 32,000 for tents and 7,000 for mortgagres.  This represents one third of all privaterented households in the State.</P>
    <P>The review group identified the SWA scheme as a flexible means of responding to housing needs for both tenants and mortgage holders and recognised that SWA housing supplements are now a mainstream housing support mechanism, operating outside the framework of overall housing policy. <Col N="1514" /> A fundamental difference between the SWA and the local authority approach in the allocation of housing resources was identified in that once a housing need is established it is met immediately under the SWA scheme whereas the local authority can only meet need on a priority basis in the light of available resources.  As a consequence, SWA meets the needs of those deemed to have the lowest priority and can be a cost effective means of providing housing for single people and those unable to meet their housing needs from their own resources.</P>
    <P>This situation highlights the need for an integrated approach to the allocation of housing resources by a single agency within a single legislative framework to ensure better value for money and a more efficient use of resources.  The use of private rented accommodation by the State to meet housing needs should be fully integrated with existing housing policy.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of this Housing Review Group report, an inter-departmental committee under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, and with representatives from the Departments of Health, Social Welfare, and Finance, was established to examine the main issues arising from the report and the transfer of the administration of rent and mortgage supplementation to the local authorities in line with a commitment in the Government programme.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of this group was held on 27 March 1996 and the committee will report to Government in due course.</P>

    <P>The main reasons for the increased expenditure on rent and mortgage interest supplements</P>
    <P>(1)<i>Budgetary Increases</i></P>
    <P>In recent years special increases in excess of the rate of inflation have been provided to SWA recipients.</P>
    <P>(2)<i>Increases in the Live Register</i></P>
    <P>Increases in the live register have increased the claimant base for SWA payments for supplements and exceptional needs payments.</P>
    <P>(3)<i>Increase in the number and cost of rent and mortgage supplements</i></P>
    <P>Increased expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements can be attributed to increased unemployment, the lack of availability of local authority housing and the demand led nature of SWA rent supplementation.</P>
    <P>(4)<i>Changing family circumstances</i></P>
    <P>The growth of marriage breakdown and the increase of one parent families have lead to a greater demand for rent and mortgage supplements.</P>
    <P>(5)<i>Retention of secondary benefits</i></P>
    <P>Participants on the community employment schemes, back to work scheme and VTOS educational scheme (no longer included in live register figures) can retain any secondary benefits to which they were entitled to (or to which they may become entitled) during their participation on the scheme.  Such secondary benefits include rent and mortgage interest supplements, diet supplements, and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance under the SWA scheme.</P>

      <P>The following Table 1 sets out the amount of lottery funding disbursed by my Department under the various grants of support for voluntary and community organisations for each of the years 1988 to 1995 and the allocation for 1996.  For the sake of completeness, I have also given details of the allocations for the grant schemes that were not lottery funded in the years in question in that table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> The lottery funds allocated to my Department have been used to fund a number of schemes of grants and other supports to voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    <P>As there were a very large number of individual grants under the various schemes in the years in question, I do not propose to circulate the details with this reply.  Details of all grants paid since 1990 are in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.</P>
    <P>The amounts shown under the community development programme as the 1996 allocations are provisional.  Payments to projects participating in the programme are made on a quarterly basis and depend on continued progress on the implementation of the agreed workplan and receipt of accounts and returns for payments previously issued.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 does not provide aid for guest houses, self-catering or bed and breakfasts.  This is due to the readiness of the market to respond to visitor growth without grant assistance.  The programme recognises, however, that there are a number of market segments where the quality of existing accommodation is deficient and includes a provision to assist, on a selective basis, investment in certain areas.  These are: accommodation-related conference and leisure facilities, a limited scheme of accommodation improvements to existing small and medium sized hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bed-rooms and graded up to and including three star, limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation needs such as caravan and camping park facilities, upgrading and improvement of existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes, provision of <Col N="1526" /> new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuits centres in remote areas currently without appropriate accommodation, improvement of existing accommodation at approved residential equestrian centres, horse-drawn caravan and motor-home investments, the additional cost of providing, in existing hotels, suitable access-friendly accommodation for people with disabilities, and improved access for people with disabilities at hotels and major visitor centres.</P>
    <P>The funds provided under the programme for tourism development projects are now considerably over-subscribed and, unfortunately, those available for specialist accommodation related developments are fully committed. The possibility of allocating additional resources to this area is being considered in the light of the upcoming mid-term evaluation of the programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that he raised a similar question in the House on 25 May 1994.  At that time my predecessor indicated that the Central Statistics Office could not provide precise data on the percentage of bovine hides processed in the country. This is still the position in relation to the figures sought for 1995. Forbairt estimates, however, that apart from high seasonal peaks, there is capacity within the country to process a large proportion of hides available from cattle export premises.  In these circumstances there are no current plans for increasing tanning capacity.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the employment subsidy scheme which involved the payment of a subsidy of £54 per week for 52 weeks, payable in instalments over a 78 week period, to employers who expanded their workforce by recruiting persons who had been signing on the live register for at least eight weeks. This was a specific and limited duration scheme agreed with the EU Commission who funded 75 per cent of the cost.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to re-launch the scheme, but the Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that last month I launched &ldquo;Jobstart&rdquo;, which is targeted at the very long-term unemployed, who have been identified as the groups most in need of Government assistance in order to secure work.  For the purposes of the scheme, they are defined as persons who have been unemployed for three years or more.  Employers will be entitled to a subsidy of £80 per week over a 52 week period in respect of each eligible recruit.</P>

      <P>A target of 35 per cent placement into jobs and 25 per cent into further education-training by end of 1997 has been set following recent changes to the CE programme. As CE has only been in operation since April 1994, it is too early yet to evaluate the full impact of the programme. However, FÁS in conjunction with Irish Marketing Surveys conducted research in 1995 which showed that of those that left community employment in August 1995, 54 per cent returned to the live register, 10 per cent were unemployed but not on the live register and 38 per cent were employed.  I can assure the Deputy that the programme will be subject to ongoing evaluation and assessment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for his second year payment under the REP scheme.  However, under revised monitoring and control procedures implemented by my Department recently, compliance checks are required to ensure that farmers have completed the specific works outlined during the first year of the plan before second year payments can be made.  A compliance check will be carried out on the applicant's farm shortly and assuming all is in order payment will issue as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, payments are not refused simply on <Col N="1532" /> the basis of trivial clerical errors in the completion of application forms.  The problem is that failure to properly complete an application form leads to delay in processing a case for payment.  In practice many errors, e.g. invalid tag numbers, are capable of correction following consultation with the applicant. In this regard I am satisfied that my Department's response time to farmers who have had problems with their applications improved considerably during 1995 and will improve further in 1996.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate that many schemes are highly complex but, given the considerable amount of money involved, as much as £650 million annually, it is not unreasonable that the EU Commission lays down very specific conditions for filling forms and meeting other requirements. My objective is to keep administrative procedures as simple as possible within the constraints of the Commission regulations.  My Department is continuously monitoring all aspects of the schemes with this in mind.  Help sheets and checklists are made available with all application forms.  In addition, assistance is available to farmers at local offices and through the services offered by Teagasc.</P>

      <P>The person in question applied for assistance under the scheme of grant-aid for investment in commercial horticulture which has a budget of approximately £600,000 per <Col N="1533" /> annum.  One of the conditions attached to this scheme is that only investments which do not qualify for assistance under another scheme are eligible.  Most of the investment being undertaken in the case in question qualifies for assistance under the farm improvement programme. The position has been explained to the person in question by staff of my Department on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>While the farm improvement programme was suspended on 8 December 1994 it was re-introduced on 1 November 1995 but limited to horticulture only.  The person in question should now make application for assistance under this scheme.</P>
      <P>In view of the size of the budget for the commercial horticulture scheme compared with the demand for assistance from it, it is necessary to award grants on a priority basis.  A deadline of 31 January 1995 was set for receipt of applications for the first round of grants. A total of 423 applications were received.  Each of these applicants had to be visited by an inspector of my Department and an overall assessment of the applications made which of necessity, took some time.  One hundred and thirty-five applicants were approved for grant assistance and these were notified in October 1995.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided that the transport strategy recommended in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative will provide the policy frame-work for the future development of the transport system in the Greater Dublin Area.  The DTI strategy endorsed the development of the existing HeustonKildare Arrow rail service and indicated that patronage on the new service should be monitored and that the possibility or extending it to Connolly and Pearse stations should be reviewed in line with market needs.  However, the extension of the Arrow service to Connolly and Pearse stations is not among the priority public transport projects identified by DTI and included in the <i>Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999.</i> I have not received any proposals from CIÉ for such an extension.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I approved the allocation of funding under the Operational Programme for Transport for a package of investment in DART and other suburban rail services in Dublin, including the construction of new DART stations at Barrow Street and Fairview, a new Maynooth line station at the old Drum-condra station and a new station at Kil-cock. Iarnród Éireann has responsibility for implementing the individual elements of the package.</P>

      <P>As I outlined previously to the House the EU introduced a five-year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the common fisheries policy.  Under the terms of this programme, which covers the years 1996 to 2000, member states were required to submit their proposals for 1996 before 15 November 1995, the Commission decision on the extent of funding to be announced before 15 March 1996.  For subsequent years members states' proposals must be submitted before 30 June of the preceding year, the Commission decision to be announced before the end of December.</P>
      <P>In submitting proposals for 1996 Ireland placed particular emphasis on securing support for the requirements to implement the new entry-exit arrangements which came into operation on 1 January 1996 and which are an essential element of the new control measures for the Irish Box.  In addition to these items, funding was sought for a range of control measures to be operated by the Departments of Defence and the Marine. The total amount of expenditure under the programme for both Departments for 1996 is £5.8 million, of which £4.3 million will be met by the EU.  In agreeing to the 1996 programme the EU Commission recognised Ireland's unique position by giving a higher rate of intervention to many elements of our package and by contributing to Ireland's operational costs.</P>
      <P>In relation to the programme for 1997, the position is that Ireland's submission which will be made to the Commission before the deadline of 30 June will provide for a downpayment for a new Naval patrol vessel.  The Commission will consider Ireland's application in conjunction with those of other member states and will decide before the end of the year the level of funding to be made available.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate what level of support might be achieved and, consequently, what level of matching funding will be required for the purchase of the patrol vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> Subject to a satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations with the Commission, the tendering process will be initiated early next year.</P>
    <P>Pending delivery of the new patrol vessel, the Naval Service will continue to provide a fishery protection service using the existing seven patrol vessels, a number of which will be refurbished under the five-year programme.</P>
