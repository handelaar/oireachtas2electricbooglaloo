      <P>I seek the Adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 30 to debate the following matter: the placing by the Government of the contract for the hire of an executive jet with a UK company, Hunting Aviation, which neither owns nor operates such aircraft, the accommodation of Hunting Aviation on terms more favourable than those on offer to other tenderers, including an Irish company, and the nature of the business relationship between Hunting Aviation, ExecAir and relevant third parties.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 12 &mdash; Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 1996 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed) and Remaining Stages; No. 13 &mdash; Competition (Amendment) Bill 1994 &mdash; Report and Final Stages; No. 2 &mdash; Control of Horses Bill, 1996 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and No. 14 &mdash; Statements on &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; (resumed).

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 12 satisfactory and agreed?  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for the adjournment of the House until <Col N="311" /> Wednesday next at 2.30 p.m. satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government proposes to introduce legislative changes or other procedures in this session or the later session to deal with the drugs problem? Every Member of the House is aware from the large number of meetings organised by concerned citizens around the country that the drugs problem is at an epidemic level.  There is no disagreement on that.  The Taoiseach will also be aware of recent reports that double the number of addicts are now prepared to voluntarily seek treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if it is proposed to introduce legislative measures to address this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern in the House about the number of murders that have occurred, and also the concern felt about the level of substance abuse.  They are matters of grave concern.  On both issues the requirement is for the most effective possible respect for and enforcement of existing legislation.  That is the priority as far as the Garda Síochána and other authorities are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be stated in regard to drugs that there is a particular problem with <Col N="312" /> international trafficking in drugs which generates what is, in effect, on-the-street marketing of drugs to increase demand for drugs in order to satisfy the financial demands of the drugs barons internationally.  One of the areas I am most anxious the European Union should make progress on is the supply of drugs into Europe as a whole, and into Ireland in particular, across our international frontiers.</P>
    <P>I also believe there should be greater uniformity of penalties for drug-related offences throughout the European Union so that no one country, because of having lesser penalties, can become an attractive location for the international management of drug trafficking. One the other hand, there is the question of personal responsibility on the part of individuals who choose to use drugs.  It is very important that people should exercise their personal responsibility and not start using these substances which destroy not only their own lives but frequently also the lives of those who love them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach received the final report from the constitutional review group; when does he propose to establish the all-party committee, and will he publish the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will be published promptly on receipt.  I have not yet received it.  I will be proposing that the all-party committee upon which work is well advanced would be established immediately on publication of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider having the matter of drugs debated urgently, in conjunction with the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, because of the situation within the prisons, which I readily admit did not start yesterday, and the number of drug pushers?  The Taoiseach said we should enforce existing legislation.  The reality is that in this and other cities, in urban and rural Ireland, people are breaking the laws by selling drugs <Col N="313" /> openly.  It is a joke to talk about enforcing existing measures when we are not doing so.  We need to start taking the issue seriously before it gets totally out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A special sub-committee of the Committee on Legislation and Security is already considering this matter and it would be the wish of the House as a whole that they would intensify their work.  It is important to make the point that there are two dimensions to this problem &mdash; supply and demand. As far as supply is concerned, it is very important that we take action to deal with the international activities that are promoting the use of drugs and deal with organised crime generally, and that the European Union equip itself with the legal means of dealing with that problem.  As far as demand is concerned, emphasis must be placed on education of people so that they realise the appalling choice they are making from their point of view if they use drugs for the first time.  At the same time there is a measure of personal responsibility that needs to be acknowledged. Individuals have a responsibility to themselves to ensure they do not use addictive substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to convince 12 and 13 year olds of their responsibility when they are subject to peer pressure.  We have to realise that we are not talking about 20 year olds.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comment regarding stepping up activity in this area.  As to the existing legislation, I wonder about it listening to gardaí at meetings night after night.  If it does exist we need to take it seriously and try to enforce it, and that is a matter for the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is a member of the Deputy's party who chairs the sub-committee on drugs.  I will convey to him the House's wish that this committee should intensify its work. I have no doubt the Deputy will do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Given existing European legislation, is it the Government's intention prior to our Presidency of the European Union to publish the freedom of information legislation?  How speedily does the Taoiseach expect that to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that legislation will be published during the Irish Presidency but, obviously, Irish citizens are entitled, in regard to EU documents and the EU Commission, to avail of the existing freedom of information obligations that the Commission has placed on itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the second report of the review group on the Attorney General's office which I received this morning.  I am sure it is only a coincidence that we have a number of parliamentary questions on that matter tabled for this afternoon.  The Taoiseach is shaking his head.  I take it, therefore, that it is not a coincidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has placed a construction on something.  I would like to clarify it so that he will not proceed under a misapprehension.  The position is that the six-monthly report was approved for publication in the normal way by the Cabinet yesterday.  It has no connection with any other concerns that may be expressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <P>Regarding the remarks of the Minister of State responsible for technology and science yesterday on Irish Shell, will the Taoiseach <Col N="315" /> agreed that Japan is in breach of many things, including the destruction of whales, and call for the banning of Nissan cars which have a factory in his constituency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Taoiseach's comments this morning about educating young people away from drugs, will he consider bringing forward the Juvenile Justice Bill?  The problem of drugs is a problem of young people. The victims of drugs are young people. We have the most out-of-date juvenile justice legislation of any member state of the EU.  The Government cannot be concerned about young people and drugs if it continues to drug its feet in bringing forward that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Juvenile Justice Bill will be produced later this year. This legislation consists of 227 sections. It is a very large Bill to which much careful consideration needs to be given in view of the rights of the people involved, the children and others concerned with their welfare.  Obviously that legislation is being carefully drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking clarity on the status of a White Paper.  Is a White Paper a document which contains Government decisions?  We heard an extraordinary contribution last evening by the Minister for Education which seems to indicate that it is merely a discussion document.  It is important to clarify the status of the document prior to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to have clarity on the status of the document. Last evening in a most extraordinary contribution, the Minister seemed to indicate that we could interpret the document in various imaginative ways.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when the House or relevant committee will deal with the 1994 Electrol Bill?  It was sidelined some months ago until a legal opinion from an arm of the Taoiseach's Department had been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the legal opinion on that matter is being considered.  When it has been considered in the light of various judgments that have given rise to the concern I will be in a position to give an indication to the Deputy as to the timetable and the amendments that may be required to the Bill.</P>

      <P>On promised legislation, is the Taoiseach aware that there are as many as 800 applications for fish farming licences on the back burner in the Department of the Marine?

      <P>Tomorrow, the party Whips will have their final meeting on Dáil reform issues for the life of this Dáil.  Two important issues have been continually raised with the Taoiseach. Will the Taoiseach allow the Chief Whip to be more forthcoming on the handling of the Order of Business?  Will we be able to table questions during July and September or at least have written questions on one day a week during July and September?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

I am asking the Taoiseach to allow the Chief Whip to be more forthcoming on two important issues, otherwise it will be very hard to continue to do business in an orderly way.  I have asked the Taoiseach a number of times to be helpful on those two issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  As I said earlier, we are left with no option but to pursue this legislation.  We simply must respond appropriately to the Labour Court determination and the unambiguous legal advice obtained.  I suppose <Col N="320" /> it could be argued that the reinstatement scheme is something of an anachronism. The climate in which it was first introduced in 1956 and subsequently extended in 1973 was very different from that which prevails today.  To say that women's role in public life in those days was peripheral would be an understatement. For example, it would have been almost unthinkable that a woman could have steered either of those earlier Acts through the Oireachtas. Women were completely unrepresented either at Cabinet or among the ranks of Ministers of State or Parliamentary Secretaries as they were called, in those days.  It took some 60 years before it was considered posible to follow the example set in the case of Countess Markievicz.</P>
      <P>The 1973 legislation, which effectively widened the circumstances in which a woman who had resigned from the Civil Service on marriage could be reinstated, was progressive for its day. Previously only widows could be reinstated.  After 1973 and woman who resigned on marriage, even after the lifting of the marriage bar, could be considered for reinstatement so long as she could establish that she was not being supported by her husband.  There is a sustainable argument that the scheme could still serve a useful purpose.</P>
      <P>In these different times concepts of equality have developed and widened. Actions taken today must be seen not to favour one gender over the other or to give preference on the basis of marital status.  Equality must share with its parent virtue of justice a complete blindness to such distinctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying, however, that we could not or should not be proactive in promoting fuller involvement by women in the public service.  Far from it.  Within the parameters imposed by law, whether Irish or European, the Government is determined to pursue policies which will encourage greater participation rates among women, in particular in the most senior ranks of the public service.  It is not simply a question of equality.  It is an issue of hard-headed <Col N="321" /> economics.  If we see human resources as the most important asset of any organisation, then it stands to reason that it should optimise the benefit of that asset.  Under-representation of women in the higher grades of the Civil Service represents the uneconomic use of a valuable resource.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, significant progress has been recorded in the Civil Service in the area of fuller participation by women.  We are certainly headed in the right direction but the journey is far from over.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that any women who have applied for reinstatement and who are eligible on age grounds will now compete for places on the special panels in the clerical assistant and executive officer competitions which it is intended to set up for former civil servants.  I referred to these in more detail on Second Stage.  Many of these women have much to contribute.  They have their previous experience of the work-place rounded by their subsequent experiences of family life.  Modern organisations &mdash; the Civil Service is, in essence, no different from any other entity in this regard &mdash; require flexibility as never before.  They want people who are more interested in making things happen than in adhering rigidly to procedure. They want people who value instinct and intuition as well as analysis and rationality.</P>
    <P>Charles Handy, an Irishman who has an international reputation in the area of management redesign, has observed:</P>
    <P>Women over the generations have had to make things happen and get things done, with or without formal authority.  They have had to handle endless variety in managing the home, taking decisions on inadequate information, backing hunch and judgment. They have had to be in turns disciplinarian and loving mother.  Not all women do these things well, by any means, but few men have had that much practice.</P>
    <P>Organisations need talented <Col N="322" /> women in their core jobs, therefore, not only for reasons of social fairness, important though that is, but because many of those women will have the kinds of attitudes that the new flat flexible organisations need.</P>
    <P>We are working towards a more flexible, flatter, customer-oriented Civil Service.  We need to avail of all the talent at our disposal, regardless of gender, in pursuit of this necessary change.</P>
    <P>I now wish to pick up on some of the points made by various Deputies.  I am pleased to note the general concern shown by a number of speakers about the under-representation of women in the upper reaches of the Civil Service. On Second Stage I outlined the situation which prevailed in 1932 when the Brennan Commission reported.  Of all the quotations I have discovered in Government documents, the following from the Brennan Commission report is the one which galled me most.  It stated:</P>
    <P>If a woman recruited to the post married after eight or ten years service, the main purpose for which she has been employed entirely fails and she has, moreover, during that time been blocking the way of a man who could give good value for the service in question.</P>
    <P>Any time I need to console myself about the slow rate of progress with regard to matters concerning women in the Civil Service or other areas where women have been discriminated against, overtly or covertly, over the years, I just have to remind myself of what the situation was in 1932 to realise that we have made enormous progress.  While there is no point in rehearsing what I said in my opening speech, I will merely reiterate that progress, albeit at a slower rate than one might wish, is being made in this area.  I assure the Deputies who touched on this point that there is no complacency on the part of the Government on the question of fuller participation by women in top management in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I can understand Deputy McDowell's <Col N="323" /> surprise that the reinstatement provisions cannot be retained for women who were forced to resign on marriage. His reaction is one which many, I suspect, would share.  I assure the Deputy, however, that the Government was anxious to preserve the scheme for the women who had no choice but to resign under the marriage bar.  However, we received unambiguous legal advice that the Equal Treatment Directive does not permit positive discrimination to compensate for past discrimination; discrimination which took place prior to the enactment of the directive is not relevant to its provisions.  We have, unfortunately, no discretion in this area. However, it is hoped that the new provision, whereby the next two series of clerical assistant and executive officer competitions will include special sub-panels for former civil servants, will go some way towards facilitating the reentry to the Civil Service of women who resigned on marriage.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Lenihan's query as to the number of women who were obliged to resign under the marriage bar, it is impossible to compute an accurate figure at this juncture. However, the number of women who qualified for a marriage gratuity can be used as an indication of the number forced to resign on marriage.  In the five-year period 1968 to 1972, inclusive, an average of 121 women qualified for a marriage gratuity.  This figure would not, of course, include those women who resigned on marriage but who, because they did not have five years' service, did not qualify for a gratuity.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the marriage bar ended on 31 July 1973.  In the period 1985 to 1995, inclusive, an average of 29 women per annum qualified for reinstatement under the statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan urged me to extend the clerical assistant and executive officer sub-panel arrangement into the future.  That option was considered. Having examined the possible pool of candidates, it is unlikely that any of the <Col N="324" /> women who were forced to resign on marriage before 1973 would still be eligible to compete after the second such competition has been held.  As it was this pool of women that we essentially wanted to target, there is little point in extending the arrangement beyond the two competitions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill, which I commend once again to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank you, A Cheann Comhairle.  I thank Deputies for their contributions and those in my Department who prepared the way for this Bill and did excellent work on it.  We are not satisfied with the present status of women, particularly in the higher grades of the Civil Service.  A great deal has yet to be done.  There are still glass ceilings, but we cannot continue to blame the marriage bar for lack of progress.  We are now researching the reasons for lack of progress and why women are not putting themselves forward for competition even though they are eminently qualified to do so.  We hope to be able to remove the obstacles which appear to be still in the way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> That Dáil Eireann, pursuant to Standing Order 103 of the Standing Orders Relative to Public Business, directs that the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, in whole be recommitted to a Committee of the whole House.</P>
    <P>The reason I have tabled this motion is that the Minister has tabled for Report Stage many amendments which alter the shape, content and thrust of the Bill to a much greater degree than we had anticipated.  He has also failed, within those amendments, to address many of the issues he said he would address when we discussed the Committee Stage of the Bill in January.  Mindful of the fact that one can speak only once on Report Stage, unlike Committee Stage when one may speak several times, it is not right that so many amendments have been tabled.</P>
    <P>My aim is to have the Bill recommitted to a Committee of the whole House.  In April there was a worthwhile seminar, which was addressed by many eminent people who were of one mind that it was flawed legislation.  Many comments were made about the unenforceability of its measures which, in some instances, were considered draconian and, in others, far too lenient.  It is universally regarded as bad legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is noted for his diligence and commitment to a close scrutiny of matters within his brief for which I commend him, but this legislation will not stand him in good stead among the business community not just in Dublin but throughout the country.  It will not achieve what it sets out to do.  It started off as bad legislation in Deputy Quinn's day, but is now worse.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to agreed to the motion under which it would be recommitted <Col N="326" /> or, alternatively, allow the review committee which will be set up to give its findings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is extremely complex legislation.  I have taken careful note of the criticisms levelled at it on Committee Stage and taken steps in the amendments I have tabled for Report Stage to allay the concerns expressed about expert evidence, the presumption of guilt and the uncertainty surrounding warrants of appointment of officers.</P>
      <P>I have taken considerable time to see how the Bill can be made enforceable and considered the arguments advanced against it.  I am satisfied that it is robust legislation which is not in any way flawed, although I admit that it is complex and that we are breaking new ground in creating criminal offences in this area.</P>
      <P>The Bill will place competition law in its rightful place.  It will allow third party complaints to be dealt with by the Competition Authority.  In extreme cases they may be dealt with not only under the civil law, but under the criminal law. I cannot accept that we did not debate all the issues thoroughly on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>At least seven of the amendments are technical.  I am aware that the Bill will be recommitted in respect of some of them.  This will allow us to have a more interactive debate on specific amendments which, as the Bills Office recognises, need that style of debate.  I cannot agree, therefore, to the motion under which the Bill would be recommitted. The way in which the House has arranged its business will ensure that Deputies will have a full and adequate opportunity to deal with issues of concern.</P>

      <P>I moved the amendment which defines &ldquo;director&rdquo; as including a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the undertaking concerned are accustomed to act but it does not include such a person if the directors are accustomed so to act by reason only that they do so on advice given by the person in a professional capacity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the folly of not allowing new material put before this House at this stage in a criminal statute to be discussed and teased out as it comes up for consideration.  I have no objection to the principle of making shadow directors come within the rubric of this Act in so far as it applies to directors but I have a far wider objection to this amending Bill in that its purpose is seriously flawed.  We should not delude ourselves about what we are doing. Recently a seminar was organised at which all these matters were gone into in some detail and at which the consensus was, apart from those present at administrative level from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, that this was a foolish enterprise in that it was seeking to criminalise anti-competitive behaviour in circumstances where it would have the effect of making it more difficult to prove civil wrongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a proposal to decriminalise certain actions.  If an action is both a crime as well as a civil wrong it will fall to be viewed by the courts in accordance with a strict construction of the Act.  If ever a case is brought under this Bill &mdash; I do not believe it will because anybody who has ever addressed a jury could not contemplate bringing a case of this kind before a jury on this legislation in its present form &mdash; and is appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal the standard of interpretation of this Act relative to the deeds or omissions, to which the prosecution relates, will be the same in the Court of Criminal Appeal as in the High Court.  Therefore, the Act will have to <Col N="336" /> be interpreted in exactly the same way. It follows that we are now introducing, effectively, a criminal standard of proof for anti-competitive injunctions and anti-competitive actions.  The Minister has not addressed this folly, nor did the Department's representatives at the particular meeting.  Every person who contributed to the debate saw the danger into which we were walking, which is that the Act will become effectively inoperable.  Whereas I have no particular objection to changing the Act to permit shadow directors to be dealt with in the same way as directors, I have a strong objection to the consequences of that change which means that an inoperable Act will become even more complicated.  I ask the Minister yet again to consider the folly of what he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue raised by Deputy O'Rourke, clearly the definition as set out could refer to a person advising in a professional capacity, if the directors were accustomed to acting on their instructions, but clearly not otherwise. This definition has been used in the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wider issue raised by Deputy McDowell and a number of commentators, I have studied it carefully and I have got legal opinion on the issues raised.  I am satisfied, having received legal opinion, that the approach we are taking is robust.  There is no support for the proposition that where an individual set of events gives rise to civil and criminal liability, the civil claim falls to be determined on the same standard of proof as the criminal claim.  To do so would belie belief if the Legislature has provided that it is possible to take a civil action for a certain set of behaviours and determines in certain instances that it may be a criminal offence.  It would stand logic on its head to suggest that the courts would proceed to say that &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; would have to be applied in the civil case rather than the &ldquo;balance of probabilities&rdquo;.  We have other instances where one can take a civil action in respect of assault and <Col N="337" /> one does not have to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in respect of driving offences, people can be sued in respect of behaviour which might possibly also constitute criminal offences.  There is no suggestion that those civil cases would have to be tried on the basis of proof beyond reasonable doubt.  To proceed with a criminal case a higher standard of proof would be required. However, it does not follow that because a high standard of proof is required for a criminal case the same should apply in respect of actions under section 6.  Given the concerns expressed in this regard, I sought sound legal opinion on the matter and I am satisfied that the approach being adopted is robust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know exactly what the term &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; means.  I do not want to make a speech on the matter without having an opportunity to ask the Minister what he intends by use of that term in this context. I want him to explain the difference between &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; and &ldquo;consent&rdquo;. If I connive at something, do I not automatically consent to it?  If I connive at an outcome, do I not, by definition and in logic, also consent to it? How could one connive at something to which one did not consent?  I want to tease out this matter.  If this amendment extends the meaning of consent, I want <Col N="338" /> to know the basis on which it does so. That should be done in a Committee Stage debate and not on the basis of three people making speeches which would not set out in a satisfactory way the nuances of these terms and the distinction, if any, between them.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why the Minister is behaving in what I suggest, as politely as possible, is a pig-headed way whereby we must agree to changes to our criminal law without discussing the precise implications of the terms he suggests. If necessary, I can make very long speeches.  There is nothing to be lost in terms of time by recommitting the Bill in respect of these amendments, but there is everything to be gained in terms of common sense.  If the Minister allows a sensible discussion on these proposals, time will be saved rather than lost. Otherwise, each time this issue arises time will be lost on a division.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In this Act references, however expressed, to an act that is done with the consent of a person shall be construed as including references to an act that is done with the connivance of a person.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This technical amendment deals with the definition of the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; which will be construed as including both consent, which would mean acquiesce or agree, and connive, which would involve intentional active or passive acquiescence.  It is designed to accommodate those situations where people passively acquiesced to an action which had a damaging impact on others and provides for a definition of the word &ldquo;connive&rdquo; where the consent can be active or passive.  In all cases the courts would have to be satisfied about the offence and the guilt of the person involved.  Under the amendment the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo; can be construed as including passive acquiescence as well as active consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask the Minister if &ldquo;consent&rdquo; equals &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; but it seems from what he said that it does.  I am puzzled about the purpose of the amendment and the definition of the word &ldquo;connive&rdquo; which can <Col N="343" /> be construed as including intentional active or passive acquiescence.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>In this Act references, however expressed, to an act that is done with the consent of a person shall be construed as including references to an act that is done with the connivance of a person.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of the amendment and why was it tabled?  As Deputy McDowell and I have stated, in spite of the best legal advice available the Bill is flawed, and the amendment is another example of this.  At the seminar in April an eminent person said that a commercial mind without a real understanding of criminal law had drafted the Bill and that it was like a burglar alarm box with a note which read, &ldquo;this is not attached&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an extraordinary piece of legislation and I will continue to make that point on every amendment.  I know the fine men and women working in the Department of Enterprise and Employment but the Bill is like a railway line where work on the drafting of it is undertaken at the first station and it is passed at the last station.  However, there is no station where one can stop to consider whether the Bill is worth pursuing or needs to be redrafted.</P>
      <P>A sign at one of the stations on this train journey read, &ldquo;Minister to set up competition review body&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil and the other parties were pleased when the Minister made this announcement as we believe this body is very necessary. The person who was supposed to be in charge of the body was unable to take up the position but the Minister proposes to press ahead with its establishment. Will the Minister put a stay on the Bill until the competition review body has had an opportunity to put forward its views on proper competition legislation?  Labour activists want the Bill because they believe they can slay dragons with it.  However, the Bill will not kill a fly, let alone slay dragons, as no one can be prosecuted under it.</P>

    <Col N="344" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier in the debate the Minister made a facile defence of the Bill based on the proposition that it is possible to assault somebody and to be liable civilly for it and to be criminally prosecuted for it. In the former case there is proof on the balance of probabilities while in the latter case there is proof beyond reasonable doubt.  If that is the standard of the advice given to the Minister then I am dismayed.  The real issue is whether certain behaviour is prohibited by section 4 or 5 of the Competition Act.  This is a matter of law; it is not a matter on which there can be two standards of proof.  We cannot have a situation where a judge in one court says that certain behaviour is lawful while a judge in another court says it is not lawful because there is a higher standard of proof.  In an assault case the standard of proof as to whether something took place may differ between civil and criminal proceedings but the nature of the act does not differ; it is an assault for a person to lay a hand on someone else's shoulder without their consent.  That is a matter of law and it is no defence in a criminal proceeding to say that there is a different standard of proof.  If the case is proven beyond reasonable doubt and it is established that a person physically interfered with somebody else then it is an assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applying that reasoning to these circumstances, the Minister's advice is fundamentally flawed and deficient in that he does not seem to understand that, as things stand, certain actions are prohibited by the Competitions Act, 1990. If they are prohibited by that Act then it will be a criminal offence to engage in them in certain circumstances after the enactment of the Bill.  The standard of proof between the two is not what is at issue.  What is at issue is whether certain circumstances are to be judged as unlawful.  The advice tendered to the Minister seems to have missed the point that henceforth the issue as to whether a particular agreement or practice is unlawful will have to be decided on the same legal basis for civil and criminal <Col N="345" /> cases.  As was stated at the conference in April, the courts will have to apply a uniform standard to these issues.</P>
    <P>I come to the second point.  It has never been clearly explained, and I challenge the Minister to do so now, whether in a trial for an offence under sections 4 or 5 of the Competition Act 1991 &mdash; that is an offence under section 2 of this Act which would be an offence under section 4 or 5 of the 1991 Act &mdash; a jury will decide whether an act was a breach of sections 4 or 5 of the 1991 Act.  Alternatively, will a judge look at the facts that are proven and say to the jury that he is directing them as a matter of law that what has been proven by the prosecution in this case amounts to an anti-competitive agreement or whatever? I want the Minister to indicate whether the jury will be entitled to say they think it is not anti-competitive as they have listened to two experts stating it is justified by the rule of reason, or some other consideration.</P>
    <P>In the case of a trial in the Circuit Court, will a judge, having listened to the arguments and the experts tell the jury as a matter of law that the agreement, concerted practice or whatever is prohibited by sections 4 or 5 of the Competition Act 1991?  That is a crucial question the Minister has not clarified and if he cannot, he should not present a Bill of this type to the House.  I should like to know whether in future juries will determine what is a contravention of sections 4 or 5 of the Competition Act, 1991, or whether on the contrary, a judge will decide that the Act was unlawful, when the jury will have to decide whether the accused was guilty of knowingly participating in the act or practice concerned.</P>
    <P>A quick run through is one of the problems of this kind of debate, because we cannot ask the Minister any questions or elucidate anything he says.  He just spews out one particular understanding of his of what the words &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; and &ldquo;connive&rdquo; mean and that is the end of the matter.  We should know what we are legislating for before doing so.  The word &ldquo;connive&rdquo; in the <Col N="346" /> Oxford English Dictionary &mdash; taken from the Oireachtas Library &mdash; means:</P>
    <P>to shut one's eyes to a thing one dislikes but is resigned to, to pretend ignorance of or to overlook; to regard an offender sympathetically; to turn a blind eye to an action which one ought to oppose but which one secretly sympathises with; to be secretly accessory to; to remain inactive or dormant or to be in secret complicity or to conspire with somebody.</P>
    <P>That is what I think the word &ldquo;connive&rdquo; means.  &ldquo;Connivance&rdquo; is the act of conniving or, as the dictionary definition states: &ldquo;assistance in wrongdoing by conscious failure to prevent or condemn.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we now criminalising &ldquo;conscious failure to prevent or condemn&rdquo; other people's activities?  Is that to be a new form of criminal activity &mdash; that when somebody engages in an activity which is argued to be a breach of sections 4 or 5 of the Competition Act, 1991, somebody else who fails to actively condemn that activity, or turns a blind eye to their behaviour, is deemed to consent to their behaviour and becomes criminally liable for their behaviour?  That is the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes in here with a little speech devised for him by somebody else in which he throws out a pat definition of &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; which does not apper to comply with the Oxford English Dictionary definition.  He proposes to make it part of our criminal law that a person who turns a blind eye to somebody else's behaviour, or somebody who consciously refrains from condemning something and secretly sympathises with it, for the purposes of this Bill if it becomes law, is deemed to have consented to that behaviour and, in so doing, becomes liable to be prosecuted on that account.</P>
    <P>Is that not a very substantive change in the law?  Since the Minister contends this is an adequate way to debate this issue, I challenge him to say in what other areas of the law turning a blind eye to somebody else's behaviour, secretly sympathising with it, or failing to <Col N="347" /> condemn it will mean one lands in jail, especially in matters of this kind of complexity? Since the Minister is so sure that this is a drafting amendment, he should tell us now the circumstances in which somebody who, apart from this amendment would not be deemed to be consenting to an activity, will be deemed to have consented to it because he was conniving at it, because he was conspiratorially turning a blind eye to what is going on.</P>
    <P>Is that any way to conduct, first, the activities of a Legislature; second, the activities of a Department or, third, our criminal law &mdash; that we will insert in an Act a provision which extends the concept of consent to apply to circumstances in which people consciously turn a blind eye to the behaviour of somebody else and thereby become criminally liable, with that person, even though there may be no gain for themselves in the activities of that person? Is it to be the case that a weak-minded member of a board of directors will be liable to be prosecuted because, even though he does not like what is going on, consciously decides to avert his gaze from it because he is in a commercial minority, under financial pressure or whatever?  In future will that be deemed to be consent to an activity which will expose somebody to criminal liability so that they end up in jail if any of these prosecutions were ever to get going?</P>
    <P>In refusing Deputies O'Rourke, Ned O'Keeffe, Keogh and myself the right to ask questions about the effect of this, the Minister says this is a drafting amendment recommended by the draftsman.  Again I challenge the Minister to state clearly one example of somebody who, but for this amendment, would not be guilty of an offence because they would not be consenting to it but who, because this amendment is passed, and because they could then be described as conniving out the activity in question, would be liable to be convicted.  If the Minister cannot do that he should not tender this amendment to this House in this fashion.  It is <Col N="348" /> very unfortunate that a Government Minister should come into this House with a Bill and say he will not be questioned on the effect of a proposed change in our criminal law.</P>
    <P>Let us take a classic example where competition law is in the public domain &mdash; therefore I will not offend anybody &mdash; one dear to the Minister's heart, that of the Irish Press group and the <i>Irish Independent's</i> activities in investing in that group which curiously, according to the Minister, was an abuse of a dominant position and an unlawful investment by the latter.  Let us apply the effect of this amendment to that set of circumstances.  If somebody sitting on the board of directors of Independent Newspapers has misgivings about such a proposal and if the proposal goes ahead against his wishes, is he consenting to it? Is that person, who decides to suppress his misgivings about what they are doing, conniving at it?  In those circumstances, is a criminal offence committed by any of the people who are doubtful about what is taking place but decide not to voice their doubts because other more powerful forces within a company decide to proceed with the Irish Press investment?</P>

      <P>One really has to ask what change we are making in our criminal law that, in addition to criminalising those who consent to something, henceforth we will criminalise those who fail to condemn because they secretly sympathise with something, or who fail, in some sense, to distance themselves from something when one might expect them to do so.  Is that the kind of criminal law we want?  If this is such small beer, I demand that the Minister give this House even one theoretical example.  He can use any facts he likes to demonstrate a case where, apart from this amendment, somebody would not be deemed to consent to activity which amounts to a section 4 or section 5 breach, but with this amendment will <Col N="349" /> be capable of being convicted.  If the Minister can explain that to the House, well and good, but only when he has tendered such an explanation and we have had an opportunity to question him on its implications, will we be in a position to decide whether to support the proposal to amend the law along those lines.  This underlines the error that lies at the bottom of the Minister's attitude to the Report Stage debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>As this is a complex area where the meanings of words are of the utmost importance and their application to specific facts will be of grave importance and may result in some people being sent to jail and others not being sent &mdash; the purpose of this amendment is to criminalise some people who would otherwise not be criminalised &mdash; I want to know precisely who is covered by the Minister's proposed extension of the term &ldquo;consent&rdquo;.  Every Deputy in the House is entitled to ask any Minister or any other Deputy who tables an amendment of this kind to our criminal law, to explain precisely what he means by it, what will be its effect and to explain, in exact circumstances, how it will apply to real situations in people's lives.  That is why a Report Stage debate, which does not provide for explanations or allow Deputies the right to interrogate to establish the implications of what is proposed, is unsuitable for an extension of criminal liability. Without such interrogation and satisfactory answers, it is impossible for any Member to conscientiously form a view as to whether he or she should or should not support the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to drag out the debate on this amendment or to be accused of filibustering, but I challenge the Minister to tell the House of one instance where, apart from this amendment, somebody would not be criminally liable, but because of this amendment he or she would be criminally liable to be imprisoned for an anti-competitive act.  I ask the Minister to cite one instance where this amendment will <Col N="350" /> have any effect.  If he cannot cite one, having regard to the ordinary and natural meaning of the words &ldquo;connivance&rdquo; and &ldquo;connive&rdquo;, he should withdraw his amendment.</P>

The purpose of the Bill is to deal with a situation where directors or managers or similar persons, who have control and responsibility for the running of a company, decide or a decision is made on their behalf on an approach that is in breach of competition law, damages others and is illegal. Members of Deputy McDowell's party argued strenuously that not only should there be consent, but a presumption of consent until the contrary is proven.  In deference to that desired objective, we are sponsoring amendments to deal with that proposal.</P>

      <P>The reason for the <Col N="351" /> inclusion of passive acquiescence as well as active consent is to cover a situation where a director or manager claimed he or she stayed silent and passively acquiesced by allowing a decision to be taken that was illegal and damaging, on competition grounds, to other parties.  The tone of the contributions of Deputy McDowell's party colleagues to the Committee Stage debate reflected that it would be undesirable that people could walk away from their responsibilities on the grounds that they did not actively agree to a decision.  We are providing that passive acquiescence by a director or manager or a person responsible for controlling a company would be caught under the word &ldquo;consent&rdquo;. Deputy McDowell, who talked about the conscious failure to condemn that could apply to almost anybody, has taken this issue to a ridiculous level, but that is not where consent is applied in the Bill.  We are dealing with people who control companies and make or have decisions made on their behalf, for which they have responsibility.  Failure to condemn in the case of someone who is extraneous to the company or who happened to be the paper keeper is not envisaged by this section.</P>

If the Competition Authority decides to take a criminal action on more serious grounds or because of the failure of the party concerned to co-operate, it will have to establish a stiffer burden of proof that the party concerned was guilty, intentionally did something and by doing that his or her guilty could be established beyond reasonable doubt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) the defendant did not know, nor, in all the circumstances of the case, could the defendant be reasonably expected to have known, that the act or acts concerned done by the defendant would constitute the abuse of the dominant position in trade for goods or services alleged in the proceedings, or&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is already an established good defence in the Bill in respect of section 4 proceedings.  This provides for a good defence where an offence is against section 5, namely an abuse of dominant position.  The existance of good defence provide a constitutional safeguard where there might be doubt as to whether the alleged offence is in breach of either section 4 or section 5.  It will also make difficult any challenge against <Col N="354" /> the offence on the ground of vagueness &mdash; if it is vague one has the opportunity to prove that one did not know nor, in all the circumstances of the case, could one have reasonably been expected to have known.</P>
    <P>Essentially this is the balancing side of the approach we have taken in respect of the criminalising of section 4 and section 5 offences.  Section 4 and section 5 in certain instances outlines very specific offences such as price fixing, but it has a more general application also.  The argument was made that, to deal with vagueness and potential complexity, it should be provided that there can be a good defence that the defendant did not know nor, in all the circumstances, could the defendant be reasonably expected to have known. It is not sufficient for him to claim he did not know and plead ignorance of the law.  He would have to establish also that as a defendant he could not reasonably be expected to have known. Equally, he cannot simply brandish advice he might have obtained if that advice is not credible and could not have been the basis for his coming to a reasonable conclusion that this was not an offence.</P>
    <P>In practice, the Competition Authority will pursue cases of breach of the competition law where, before it proceeds to take criminal action, it has been in very considerable and detailed interaction with the defendant.  Prosecutions will arise out of the failure of people to co-operate with the attempts of the Competition Authority to deal with offences that have been pointed out to them.  It is on that basis that the authority will finally decide to proceed against them.  In practice the type of criminal offence that would be prosecuted under this Act would not be in the vague margins where the defendant would not know or could not have been expected to know.  From the point of view of drafting the legislation it is important that we have this constitutional safeguard.  That is the basis for <Col N="355" /> sponsoring this amendment which is consistent with the similar treatment of offences under section 4 and breaches of licences issued under section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it makes sense to allow the same defence for a section 4 as for a section 5 offence. From that point of view I can see the Minister's motivation in sponsoring this amendment, but I am alarmed at the explanations I have heard from the Minister and his Department about this Bill.  We now hear that in practice the prosecution element of this Bill will not in fact be brought into effect unless there has been considerable interaction between the Competition Authority and the company being prosecuted, during which the company has failed repeatedly to heed warnings given to it or to co-operate with the Competition Authority in the enforcement of the competition law.</P>
      <P>That is nowhere written into this Bill, and it is not a plausible interpretation of the Bill.  If, when this becomes law, the Competition Authority discovers that two Irish supermarket owners are rigging the price of milk, and has documentary evidence that will stand up in court, it will not decide not to prosecute because it did not have interaction with the supermarket owners for a while and did not tell them not to do this.  If it finds out in retrospect that there has been a price-rigging cartel in milk or concrete products, it seems the law the Minister is bringing forward will allow it to prosecute with no question of a preliminary stage of dissuasion or correction before prosecution.  If it is not in the law we should not assume that this Minister's interpretation of how a Competition Authority would work will apply in future.  We are making the law, not enshrining the Minister's benign interpretation of this law.  It either is or is not the law, and there is no way of getting around that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a cumulative test.  First, the defendant has to prove he did not know what he was doing was an abuse of a <Col N="356" /> dominant position.  Second, he has to prove that it was not reasonable to expect him to have known it in all the circumstances of the case.  The Minister says it will not be a defence to show that one had legal advice along certain lines; the legal advice itself will have to be such as to be capable of standing up to scrutiny.  For example, if the board of the <i>Irish Independent</i> debated the advisability, having regard to the competition law, of investing in <i>The Irish Press</i> and their lawyers counselled against it because it could be in breach of the Competition Act, but it goes ahead with it because it strongly feels it is not in breach of the Act, can it avail of this defence?  What is a businessman to do if, as frequently happens in these matters, one lawyer says something is permissible under the Act and another lawyer says it is not?  Can he act on the most favourable opinion or must he disregard opinions in these circumstances and rely on his own judgement or a judge's objective judgement as to the merit of the two opinions he has received?</P>
    <P>It seems that this Bill does not address one issue, the European case law in relation to the defences for abuse of dominant position.  Take one particular defence, the so-called rule of reason defence, which allows certain restrictive anti-competitive agreements to be put in place.  For instance it allows a newspaper to appoint two agents but not every newsagent in a town to sell its product.  One can argue that it is anti-competitive that every newsagent is not entitled to get a supply of <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> and that a newsagent in a small town could have a monopoly.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose there is a deal between the Retail Newsagents of Ireland and the National Newspapers of Ireland.  Some people might say it is anti-competitive whereas others might say it was arguable and would take a chance.  I do not believe the Bill addresses marginal cases.  The Minister's <Col N="357" /> bland verbal assurances that prosecutions will never be brought until there is a period of interaction, persuasion and non-compliance by those who are prosecuted is simply not worth the paper it is not written on.  A verbal assurance is worth nothing.  I query strongly the probity of putting into our law something that a Minister has to say will never really be enforced in practice.</P>
    <P>Look at section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, which is now used to solve regular crimes, such as an offence under the malicious damage Acts.  People are detained for 48 hours for offences that have nothing to do with offences against the State.  We cannot legislate on the basis that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, thinks that the Bill when enacted will never be aggressively enforced and will only be enforced as a last resort by a Competition Authority for whom all other avenues have been closed off by the non-co-operation of the person to be prosecuted.  I am against this.  The Minister has acknowledged the folly of it and it has been signposted by my party.</P>
    <P>In any criminal trial that I have ever been involved in, the judge says to the jury: &ldquo;You are the masters of fact, I determine the law.  You must take the law from me as I say it and if you disagree with it there is a court of criminal appeal to put me right.&rdquo;  It appears the Minister is incapable of telling this House that in these cases it is the function of the judge to look at the evidence and say that does not amount to an unlawful practice under section 4 or an abuse of a dominant position under section 5 and the jury must take that as the legal interpretation.  If the Minister's version of these trials is correct, it is a new aspect of Irish law that, notwithstanding a direction as to the law by a judge, the jury can say they do not agree, that they have heard an economist, a latter day McDowell or Bruton, and his evidence on the justification for this action and they will overrule the judge and will find that this was not an <Col N="358" /> unlawful act or an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>I can give examples of a simple cases we know about.  It was stated in public at a seminar organised by the Minister or his precedessor that the <i>Irish Independent</i> investment in <i>The Irish Press</i> amounted to an anti-competitive agreement and-or an abuse of a dominant position.  There was a heated denial by the newspaper in question that it did so amount but if a trial on indictment was launched &mdash; which I suppose is a bit unlikely &mdash; and Independent Newspapers were brought before a jury to determine whether their behaviour in relation to <i>The Irish Press</i> was an offence under this Act on some repeat occasion, it could be the case that a judge would say, &ldquo;I have heard the evidence from the experts and I am saying that that investment was anti-competitive or amounted to an abuse of the dominant position and I am directing the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that this is unlawful.  Your function is to decide the facts.  Did Independent Newspapers know it was unlawful, did Independent Newspapers' three named directors who are in the dock before you connive at this or consent to this being done.&rdquo;  Is a jury in those circumstances able to say it does not agree with the judge and that it was a perfectly proper investment and did not amount to an abuse of a dominant position?</P>
    <P>I want answers to that question because the ordinary people are entitled to know what is being put into our law. If, as the Minister has hinted in his contribution on the amendment, a jury is entitled to disregard the directions of a judge as to the legality or otherwise of any action in coming to a conclusion as to whether to convict under this Act, I want it spelled out by the Minister and I want the Attorney General's advice tendered to this House in the course of this debate that the Minister is correct in saying that it is a matter for the jury exclusively and that a judge cannot direct a jury as to whether an act does or does not contravene sections 4 and 5 of the 1991 Act.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister define the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; as used in this amendment?  Is he satisfied that the use of the term &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; will stand up in criminal cases?  Obviously a much higher level of proof will be needed. Perhaps when the Minister is replying to this amendment he will enlighten us as to the legal opinion obtained by the Department in the drafting of the Bill, particularly the amendments before us.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the criticisms of the Bill at the conference is that it is the work of economists' minds who had examined in detail the legal and criminal implications but had not applied the best advice from legal quarters.

      <P>First I will deal with Deputy O'Rourke's queries.  I can assure her that we have had very detailed legal advice throughout the drafting of the legislation and it has been informed not just by in-house legal advice in the parliamentary draftsman's office or the Attorney General's office but also outside legal advice from practitioners in this area.  I would have been very anxious to apply that rigour and I am very satisfied that rigour has been applied in the way the Bill has been approached.  It is frustrating to see legislation taking so long to be enacted but that is because we felt the need to apply that sort of rigour to the Bill and to the criticisms that have come up in more recent times which we felt we needed to have assessed.  In making the defence that we have applied in respect of section 4, the defendant would have to establish that he could not reasonably have been expected to know.  The court will have to be satisfied that his argument that he could not have been expected to know is reasonable.  This will put the onus on the defendant who chooses this defence to establish this.  In the normal course of events he would <Col N="360" /> be open to cross-examination on his claim that this defence applies to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell sought to imply that my description of what would happen in practice in the case of the Competition Authority pursuing an offence would be the only possible way in which this would be applied.  I said clearly that was not the case.  The reason we have this defence is that we are providing a law for all eventualities, not only the ones which would be more common.  If people are advised that something is unlawful but they choose to rely on their greater judgement and opt for this defence, the onus is greater on them to establish how they reached the reasonable expectation that their judgment was superior to the professional judgment which has been offered to them.  It will be difficult for them to convince the court that they acted reasonably in reaching a judgment that this was legal, notwithstanding that they received advice to the effect that it was not legal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell envisaged the possibility the Bill might not be able to cope with serious offences such as market rigging or price fixing by the taking of a direct challenge under a criminal Act, I am not saying that this is not the case.  The Competition Authority could on the basis of the discovery of market rigging or price fixing go down the criminal route but it could also go through the civil route by obtaining an injunction.  It has a range of options and it would have to decide on the gravity of the matter before it decided which one to take.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(9)  For the purpose of determining liability for an offence under this section, any act done by an officer or an employee of an undertaking for the purpose of, or <Col N="361" /> in connection with, the business or affairs of the undertaking shall be regarded as an act done by the undertaking.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the liability for wrongdoing can be pinned on an undertaking <i>via</i> a particular person acting on its behalf. The undertaking cannot disown an act done by its officer or employee and say it cannot be held responsible for it. Deputies were concerned that under the criminal code there should be a clear pinning of responsibility on the undertaking in respect of actions by an officer or an employee under its control.  The amendment provides that an undertaking will be criminally bound by the acts of its officers or employees.  An undertaking would have a good defence if it could establish that it did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that acts done by its officers or employees resulted in an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  If an employee took an action to become involved in price fixing, this would imply that the undertaking was responsible. However, in answering the charge that it was criminally liable, it could seek to use the defence that it did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know about the behaviour of its employees but it would have to establish that this was the case. In this amendment we are responding to calls made on Committee Stage to tighten up this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this amendment.  I remember the debate we had on this issue on Committee Stage. Deputy O'Malley and I cited examples. We sought to tighten this area so that there could not be a disregard by an undertaking of an offence which had been committed.  We wanted to ensure that the pinning of an offence on a <Col N="362" /> member or an employee of an undertaking would not result in the undertaking disowning the offence.  The Minister said that the checks and balances of the previous amendments with regard to defence would apply.  He wanted to take amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together but there needed to be a greater teasing out of amendments Nos. 3 and 4. Amendment No. 5 is a clear attempt to take account of the concerns which were expressed on Committee Stage.  I support its thrust, particularly as it is allied with the balances concerning good defence.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(10)  References in this section to an order under section 14 of the Principal Act shall, where the context admits, be construed as including references to an order under subsection (2) of section 12 (as adapted by the Principal Act) of the Act of 1978.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At present, under section 5 it is an offence to breach an order made under section 14 of the Principal Act.  Such an order is made when there has been an abuse of a dominant position.  The company involved can act only in accordance with the order.  The amendment provides that where a ministerial order has been challenged in the High Court and amended by it, it will also be an offence to breach the amended order. This is essentially a technical amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3. &mdash;Section 14 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (11):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(12) (a)  The Authority may at any time in the exercise of their function under this Act make an interim order directing any person or enterprise to suspend any action or proposed action with the Authority believes may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an abuse of the rules of competition as set out in section 4 of this Act,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(ii)  abusing a dominant position in contracention of section 5 of this Act, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> (b)  the Authority may provide that such an interim order shall be for a period not exceeding four months while the Authority conducts a study of any practice or action or any proposed practice or action against which the Authority issued an interim order under paragraph (a),</P>
    <P>(c)  the Authority may at any time vary the terms of an interim order issued in accordance with paragraph (a) or as a result of any decision by the Minister in accordance with paragraph (d),</P>
    <P>(d)  the Minister, having considered an interim order issued by the Authority, may if the common good so warrants by order direct the Authority to modify their interim order as the Minister may direct.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A similar amendment was moved by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment when Deputy Ruairí Quinn was the Minister dealing with this Bill.  This Bill has been debated for so long that it is like a never ending saga.  We propose that the Authority should have the power to make an interim order for a limited period &mdash; the making of a permanent order would be a matter for the courts and the Oireachtas.  An interim order might have proved useful in the <i>Irish Indepen dent-The Irish Press</i>case. This reasonable proposal would allow the Authority to act quickly.  I do not know how it could be declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c) the Authority would be allowed to vary the terms of an interim order.  That would be the better approach.  Under the existing system it has to seek an injunction.  This proposal would allow it to adopt a more pro-active approach &mdash; this addresses a particular criticism levelled at it &mdash; and deal with companies directly, rather than being passive and waiting for matters to come to its notice.</P>
    <P>In carrying out research I was interested to learn that in other countries the Competition Authority is much <Col N="365" /> more stimulative in its approach to matters such as this whereas the Authority here is inclined to regulate.  In Poland, which is eager to become a member of the European Union and which we with other member states are keen to help through various trade programmes, the competition authority has six regional offices to disseminate information in a much more user friendly way.  I would like the Authority here to stimulate rather than constantly regulate Irish business.</P>
    <P>Rather than shoot down everything we suggest I hope the Minister will agree to the amendment which I freely admit was tabled by Deputy Rabbitte when he had a different status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it would be nice if certain cases could be dealt with quickly.  We are constrained, however, by the rules of the courts.  It has been proposed that the Competition Authority should have the power to make an interim order, albeit for a temporary period, but it is not open to it to hear and judge cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the courts to decide whether a decision is legal.  The Authority has the power to take an action, not to judge cases.  If a person applies for and is refused a licence to continue a section 4 practice, the Authority would have to go to the courts to have the practice declared unlawful if the person concerned persists with it.  We have to appreciate that there is a line between the role of the Authority and that of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister suspects that a dominant position is being abused he may request the Authority under section 14 to investigate the matter.  On receipt of its report he may make an order immedieately in the interests of the common good prohibiting the abuse or requiring adjustment on particular conditions. There is, therefore, under <Col N="366" /> section 14 an effective and quick procedure.</P>
    <P>In the case of section 4 practices, however, the final decision must rest with the courts.  The approach we have taken is that these issues cannot be decided by the Authority acting as judge and jury.  What the Deputy has proposed would overturn these principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point.  The point was made strongly by Mr. Lynch at the conference that without proper resources all bodies would continue to be spancelled and silenced; this is always a good defence for them. A criticism directed at the Competition Authority is that it presents an inscrutable face to the public and appears to act, unwittingly, in a mysterious way.  It also seems to be obtuse to the ordinary person.</P>
      <P>When one thinks of anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position one conjures up the image of big companies &mdash; the big boys &mdash; and many millions of pounds being at stake if it is proved they have engaged in such practices.  The Authority should be more open about what it is able to do under existing legislation and the way it does its business.  This is still a great mystery to many of those involved in business.  Its aim is to prohibit anti-competitive practices, but there is nothing to stop it being stimulative in its approach to those who may have to use its procedures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal in some detail with the involvement of the Attorney General's office in this case.  The involvement of the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána has been dealt with separately by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The sequence of events in relation to the involvement of the Attorney General's office in the matter is as follows. Mr. Duncan was being held in custody on foot of a detention order under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The detention order was due to expire early on the morning of Saturday, 13 April.  At that time he would either have to be released or charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Late on the evening of Friday, 12 April, in advance of any original warrant being transmitted to the State, <Col N="369" /> because of the urgency of the case, the UK authorities sent a complete copy of the original warrant and supporting documentation, i.e. the affidavit and certificate, to the Office of the Attorney General here by fax.  The Attorney General's office then fixed this documentation to the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Department of Justice. This faxed documentation was examined on that evening by one of the legal assistants in the Office of the Attorney General and by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>These copy documents, sent to the Office of the Attorney General from the UK, were complete and in order.  The solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's Office dealing with the matter on behalf of the State, also carried out a thorough examination of the copy documentation received from the UK.  A complete copy of the warrant which had been received from the UK authorities was then furnished to the Garda Síochána by the Chief State Solicitor's Office, again by fax, on the evening of Friday, 12 April. The Garda Síochána were aware that the original warrant when it arrived should conform with that documentation.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Department of Justice, on the basis of reports furnished by the Garda on 21 May, that the original warrant, &mdash; as distinct from the copy &mdash; certificate and affidavit would appear to have been received by hand from a British police officer at approximately 11 o'clock on the night of 12 April.</P>
    <P>At approximately 11 a.m. on Saturday, 13 April, when the case was being dealt with, in the course of his evidence the detective superintendent dealing with the case handed into court what purported to be the original warrant, certificate and affidavit.  These were examined, in turn, without comment, by the judge and the defence solicitor. They were then examined by the solicitor for the State.  At that point she &mdash; the solicitor for the State &mdash; noticed there was no exhibiting clause on the back of the purported warrant.  She <Col N="370" /> realised at that point that the documentation was defective because of the lack of this exhibiting clause.  Therefore, without making any other comment, and so that an investigation could commence as to what had happened, she asked for the case to be allowed to stand over until later in the list.  The District Court judge agreed to this request.</P>
    <P>During this period, while the hearing was delayed, it became apparent that the document which had been produced in court was a photocopy, bearing an original endorsement by the Garda Síochána and not the exhibiting clause that would have appeared on the original documentation handed over by the UK authorities.  At this point, the solicitor for the State had no information on whether the Garda authorities had been furnished with an incomplete copy by the UK authorities which the Garda had then endorsed or whether the Garda had made a copy and endorsed it in error.  The solicitor immediately sought instructions from the legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General who was dealing with the matter, who in turn sought directions from the Attorney General.  This was when the Attorney General first became aware that it was a copy and not the original that had been presented in court.  This was approximately 12.35 p.m. on Saturday, 13 April.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile instructions were given by the solicitor acting for the State to the Garda Síochána and the English police officer present to carry out an immediate search to see if the original warrant could be located, but this search proved fruitless.  On the situation being explained to the Attorney General that the document produced in court was not an original warrant and that the original warrant could not be found, the Attorney General had no alternative but to instruct the solicitor to withdraw the application for extradition.</P>
    <P>At this stage, neither the Attorney General nor any of his officers were aware of how this defect in the documentation had come about.  While they has seen a copy which had been faxed <Col N="371" /> to them in advance by the UK authorities the previous evening, they had no means of knowing at any stage whether the original had ever been transmitted to the Garda Síochána.  It was clear that an error had been made either by the persons responsible for transmitting the original warrant from the UK side or, if that warrant had been properly transmitted by them, by the Garda Síochána, but neither the Attorney General nor his officer had any means of identifying which of these two reasons underlay the defect in the extradition warrant.  It should be added that neither the Attorney General nor any member of his office had a means of knowing whether an original warrant had been delivered to the Garda Síochána or of knowing whether the mistake had been made by the Garda rather than the UK authorities.  They only learned this after the Garda investigation was completed on 21 May.</P>
    <P>It is not and never has been part of the function of the Attorney General to carry out a personal examination of documents to be presented in court such as warrants to be used in extradition cases.  It is believed that there has never previously been a case in the State where the absence of the original documents caused an extradition application to fail.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which this application failed are unique.  The function of the Attorney General is to examine the content of the copy documents furnished to the Attorney for the purpose of exercising his functions under section 44 of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended.  This involves ascertaining whether there is a clear intention to prosecute founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  In addition, the Attorney advises the Garda as to the fulfilment of certain other legal criteria which must be met before extradition can take place and his advice is then conveyed to the Minister for Justice. This is the principal purpose of the Attorney's involvement in cases of this kind and his function does not extend <Col N="372" /> to examining warrants to establish their originality.</P>
    <P>The full facts only became available on 21 May when the Minister for Justice received the report of the Garda inquiries into the case.  The Minister conveyed these to the House at the earliest possible opportunity through a written reply to a Dáil question and through a public statement at that time.  Let me also emphasise the following points concerning the subject matter of today's questions about the involvement of the Attorney General's office: 1.  There was no information available on 13 April which would lead the Attorney General's office to be aware which police force had mishandled the matter; 2. the Attorney General's office has no operational responsibility for the Garda Síochána; any investigation was a matter for the Minister for Justice or the Garda authorities.  It was clear that the warrant had been mishandled by one or other police force, or maybe by both, but that was not determined until the completion of the Garda report dated 21 May; 3. in the aftermath of the failed extradition on 13 April, the Attorney General's first priority was to consider and decide upon the new warrant which was furnished by the UK authorities the following day and this consideration and decision took place between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. on the morning of Sunday, 14 April.  That process was completed later on Sunday 14 April, and further action on that matter now awaits the outcome of separate criminal proceedings in this jurisdiction; and 4. the Attorney General's office had no role or function in investigating or distributing blame as between the two police forces.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer Deputies' attention once again to the statements issued by the Garda Síochána on 22 and 26 May 1996.  I am satisfied that these statements explain the full factual situation in relation to the missing warrant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the UK authorities faxed a copy of the original document they were subsequently sending to the Attorney General's <Col N="373" /> office.  I presume that faxed copy was complete; it included the British endorsement.  Was it not clear, therefore, that on the day of the court hearing the Garda presented in court a document that did not include the British endorsement?  Does that not make it fairly evident that the fault lay on the Irish side, particularly in view of the fact that the British warrant was sent via a senior British police officer who personally delivered it to the Garda, who was present in court, as the Taoiseach said, and who could have confirmed &mdash; presumably he did confirm &mdash; when the case collapsed that he had brought the original warrant from England?  Will the Taoiseach agree it was possible to confirm it at that time?  Finally, the Minister for Justice told us last week that the copy documentation was produced to her at approximately 12.30 a.m. or some such time.  Will the Taoiseach tell us from where that copy came?  Did it come from the Attorney General's office or from the Garda?  The Minister for Justice has confirmed that document was complete, that it included the British endrosement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the first part of the Deputy's question, it is correct that the copied documentation received in the Attorney General's office contained the exhibiting clause which was absent from the copy presented in court.  When the absence of that exhibiting clause was identified by the solicitor acting for the State in court an initial request was made to stand down the case for the time being.  It was subsequently established by the solicitor acting for the State, in consultation with all the officers present, that what had been presented to the court was not the original but a copy.  It was not possible at that stage, in the short space of time available, for the solicitor or the relevant authorities, either the British or Irish police forces, to establish where the fault lay in terms of the fact that an original document had not been presented in court.  At that time the priority of the people concerned was to <Col N="374" /> find the original document.  They were searching for it and until they had completed their searches they obviously could not determine where it was or who was responsible for it not being where it should have been.  That search occupied most of the time.</P>
      <P>The next priority was to deal with the new warrant which subsequently arrived.  That had to be examined by the Attorney General in accordance with the relevant sections of the Extradition Act.  The question of attribution of blame as to who was responsible for the fact that it was not the original document produced in court was the responsibility of the Garda authorities, which they subsequently discharged in their report of 21 May.  The information was not available to the Garda; it could not draw any conclusions on the matter until it had completed those investigations which were not completed until 21 May.  As soon as that report was completed by the Garda authorities, the relevant information derived from it was presented to the House in response to a written question.</P>

I presume it was through that route the Department of Justice obtained its copy.  There would also have been other communications from the Garda to it, but obviously the ones with which I am concerned are the communications from the Attorney General's office to the Department of Justice.

The Attorney General's responsibility is, as set out in the Extradition Acts, to establish that there is a case to answer.  He does not examine this matter under political direction or on the basis of political responsibility. He makes an independent judgment as a law officer as to whether there is an adequate case to answer and whether legal requirements are being met.

      <P>Is it not a fact that when the Taoiseach tried to recollect last week to whom he had spoken about this matter, he remembered a discussion he had that weekend with the Attorney General and not the Minister for Justice? Is it not reasonable to assume the Attorney General would have discussed this important matter with him on that weekend when it was such a major political issue both here and in Britain?  Is it not reasonable to assume the Attorney General would have fully briefed the Minister for Justice on the matter and the Minister for Justice, if not the Attorney General, would have spoken to the Taoiseach about it?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach seems to have said in all his statements that nobody spoke to him about it.  Even though it was a major political issue and a major issue in Anglo-Irish relations and the Taoiseach spoke to the British Prime Minister, neither his Attorney General nor the Minister for Justice told him anything about it.  Several weeks later when he answered a question from Deputy Burke and me he said he could not see any reason it could have been other than on the British side.  It is unbelievable.</P>

      <P>Obviously, I have thought about the matter.

The Deputy's suggestion that he did do so is not accurate and I ask him to accept my word on the matter. The Attorney General did not discuss the matter with me.  I have talked to the Attorney General since about the <Col N="378" /> matter and he agrees that he did not discuss it with me.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for him to become involved in discussion with me on a matter that is part of his legal responsibilities, as distinct from his responsibilities as adviser to the Government.  He acts as an independent officer and as part of the judicial system in assessing the validity of the case set out in the warrants.

      <P>The Attorney General was perfectly right not to get involved in seeking political judgments on how he should handle these documents.  I remember the attitude taken by Fianna Fáil when the legislation was introduced.  They wanted to ensure that the extradition process involved independent legal judgment by an Irish officer before extradition was allowed to take place.  They did not want automatic acceptance of the validity of warrants and documents coming from overseas. They wanted to be sure an Irish law officer was satisfied in the matter and that is what the Attorney General was doing.  In so doing he was not acting politically but as a law officer of the State making independent judgments. Therefore, it would not have been appropriate for him to involve me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in seeking direction from me or to apprise me of what he was doing because he is required to act independently in this area.  Deputies should remember that the safeguards involved in the independence of the Attorney General in this matter are important to individual citizens.  The <Col N="380" /> Deputy's attempt to try to create a situation in which the Attorney General, instead of dealing with these matters independently, has to seek political cover, and to involve the Taoiseach in every decision if it succeeded would undermine the safeguards in the extradition legislation that were intended to be in place when the legislation was passed.  Deputies should be aware they are unduly politicising this process for short-term party political gain.  The Attorney General's arm's length involvement <i>vis-á-vis</i> me in this matter is necessary to safeguard citizens in matters of this kind and should not be influenced by any political considerations even for improving Anglo Irish relations.</P>

      <P>That allegation made by the Fianna Fáil Party has been denied on the record by the officials of the Department of Justice.  It is not true and the Deputy is repeating untruths time and again even though he knows they are untrue.  Furthermore, I draw his attention to the fact that the report from the detective superintendent who investigated the matter stated that because an initial review of the steps taken to deal with this matter failed to establish the reason the original warrant was not available to the court, a detective chief superintendent was appointed to carry out a further review of the whole matter. That is what is stated in the report furnished on 21 May and it illustrates that the Garda authorities did not know where the fault lay.  Therefore, they could not have conveyed information to the Department of Justice as to where the fault lay because they did not know.</P>

      <P>In relation to the specific case referred to, is the Taoiseach clearly informing the House that no error occurred in relation to documentation on the Irish side?</P>
      <P>I replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that there was any omission on the Irish side but the matter is the subject of a separate parliamentary question to the Minister for Justice.  This question tabled by Deputy Harney relates solely to the procedures in the Attorney General's office, which I have outlined.  I have further stated I am satisfied there was no failure to apply appropriate procedures in the Attorney General's office which contributed to the difficulties that occurred in this case.  As to the difficulties elsewhere and the attribution of any responsibility for those between different jurisdictions [between Ireland and Britain] and offices [between different offices in either jurisdiction] that will be the <Col N="387" /> subject of a detailed parliamentary reply from the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I made it clear that I had not come to any conclusions on the matter.  I was not aware of any reasons to suggest that the Irish side was at fault, but I made it absolutely clear that no conclusions had been reached other than so far as the Attorney General's office was concerned. The responsibilities of the two police forces were to be the subject of an investigation which would then be the subject of a parliamentary reply, which is what happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While extradition is a legal procedure, does the Taoiseach accept it has enormous political implications for Anglo-Irish relations?  That being the case, is it not strange that when he heard of the collapse of the extradition case on 13 April &mdash; which I am sure he heard about given the extensive coverage it received &mdash; did he not feel obliged to ask the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General what went wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was appropriate to allow the investigations to proceed and for responsibility to be attributed after due investigation by the Garda authorities. I do not believe it is appropriate, for example, in regard to the attribution of blame within the Garda structure, that people should be forced to rush into judgments that could affect the careers of individuals without making sure that everybody is heard.  It is important to make the point that some of the people who had a contribution to make on deciding whether the original document was presented to the Garda Síochána were in another jurisdiction. In other words, people in Britain as well as here had to be interviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I regret the delay in the matter, it is appropriate that the necessary degree of time should be taken to get the facts right because it affects the rights and positions of individuals.  It <Col N="388" /> would not be appropriate for me to contact the Minister for Justice every other day asking her to publish reports, irrespective of whether she has all the facts, merely to enable me to answer questions in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue here is the integrity of the extradition system and the behaviour of the officers given that duty by the State, including their political masters.  In response to Deputy Harney's question, the Taoiseach said <Col N="389" /> he had allowed the investigation to proceed. Who told him an investigation was proceedings?  He went to great lengths to tell us he had not been told anything. He did not discuss the matter with the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice.  Therefore, who told him that weekend when the political row was starting that an investigation was under way?  After the débácle in the court on the Saturday, on Saturday evening and Sunday the acting Government press secretary or the duty officer indicated that this was a matter of responsibility for the other side of the water, that it was not the responsibility of the Irish authorities.</P>
      <P>If the official version is to be believed &mdash; the Taoiseach is asking us to believe it &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General were not in control of a fundamental issue of basic human rights of an individual in terms of extradition at such a sensitive time in Anglo-Irish relations.  The Taoiseach is also asking us to believe that the Garda kept the Government and the country in the dark as to what had been going on for six weeks, but I do not accept that.  Is it not more probable that the Government hoped that the embarrassment caused by the cover-up at the weekend, when it said that the matter was not our responsibility, would go away?  How could the Taoiseach defensibly say in the Dáil on 24 April that he had no reason to believe there had been an error or omission on the Irish side on the matter that contributed to the difficulties? The Taoiseach said he had been briefed by the Attorney General's office.</P>

I did not specifically ask about the Attorney General's office but about any of the Irish authorities, and he said on 24 April that he had no reason to believe there had been any error or omission, despite the fact that, as he said, the Garda had not given him the information at that stage.

      <P>I received no briefing in the matter on the weekend in question, from the Minister for Justice or anybody else.  I was informed of the investigation in preparation for the replies I gave the House on 24 April. At that time the Department of Justice informed me of the matter &mdash; although I was not answering questions about the Department of Justice it was anticipated that supplementary questions would be asked about the matter in terms of the documents presented not being the original. I said at the time that an investigation was being conducted by the Garda Síochána and that the Minister for Justice was awaiting its results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was answering Deputy Harney in that context.  I did not believe that subsequent to 24 April it would have been appropriate for me to have contacted the Minister for Justice every second day demanding completion of the investigation.  I believed it was appropriate that the investigation, which was an exercise in hindsight, should be through and fair to all concerned and I did not involve myself in demanding weekly or daily reports on how it was progressing.  I was satisfied it would be completed in the normal way, as was done.  I hope that is clear to the Deputy.  I was not speaking in the context of the weekend of 12-13 April when I referred to investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made a number of charges about people not being in control. It is important that we return to the basic facts.  A member of the Garda <Col N="391" /> apparently shredded an original document while making copies.  I realise that Deputies are anxious to attach political blame for everything, and that is understandable, but I hope Deputy Burke, in referring to people not being in control, is not suggesting that I should sit in the appropriate room where documents are photocopied, in the Garda office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be too much responsibility for the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see whether a copy or an original document is shredded. That is very peculiar version of the functions of a Taoiseach or Minister. It would not be an appropriate use of time.  In all systems of public administration there is a normal requirement for a degree of delegation of responsibility, and in this case there is delegation of responsibility in the first instance to the Minister for Justice.  It is important to remember in regard to Garda management, that it is a matter for which the Garda Commissioner, who is separately established, with separate functions from those of the Minister for Justice, is also responsible.  It was appropriate not to draw conclusions as to what happened until the appropriate authorities &mdash; in this case the Garda Commissioner &mdash; had completed the investigation, which was done on 21 May.  The attempt to suggest that there should be political supervision of clerical operations of this kind is, to say the least, foolish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that <Col N="392" /> the Garda authorities should investigate in their own way the loss of any documents in their custody, and that is what happened in this case.  The result of the investigation into the loss of a document in Garda custody was produced by the Garda on 21 May and presented to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach have contact with Mr. Major, or did his officials have contact with the British officials on this issue?  To come back to the issue of the British policeman in the court, surely the job of that policeman was to produce an original document in court in Ireland?  He was delegated by the magistrates' court to do that.  Is it not the case that his only jobs was to bring that document here and formally prove it in court?  Surely when the court case broke down he was consulted, in which case he would have told the Irish officials that he delivered the document to the Garda at a certain time.  The Irish officials, therefore, would have known without doubt that the Irish side was at fault.  Is the Taoiseach saying that nobody on that side of the House accepts political responsibility for producing flawed documents in a very sensitive court case, for a delay of more than a month in coming to a final conclusion and for what in effect was a cover up from mid-April to late May?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards what happened in the environs of the court on <Col N="393" /> the day in question, obviously the first priority, as I explained to Deputy O'Dea, was to see if the original document could be found, given that the original was not presented in court, and produced for the adjourned hearing.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has ascertained the cause of dead bream in Lough Derg; if he will commission a health status study on coarse fish in that lake; the immediate action, if any, which is necessary in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the recent mortality of bream in Lough Derg, not least because of the valuable contribution which coarse angling tourism <Col N="398" /> makes to the Shannon catchment.  The Department and I have been in ongoing contact with the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board since the problem emerged at the end of March.  Investigations carried out by board staff at the time confirmed numbers of dead bream in various locations in Lough Derg.  In liaison with the ESB, which owns the Shannon Fishery, the board arranged for an immediate scientific assessment to be undertaken by UCG's fisheries research team.  UCG has been working over the past two years on a wide ranging study of coarse fish stocks funded by the ESB.</P>
      <P>There are a number of unexplained aspects to the mortalities, notably the fact that only mature bream are involved and other fish species, such as salmon and trout, which are usually more sensitive to changes in the ecological conditions of waters, have been unaffected.  Other freshwater coarse fish in Lough Derg were apparently unaffected. The bream mortalities continued for about three weeks and had ceased by the end of April.</P>
      <P>Scientific investigations are continuing and there are no definitive answers as yet as to the cause of the mortalities. Preliminary findings have indicated extreme gill damage but at this stage no conclusive evidence of associated disease has emerged.  Water quality in the lake was examined at the time of the fish kill and found to be generally good. Further investigations into other possible environmental factors, including sediment analysis are ongoing.  The jury is still out on the cause of the mortalities. I expect a final report in the matter within a few weeks.</P>
      <P>I am advised that preliminary fish population survey data indicate that the very considerable bream stocks in Lough Derg have not been measurably affected by the recent mortalities. These, though worrying, were quite low relative to overall stock levels.  At this stage there is no reason to believe that angling catches will be adversely affected during the coming season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> The current problem serves to underline the need for sustained action to address ecological and fish health problems in Lough Derg and throughout the Shannon catchment area, in the interests of protecting and enhancing the valuable coarse fish resource and the ecosystem which supports it.  The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has been concerned about the management of coarse fish in the Shannon system for some years.  The research project being undertaken by UCG, which was commissioned by the ESB at the board's request, was a first step in taking action in this area.  That now needs to be followed up on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>As an immediate response I have requested the Department, the Shannon Board, the Central Fisheries Board, the ESB and the Marine Institute to prepare a report and to recommend proposals to progress a coherent strategy for the management of the national coarse fish resource.  They have proposed, as an initial step, the engagement of outside expertise to conduct a study of coarse fish stocks and problems experienced in recent years and to recommend on management strategies and future research and fish health programmes.</P>
    <P>An integrated and systematic approach to the conservation and management of our valuable coarse fish stocks is required and I am fully committed to working with the Shannon Board, the ESB and all relevant agencies and Departments in putting in place the necessary measures to achieve this aim.  I expect to receive shortly the detailed collective proposals from the Department, the board and the other agencies which will be considered and taken forward as a matter of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the Minister's decision to undertake a health study of coarse fish in Lough Derg and other places, I find the tenor of his reply very complacent.  I do not know whether he had an opportunity of seeing the spectacle of thousands of <Col N="400" /> dead bream decaying on the shoreline. That this could not affect tourism and other aspects of the development of that lake is inconceivable.  The Minister should speed up as much as possible the investigation of the unexplained aspects of this matter.  While other species were not affected, it is frightening that something like this can continue for this length of time without its causes being known.  We could perhaps be faced with an even deeper problem tomorrow.  I am extremely anxious that the health study be undertaken so that within a very short time we will not be faced with problems affecting other species.  After two months we will still do not know the cause of the deaths of these thousands of bream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>My response was far from complacent.  Immediately the information became available to me and my Department a study was sought from University College Galway and its results made known to us very speedily. It might be worth quoting from it for the benefit of Members:</P>
      <P>Fish pathology investigations by the UCG-based Aquatic Veterinary Group (Bioresearch Ireland Ltd.) showed that the dead and moribund bream, as well as gill netted apparently healthy fish in upper Lough Derg, showed extreme gill hyperplasia and necrosis, not associated with infectious disease.  This led to the conclusion that chronic exposure of the fish to unfavourable environmental conditions had contributed significantly to the deaths of the bream.  The immediate factor(s) involved could not be established since the tissue response was a generalised one which could be attributed to the effects of either soluble or particulate irritants.</P>
      <P>Later the report went on to state:</P>
      <P>Lough Derg water quality was generally found to be good, with a vertically mixed well oxygenated water column.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> Following that report scientists in UCG are carrying out a further study of the sediment in Lough Derg to establish what occurred there.  There were a number of unusual features to it.  The larger, older bream only were affected by this incident, smaller ones were not.  Other fish species were not affected at all. Because of this incident and the necessity to concentrate some further research activity on coarse fish, I have asked the Shannon Regional Board, the Central Fisheries Board, the Marines Institute and other agencies, including the ESB, to prepare a report for me.  They have given me an initial indication that it will be necessary to secure outside scientific assistance to enable them to carry out some studies on our coarse fish stocks, which will now proceed.  Whatever measures are deemed necessary to protect our coarse fishing resources will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in this House wants more than I to believe that the quality of water in Lough Derg is such as to safeguard fish life and promote our tourism industry.  Because of investment by many local people there I genuinely want to believe that, but I am quite frightened that something like this can continue for so long and, even at this stage, we cannot ascertain the reasons. Can the Minister not understand that as long as the general public and visitors go there and discover this problem, there will be a total lack of confidence in the ability of that lake to sustain employment and tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that angling on Lough Derg will not be affected.  I am sure Deputy Smith will agree that what is required is a definitive scientific view of what caused this fish kill.  We had better await that rather than rush to a conclusion which might not be substantiated subsequently.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>whether the surveillance intelligence available to him shows that over-fishing by foreign trawlers in Irish waters is much greater than anticipated and that 20 per cent of trawlers inspected are breaking EU fishing laws; and the step, if any, he will take to enable the Naval Services to deal effectively with this huge national loss.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11250/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year, a total of 324 foreign fishing vessels have been boarded and inspected by the Irish Naval Service.  Of these 18 vessels or 5.5 per cent of the total were detained for serious breachers of fishery legislation such as under-recording of catch or having undersized fish on board.  Prosecutions are now in train.  A further 48 foreign vessels were given written warnings for minor breaches such as failure to have fishing licence on board.  These did not warrant the detention of the vessel and crew.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service, Air Corps and the Department are working intensively together to ensure that all our fishery surveillance resources are deployed to maximum effect.  The two high technology CASA aircraft have enabled aerial surveillance to be maintained on fishing activity on a daily basis.  In addition, from January of this year, all fishing vessels over 18 metres entering or leaving the Irish zone have to report their entry and exit in advance to the fishery protection services.  These reports, together with the findings of the CASA aircraft, are transmitted electronically to fishery patrol vessels at sea.  The combination of aerial surveillance and entry/exit reporting data is making for increasingly accurate and effective targeting by our patrol vessels and is providing an excellent continuous fix on all patterns and levels of fishing activity in Irish waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This control and enforcement regime backed up by stringent penalties is paying dividends.  Boardings are going up and detentions, proportionately, are going down.  This reflects the fact that fishermen are being forced increasingly to accept that illegal fishing is not worth <Col N="403" /> the risk.  That being said, I am still very concerned that there is a level of continued flouting of the law.  We will continue to crackdown hard on non compliance as well as pursuing with other member states the need for firm action to put a stop to boats committing offences in EU waters.  I am determined to safeguard stocks and eliminate illegal fishing in our waters.  I am committed therefore to building on our track record to date to ensure that existing protection resources are deployed effectively and to further enhancing that capability with the significant EU financial support which has been made available to assist in that investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a committee of experts in the European Commission proposed a further reduction of 40 per cent in certain species for 1996-97 and that the overall total allowable catch of the Community will drop by in excess of 20 per cent in ensuing years?  Does he accept that normally the Commission proposes global reductions, in other words, the fleet that causes the problem suffers no greater reduction in its catch than those others, like the Irish one, which because of their size and age are not involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It pays to flout the law and the Minister has said he is worried by the manner in which it is being flouted.  Would he accept that as much as £2 billion in value of fish stocks can be taken from our waters in one year by European trawlers, particularly the Spanish, as a hidden subsidy?  Does he know that this very day a Spanish trawler has been detained in Castletownbere, which has held no fishing licence for two years and has no records maintained of the monk-tail fish it has caught?  Does he agree that we are not in a position to deter such actions and are suffering on a double front?  Will the Minister tackle this problem?  Will he ensure that the global reductions effected by the Community in terms of total allowable catch will not take place and that those guilty of over-fishing will suffer a much greater <Col N="404" /> reduction in their catch than those like the Irish fleet who are innocent in this respect?  Can he confirm that the surveillance and other information available to him through additional aircraft availability is such that we are unable to cope with so many incidents of flouting of the law at sea?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the total allowable catch will not be settled until the December Council meeting.  I can also assure him that I shall do precisely what I did last year, that is fight our corner to ensure that our fishermen are allocated a reasonable percentage of fish in the total allowable catch.  We consistently put forward proposals to stamp out illegal fishing.  I do not accept that any member state should be entitled to flout the law and during our Presidency of the European Union we will pursue a number of issues, including conservation proposals, technical conservation measures and further surveillance packages.  We will also ensure that the reporting of the catch, a measure that is due to be implemented on 1 January 1998, takes place.</P>
      <P>One of the principal problems facing us is the activities of flag ships crewed by Spanish fishermen under the British flag.  I raised that matter with the UK minister whom I met in London two weeks ago.  As a result of that meeting he agreed to his officials co-operating fully with ours to deal with this issue.  I intend, as I have done before, to raise that matter with the EU Commissioner whom I will meet on 8 June and to ensure it will be addressed during our Presidency of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take any steps I can to ensure regulations are adhered to and any further steps necessary will be taken to prevent the people flouting the law.  My primary role in the fisheries area is to ensure Irish fishermen get a fair deal, given that going back to 1972 we did not get a fair one and have been struggling ever since to get one.  I will not give up <Col N="405" /> that struggle and will use every opportunity to ensure that the wrongs we suffered are redressed.</P>
    <P>In terms of surveillance, I am impressed with the level of technology, the advances made in co-operation between the Air Corps and the Naval Service, the tracking methods in place, the information available and its transfer to make the job easier.  We have made great strides and we are continuing to advance on our achievements to date.  I will join the Deputy in doing all I can to assist the industry and to ensure our fishermen get their fair share.</P>

      <P>The question of a short service commission was stated in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan as a proposition for special study.  This special study will be undertaken during phase I of the plan and appropriate proposals brought forward. Such short service commissions are to be found in the armies of other states and the concept has initial attraction in the context of the present imbalance in the PDF officer crops, between senior and junior officers.  Its suitability for Irish circumstances, however, requires further examination.</P>
      <P>When a policy in this regard has been formulated, the representative association will be consulted in accordance with the defined scope of the conciliation and arbitration scheme at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A special study will commence within the next three months. The real problem, that of the age profile of the officer crops, has been the subject of much criticism in various reports presented during the recent years.  The proposed introduction of a short service commission would be with a view to preventing a recurrence of the present position.  The questions posed by the Deputy would be a matter for the special study and for detailed discussion with the representative association. Short service commissions are not uncommon in other armies &mdash; there is a three year commission in Britain.  It will depend on the period decided following discussions as to whether officers will have an opportunity to attend university or the particular role they will play within the structure of the Defence Forces, but the concept of a short service commission is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> I hope that during the next few months the Deputy will have an opportunity to table further questions to which I will be able to reply following the special study.  I will be only too pleased to discuss these and any questions he may have concerning the proposals under consideration.  When the various proposals are put together, we will be anxious to discuss them with the representative association, bearing in mind that it will be done in the context of not allowing what happened in the past to recur.</P>
    <P>It is important that the those who serve in the Defence Forces get job satisfaction and are not frustrated because promotions are blocked.  I do not want that to happen again in the Defence Forces.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 9 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)(a)  Where an offence under section 2 of this Act has been committed by an undertaking and the doing of the acts that constituted the offence has been authorised, or consented to, by a person, being a director, manager, or other similar officer of the undertaking, or a person who purports to act in any such capacity, that person as well as the undertaking shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished as if he or she were guilty of the first mentioned offence.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where a person is proceeded against as aforesaid for such an offence and it is proved that, at the material time, he or she was a director, manager or other similar officer of the undertaking concerned, or a person who purported to act in any such capacity, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that that person consented to the doing of the acts by the undertaking which constituted the commission by it of the offence concerned under section 2 of this Act.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment arises directly out of our discussions on Committee Stage when a number of Deputies were concerned that there should be a presumption of guilt in respect of consent given by managers or directors.  Otherwise, under this Bill, it would be very easy to escape the implications of wrongdoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> We have accommodated that in this amendment.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate briefly, on amendment No. 5 we agreed that an action by an employee is an action of the undertaking and that, therefore, the undertaking can be held liable.  In amendment No. 8 we are saying that an action by the undertaking consented to by directors, managers and those purporting to act in any such capacity implies the guilt of the manager as well as of the undertaking. We are also providing in paragraph (b) a presumption of consent to the doing of acts by the undertaking until the contrary is proven.  This directly follows our Committee Stage amendment.  It means that where an offence has been authorised or consented to by a person who is a director, manager or other similar officer, or a person who purports to act in any such capacity, that person as well as the undertaking shall be guilty of a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the phrase &ldquo;purporting to act in any such capacity&rdquo;.  The reason that is introduced is that a person may be acting as a director although not technically appointed as a director in the sense of not complying with all the provisions of company law for the appointment of directors.  Therefore, we are providing that a person who purports to act in any such capacity would also be covered by this provision and not simply a director who is appointed under the system for appointing directors.</P>
    <P>Obviously we cannot pursue an undertaking in respect of criminal sanctions. An undertaking represents a number of people acting either together or individually who authorise an action. This section provides that the person who authorised the action would be guilty of the offence and, therefore, would be liable, in the case of a criminal trial, to imprisonment if the case is proven against him.</P>

We are applying that not just in respect of corporate bodies, as in the original case, but in respect of any undertaking.  That was requested by the Deputies.  Paragraph (b) relates to the presumption of guilt.  It is complex, and we accommodated the two requests.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  Notwithstanding section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings for an offence under section 2 of this Act may be instituted within 2 years from the date of the offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides for extra time to put together a case where it is being brought by the Competition Authority <Col N="511" /> for a summary prosecution in the District Court.  Under the present provisions of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act one would be confined to a six month period to put one's case together. We have been advised that the complexity of competition cases might make the six month rule too short to assemble the necessary evidence and be in a position to bring the case.  Consequently, we are specifying a longer period, namely two years, during which a comprehensive case can be built against an alleged offender under competition law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years is not long enough because in business arrangements the facts often do not come to light until considerably later.  The facts could have been submerged for a considerable period.  Somebody may then come forward with information that has the greatest bearing on the case in hand much later than the two-year period and I would have thought that a longer period would be required.  The two-year period is a great improvement on the original proposed period of six months, which would not be tenable, but in the changing business environment two years is brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have considered that point.  In respect of indictable offences, in other words serious criminal offences, the limitation does not apply. This will apply simply to summary prosecutions in the District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are both criminal offences.  The Competition Authority has two options.  In less serious cases it can go to the District Court but in indictable cases it must go via the DPP to court.  If it goes the DPP route, there is no time limit.  We are extending the time limit from six months to two years in respect of the lesser offences. This is a reasonable balance between the statutes of limitation that apply to <Col N="512" /> District Court cases and achieving something that is workable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  In proceedings for an offence under section 2 of this Act, the opinion of any witness who appears to the court to possess the appropriate qualifications or experience as respects the matter to which his or her evidence relates shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section, be admissible in evidence as regards any matter calling for expertise or special knowledge that is relevant to the proceedings and, in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the following matters namely&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the effects that types of agreements, decisions or concerted practices may have, or that specific agreements, decisions or concerted practices have had, on competition in trade,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  an explanation to the court of any relevant economic principles or the application of such principles in practice, where such an explanation <Col N="513" /> would be of assistance to the judge or, as the case may be, the jury. </P>
    <P>(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1)  of this section, a court may, where in its opinion the interests of justice require it to so direct in the proceedings concerned, direct that evidence of a general or specific kind referred to in the said subsection shall not be admissible in proceedings for an offence under section 2 of this Act or shall be admissible in such proceedings for specified purposes only.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This arises from a debate on Committee Stage.  There was considerable doubt expressed that expert opinion evidence would be admitted in a criminal case and the committee was concerned that if expert evidence was not admitted it would be very hard to prosecute the case.  As a result we have provided for expert opinion evidence.  If the witness appears to the court to possess the appropriate qualifications relating to the matter being discussed and if the court is satisfied that the person to give evidence is expert in such matters, in particular on the effects the types of agreements, decisions or concerted practices have on competition, explanations of relevant economic principles or the application of such practices and if the explanations will be of assistance to the judge or jury, such evidence will be admissible.  The court has jurisdiction to rule out the admissibility of such evidence when it considers that the ends of justice could best be served by so doing. The court's discretion is not being circumscribed but it is being clearly indicated that the intention of the Oireachtas is that such expert evidence should be admissible unless the ends of justice are not best served by it.  The court will, of course, have to be satisfied that the person giving evidence on the matters in question is expert and a witness does not express an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.</P>
    <P>The evidence is essentially of a technical nature and this addresses issues raised by Deputies on Committee Stage <Col N="514" /> and outside the House.  Deputies will recall that there were discussions as to whether current practice would admit such evidence and we are trying to make clear what our intentions are.  In this amendment we are responding to what the Deputy sought.</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) The authority shall, at the request of the Courts, provide such advice, including specialist economist advice, as required, during the hearing of a case under the Principal Act. </P>
      <P>Obviously I agree with the Minister's amendment because both amendments are making the same point.  We discussed this at length on Committee Stage because we were aware there was a range of specialist advice that would be needed at certain points during the hearing of the case and nobody would be able to give it.  In criminal cases expert opinions are not uncommon.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to withdraw my amendment but perhaps in a fit of generosity which the Minister has not heretofore displayed today he might accept my more simply worded amendment in preference to his own.  It is very important that expert advice be on-call. I suggest that a panel of experts with expertise in various areas which would impinge upon the likely cases to be heard should be on-call and ready to give such advice in technical cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are civil proceedings but the Minister in his amendment deals with offences under this Bill <Col N="515" /> which are criminal proceedings.  I agree if we are about to change the law on criminal matters so as to bring in competition offences that it is necessary to have express authority for a judge to admit expert evidence on the economic effects of particular matters.  Expert evidence is not covered by any statute but it is debatable that without some express permission people would be allowed to express opinions as to the likely effects of certain economic actions in a market place.  It is necessary that expert evidence should be available in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am slightly worried that the two named categories of evidence that can be given are unduly restrictive.  The first one is the effects that agreements, decisions or concerted practices may have or have had on competition and trade.  I raise this point for consideration by the Minister.  There will undoubtedly be a lengthy debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  Does the Minister agree that he may not have covered the whole area of abuse of dominant position in clause (a)?  I do not know whether it is sufficient to cover abuse of dominant position charges.  The words &ldquo;agreements, decisions and concerted practices&rdquo; might not be sufficiently wide to cover expert evidence on what would amount to an abuse of dominant position by a non-concerted practice on the part of a company.</P>
      <P>The amendment refers to the explanation being &ldquo;of assistance to the judge or, as the case may be, the jury&rdquo;.  It is one thing if this is designed to reflect summary proceedings as opposed to proceedings on indictment.  However, it will be a strange state of affairs if in a District Court, sandwiched between bicycle lamp cases and television cases, an expert clambers into the box to give evidence about cross elasticities of demand arising from a collusive practice between two supermarkets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I query whether this will be the case or whether a more malign interpretation can be put on this that judges, having heard the expert evidence, will make their minds up as to whether something is or is not an unlawful practice, will direct juries to accept their decisions and tell them that it is none of their business to further consider the issue.  As a matter of law a judge may be able to direct a jury to regard the agreement in question as one prohibited by section 5.  This would mean that the jury would only be given the limited function of determining the facts in the case separate from adjudicating the legality of any particular arrangement.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission published a paper on the law relating to dishonesty. It sought submissions from people on this paper.  I made a submission arguing that in serious company law prosecutions the law should be changed to allow accountants to summarise and draw conclusions for a jury from facts they find in an investigation of a company to make their expert evidence as to a pattern of behaviour admissible.  The point was properly made on Committee Stage that any workable system &mdash; I do not concede that such a system is being put in place here &mdash; in which any tribunal, whether a jury or a judge only tribunal, had to come to grips with the real issues involved in the Competition Act, 1991, would need a system whereby expert witnesses can give evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will we have a case where a jury sits and listens to three experts drawn from the department of economics in Trinity College who say that, in their view, the rule of reason justifies a particular restrictive agreement and where the prosecution brings by way of rebuttal two other expert witnesses who say that the expert evidence for the defence is <Col N="517" /> wrong?  I do not show disrespect for any jury's verdict.  I am firmly of the view that if it cannot be explained to 12 ordinary people drawn at random why somebody should be in jail, that person should not be in jail.  If the case for a person being in jail cannot be made out to their clear understanding, nobody should be in jail.</P>
    <P>I query whether it is desirable to have a species of offence where it is open to argument by experts whether an offence had been committed.  It is one thing to have an expert say that the fingerprint on the revolver was that of Deputy O'Rourke and another say that it was not.  It is a very different matter to have experts testifying as to whether the activity she is supposed to have committed with her revolver amounts to a crime.  I am deeply suspicious of the philosophy behind this Bill.  It proposes to create a species of offence where it is possible to argue to a jury that when all the facts are proven they do not really amount to a crime on one view of the law.  It could be established that two supermarkets have come to an agreement on the price of milk or that one large dairy has come to an agreement with four supermarkets on the supply of milk.  A troop of economists could disagree with each other in court as to whether such an agreement was anti-competitive. A jury could decide to convict or acquit on the basis that one witness wiped the floor with the other experts.  To allow for this possibility is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>The fundamental cornerstone of the criminal law is that 12 ordinary people confronted with the facts can say whether something is or is not an offence.  To have them listen to a three day debate by experts as to whether something did or did not amount to an offence would introduce an entirely novel concept into our criminal law which would completely depart from the canon of clarity and simplicity.  It would be utterly wrong for somebody to be in Mountjoy Jail because two experts who argued his side of the case did not have a good day and lost the argument <Col N="518" /> before a jury on points to three experts who argued the other way.  This would be crazy but the Bill is, unfortunately, dragging us into this situation.</P>
    <P>It would be far better to state that price fixing, market sharing and one or two other categories are definite offences when they are committed by one or more people in agreement without permission of the Competition Authority.  These offences should only apply in cases where more than a certain volume of turnover is involved.  It would be clear to a jury whether companies engaged in price fixing had not been licensed by the Authority.  It is nonsense to make a jury listen to two subjective arguments among economists on whether the likely anti-competitive effects of an agreement outweighed its pro-competitive effects and whether it was justified by reference to the rule of reason on whatever jurisprudence is handed down by the European Court.</P>

      <P>I am talking about expert evidence.  Is there any other place in the world where a jury listens to expert economists arguing about whether an agreement is or is not competitive and can send somebody to jail on the basis of the view of one economist compared with that of another?  I doubt it.  This underlines the nonsensical enterprise which underlies the Bill.  We are asking juries to become theorists and arrive at theoretical judgments about facts which are put before them and their likely effects in the future or in the past.  That is reprehensible.  It is not the function of the criminal law to decide between two theoretical views of a hypothetical situation as to the possible effects of a contract if it is allowed to run for three years.  It is even worse to think that somebody could be put in jail because a jury prefers the views of one set of theoretical economists to another as to the likely effects of the decisions, activity or contracts entered into.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> To go back to the point I made this morning, people went on television and radio saying that the investment in <i>The Irish Press</i> was perfectly lawful while others at public seminars stated it was manifestly unlawful.  I often wonder what would have happened if that debate had taken place before a jury. Would a jury seriously have been asked to decide whether the directors of Independent Newspapers should go to jail or whether Independent Newspapers should be liable to a hefty fine because it agreed with the economists from Trinity rather than from UCD as to the likely effect of the investment in <i>The Irish Press</i> on the newspaper market?</P>
    <P>The Minister effectively said that Members should not worry, that this will be introduced only as a last resort in the clearest of cases where the Authority has tried to persuade the people concerned to behave themselves, but that assurance is not provided for in the Bill.  It is either the criminal law that certain activities are crimes or it is not.  It is a bit like the national emblem being the harp with a few broken strings and &ldquo; `twill do&rdquo; written underneath.  We are introducing a criminal law and saying that, in the last analysis, only the really bad cases will ever be confronted with this in the most obvious of circumstances. I find that a reprehensible way to legislate for criminal law.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell more or less answered his own point as to whether paragraph (a) covers expert evidence in respect of the possible abuse of a dominant position.  It provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the giving of information by experts about the effects of certain decisions on competition and trade. This could relate to the abuse of a dominant position.  The section also includes the words &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing&rdquo;.  I see this as an enabling provision which will <Col N="520" /> allow the court to admit such information in evidence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy expressed his unhappiness about the clash of experts as to whether an offence has been committed. This goes back to the debate on Committee Stage on whether certain offences should be specified and whether this should form the basis of the law in this area.  It is my understanding that this is not the way the law in the United States, which is, probably, the most developed in this area, has evolved.  A list of specific offences was not compiled, rather they have been built up over time by various court precedents.</P>
      <P>Specific offences have been included in section 4 against which people can judge what has happened.  These include: directly or indirectly, fixing purchasing or selling prices; limiting or controlling production markets, technical development or investment; sharing markets or sources of supply; applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions and so on.</P>
      <P>Given the wider scope of sections 4 and 5, there are certain provisions on what would constitute a good defence. We dealt with that matter earlier.  A judge cannot direct a jury to find a person guilty.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.11:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Section 7 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(7) The Authority shall make its decision granting or refusing to grant a licence under section 4 (2) within two months of a notification made under subsection (3).&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The deadline of two months specified for granting or refusing a licence is generous. Decisions should be made speedily. There are, however, enormous delays.  In complaining about the lack of resources the director of the Competition Authority made the point that while a considerable portion of the backlog has been cleared it is a constant battle &mdash; a King Canute job &mdash; to roll back the waves.  There should be a deadline for granting or refusing a licence. It is very important that they are made withing two months of a notification made under subsection (3).</P>

      <P>I regret that I am unable to agree to the amendment.  As the Deputy is probably aware, about 1,200 agreements were notified to the Authority for licensing.  These are, essentially, illegal.  Despite their illegality they are seeking a licence to permit them to proceed on grounds of wider public interest specified in the Bill concerning special economic advantage. It would be foolish to put a time limit that would give rise to the real danger that anti-competitive agreements could pass by default if the time limits could not be met.  While the authority is making good progress, some particularly difficult issues will arise in respect of the remainder.</P>
      <P>In other areas I can see the possibility of time limits and we could look at that when considering the possibility of regulations being drawn up under the Act. Time limits may be appropriate in the context of certificates.</P>
      <P>This refers to licensing something that is illegal but that should not be done under the pressure of a time limit; at least not now when there are quite a number of difficult cases to be handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the competition authority complained bitterly about not being able to deal with cases due to lack of resources.  Given the enforcement burden, the authority said in a report that it would have fewer notified agreements. Having received more than 1,300, it has reached the significant landmark of having dealt with 1,000 of them. The authority says that while the backlog is getting smaller it is also getting older and, therefore, it has those cases the Minister mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority goes on to say that it is unacceptable to have such delays in dealing with notification from the point of view of keeping parties waiting for too long, or of consumers who may be suffering from anti-competitive agreements upon which the authority has not yet ruled.  It says it has done its best to do the work, but at a high cost, it is limited without proper resources and things will get worse before they improve.  The <Col N="523" /> possibility of notifying agreements under the Bill, might increase the authority's problems.</P>
    <P>How often does the Minister meet the competition authority?  I am perplexed about that.  On the one hand it is quite acerbic about being independent of the Department or the Minister, according to a comment in its report.  On the other hand, there is a mechanism whereby the Minister can make a decision on an urgent case.  We discussed that this morning when we considered an amendment which would have speeded up the operation.</P>
    <P>What relationship is there between the Minister's Department and the competition authority?  It is one of reportage or distancing?  Clearly, the Minister cannot involve himself in the day to day running of the authority, but does he involve himself in how effective it is in dealing with cases and particularly with consumers who may be suffering because of anti-competitive practices?</P>
    <P>It seems to be a hybrid arrangement and the statute establishing it is not clear.  It is unhappy with its operations because of the paucity of finance it receives.  Is the Minister satisfied this Bill will increase the effectiveness and workmanlike atmosphere needed in a competition authority?  I do not think it will.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to give the authority the resources to do its work? There are two aspects to this.  The amendment seeks to bring speed into the process, but the authority cannot comply due to lack of resources.  The other aspect concerns the authority's standing and its relationship both with the Minister's Department and the world outside.  Does the Minister see a need for the competition authority and its operations to become more open and transparent?  While I am sure the authority is accountable to the Minister, is he satisfied that enough people know the authority is there, as well as what it is doing and who it is meant to serve?  I am not.</P>

      <P>They can seek a judicial review of the procedure that has been adopted.  A licence is a permit to do something that otherwise would be unlawful and void.  The permit is given for specialist reasons set out in section 4 (4) which describe special circumstances that might permit it to give a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a specialist area where experts decide whether circumstances are sufficient to permit something that would otherwise be an anti-competitive practice. It is an area where it has the final decision in much the same way as An <Col N="525" /> Bord Pleanála or the Environmental Protection Agency has a final decision on the technical question as to whether a person meets this requirement.  There is only an appeal from An Bord Pleanála or the Environmental Protection Agency on a point of law.  That provision would apply here.</P>
    <P>If a person or an undertaking persisted with the behaviour in respect of which the licence was refused, it would be pursued by the authority and would have the opportunity to defend its position in court on an enforcement action by the authority against it.  In that sense, the undertaking has a further stage it can go to.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, along the same lines as An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency, the present procedure is working satisfactorily. We should not introduce a new round of appeal that would clog the courts.</P>

      <P>The relationship of the authority to the Minister is set out clearly in the law.  It is a quasi-judicial body.  Its decisions are published at great length.  There is a huge amount of transparency whereby one can study the basis of their decisions.  It also provides <Col N="526" /> an annual report in which it summarises its work.  To a degree the authority is at arm's length from the Department.  It is quasi-judicial and it processes licences and certification without reference to the Department.  That is its primary function.  Under section 11 it can also be asked by the Minister to investigate the conditions in a particular market or, under section 14, it can be asked to determine whether there is potential abuse of a dominant position and report to the Minister, on foot of which I can take action.</P>
      <P>I meet members of the authority on a regular basis.  A significant increase in resources will be allocated to the authority in accord with its new duties.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> In page 9, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(1) Any person who is aggrieved in consequence of any agreement, decision, concerted practice or abuse which is prohibited under section 4 or 5 shall have a right of action for relief under this section against either or both of the following, namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any undertaking which is or has at any material time been a party to such an agreement, decision or concerted practice or has been guilty of such an abuse,</P>
    <P>(b)  any director, manager or other officer of such an undertaking, or a person who purported to act in any such capacity, who authorised or consented to, as the case may be, the entry by the undertaking into, or the implementation by it of, the agreement or decision, the engaging by it in the concerted practice or the doing by it of the act that constituted the abuse.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment widens the application of section 6 of the Principal Act to ensure aggrieved persons have the right of civil action against either the undertaking, a director, manager, etc. of such an undertaking or both.  In view of the fact that undertakings or directors can commit offences, it made directors potentially personally liable for civil damages.  The effect of this amendment is that the aggrieved person can seek damages against a director.  As I explained earlier, the phrase &ldquo;purported to act in any such capacity&rdquo; covers a case where a director may not have been properly appointed or where it is difficult to prove the person was a director. To ensure compliance it is important that people who authorise actions that damage another person can be pursued and that there can be findings against them.  Corporations are not nameless entities; they are controlled by <Col N="528" /> individuals and we do not want individuals to be in a position where they can set up legal vehicles to avoid pursuit under this clause.  They can rebut their involvement under legislation but this amendment permits the taking of a case for damages against the undertaking, the directors, managers, etc. or both.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out the implications of this amendment.  Many bodies have been charged civilly with breaching the law, one of which is the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Proceedings have been taken against many other large companies, some of which were owned by the State.

This measure completely rips apart the veil of incorporation on civil liability and it does not seem, on the face of it, to distinguish between those who are seriously guilty and gain from it and the managers and directors who gain nothing from it.  The Minister seems to be making them all civilly liable to other people for the activities of companies on whose board they may have represented a minority. The Minister is galloping in here at the eleventh hour to radically change our law in relation to directors' liability.  He is making a whole class of people, including those who passively acquiesce, <Col N="529" /> to use the Minister's own pharase, in certain behaviour civilly liable and liable to be bankrupted in their retirement from companies.

    <Title>Control of Horses Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to a commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to introduce legislation to control wandering horses in urban areas. The commitment arises from an undesirable phenomenon, mainly urban, which has been developing for some time.  The problem has now reached such a stage that it can no longer be ignored and must be the subject of resolute legislative action without further delay.  Deputies will be aware that straying horses are creating problems in many of our towns and cities, causing damage to property, traffic accidents and injury to persons, particularly children. Deputies will also be aware of recent media coverage of fatalities associated with horses straying on roads. Roads add to the topicality of the issue. With the construction of a major motorway on the perimeter of Dublin city, in the very area where there is a high concentration of uncontrolled horses, there is potential for horrendous carnage as a result of collisions between unattended horses and high-speed vehicles.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to ensure that horses are not a source of danger to life and limb.  My concern is to secure a responsible, welfare-friendly maintenance and ownership of horses.  I fully accept that horse ownership is part of the traditional fabric of city life and that it has the support and participation of a broad cross-section of people in urban communities.  Horses are a fact of economic life for many urban dwellers including jarveys and carters.  I am satisfied that the Bill is a balanced approach to horse ownership in an urban environment.</P>
      <P>The issues involved in the proposed legislation transcend the traditional functions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  When assigned special responsibility for progressing the legislation.  I decided to set up a consultative committee consisting of representatives from my Department and from the Departments of Justice and the Environment, South Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and the Garda Síochána.  I also embarked on a more general process of consultation and met a wide variety of bodies and individuals concerned about the topic of straying horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware from the reply to a parliamentary question in the Official Report of 2 April that representations and observations were received from a wide variety of interested parties <Col N="535" /> including other Government Departments, local authorities, public representatives, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, MEAS, representatives of the travelling community, the Automobile Association, the IFA, the Dublin Horse Owners Association, the Joint Animal Aid Committee and from concerned individuals in relation to the general issue of urban horse control.</P>
    <P>A central point established by the consultative committee in regard to the problem of wandering horses was that, while the Animals Act, 1985, contained powers for local authorities and the Garda Síochána to impound any animal found wandering in a public place, these powers needed to be strengthened and supplemented by new legislation to deal with the current problem.  This basic stance of the committee and the results of its general deliberations combined with the observations from the other interested parties resulted in the Bill which we are now considering.  I also had discussions on this issue with the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy in April.  A number of very useful suggestions were made during the meeting and I was glad to insert them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill I also took account of the control of horses Bill introduced in 1990 in Private Members' Time by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  I commend him for his initiative in promoting that Bill, which was a most valuable source of ideas for me and my officials in drafting the Bill now before the House.  There are, of course, differences of emphasis and context between the Bills, but, either expressly or by implication, I have adopted many of the ideas and concepts in the 1990 Bill and of the Private Members' Bill introduced recently by Deputy Brendan Kenneally. It is a measure of the general support for legislation of this kind across the political spectrum that Deputies have taken the interest to draft Bills of their own. <Col N="536" /> A task which I intend to tackle in the near future is the question of means of identification.  There are various forms of identification &mdash; freeze branding, hoof and lip tattooing, and microchip implanting &mdash; which need to be examined in order that the identification regulations to be made under section 28 incorporate an optimum form of marking for the horses to be controlled.  I have accordingly arranged for officials of my Department to undertake a review of the various forms of identification to make it possible to introduce the regulations as early as possible after enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer briefly to the question of the monthly horse fair in Smithfield Market.  There have been calls for its abolition.  I have given full consideration to this matter and concluded that the issue is far too complex for treatment in a Bill of this kind, which deals with control rather than major legislative change.  The general topic of markets needs to receive the comprehensive attention of a body such as the Law Reform Commission before a decision is taken on the question of abolition.  My Department operates market legislation going back to the last century which is virtually defunct and, on the face of it, should be repealed. However, piecemeal abolition of such legislation or of Smithfield Market is not the way forward.  At this juncture the priority is to run Smithfield on a fully regulated and supervised basis. That position, in conjunction with the ban on the sale of horses to minors under section 40 of the Bill, will largely deal with the adverse aspects of Smithfield.</P>
    <P>Judging by representations received and Private Members' Bills, there is an expectation that the Bill under discussion should deal comprehensively with a range of detail in relation to the welfare of horses.  This is unnecessary. Instead I have decided that the penalty provisions of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, should undergo a major recasting to include penalties for conviction on indictment.  Section 45 provides that the maximum penalties under subsection (1) of section 1 of the Protection <Col N="537" /> of Animals Act, 1911, will be as follows: on summary conviction a fine of £1,500 or six months' imprisonment or both and on conviction on indictment a fine of £10,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.  This provision seeks to address a limitation of the existing section 1 (1) in that it contains only minor penalties on summary conviction.  The table accompanying section 45 shows subsection (1) of section 1 of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, following insertion of the new penalties.  I consider that the new provision is sufficient to deal with cases of cruelty to all animals, including horses.  In proposing this new deterrent against acts of cruelty and in restating by table the relevant provisions of the 1911 Act, I am putting horse owners and others on notice that any acts of cruelty against horses or any other animal will bring them face to face with the full rigours of a strengthened law of protection.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the costs to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the administration of the legislation shall be met, to the extent sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. While there are a number of financial provisions in the Bill, for example, licence fees and fees for inspection of registers, whereby revenue will accrue to local authorities, this revenue may not be adequate to cover the costs of local authorities in employing additional staff and fully discharging their responsibilities under the legislation. For this reason, the Bill provides that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make grants towards the expenses of a local authority incurred under the legislation.  The precise staffing and other resources required will be finalised between the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the context of Estimate discussions.</P>
    <P>The central provision in the Bill for the control of wandering horses in mainly urban areas is the declaration, by means of local authority by-laws, of control areas where a horse may not be <Col N="538" /> kept without a licence.  These areas will be declared by by-laws made by the local authorities under section 17, which empowers a local authority to declare any area within its functional area to be a control area where horses must be controlled by licence in order to prevent them from causing annoyance, damage, injury or nuisance.  A particular advantage of control areas declared by by-law is that, where there is an intrusion of an urban horse problem into the nearby rural hinterland, the by-laws may extend the control provisions to the rural area. Another advantage is that the control provisions of the Bill may be introduced on a staged or a pilot basis whereby there can be concentration of resources on local authorities where the horse problem is acute and local authorities with a minimal horse problem may defer implementation.</P>
    <P>Other key provisions are the issuing of licences to horse owners in control areas subject to compliance with conditions to be set out in by-laws; disqualification from keeping a horse or from obtaining a licence; a ban on the sale of horses to minors under the age of 16 years, the seizure, detention and disposal of stray, unlicensed or unidentifiable horses or horses causing a nuisance or posing a danger; criminal liability for injury or damage caused by horses; powers of enforcement for authorised persons and members of the Garda Síochána and powers of arrest and the issue of search warrants.  Penalities on conviction of offences under the Bill are also provided.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal section by section with the other main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 contains definitions. The defintion of disposal of a horse includes selling, giving away or destruction.  The definition of horse is that contained in the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965.  Considerations of consistency arising from the necessary amendment of this Act by section 41 require that this definition be adopted.  A stray horse is defined as a horse apparently wandering at large, lost or unaccompanied by any person <Col N="539" /> apparently in charge of it in a public place or on any premises without the owner's or occupier's consent.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the appointment of authorised persons by the local authorities to exercise the functions conferred on them by the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 empowers a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant persons suspected of having committed certain offences under the Act. These offences are: failure to remove an unlicensed horse from a public place or a control area; failure to give name and address to an authorised person of the local authority or the Garda Síochána where the commission of an offence under the Act is suspected; failure to desist from dangerous use of a horse, from infringing by-laws relating to horse control and welfare, or from having a horse in an area from which it is excluded; obstruction of an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána in the exercise of their duties; failure to adhere to by-laws relating to the control and welfare of horses; keeping, having or riding a horse in an exclusion area.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that maximum penalties for offences under the Act, other than section 42, will be a fine of £1,500 or six months' imprisonment or both.  For an offence under section 42 dealing with criminal liability the maximum penalties will be: on summary conviction a fine of £1,500 or six months' imprisonment or both; and on conviction on indictment a fine of £10,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.  The summary fines are payable to the local authority which prosecuted the offence.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that, on conviction of an offence, a person may, in addition to the penalty imposed, be disqualified from keeping a horse for such period as the court sees fit.</P>
    <P>Section 8 empowers the court to order the forfeiture of a horse to a local authority on conviction of the owner of an offence where the welfare of the animal so demands.  The local authority may seize and detain a horse and dispose of its as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Section 10 allows the imposition of an on-the-spot fine of £50, variable by ministerial regulation, for offences such as failure to licence a horse kept in a control area under section 18; failure to inform the local authority of the disposal or change of ownership of a horse under section 25; failure to produce a horse licence for inspection by the local authority or the Garda Síochána under section 26; failure to remove an unlicensed horse from a public place or control area under section 27; failure to comply with by-laws under section 43; and failure to keep a horse out of an exclusion area or to comply with a requirement of an authorised officer or a member of the Garda Síochána that a horse be removed from an exclusion area under section 44.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with regulations which may be made by the Minister. The Minister is empowered to make regulations prescribing the amount of the on-the-spot fine under section 10; the persons exempt from the requirement to have a horse licence under section 19 and the means of identification of horses kept in control areas under section 28.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that a horse owner who keeps a horse or has it kept for him in a control area must hold a horse licence granted by the local authority. It is also provided that a nonowner cannot have control or charge of an unlicensed horse in a control area. Pound keepers and veterinary surgeons in the exercise of their services and other designated classes of persons are exempted from the licensing requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 19 exempts certain horses kept in control areas from the licensing requirement.  Examples of such exempted horses are those kept by the local authority, the Garda Síochána or the Minister for Defence, horses being treated by a veterinary surgeon on premises other than the premises where the horses are kept and foals kept with their dam or foster-mother.</P>
    <P>Section 20 empowers a local authority to grant a horse licence to the owner of a horse entitling the owner to keep the horse in a control area.  The licence shall <Col N="541" /> be in respect of a particular horse specified in the licence.  Provision is made for the amendment, revocation or suspension of the licence if the holder is in breach of the Act or the conditions of a licence or has already had a licence amended, revoked or suspended.  The local authority may not grant a horse licence to certain categories including persons under 16 years of age or persons disqualified from keeping a horse under section 7.  Local authorities may exchange information with one another about horse licences.</P>
    <P>Section 22 sets out the procedure for applying for a horse licence.  The application shall be to the local authority and shall include the submission of a prescribed fee as specified by ministerial regulation.  An application unaccompanied by the fee shall be invalid.</P>
    <P>Section 23 sets out a procedure for appeals against a decision by a local authority to refuse to grant a horse licence or to amend, revoke or suspend a horse licence.  Where the local authority notifies an application for a horse licence or a licence holder of such decision, the aggrieved person may make representations within 14 days of the notification.  The applicant or holder may in turn appeal against such decision to the judge of the District Court.  A decision of the District Court on an appeal shall be final save that, by leave of the court, the appeal from the decision shall lie to the High Court on a specified question of law.</P>
    <P>Section 24 requires each local authority to maintain a register of horse licences granted by it.  The register must contain information such as an identification reference and description of the horse; the name and address of the horse owner or, if the horse is kept by a person other than the owner, the name and address of the keeper; the place where the horse is kept.</P>
    <P>Section 25 requires that, where the holder of a horse licence disposes of a horse, he or she must notify the local authority about the disposal within 14 days of disposal and must surrender the <Col N="542" /> licence to the authority.  Where ownership of the horse has changed, the name and address of the new owner, where known, must be given to the local authority, and the authority must record these particulars in the register maintained under section 24.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána may request a person whom they suspect is the owner of a horse kept in a control area to state whether such owner has a licence for the horse.  It is also provided that the authorised person or the Garda may request the holder of a licence to produce it for inspection within ten working days of the request.</P>
    <P>Section 27 empowers an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána to require a person in control or charge of an unlicensed or unexempted horse in a public place or control area to remove the horse immediately from the public place or control area.</P>
    <P>Section 28 empowers the Minister to make regulations for the identification of horses kept in control areas.  This provision is intended to facilitate the prescription of nationwide means of identification so that straying over county border can be detected.</P>
    <P>Section 29 empowers an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána to inspect and examine any horse.  It is also a requirement of this section that the person in charge or control of the horse shall give the authorised person or the Garda any reasonable assistance he may request for the purposes of the inspection or examination.</P>
    <P>Section 30 obliges any person who keeps or has charge or control of a horse, or the owner or any person in charge of a premises where a horse is found, to give, when requested, the name and address, if known, of the owner of the horse to an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Section 31 empowers an authorised person of a local authority or a member <Col N="543" /> of the Garda Síochána to request their name and address from a person whom the officer or garda suspects is committing or has committed an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides that an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána may direct a person to desist from offending against the provisions of section 42 or against by-laws made under section 43 or 44, i.e., to desist from dangerous use of a horse, from infringing by-laws relating to horse control and welfare, or from having a horse in an area from which it is excluded, if the authorised person or garda has reasonable cause to suspect that the person is so offending.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides that, where an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána suspects that an offence is being committed or a horse is being ill-treated in any premises or vehicle, the authorised person or member may enter such premises or vehicle and may, there or in any other place and with the assistance of other persons or equipment, search for any horse or document and may take extracts or copies from the document. The authorised person or the garda may not enter a dwelling without a search warrant authorising such entry.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that a judge of the District Court may issue search warrants to a named member of the Garda Síochána to enter, if necessary by force, and, within one month, to exercise on the premises named in the warrant any of the powers conferred on a member of the Garda Síochána under the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 35 makes it an offence to obstruct or impede the authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána in the exercise of their functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 36 empowers an authorised person of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána to seize and detain any horse which the officer or member suspects to be a stray horse, a horse not under adequate control, a horse causing a nuisance or posing a danger to persons or property, a horse being kept in a control <Col N="544" /> area without a licence, a horse not capable of being identified or a horse being kept or ridden in an exclusion area.  A person who, without lawful authority, removes a horse from a place of detention while it is being detained shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 37 empowers the local authority in whose functional area the horse was found or the superintendent of the Garda Síochána to attach an identification mark or device to a horse which has been detained under section 36.</P>
    <P>Section 38 empowers the local authority or the superintendent to continue to detain a horse for the purpose of court proceedings or for disposal in accordance with by-laws made by the local authority.  By-laws made under this section in relation to a horse detained under section 36 may deal with the notices to be given or displayed in connection with the detention, the fees, including transport costs, to be paid by the owner or keeper or the horse detained and the sale, disposal or destruction of the horse.  If the owner or keeper of the horse is known, the sale, disposal or destruction shall take place if he or she fails to produce a horse licence or to remove the horse from detention.  The local authority or the superintendent are empowered to enter into any arrangements with any person, including a pound keeper, in respect of the acceptance, detention, disposal and destruction of horses detained under section 36.</P>
    <P>Section 39 requires every local authority to maintain a register of horses seized and detained in its functional area which come into its possession.  Every superintendent is required to maintain a register of horses seized and detained by the Garda Síochána. The registers must contain particulars such as an identification reference, a description of the horse, the date of seizure and detention, the manner in which the horse is dealt with, the place of detention and details of the person reclaiming the horse.</P>
    <P>Section 40 makes it an offence to sell or attempt to sell a horse to a person under the age of 16 years.  Section 41 is a necessary amendment of section 24 of the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, to obviate conflict between the prohibition against <Col N="545" /> the sale of animals as pets to a person under the age of 12 years and section 40 of the Bill.  The table accompanying section 41 sets out the provision in section 24 of the Act of 1965 following insertion of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 42 attaches criminal liability to the owner, keeper or person in charge or control of a horse who wilfully or recklessly permits a horse to pose a danger to a person or property or to cause injury to a person or damage to property, or who wilfully or recklessly causes a horse to pose a danger to a person or property or to injure a person or damage property.</P>
    <P>Section 43 empowers local authorities to make by-laws for the control and welfare of horses in the whole or part of its functional area.  A local authority may specify the manner in which a horse is to be kept under control in a public or other place so as to prevent injury or nuisance; and specify the manner in which a horse is to be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Section 44 empowers a local authority to prohibit by by-law the keeping or riding of a horse in an area where the horse is causing or is likely to cause a nuisance, injury or damage.  An authorised officer of a local authority or a member of the Garda Síochána may require a person whom they suspect is contravening any by-law made under this section to remove the horse immediately from the area to which the prohibition applies.</P>
    <P>These are the salient features of the Bill which I commend to the House and, in doing so, I would like to thank all the organisations and individuals who contributed to its preparation.  As I indicated we engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process in formulating the terms of the Bill. Nevertheless, I will listen very carefully to contributions from Deputies and will be prepared to consider favourably and will be structive proposals which would improve the measures and which are appropriate to the legislation.  I thank my officials for the hard work they put into the preparation of the Bill and I look forward to an open, comprehensive and constructive debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and <Col N="546" /> am glad that the Minister of State and the Government have reacted to the Control and Regulation of Horses, Bill, 1996, published by me earlier this year. It is wonderful to see the Government trotting after Fianna Fáil when we introduce a Bill.  While welcoming its provisions, I give a general welcome to the Bill as many areas need to be looked at again.  In this context I wish to put forward some ideas.  However, I thank the Minister for giving us the opportunity some weeks ago to discuss these provisions in committee after the general principle of the Bill had been produced.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the unnecessary use of licensing to solve social problems but when people are killed on the road and life is made unbearable for people living in housing estates and elsewhere then proper controls on the keeping of horses must be introduced and enforced.  I drafted my Bill out of a sense of frustration at the lact of action taken to tackle this growing problem.  Dogs are not allowed to roam free in public places, yet horses, which pose a greater danger to the general public, are largely uncontrolled.  It is unbelievable that no form of registration or licensing has been introduced in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always felt that wandering horses would cause deaths on the roads and unfortunately this was borne out earlier this week in County Tipperary and a few weeks ago in County Meath.  These are only two in a long list of mishaps, some fatal, which the road using population has had to endure for many years. We have never looked at the problem in its proper perspective or realised the level of frustration and anger among the public or danger posed to them by wandering horses.  Some weeks ago a young girl lost her life at a concert as a result of a breakdown in crowd control.  Calls were rightly made for a major investigation into this incident and the procedures generally followed at such events.  The loss of human life is a serious matter which always warrants investigation, yet we have allowed horses go uncontrolled for decades with <Col N="547" /> a consequent loss of life.  As such incidents were conveniently classed as road accidents there seemed to be no urgency in dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>The difficulties and dangers presented by wandering and uncontrolled horses are so old and seemingly so well accepted that I often wondered if we as legislators would ever face up to our responsibilities.  One can keep a cat or dog with little bother or imposition on one's neighbour but the keeping of a horse cannot be called a trivial decision as it has major cost implications for the owner, its size makes it difficult to properly control and its general welfare necessitates a great deal of work by the owner.  As the ISPCA says every Christmas, a dog is a present for life. However, for those people who live beside irresponsible neighbours a horse can be a life sentence.  This is not good enough and the problem must be dealt with.  Those who own or control horses must be made live up to their responsibilities both to the animal and society.</P>
    <P>Many people who keep horses have small gardens or no gardens but even if they had large gardens I doubt if they would allow them to cut up the lawn or damage it.  Instead they irresponsibly allow their horse to graxe the long acre, the side of the road, or hunt them into public land where they disrupt the unfortunate residents.  Lest anyone thinks I am singling our a particular section of the population, I would remind Deputies that the settled population is as much to blame, and in many cases more so, than travellers for the problem of wandering horses.  Richard III is said to have cried out in frustration, &ldquo;A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse&rdquo;.  I know many housing estates where he would find a stable full of horses any afternoon.  In addition to this obviously unacceptable problem, we should look at the financial cost of horses which are let run loose.  In many cases gardaí are called out to deal with this problem, taking them away from other duties.  They must also try to find and notify the owners or else arrange <Col N="548" /> for the animals to be collected and transported to a horse pound.</P>
    <P>My experience of the problem has been in an urban context but I am aware that it is also a problem in many rural areas.  We must not only legislate to curb the current difficulty but also anticipate future problems and the way some horse owners might try to circumvent the new law.  Accordingly, it is important that the regulations are enforced throughout the country, not merely in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has now entitled the Bill &mdash; Control of Horses Bill, 1996, rather than Control of Horses in Urban Areas Bill as it was entitled when its heads came before us in committee. Initially that change heartened me since I assumed that some of the points made by my colleagues and me had been taken on board by the Minister but, unfortunately, it appears that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out those provisions which should be included in the Bill and comment on how its actual proposals, as drafted, withstand that scrutiny.</P>
    <P>A system of identification of horses is most important and a tamper-proof method introduced if at all possible. There are a number of systems of identification which can be used &mdash; such as freeze branding, microchip implant, lip tattoo, hoof tattoo and others, the least likely of which to be tampered with being the microchip implant.  I am informed that even the Irish Show Jumping Association is considering implementing this method of identification resulting from problems it has encountered in the course of its competitions. I was also interested to discover that this method has already been introduced by the Fettercairn horse project in Dublin, to which I shall revert later. While other methods are open to abuse, perhaps there is some other tamper-proof means of tagging horses and, if so, they should be deployed.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware &mdash; and the Minister must accept &mdash; that people are very adept at circumventing controls and <Col N="549" /> quickly devise methods to cheat society and the State.  So far they have been able to reproduce smart cards for television decoders, refresh Telecom phone cards, falsify insurance certificates, alter animal records, even copying road tax discs; the list is endless.  When it comes to frustrating the law, dodging payment of a fine or otherwise refusing to comply with an accepted system, people will devise and use the most ingenious methods.</P>
    <P>Logically, therefore, a chip implanted by means of minor surgery, replaceable only by the same method, is probably the only system with any chance of success, given the level of expertise involved and, while it may be a paying proposition to attempt replacement in the case of a valuable racehorse, it is a far more remote possibility in the case of a less well-bred horse kept as a pet.</P>
    <P>The regulations should be enforced for all horses with the exception of thoroughbred racehorses.  In addition, it should be an offence to keep any horse over the age of six months unless it can be properly identified.  Any change of registration must be duly recorded.  Any person transferring possession of a horse could do so only if he was the holder of registration papers for that animal.  In the interests of eradicating disease, we have been able to effect such control in the case of cattle, much more numerous, so that it should not be an insurmountable task in the case of a few thousand horses.</P>
    <P>Registration should be carried out by the local authority of the functional area in which the horse is to be kept, with restrictions on the type of person who could qualify to own a horse.  I envisage this registration procedure being operated somewhat along the lines of the present motor vehicle registration whereby the Garda would have easy access to the records to establish the ownership of an impounded horse. Registration papers would follow a standard format and be valid, from date of issue, for the duration of the horse's life, any fees arising in this identification <Col N="550" /> process and in the production of registration papers to be paid to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>In the context of this problem, the most important part of any legislation is the actual, physical control of horses. Horses should not be permitted to be in any place other than, (a) the premises of the owner, (b) the premises of any other person in charge of the horse and (c)  the premises of any other person, with the consent of that person, thus ensuring that its owner or such other person in charge of it keeps it under effectual control.  The very application of such criteria immediately precludes horses from straying on public roads, private property or lands in the control of a local authority.</P>
    <P>If those measures are breached, immediate action must be taken and horses impounded under the provisions of the Animals Act, 1985.  When a local authority has taken possession of any animal, it should be transferred to a national pound.  I will revert in a moment to my reasons for recommending the establishing of a national pound.</P>
    <P>When a horse has been impounded more than once, the relevant local authority may dispose of the animal as it thinks fit, even to the extent of having it destroyed humanely by a veterinary surgeon.  The impounding of a horse should be carried out by a member of the Gárda Síochána, a local authority or an ISPCA inspector, such bodies agree their liaison arrangements for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Whenever a horse is claimed from the pound and the authorities are satisfied that the applicant is entitled to claim it, certain undertakings must be given to ensure the animal's future well-being. All costs incurred in the removal of a horse to a pound, veterinary fees and provision of sustenance while maintained in the pound, must be paid for before release.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, each local authority is required to provide its horse pound.  However, most of them do not and it would probably not be financially <Col N="551" /> feasible.  As I perceive it, the main problem has to do with security.  Local authorities are in poor financial circumstances at present and, if compelled to provide a 24 hours a day presence at a horse pound, the likelihood is they would be able to provide one person or at the very most two at any given time. If a number of horses were impounded and their various owners banded together to raid the pound to recover their animals, its defenders would not be in a physical position to prevent them, thus rendering such a facility useless.</P>
    <P>If there was a national pound funded by all local authorities, proper security could be provided 24 hours a day and any owner wishing to retrieve a horse would be obliged to do so in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>The legislation relating to the sale of horses also needs to be tightened up, to the extent that any horse fair, sale or mart would require the permission of the relevant local authority, impose a prohibition on the sale of horses to any person aged under 18 years, accompanied by a provision that there would be an approved veterinary surgeon available and so on.  I outlined a number of other stipulations in my Bill, too lengthy to list here and to which I shall refer on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Sufficient grazing must be provided for the maintenance of horses.  While there are instances of horses kept in a house or garden, this can be allowed only if its owner can prove that it is a work-horse on which he depends for his livelihood or a substantial part thereof. It is ludicrous to think that a horse can be cared for properly on the roadside. Therefore, it should be a requirement of the Bill that people are able to prove they have proper quarters and open space so that horses are not mistreated or have less than a normal lifestyle resulting from the confined space in which they are kept.</P>
    <P>Following an accident involving a wandering horse, the animal's owner will be liable for damage or injury <Col N="552" /> caused to any person, motor vehicle or any other property.  From where will the resources come to pay compensation to the victims of wandering horses?  More often than not, their owner would be unable to pay any realistic amount of compensation and the likelihood of insurance cover is slim.  Perhaps we should consider a scheme of insurance akin to car insurance to provide adequate cover in such circumstances. An innocent pedestrian, cyclist or motorist should not be at a loss; neither should a householder who suffers serious damage to his or her home, land or other property.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to the ISPCA in section 3, although I specifically referred to it, and it must be involved. Perhaps it is intended that a local authority can designate members or officers of that society as authorised persons.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the penalties involved.  I am prepared reluctantly to go along with them although I had suggested more severe penalties.  I note also that the fine has been reduced from £2,000 in the general scheme of the Bill, circulated previously, but that the term of imprisonment has been increased from three to six months.  One could argue forever about the amount of a fine or length of incarceration.  At least I am happy the Minister is not taking too lenient a view in this respect.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 7 are in accord with my views.  Nevertheless, there should be a provision that a judge can disqualify a person from ownership of a horse, if necessary, for life.</P>
    <P>With regard to the forfeiture of horses dealt with in section 8, it appears that court action must be taken before a local authority can dispose of any animal. I referred earlier to my belief that, if an animal has been impounded twice, it could not be returned to its owner but disposed of by the relevant local authority. Under the general scheme of the Bill we discussed previously, the Minister had suggested that, if an animal has been impounded on three occasions, it could be disposed of in some manner.  It is hard to argue which of those methods <Col N="553" /> would be the more appropriate or proper. The Bill, as drafted, appears to move away from that provision.  There may not always be a will to go to court to seek a conviction, particularly because of the costs involved, which may not be awarded to the local authority, and the delays usually encountered in court cases.  It would be easier to grant powers to local authorities after two or three visits to the national pound.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by section 11 (1) which states that &ldquo;a register may be prepared, established and maintained in a form that is not legible if it is capable of being converted into a legible form&rdquo;.  I have tried to figure out what that section means, without success, and I ask the Minister to enlighten me on it.</P>
    <P>I have a major difficulty with the concept of control areas stipulated under section 17, which basically urbanises the Bill.  We were told on Committee Stage that a local authority could designate a county as a controlled area.  That being the case, why should it not be written into the legislation?  It is suggested that there is not a problem in rural areas, but on two recent occasions I have met wandering horses on rural roads in my constituency. Nothing is more dangerous than being confronted with wandering horses on driving round a bend at normal speed.  It is dangerous, disruptive, unnecessary and should be dealt with firmly by the Minister in this legislation, but the danger, aggravation or loss is not always confined to roads.  Horses can inflict damage on crops in rural areas, on rural gardens or on innocent bystanders in their homes.  The practice whereby owners of horses can drive their animals into fields at will to graze on the cream of crops, regardless of the damage they cause, must stop.  It must be brought home to people, who inflict such loss on farmers or other land owners, that such practice is no longer acceptable, that there is a law to deal with it, the will to enforce it and no jurisdiction in which it does not have effect.  There cannot be safe havens for <Col N="554" /> people who attempt to flout the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the owners of a large number of horses will move to an area within a local authority jurisdiction which is not a controlled one.  I foresee problems in suburbs of cities such as Waterford or Limerick, which are in a different county.  That would make a mockery of the legislation.  The Minister stated that if there was a problem concerning wandering horses in an area, new by-laws could be introduced to deal with it, but from reading the Bill I gather it may take a number of months to do so, by which time the owners of horses could move them to another area that is not controlled.  One of the reasons the Minister put forward this proposal is that a large number of farmers own work-horses, which do not cause a problem, and they would be exempt from registration.  In farming a new law we must be practical and appreciate how these measures will operate in reality.</P>
    <P>While the general scheme of the Bill was presented to us, there were many references to the Control of Dogs Act, 1986.  Despite that legislation I am not aware of inspectors going on to the private property to ascertain if dogs are licensed.  If they are not running free or causing a problem, they are largely ignored.  That is a common-sense way of enforcing the regulations.  Similarly, I do not envisage authorised persons visiting farms throughout the country to ascertain if their horses are licensed.  I do not see how a well-cared for horse, tethered or stabled three fields from the public road will attract the attention of members of the suffering public or an inspector.  Initially, I expect those people, who may have to bring their animals on the public thoroughfares, will be registered.  It is also likely that many of those now flouting the law will not register their animals.  However, that could be remedied if the horses were impounded as there are not circumstances in which a horse would be released from a pound without being properly registered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> Another reason that provision is included may be to exclude areas in which thoroughbred horses are normally found.  Unless I missed it, I did not find any provision to exempt thoroughbred horses from registration.  If it is intended to cover that through the use of control areas, those with thoroughbred horses in urban areas would have to register them whereas those in rural areas would not.  Those horses need to be specifically exempted.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in Part II concerning licensing of horses, maintenance of registers etc., appear to be very much in line with what I suggested and I do not have a problem with their content. If my reading and understanding of section 28 is correct, I compliment the Minister on listening to the views put forward during the committee hearing. According to the explanatory memorandum, the Minister is empowered to make a regulation for the identification of horses which would be a nationwide means of identification.  I accept the Minister's right to make such regulation by the best means available and I assume that section means there will be a standard system for the country or control areas as envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I made the point forcefully when the heads of the Bill were discussed that some of these animals are mobile and could easily end up in different local authority jurisdictions.  That being the case, the previous suggestion of allowing each local authority to decide its means of identification could not work.  Under a standard system it would be easy for information to be transferred from one local authority area to another.</P>
    <P>Section 40 introduces an age of 16, below which a person cannot own a horse.  Below that age the head of a household is deemed to be the owner.  I suggested an age limit of 18 years, but in doing so I was conscious that provision could be circumvented by an adult registering as owner of the animal involved. There is nothing we can do about this and I cannot quibble with this provision. <Col N="556" /> It may throw some responsibility on a parent to ensure a horse is properly looked after.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposals in section 42 whereby criminal liability is attached to the owner or person in charge of a horse as it would be unfair to put the onus on the injured person or the property owner.</P>
    <P>Section 43 may contradict section 28. Section 43 appears to give power to the local authority to make a by-law in its functional area whereby it can require identification of a horse in such manner or by such means as may be specified.  If it is given to the authority to decide the means of identification, that is different from section 28 which provides that the Minister lays down, by way of regulation, the system of identification.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal specifically with the sale of horses, a problem area identified by a number of animal organisations in the past.  The Minister may intend to cover this area in each local authority by means of a by-law, but it might make more sense to specifically include provisions in this legislation. Neither are there any provisions on the keeping of horses.  In my Private Members' Bill, I proposed provisions governing the keeping of horses in restricted areas, the amount of grazing land required etc.  However, I have an open mind about this now, particularly in view of the arguments put forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Fettercairn Horse Project, the Ranch, located in Tallaght and I would like to deal with it in more depth.  The main reason for bringing forward legislation in this area is chiefly to curb the menace of wandering horses and not to put a stop to the fun and joy that horses bring to so many children and adults.  This is not normally a problem in rural areas, but can be in an urban context.  I had the pleasure of visiting and seeing at first-hand the excellent work being carried out in a supervised and orderly manner.  This project could be a prototype for other areas although I realise this type of horse <Col N="557" /> ownership is largely Dublin based.  Currently, approximately 30 horses, individually owned, are catered for by this organisation and if it did not exist, those animals would be running wild and causing many problems.</P>
    <P>Currently there is an area of approximately one acre of land beside a local community centre owned by South Dublin County Council.  This land has been fenced off into corrals with chain-link fencing.  Boundary fencing has been provided as well as temporary stabling. Every morning young people water their horses and release them from the corral to graze on land largely owned by the local authority.  The horses are staked to prevent them from wandering. After school the young people clean the corrals and stables and water the horses. At approximately 7 p.m. all the horses are locked up for the night.  In addition to the obvious social benefits this activity provides by keeping so many young people occupied there are also other possibilities for future employment in the equine area.  Courses in horse riding and stable management, workshops on animal welfare and harness making and so on are been conducted.</P>
    <P>Many of our larger towns and cities are becoming urban jungles and we constantly hear the call for the provision of more and more green areas.  It would not be such a bad idea if some of these green areas encompassed a fenced-off portion for equine pursuits under the control of approved local bodies.  Often large indoor recreational facilities are provided when a simpler and cheaper solution could be found.  The experience in Fettercairn is an example of that.  The leaders of this project are concerned that once this legislation is enacted the land will be taken back from them by the local authority and the horses impounded.  This would be a retrograde step.  We could address this issue on Committee Stage by tabling an amendment to give a mandate to local authorities to set land aside for this purpose. It would have to be strictly controlled <Col N="558" /> with only organisations approved by the local authority eligible to participate.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate on this Bill and to further discussion on Committee Stage when some of the changes I have suggested might be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for allowing me to speak first. I have just a few comments on this Bill. I represent an area in Dublin and hope, following the next general election, to represent a wider area than I currently do when the Dublin Central constituency will include Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot where this is quite an important issue.  When one reads the weekly accounts of cruelty to animal in our newspapers, and the accounts of residents in these areas expressing their constant concern on grounds of health, <Col N="559" /> safety &mdash; even for the animals themselves &mdash; caused by horses being left wandering on urban green spaces, in front gardens and on roadways, one has to welcome this Bill.  As somebody who has expressed concern for the welfare of animals in the past I have no difficulty in saying I welcome many of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The one major question I have about the Bill is whether it will exclude young people from owning horses on the basis of class.  If one lives in a poor, disadvantaged area and in poor circumstances, will this Bill preclude owning a horse or any other animal?</P>
      <P>In the Cherry Orchard area young people, in anticipation of this measure, have been attempting to rent land so that they can maintain their horses in a proper and responsible way within the provision of this Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Minister said he was prepared to listen to suggestions.  In some ways I am reiterating the suggestion of the previous speaker when I give the example of the Cherry Orchard area where Dublin Corporation has developed an action plan and intends, as part of that plan, to set aside 11 or 12 acres as part of a pilot project for a horse welfare scheme.  It is hoped to get the support of FÁS, the vocational education committee, the DSPCA and various other authorities in conjunction with and under the control of the local communities to organise a similar project to train young people in the welfare and care of horses and allow them to continue to own horses in a responsible and controlled way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion to the Minister, which I hope he will respond to in detail, is that a measure which can and will have a major impact on the ownership and control of horses in the Dublin area in particular should be accompanied by Government incentives to the local authorities or direct to communities to enable young people to organise alternative projects.  The current situation is that many young people simply leave their horses wandering on open green spaces.  This is unacceptable to everyone <Col N="560" /> concerned, including the owners, many of whom I have spoken to, but it is the result of simply living in a community that does not have the resources to do otherwise.  What I am asking is that the Government which is introducing this measure should at the same time announce measures, incentives, and assistance to local authorities to establish projects such as the one in Fettercairn, or the one the community in the Cherry Orchard area is attempting, with little or no resources to set up.  The Minister and the Government should look carefully at this to see what financial or other resources can be made available to allow such projects to be managed and run by the local community. If this is not done the Bill will effectively exclude young people from owning horses on the basis of class.  That would be wrong and would discriminate against people living in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is here because, in many ways, this is an issue of equality.  I represent an area in which many young people have a minority interest in owning horses.  In many ways this Bill represents the will and wishes of the majority.  The issue of concern to everybody is the appalling cruelty we have witnessed almost on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>In that context I pay tribute to the work of the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals because without its selfless activity, the situation would be much worse.  Perhaps the Minister when responding will indicate what help and financial assistance the Government gives to the DSPCA because I understand it operates on very limited funding and very little State support. The DSPCA has led the campaign against cruelty and highlighted this issue and has had a major input in having this Bill brought before the House.  I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Many speakers will emphasise these points but a point that may not be emphasised by others, is that of maintaining the amenity value of horse <Col N="561" /> ownership in urban areas by State support in an organised and responsible fashion.  If this is to be done it will require resources, a range of incentives and giving a lead and direction to the local authorities to try to do this.  I hope the Minister will respond to this aspect of the problem in due course.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing his time with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but I am exasperated at the length of time it has taken to bring it before the House. It is a classic example of the urban-Dublin-rural divide in this House.  Urban horses have always been a problem.  I recall a poem by Evan Boland in which the wandering urban horse is referred to as a &ldquo;was horse&rdquo; somewhere in the south side of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem has exploded in the past three years and horses have become an extremely difficult, irritating and dangerous nuisance in many parts of Dublin.  I am certain, however, that this legislation or the smaller Fianna Fáil Bill could have been produced two to three years ago.  Why was there such an incredibly long delay?  Is it because many people in this House do not give a damn about Dublin and are not concerned about the fundamental issues that affect Dubliners or is it that we have such huge entrenched vested interest group who avail of the tax free concessions in the horse breeding industry in the rural horse rearing aristocracy which controls so much of our land? This problem in a minor way is like the horrendous drug problem which affects our city in a major way.  We know we desperately need legislation, facilities and treatment but we Dublin Deputies are still waiting.  Deputy Bertie Ahern who represented Dublin Central for nearly 19 years saw the problem exploding but what did he do as a senior Minister to try to cope with it?  Unfortunately, some Members seem to say, &ldquo;to hell with Dubliners and to hell with Dubliners' concerns&rdquo; and you really wonder what Dublin Deputies have to <Col N="562" /> do to get the key problems facing Dublin on the agenda.</P>
    <P>This Bill only does half the job because many of its provisions refer to making further lengthy bureaucratic by-laws by the local authorities.  The earliest the Bill could be in operation in Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Finglas and Coolock is nearly a year from now.  This saga has lasted four to five years.  Why did Dublin representatives have to wait so long for this?  It is utterly exasperating and outrageous and sometimes I think it would be better to have a regional parliament in which we would deal with our own problems in this city.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Gregory that the urban horse has brought some benefits to very deprived areas.  In my own constituency I have seen several mammies buying horses for their young people and it effectively kept them out of serious trouble with drug related crime.</P>
    <P>The upsurge of interest in horses has coincided with the decline in joy riding which previously was a desperate menace and we had to wait until 1994 for legislation to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I have seen the great affection, the great interest and the developing equestrian skills of many urban children and young people.  For all of these reasons we need to encourage those young people but to do that we need substantial funding.  There is a one or two line reference to that in the Bill &mdash; and I will return to that later &mdash; but I do not see the kind of massive support to which Deputy Gregory refers if we are to set up a number of urban stables around the city.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary and the key reason for its introduction is to deal with stray animals.  The open spaces in my constituency from Moate View Drive and Green across through Belcamp, Darndale, Fr. Collin's Park in Donaghmede, Edenmore, Springdale Road, Donaghmede Park and our new city estates have been utterly and totally wrecked and young trees have been pulled up.  The Dublin City Parks department does excellent work but its effort has been totally frustrated by the <Col N="563" /> problem of stray, uncontrolled horses. There are young people in football and camogie teams who spend an hour or an hour and a half trying to repair a pitch before the game can commence.  Likewise on the streets, many footpaths are fouled and totally wrecked as a result of this problem.  Uncontrolled horses are dangerous.  In the past six months there were three very serious incidents in my constituency where horses reared up on a young child and caused fairly serious injury.  Then we had the spikes left on our open spaces and which are a danger to athletes, footballers and so on.  While driving on one of the roads in my constituency I narrowly avoided a horse jumping across the boundary field of Darndale Park.</P>
    <P>Many of the corporation tenants in my constituency who live next door to where horses are kept face difficulties. There are one or two spectacular cases of five or six horses that are kept in urban stables.  The reality is that most urban households and gardens are not big enough for such large animals to be tethered in.  There is reference to this in Roddy Doyle's book, <i>The Commitments.</i> Urban horses going in through the front door seems funny but it is unpleasant for those who live next door.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Gregory, it was the cruelty to animals which motivated us to demand this legislation.  During Christmas at least six horses died in the Coolock ward of Dublin City.  Horses have been left out in the wind, rain, snow and heat.  They have been cruelly ridden, with perhaps many children on them, kicked and beaten.  Some horses have even been ridden to death.  The last speaker paid tribute to the DSPCA and other organisations which have tried to rescue horses.  This, most of all, is why we are debating this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is nothing in the Bill about horse sales and fairs.  Deputy Kenneally introduced a Bill on horses a few months ago, at least a page of which was devoted to sales and fairs.  The Smithfield horse fair in Dublin is causing difficulties.  It is run in <Col N="564" /> an out of control and <i>ad hoc</i> way without any permission from the local authority. This has only happened in relatively recent times; it is not an ancient tradition.  It is too cruel even to think about horses being raced on cobbled ground or behind vehicles but this happens on the first Sunday of every month in a part of this city.  The Minister should look at this area again.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attempts in the Bill to establish areas of control in local authority functional areas.  The decision to ban the sale of horses to people under 16 is merited in the circumstances.  The Minister's decision to introduce reasonable penalties for cruelly abusing horses and for refusing to implement this legislation is to be commended.  I welcome the power to seize and detain horses. There have been difficuties in organising round ups of horses in north side estates in recent years.  Section 8 will go some way towards doing something about this.  There is no reference in section 12 to how horses will be identified. Deputy Kenneally Bill's referred to freeze branding, micro chip implants and lip and hoof tattoos.  I presume the Minister will make an order or issue regulations with regard to branding but this should be detailed more clearly in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a section relating to by-laws. Having been a member of a local authority, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know the lengthy debates authorities have in order to agree by-laws.  I welcome the democratic procedures outlined in the Bill.  However, they are long drawn out and the Minister should look at this.  Section 15 refers to grants to local authorities.  I hope this will include serious and positive provision for the meritorious side of urban horse owning because this needs resources.  I welcome the provisions on the designation of control areas and the management of licences.  I welcome the fact that under section 20 not maintaining horses properly, abusing them and causing them injury or harm will constitute major offences.  Section 42 clearly establishes <Col N="565" /> that errant horse owners will be subject to criminal liability for demage.</P>
    <P>There could be a positive side with regard to horses if we establish a regime of controls.  A previous speaker referred to Fettercairn in Tallaght.  There is a plan for Gallanstown in west County Dublin.  North Coolock also comes to mind.  In all these areas there is the possibility of having urban stables.  I agree with other Deputies that we need a reasonable amount of land attached to such stables if children are not to have access to open spaces or their gardens. We need serious funding from the Government to be able to do this.  Perhaps horse owners like Mr. Charles J. Haughey, who does not live too far north of the urban horse owning area, and owners in County Meath, who do not live far from Finglas, might put some of their facilities at the disposal of young horse owners who truly want to be involved in equestrian sports.</P>
    <P>I am exasperated that this legislation has taken so long to be introduced.  I hope its passage through the Oireachtas will be quick, that local authorities will implement it and that we will provide real funding to support the positive side of urban horse owning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Bill.  There have been a number of attempts to introduce a Bill on the control of horses over the past few years.  I commend Deputy Kenneally for recently introducing such a Bill and putting forward radical and wide ranging suggestions on how to control wandering horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a perception among some Deputies that this problem exists only in Dublin and the major cities.  It exists throughout the country.  Enniscorthy is noted for the number of horses who wander through the streets, greens, housing estates and other areas of the town and its hinterland.  For many years we have fought to have such a Bill introduced. A local action committee has put forward numerous suggestions to me and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, as to how <Col N="566" /> some of these major problems can be resolved.</P>
    <P>Many road accidents have been caused by horses.  Some people have been killed and others seriously injured. Children have been kicked by wandering horses.  Pedestrians have been knocked off footpaths and roadways. Large numbers of horses are galloped through Enniscorthy to the River Slaney on a regular basis, particularly during the summer, in order to give them water.  Many horses are well looked after, particularly in rural towns. They are not undernourished and are always of the highest quality.  However, when there is a road accident, a pedestrian is knocked down or a child is kicked, nobody seems to own the horses.  It has proved to be a major difficulty for local authorities and the Garda to apprehend and bring to justice the people responsible for such accidents.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have done their best over the years to deal with the problem. However, because of lack of funds, manpower and legislation, they were never in a position to deal comprehensively with the problem of wandering horses in towns and along highways. They usually collect such horses and bring them to a pound.  However, the following morning they find that the gate of the pound has been broken or its railing has been cut and the horses have been taken out.  The horse disappear from the urban area for a period but within a week or ten days they again wander uncontrolled through the town with no one seeming to have responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>We need to provide pounds of a standard adequate to keep these horses in. Empowering local authorities to make by-laws for the control and welfare of horses is worthwhile.  However, the issue of where to keep them if they are apprehended is another day's work. Major finance could be made available to local authorities to upgrade their pounds.  However, Deputy Kenneally's suggestion of a regional pound may be a better way of dealing with the issue. Such a pound would be operated by a <Col N="567" /> number of authorities who would pool their resources and finances in order to have a high quality pound.  The Minister should consider this possibility.</P>
    <P>People who own wandering horses are often wealthy.  However, it is difficult to pinpoint who owns horses and from where they come.  There was a serious accident on the Wexford road last Christmas.  Two or three cars were badly damaged and some people were injured.  When the accident happened, there were people with the horses. However, when members of the Garda appeared on the scene, some of these people had disappeared.  Others said the horses did not belong to them but to other people of the same name.  This is a difficult problem.  Under existing legislation if I report a problem to the local authority, it will, in turn, report it to the Garda Síochána who will state that there is very little, if anything, it can do, as it does not have the necessary powers to deal with it.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting Bill.  The Minister of State said that all worthwhile and radical suggestions will be considered favourably.  That is welcome because every Deputy has experienced the problem of wild and wandering horses.  During the Dublin West by-election candidates were made aware of the concerns and fears of the local community about the damage caused to property and playing pitches.  What is of more concern is that people have been injured. This gave rise to appeals to bring forward the Bill as a matter of urgency. The problem was highlighted on a regular basis in recent months by Deputy Kenneally, by Deputy De Rossa when in Opposition and by most Deputies at some stage.  It is up to each one of us to make a contribution to ensure the best possible legislation is enacted into law to resolve it once and for all.</P>
    <P>Communities throughout the country are fed up to the teeth with this problem and the lack of control over stray and wandering horses.  I appreciate that in some areas people have traditionally kept horses and acted responsibly, but <Col N="568" /> there are also the cowboys who want to make a fast buck without having to provide land or feeding stuffs or exercising any control, as this costs money.  The horses are usually placed in the local farmer's field or allowed to roam on public land.  Unfortunately, whenever they break free, no one seems to be able to deal with the problem.  I do not want to change the traditional way of life, but the suggestions put forward by the Minister of State and Deputy Kenneally that people should have to provide land, act responsibly and so on are welcome.  In this way the Garda Síochána and local authorities should be able to identify the owners when horses are found wandering on the highways and byways.</P>
    <P>At a time when millions of sheep and hundreds of thousands of cattle are marked on the ear, back or tail &mdash; this system works reasonably well &mdash; it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility, in an era of high technology, to devise a system involving the use of microchips or tattoos to identify horses. The Minister of State said he will seriously consider introducing regulations to provide for this.  He also said he is empowering local authorities to make by-laws for the control and welfare of horses in the whole or part of its functional area requiring identification of the horse in such manner or by such means as may be specified and specifying the manner in which the horse is to be accommodated.  As there appears to be a slight contradiction, perhaps he will clarify the matter.  There is a need for regulations to ensure a proper identification system is put in place to enable the Garda Síochána and the local authorities to positively identify the owners of animals immediately when an accident occurs resulting in damage to property.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have an important role to play.  They provide such services as refuse collection and street cleaning on a daily basis and know who lives in each housing estate. Its members and staff are very much aware of what is happening.  It is vital that they are given adequate resources <Col N="569" /> to implement the provisions of this Bill and any regulations and by-laws which may be made under it.  Too often in the past regulations have been made without providing the necessary finance to allow local authorities to implement them.  The Minister of State said that he intends to adopt a hands-on approach. While this is important it is equally important that the local authorities are provided with the wherewithal to deal with this serious problem.</P>
    <P>Section 37 states that where a horse has been detained under section 36 the local authority in whose functional area the horse is detained or the superintendent of the Garda Síochána, as the case may be, may cause to be attached to the horse such identification mark or device as the authority or the superintendent sees fit.  In Enniscorthy horses rounded up by the local authority are placed in the local pound.  More often than not they are removed the following morning by their owners and once more allowed to roam the streets.  Because of the lack of a proper identification system no one knows who owns each horse or if they have been impounded previously.  This is an important section and must be rigidly enforced.</P>
    <P>There is a need for close co-operation between members of the Garda Síochána and local authority officials who have criticised each other.  There is much frustration.  It seems the Garda Síochána does not want to know whenever the local authorities contact it about the dangers posed by wandering horses on the roads as it does not believe it has any particular role to play in the matter.  There must be close co-operation between the Garda Síochána and local authority officials, which is not happening at the moment.  There is a lot of frustration and criticism of each other's roles in relation to the problem. The Garda Síochána do not want to hear from local authorities when they contact them about the danger of wandering horses on the roads because they feel they do not have the powers to deal with it or any particular role to play.  In <Col N="570" /> fairness, the Garda do not have the necessary round up facilities.</P>
    <P>For a number of years in Enniscorthy and Wexford, the IFA and the ICMSA have been involved with the local authority in rounding up animals and taking them to pounds further afield.  To a certain extent that has worked because people have to travel to other parts of the country and pay a lot of money to get their horses released from pounds. There has been a working relationship between certain bodies in the county and it has operated in other counties also.  It is only a haphazard system, however, and has never operated properly.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give powers to the Garda and the local authority to deal effectively with the problem.  I hope the Minister will take on board the ideas and amendments as the Bill progresses through the House.  The Minister should ensure, above all, that finances are available to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The traditional role of those involved with horses should be maintained under strict control.  If necessary, they should be forced to adopt a responsible attitude, failing which they should be dealt with effectively under this Bill.  They should be made to suffer the consequences whether that involves removing their horses, imposing fines or not allowing them to have horses for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which represents a major effort to deal with the problem. Deputy Kenneally, Deputy De Rossa &mdash; before he was a Minister &mdash; and others have tried to deal with it.  It was always going to be difficult, from an equality and legislative point of view, to avoid isolating one section of the community just because they had horses.  For that reason, the Bill has to deal with horses owned by all sections of the community. I hope the Minister will heed the suggestions and ideas raised in this House.  We will then have a Bill which, at last, will deal effectively and efficiently with the problems we have experienced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction, at long last, of this legislation.  I share the exasperation of my colleagues, Deputy Broughan and Deputy Gregory, at the long delay in introducing it.  Much of the delay was caused by the fact that this is an urban issue affecting working class areas, primarily in Dublin.  For that reason the legislation has not been given the priority it deserves.  Like so many other issues affecting working class areas of Dublin, there simply is not the political interest in this House to handle it with the urgency it requires.</P>
      <P>This issue should have been dealt with five years ago when proposals were made by my constituency colleague, Deputy De Rossa.  I do not see why his fine proposals could not have been adopted then.  Worthwhile proposals were also put forward by Deputy Kenneally, but for a number of reasons action on them was delayed.  It is regrettable that such delay occurred because if we had put our minds to dealing with this problem five years ago it could have been managed more easily.  The difficulty now is that the problem is out of control.  It is a huge problem in urban working class areas around the country.</P>
      <P>Since coming to the House at the end of 1992 I have found it difficult to draw attention to this issue which greatly affects my constituents.  The main difficulty has been in trying to get people to understand the nature of the problem. Rural based Deputies, and Ministers in particular, simply did not understand it. The view taken in the beginning was that this related to travellers' horses because there is a problem with them in rural areas.  There was, however, a striking failure to grasp the problem because of the kind of areas it affects.  It is regrettable that the difficulties of working class areas seem to receive such little attention and legislative priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it incredible that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is dealing with this.  That causes its own problems because it is an urban issue and there is a failure on the part of those dealing with agricultural matters to understand it.  I welcome, however, <Col N="572" /> the eventual publication of this Bill and this debate.  This is only the start.  I am concerned that even after the enactment of this legislation and its enforcement by local authorities through by-laws and regulations, much work will remain to be done.</P>
    <P>Given that we now have the legislation, the Minister should ensure that it will be enacted as quickly as possible. The Minister should continue to monitor it with local authorities as well as giving it the urgent attention it requires. If local authorities are not given the opportunity to long-finger it, we should quickly see changes.</P>
    <P>All of us who represent urban areas are aware of the problems that have been caused by wandering horses.  Our primary concern must be the extraordinary cruelty inflicted on many horses by people who do not understand the animals and who know very little about the work required to keep them properly. Many of the horses are bought in poor condition and are kept in entirely unsuitable surroundings.  Apart from the question of cruelty, there is the issue of safety.  We have had a number of accidents in Dublin and many more are waiting to happen because unsupervised horses have access to busy roads.</P>
    <P>Such horses also pose a danger to young children who are at risk when playing on open green spaces.  In addition, wandering horses have caused huge problems in communities where people are trying to improve the environment through tidy district competitions and other efforts.  People try to take a pride in their local areas but their efforts are being undermined in this way.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Junior Certificate Curriculum: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Martin on Tuesday, 28 May 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann declares its commitment to maintaining history and <Col N="573" /> geography as core subjects on the junior certificate curriculum in second level schools and calls on the Government to amend the White Paper on Education entitled, Charting our Future, to include history and geography as core subjects in the junior certificate curriculum.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the commitment in the White Paper to promote and develop in pupils a knowledge and appreciation of their social and cultural heritage and environment through the study of history and geography at junior certificate level, and in particular, welcomes the Minister's commitment to maintain the status of history and geography as core curriculum subjects in the junior cycle.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Education) </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who advises the Minister or whether she simply gets peculiar ideas but there was no sense in even thinking about abandoing history and geography as core subjects in the junior certificate.  It appears from recent announcements that second thoughts will prove best but to even contemplate downgrading two such vital subjects is unforgivable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is natural to have an interest in history. People are anxious to know from where they came and to know about their past and ancestors.  That is the reason the descendants of those who emigrated during the Famine to the USA, Australia and Canada are coming back in droves 150 years later to trace their roots and to visit the land of their <Col N="574" /> forebears.  For many of them the greatest thrill is to realise that their ancestry can be charted back for many hundreds of years and they are proud to learn all they can of their family history.</P>
    <P>Interlinked closely with history is our language, traditions, songs and way of life.  If any subject merits the title &ldquo;part of what we are&rdquo; it is history.  We can be proud of our history, our ancient civilisation and our literature.  Our place in Europe did not start with our entry to the EEC but goes back to the dawn of European civilisation.  We have a great deal to learn about it, we can be proud of it but we can also lament.  It is important to learn what happened in the past so that we can plan for the future.</P>
    <P>In the peace process on this divided island a thorough knowledge of our history is needed, not from a partition viewpoint but to enable us to understand the views and sensitivities of our fellow Irishmen and women whose political ideals and religious beliefs we do not share but with whom we want to live in harmony.</P>
    <P>History learned in a realistic, sensible fashion must help us appreciate the views and aspirations of others and to respect them.  Every country cherishes its past, is proud of its patriots and is keen to celebrate these features.  A former Labour Minister, now a journalist, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, once declared that the Irish were commemorating themselves out of existence.  I am not sure if his latest venture into politics will be worthy of commemoration when modern history is being told, but during his short time in this House he was likened to a lighthouse in a bog &mdash; bright enough but useless.  It is ironic, at a time when most lighthouses are no longer under manual control, that Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien has decided to wave the red hand of Unionism.</P>
    <P>If history is necessary, geography is no less important.  It helps us understand and appreciate our locality, our neighbourhood, our country and the world.  It helps us to appreciate our fields, rivers, mountains, lakes and seas, our flora and fauna and our clean air <Col N="575" /> and water &mdash; everything to do with our environment.</P>
    <P>A buzz phrase often used today is &ldquo;sustainable employment&rdquo;.  It depends on our appreciation of the planet &mdash; without a knowledge of geography at global level it is impossible to appreciate the fragile universe we occupy briefly and our duty to pass on this heritage to the next generation.</P>
    <P>Only when we digest the real lessons of geography can we appreciate the danger of over-exploitation of the rain forests or contributing to the thawing of the ice cap.  Although some may give lip service to these matters, we must heed them if only from a selfish viewpoint as global environmental problems anywhere in the world can have serious consequences for us all.  The events at Windscale and Chernobyl made us aware that no man is an island.</P>
    <P>As a basic need in everyday communications geography is necessary to get to know other people and to share experiences with them.  It teaches us to understand where we are and helps us to know where we are going. History tells us from where we came.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister for Education is not in the House, when she suggested that history and geography were no longer required as core subjects in the junior certificate it was obvious she did not know whether she was coming or going.  I welcome the change in thinking that has taken place in this regard and that common sense prevails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. Some years ago the television programme &ldquo;Roots&rdquo; made a resounding impact on audiences in the United States, Ireland and throughout the world.  It exemplified the need in people to know from where they came, their cultural background, how their ancestors lived and the experiences their forebears endured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are returning to Ireland from the USA, Australia, Canada and many other countries seeking their roots.  They want to know the way in <Col N="576" /> which their forebears lived and the events that took place in Ireland through the centuries.  The Famine commemoration this year is an indication of how close people hold the events of the past of their hearts.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that young people are made aware of their past at an early age. They need to know about the achievements and mistakes of the past. Through history they hear of the wonderful achievements of famous explorers, inventors and leaders of Church and State.  For many people such knowledge at an early age inspired their direction in life.  History leads to a greater understanding between communities and countries and it is inconceivable that any Government would consider reducing history to a minor place on the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Geography bridges the environmental and social sciences and is relevant to our young people as they grow up in a complex world.  Both the content and the skills acquired through geography are essential to proper education.  The White Paper stresses the importance of the following for the junior cycle: breadth, balance and relevance; an emphasis on the environment: fostering continuity between the social and environmental programme at primary level and geography at second level; our membership of the European Union; the need to encourage North-South co-operation; the need to create awareness of global issues and encouraging pupils to develop qualities of responsibility and citizenship in a national, European and global context.  Geography is a subject most suited to examining these topics and meeting the aims and objectives related to their inclusion when charting the future of education.</P>
    <P>In marginalising history and geography, this Government is perpetrating a most grievous disservice on the youth of the future.  I hope the Minister does not take the next step and request revisionists such as that Labour stalwart, the former Minister, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, and the professor who appeared on &ldquo;Question and Answers&rdquo; last Monday night, to rewrite Irish history as they would like it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> This motion deserves the support of all parties in the House as it highlights the importance of history and geography in the development of a broad-based education for our young people.</P>

Go bunúsach is rud tábhachtach é go mbeimis ag soiléiriú cad dír each a bhí i gceist ag an Aire Oideachais nuair a labhair sí ar an hábhair atá i gceist anseo.  Ní mór dom a rá chomh maith go bhfuil suim faoi leith agam sa dá ábhar atá i gceist ní amháin gur thaitn siad liom agus mé ar scoil ach creidim go bhfuil siad an-thábhachtach ó thaobh na saorántachta de agus ó thaobh na ndaoine óga atá ag fás suas inniu má tá freagracht le bheith sa saol poiblí agus i saol pearsanta an duine.</P>
      <P>I cannot help but feel the Minister in provoking this motion has acted more from an attitude of high handedness than from any sense of malice.  That is as fair as I can be to her.  I wonder whether in reality she really means to downgrade history and geography.  Has she confused the need to provide a relevant modern curriculum giving an impression that she is downgrading history and geography?  It seems to be a downgrading on the face of it.  Would it have been wiser of the Minister to explain more fully that the changes in education were not replacing history and geography but changing their organisation?  Rather than have these subjects form the main organisational bricks of education at second level, we have introduced changes similar to those at primary level.  The module idea is more relevant to education nowadays because information technology is more widely available and used increasingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be stressed that the changes relate to the integration of subjects.  The reality is that subjects are integrated by <Col N="578" /> their nature and are not simply information packages.  Our approach in the past resulted in exams such as the former intermediate certificate and the leaving certificate which were removed from reality and seemed to be just score cards shown to employers, rather than any true preparation for the life that students may want or need to lead when they leave school.</P>
    <P>We should also stress how the changes relate to the view people take of the world.  Education should be more global in nature, in light not just of information technology but also of the way in which travel has developed. Instead of that we have been using subjects in school which are very much dominated by a nation state view.  This seems to miss many of the relevant changes and details of the world in which we live.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that history has been used and abused in the past and this must be taken into account.  When any schoolchild on a tour of this House is shown the picture of Countess Markievicz, it becomes the subject of a debate as to who was the first women elected to the British House of Commons.  We talk then about the differences of interpretation between our country's history and another's.  History is important to enable us to get to the bottom of many of an scéilíocht a bhaineann le cúrsaí staire go minic.</P>
    <P>Geography has also been dominated by a nation state outlook.  Friends of mine have said their most memorable experiences of geography involved colouring maps of countries.  This seemed to be their main legacy when geography is such a broad subject.</P>

      <P>Indeed, by the time people finished schooling the information given is no longer correct. Geography cannot be allowed to slip from its place as a core subject.  It is <Col N="579" /> important to avoid conflict and differences. It is important that we all understand that we share one earth and that we have a responsibility to look at all parts of the world in the context of an integrated living environment.</P>
      <P>It is good and relevant to emphasise civics but it is an empty subject without geography as a cornerstone and history to inform people about the past and the type of future they might wish to avoid.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo ag an tráth seo &mdash; sé sin go mbeadh stair agus tíreolas mar bhun-ábhair sa churriculum don Teastas Sóisearach.  Tá sé íontach tábhachtach go mbeadh an stair agus an tíreolas ina mbun-ábhair sa Teastas sin.  Níl aon fhaitíos ormsa nach <Col N="580" /> mar sin a bheidh an scéal.  Bhí mé sa Dáil tráthnóna inné nuair a dúirt an tAire go soiléir gur mar sin a bheidh. Tá an ráiteas sin tugtha aici go neamhbhalbh ní amháin sa Teach ach taobh amuigh dí chomh maith.  Ní fheicim mórán difríochta idir an rún agus an leasú ach más é an toradh a bheidh orthu ná go mbeidh áit lárnach ag an stair agus ag an tíreolas sa Teastas Sóisearach beidh mise thar a bheith sásta.</P>
      <P>Aontaím le cainteoirí eile gur ábhair íontach tábhachtach iad an stair agus an tíreolas &mdash; gur ábhair nádúrtha iad.  Tá sé sa nádúr ag an duine suim a bheith aige sa stair.  Tá sé sa nádúr ionainn go léir eolas a bheith againn ar cad as a dtáinig muid.  Tá cuimhní cinn againn go léir ag éisteacht lenár dtuismitheoirí agus lenár sean-tuismitheoirí ag insint scéalta.  Chuireamar go léir an-suim iontu &mdash; scéalta faoi na Fianna, faoin Chraobh Rua agus faoi na cathanna a bhí ann fadó.  Teastaíonn ó gach éinne a fháil amach agus tuiscint a bheith acu ar cad a tharla san am atá thart.  Tá an rud céanna fíor maidir leis an tíreolas de.  Ó thagann an páiste ar an saol d'fhéadfá a rá go mbíonn sé ag cur eolais ar an saol. Faigheann sé eolas ón a thimpeallacht, ón seomra ina bhfuil sé ann, ón teach, ón mbaile ina bhfuil sé ina chomhnaí ann agus leathnaíonn sé amach de réir a chéile go dtí an tír, go dtí an Eoraip agus go dtí an domhan.  Is rud nádúrtha é sin agus tá sé íontach tábhachtach go mbéadh sé mar bhun-ábhar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar dhuine a chaith na blianta ag múinteoireacht caithfidh mé a rá gur ábhair iad an stair agus an tíreolas a thaitn go mór liom féin.  Nuair a thaitn íonn ábhair leis an múinteoir taitníonn siad leis an dalta chomh maith.  Tá sé iontach tábhachtach go ndéanfaí an stair a theagasc sa scoil mar go dtugann sé leagan ceart do na daltaí ar cad a tharla. Is í an eagla a bheadh ormsa ná muna mbeadh an stair á múineadh sa scoil go mbeimis ag braith ar scannáin agus ar Hollywood chun a insint dúinn cad a tharla san am atá thart.  Ón méid atá feicthe agamsa ní dóigh liom go mbíonn siad san cruinn nó ceart go minic.  Cúpla seachtain ó shin chonaic mé an scannán <Col N="581" />&ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;.  Deineadh an scannán in Éirinn ach is dóigh liom gur tháinig an t-airgead as áit éigin eile.  Níl fhios agam an stair é.  Deir na staraithe liom nach bhfuil sé cruinn nó ceart.</P>
    <P>Mar sin is dóigh liom gur chóir dúinn an stair a thabhairt do na páistí sa scoil ó théacsleabhair a scríobh na staraithe. Agus sin ráite agam táimid anseo sa Deisceart agus gan an leagan céanna den stair againn anseo is a bhíonn acu sa Tuaisceart.  Nílimid ag léamh as na leabhair chéanna.  Níl an hymn-sheet céanna againn chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an stair.  B'fhéidir gur rud maith a bheadh ann dá bh'fhéadfadh na staraithe anseo agus na staraithe i dTuaisceart na hÉireann teacht le chéile agus leagan stair aontaithe a chur amach.</P>
    <P>There should be a joint approach by our many academics and historians in the South &mdash; one well-known and famous historian is a Member of the Seanad &mdash; to try to arrive at an agreed version of our history.  That is not beyond the bounds of possibility.</P>
    <P>History can be equated with a perspective on the past, how our ancestors lived and their lifestyles.  In this context, the Céide Fields, Dún Aengus and Newgrange come to mind.  Students first encounter history at primary level but the curriculum is mainly devoted to Irish, English and Maths.  It follows that they have little background in history coming into the secondary sector.</P>
    <P>Every study should have a grounding in history, as part of the junior certificate course, because each pupil will get information on their local areas.  In one section of the course on social change in the 20th century the student studies the process of change in their own district, particularly in relation to housing, work, agriculture, leisure, transport and a wide range of areas of interest.  In the leaving certificate, 20 per cent of the marks are allocated to a research project.  Many students concentrate on local history.  In my own school, Pobal Scoil Gaoth Dóbhair, very good research projects have been done on Lord Leitrim, Canon James McFadden, known as the patriot <Col N="582" /> priest of Gweedore, and old cemeteries and Churches of both denominations. Other topics have included Pat O'Donnell &mdash; he may not be known to Members &mdash; the Invincible who followed James Carey to South Africa.  He is remembered in song and verse in my part of the country, Aistear Gaoth Dóbhair and the Aranmore drowning tragedy.  It would be a shame to deprive the student of all this at the stroke of a pen.</P>
    <P>In the new junior certificate course introduced in 1992 the emphasis is on an overall picture of world history, spread over a three-year course.  In the old intermediate certificate course the emphasis was restricted to a particular period.  We now have a general course where first year covers Irish history, ancient civilisations such as those of Rome, Greece and Egypt, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, utilising archaeology to trace and examine those influences which shape our lives today.</P>
    <P>In the second year the emphasis is on the major social and political changes which have taken place over the century &mdash; the reformation, plantations and the political, industrial and agricultural revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. In the third year modern history is studied up to the present day.  Under this broad cover the student gets a full picture of world history, utilising the most modern textbooks available.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the study of history is not as it has been &mdash; a matter of learning dates and battles by rote &mdash; rather it assists us to understand today's complicated world, the colonisation and the decolonisation of South Africa and the system of apartheid, and in our own country the foundation of the State, partition, etc. and the process of unification of Europe since the end of the Second World War.  It is interesting that many of the protagonists in that conflict are now members of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The study of history bestows particular skills on students &mdash; the ability to read and fully research a project and to vertify the relevant source materials. Evaluation and analytical abilities are <Col N="583" /> also improved.  It would be a mistake if they did not have the opportunity to study it as a core subject in the junior certificate.  I have no doubt from what the Minister said last night and from her statements outside the House that it will continue to be a core subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's most recent commitment on this subject given at the NCCA meeting.  She asked the National Council for Curriculum Assessment to examine the overall development of the curriculum and to keep in mind her desire to retain history and geography as core subjects.  I deliberately sought out that information because I had a motion tabled for the Adjournment a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>History is central to what we are.  I do not believe there is enough in the history books.  Historians, being mainly men &mdash; I hope this will change in the near future &mdash; usually deal with the grand events.  They seldom deal with social history, the lives of ordinary people, which is as important to the development of society as the grand events.  They may not have as dramatic and as sudden an effect but they do have an effect.</P>
      <P>I shared the widespread public concern at reports that history was due to be dropped from the junior curriculum. It would be an enormous loss and we cannot allow it to happen.  I was concerned that young people would be educated in an historical vacuum without the social and cultural reference points which copperfasten our identity.  A knowledge of what we were and where we came from has made us what we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few months ago we learnt of the thousands of people who were adopted either outside the country or within and whose files had just been opened.  We learnt of the heartbreak of those people who sought to find out who they were, where they came from and their background. That was all about seeking out one's personal history.  The individual history is just as important as time and place and as valid to the individual as to <Col N="584" /> a nation.  We should learn a lesson from that.  Individuals seeking out their history want to know who they are and where they have come from.  The search may not be an in-depth one for all of us but we all demand to know it.</P>
    <P>Knowledge of the past is the key to unlocking the puzzles of the future.  It enables us to understand &mdash; and at times of conflict understanding is important &mdash; and, perhaps, resolve conflicts.  It gives an edge to our analysis of social, economics and political issues.  Predictably, since this issue first surfaced some months ago, legitimate concerns about the future of our children's education have been hijacked by people who would suffer most from the teaching of a true and open history.  During the debate in the media, I read an astounding comment to the effect that the Minister for Education was abolishing history &mdash; Pol Pot came to mind &mdash; because teaching history makes good little Fianna Fáilers while teaching social studies makes good little Labour Party members.  That is nonsense.  A thorough knowledge of recent history would ensure that Fianna Fáil, in particular, would remain on the Opposition Benches for the foreseeable future. After all, who fears to speak of 1994?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever devised that bizarre theory did not want to understand the crucial relationship between historical and social development. History and social studies are interdependent and should be taught in conjunction with one another.  In that regard, I welcome the development of the new civics programme which will include elements of history and geography. Having taken part in a civics programme in my constituency &mdash; perhaps not as developed as this one &mdash; I understand how history could get lost in a civics programme.  For example, I spoke to that civics class about women in politics and society and linked the first, second and third wave of the feminist movement to the suffragettes and the celtic <Col N="585" /> past.  While it is relevant and essential to include those elements, that is not the proper way to teach history.  That is why a civics programme, containing an element of history and geography, must never take the place of history or geography as core subjects.  Unless one knows the connections, civics will have little value other than when referring to the present.</P>
      <P>While I recognise the potential value of the CSPE.  I am anxious that history, in particular, should be maintained as a separate subject in its own right rather than as a component of another multidisciplinary syllabus.  There appears to be an assumption in some circles that teaching history breeds nationalism.  On the contrary, an objective teaching of history teaches us to reject narrow dogma.  It is not a coincidence that many countries, such as Germany, which have suffered most as a result of nationalism insist on their history being taught, understood and appreciated.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the dangers of overloading the syllabus and placing extra pressure on students already anticipating a gruelling points race, many of us are familiar with that process at present. Difficult choices will have to be made by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  I understand the Minister is currently taking advice on whether all schools should teach an identical compulsory core of subjects and whether compulsory subjects should consist of conventional full courses or broken up into modules or shorter courses, which would benefit a particular group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>History and geography are compulsory in secondary schools but not in vocational or community schools. However, the fact that the majority of them teach those subjects as core subjects must stand for something.  What about the adage, if it is not broken why fix it?  Given the centrality of history to a rounded education, it should be made compulsory in both vocational and community schools for students up to a certain age.  When students have to make decisions about their future education <Col N="586" /> and must drop certain subjects, one would hope that, having received a rounded education up to then, they would make a correct decision.</P>
    <P>The debate should not focus on scaling down the teaching of history, but on expanding it.  I would prefer if history took a much broader sweep in our text books.  We should also focus on devising new teaching methods which would make the subject relevant to a new generation. I have no doubt the Minister and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will devise an innovative approach, not only to the teaching of history but to its context in the curriculum in general.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's latest statement. She wants the curriculum development group to ensure that history and geography remain core subjects.</P>

      <P>This is a useful and timely debate.  We do not often have an opportunity to discuss historical writing and the place of history in society in general.  It may have been an ill wind that gave me an opportunity to contribute to this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy waits long enough he will hear my views on the subject.  While we can learn from the past, we cannot live in the past.  It is important that historical writing is fully understood and that we benefit from it. Interest in historical matters has increased significantly at local and national level.  We owe a great deal to modern historians for their energy and stamina and for their research.  The quality of historical writing has, by and large, improved and has diverted from the triumphalism of the past.  Henry Ford once said that history is more or less bunk.  He knew more about making cars, particularly black ones, than about historical writing.  An understanding of the past is necessary for the progression of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> A good historical book can change one's life.  Following the Michael Davitt memorial lecture in Foxford, I reread his biography, a most exciting and stirring adventure.  A book that effected a fundamental and seminal change in my life was James Connolly's &ldquo;Labour in Irish History&rdquo; and a biography by Emmet Larkin of James Larkin.  Some people may say those books pointed me in only one direction but I have no regrets about that, I would do it all again.  I learned a great deal from my three heroes, Davitt, Connolly and Larkin. While some other heroes have feet of clay, for me, those three remain on the pedestal.</P>
    <P>It is often said that victors write their own history.  There are many examples of those who win a liberation or civil war controlling education and the economy and writing books on the matter. In the first flush of victory and self-determination in Ireland a spate of books, such as &ldquo;Limerick's Fighting Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cork's Fighting Story&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clare's Fighting Story&rdquo; were written, many of which had nothing to do with history.  They dealt more with mythology and propaganda than with history. Our school history leaves much to be desired.  Any ideology, communism, capitalism or nationalism&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Or socialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;must serve the people and not the other way round.  If people are made to serve an ideology, that society will collapse and we have had examples of this in Eastern Europe and nearer home.  In the past, history was often used for political purposes and frequently masqueraded as propaganda and mythology.  Germany under fascism is a typical example.  All too often in the past we laughed at the British way of life and their exalted respect for the empire, jingoism, the Royal Family and other ancient institutions. However, we had no grounds for laughing at anybody because our history was <Col N="588" /> often based on very questionable, spurious and bogus assertions.  It had a sectarian slant to it and, in the first three or four decades after independence, was heavily influenced by the teachings of one Church, the Roman Catholic Church.</P>
      <P>History books were often one-sided and gave a very distorted view of our past.  From reading them one would get the impression that the Irish were a chosen people, with a unique combination of race and religion.  All too often we were led to believe that our history was in some way unique, but it is not much different from that of any other country.  Most ordinary people, including the people of Britain who suffered the horrors of the industrial revolution, have been oppressed.  We should not believe that as a people we were hard done by because we were no more hard done by than the people of Burma, India or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In the past we adopted a very distorted attitude towards the British.  We were ruled and misruled by the British for many hundreds of years.  Britain had an empire on which it was said that the sun never set and and it was inevitable that it would rule Ireland as a small country with a small population. However, the British influence on this country was not entirely bad.  We owe much to them in that they taught us the English language, a most valuable asset, democracy and liberal ethics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A battle has been going on in recent times between historians and so-called revisionists but all history must be revised in light of the changing world. With developments in technology, life has been made easier for historians.  It would be a very bad historian who did not question the writing of history. Some historical work is good, well written, well researched and honest and other work masquarading as history is shoddy, badly researched and badly written.  In badly written history, which would be called academic history, there are many clichés and jargon which <Col N="589" /> makes it impossible to read.  Good history should be well written and readable and should tell a story.</P>
    <P>I agree with earlier speakers in regard to Northern Ireland.  There should be a common history of what happened in Ireland, particularly Northern Ireland, among Roman Catholics, Protestants and people of no religion.  It has been a curse of Northern society that education is divided.  There is no reason young people's minds should be poisoned by distorted versions of what took place in the past.  A wrong view of life is inculcated upon them.  We can learn from Europe in that respect.  The struggles of the ordinary people in Europe against fascism and the coming together of Germany and France after fighting two bloody wars in this century to form a European union are very good examples of how people can put the past behind them.</P>
    <P>It is important that a very broad attitude to history be adopted in schools so that children have a view of all mankind and can mix with people of different backgrounds, religions and colours. That is the way forward, rather than teaching history in a narrow, dogmatic, sectarian way.  In regard to adult education, we have a very good opportunity to help our unemployed and those who wish to study.  Those people should have an opportunity to study not merely vocational education but subjects such as literature and poetry and, above all, local history, and to do so in an environment that is free from rancour and bitterness.  That would benefit them greatly in that it would encourage them to have more self-confidence and self-esteem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has been misquoted in this debate.  It was never her intention to abolish history.  That is farcical and nonsense.  Nobody in their right mind would say that history should be abolished.  It would be ridiculous to abolish our heritage.  If Deputy Martin was listening he might learn something from this debate.  The Minister, who is a teacher, is a colleague of mine in the Labour movement and she would not <Col N="590" /> try to abolish history.  She adopts an open, democratic attitude to the teaching of history in schools.  I was alarmed at press reports about the Minister's proposals, but the media created much hype and speculation and distorted the true position.  The Minister has no intention of abolishing history.</P>

      <P>As I said at the start of my contribution, it is an ill wind that does not blow some good.  I welcome this debate because one should not ignore history. In the past a one-sided attitude was adopted to history and many people had a distorted and sectarian view of it. However, as people travel the world their attitudes change.  This debate will have far-reaching benefits for schools, universities and colleges throughout Ireland.</P>

      <P>I support the motion that Dáil Éireann declares its commitment to maintaining history and geography as core subjects on the junior certificate curriculum in second level schools and calls on the Government to amend the White Paper on Education, entitled Charting our Future, to include history and geography as core subjects in the junior certificate curriculum.  Having listened to Deputy Kemmy, one would think that we want to change our past.  History is very important.  The Deputy spoke about the dogmatic <Col N="591" /> approach adopted to history in the past. The Irish could be compared with the French whose history is similar to ours. They very much cherish their history and it is one of their core subjects.  Is it wrong to cite the names of Tone and Pearse, who may have been of different religions but who were great patriots of the past and are part of our great tradition and history?  We cannot ignore our past and people such as those I mentioned, and that is what we would be doing by getting rid of our history.</P>
      <P>It showed great foresight on the part of Deputy Martin to bring this motion before the House and get the support of the Front Bench in doing so.  Many schools were saddened by the Minister's proposal and I received a large volume of correspondence on the matter.  We are trying to prevent the people over there from getting rid of everything that is good.  The Minister for Education and the Government will rue the day she suggested this change.  As we near the end of the school year this is an appropriate time to give marks to the head girl.  Niamh is eager to learn, works hard at her books and is always punctual and polite.  Her weakest subject is history, which she will have to repeat.  As head girl Niamh must try harder and work on her leadership responsibilities.</P>

      <P>During the year the Minister negotiated agreements with representatives of the teachers' unions.  She can hardly be blamed for the failure of those representatives to recommend their own agreement but on the next occasion she should explain, communicate and sell her proposals direct to the teachers. Part of the communiqué sent by the union to its members was pathetic.</P>
      <P>The main issue facing the Department is school inspection.  It is still not clear who will carry out these inspections. The emphasis will be on schools and not on teachers.  The biggest problem facing the boards of management, parents, pupils and, in particular, the majority of teachers is non-performing teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school system seems to be unique in that promotion below principal level is on the basis of seniority only.  Why does the Department of Education not reward merit?  Does it know what merit is?  Pupils deserve the best teachers and their parents expect it.  The Minister should be able to introduce promotion on merit while at the same time ease non-performing teachers out of the system. These teachers must be unhappy in the system and they could use their skills to better effect elsewhere.  The Minister should identify this problem <Col N="593" /> and put corrective measures in place. After all, not all teachers are gifted or dedicated.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's replies to these points.</P>
    <P>Until recently geography was taught through Irish in many primary and secondary schools.  This subject is now taught in English and towns are no longer known by their Irish titles.  This creates some confusion and I would like to see a return to the past where towns were referred to in Irish, for example, Mitchelstown was known as Baile an Mhisteánaigh and Fermoy was known as Mainistir Fhearr Muighe.  Geography is a very important subject and it must be taught in the proper way.</P>
    <P>History deals with our past.  A bank manager always looks at the past of a person who asks for a loan.  We are measured on the basis of our history.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil regards history and geography as core subjects. History gives us a fundamental and basic knowledge of who we are.  We are accused of looking only at the past but it is important to realise that we have to look back if we want to go forward.  It is only in looking back that we can begin to reconcile ourselves with our past and look forward to a prosperous and cohesive future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a student of history and <Col N="594" /> politics in UCD I read Brian Farrell's text book &ldquo;The Parliamentary Tradition&rdquo; in which he stated that the history of yesterday is the politics of today and the politics of today is the history of tomorrow.  If we disregard our history, future politicians will be confused to say the least.  I am not being facetious when I say we need the continuity provided by history.  Deputy Kemmy referred to his love of history and I am aware of his interest in this subject but he was somewhat disingenuous and selective in his comments.  He referred to James Connolly, Jim Larkin and Michael Davitt, three very important people in our history. I share his interest in them. Deputy Kathleen Lynch said we should be careful about nationalism, a concept which she tried to portray as dangerous. I am sure Deputy Kemmy will agree that James Connolly and Jim Larkin were not only great Labour people but, together with Michael Davitt, were great nationalists.  What is dangerous is not a belief in nationalism but being selective in what one believes.</P>
    <P>This is what has brought about revisionism, a concept which attempts to dilute and distort history. Over the past 20 years some journalists have been afraid to face up to our strongly held but divergent beliefs.  It is important that we as a society regard these divergent beliefs as a challenge and an opportunity to bring about cohesion and not division.  Even though revisionism seems to be going out of fashion I am tired of listening to these individuals apologising for being Irish or for those people who take a nationalist view in the broadest sense of that term.  This says more about them than the society in which they live. Seán MacBride put it very well when he said these kinds of apologists often appear in post-colonial societies.  He also referred to the slave mentality in these societies.  The whole concept of democracy, of understanding what our history is about, necessitates the opportunity not only to be aware of different <Col N="595" /> views but to acknowledge and recognise that there is another view from one's own.  After all, true democracy does not mean there has to be a uniform view. The old adage stands: How do we know where we are going if we do not know from where we have come?  In psychology the quest for self-knowledge is recognised.  Our history, as a country and a nation, must play a very big part in gaining self-knowledge, an understanding of our community and why it works the way it does.  The sense of collectiveness and belonging is a very fundamental need in each person's psyche. We cannot fully appreciate our literature, music or art without a knowledge of its historical context.</P>
    <P>How is it possible to really enjoy a dolmen over 4,000 years old, a wedge tomb or any of the other archaeological delights of The Burren without having some conception of their history, however sketchy?  How is it possible to truly appreciate any of our national heritage sites without being aware of their historical significance?  It is like trying to stage Hamlet without the prince.</P>
    <P>As a society we should stand condemned if our young people know less about themselves than many of the tourists who visit our shores.  Like my colleague, Deputy Martin, I am very disappointed that there was on reference to history or geography as core subjects in the White Paper whereas there was very definitely in the Green Paper which has disappeared mysteriously under the present administration and Minister for Education.  Again, there is no reference to arts, drama and music or to any of those aspects of what should be a general education to develop the whole person or an holistic approach to our overall education system.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago when the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, substituted for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who was in Hollywood, I tabled a parliamentary question asking how the <Col N="596" /> Government or Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht wished to ensure that younger people would have further knowledge of and interest in our heritage. In the very limited reply there was not one reference to the importance of history.  Even at this late stage I hope the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will follow the example of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, who appears to have a certain penchant nowadays for winging it alone, and at least condemn what Fianna Fáil believes to be a most destructive proposal, the attempt to eliminate young people's chance of learning history at school.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Martin on having initiated this debate and all those who have had the courage, through the press, to voice their rejection of the Minister's plans for history.  It is better that the Minister loses face by backtracking on her initially stated views on history as a core subject in the junior cycle curriculum rather than a generation of young people at school being brutally cut off from what is rightly their proud heritage which they have an inalienable right to explore.  However subtly portrayed, State paternalism should not be allowed to dictate the pace.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House, I should like to share my time with Deputy Quill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that, at long last we are discussing educational issues that have nothing to do with structures but with the content of what children are taught at school.  I congratulate Deputy Martin on having tabled this motion &mdash; which should not have been necessary &mdash; but the fact is that, once again, the Minister for Education dipped her fingers in the waters of public opinion, found the temperature far too high, and had to roll back on a proposal in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> It was very interesting to hear the Minister say she had now told the NCCA that the study of history and geography will be part of the core junior cycle curriculum.  As Deputy Kemmy said, there is no mention in the White Paper of history and geography as core subjects within the junior certificate curriculum. In addition, in answer to a parliamentary question tabled by my party on 7 May, the position appeared to be very much the same.  Obviously, the Minister was being subjected to some pressure, leading to a little muddying of the waters, but the White Paper says that, for the purposes of certification, the following specific requirements will be necessary: the programme for all students at junior cycle will include a core of Irish, English, mathematics, a science or technological subject and at least three further subjects from a wide range of full and short courses; all students should have access to the study of a modern European language &mdash; with which I am delighted &mdash; and to a recognised full course in at least one creative or performing arts form.  While all that is very laudable there is no mention of the study of history and geography or, more specifically, to their being core subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply left us even further confused.  Having said more or less the same as stated in the White Paper in relation to the study of three basic subjects and so on, she continued to say she did not want to overload the curriculum &mdash; none of us does &mdash; but that a number of critical questions needed to be addressed, including whether the same set of subjects should be compulsory for students in all types of schools.  Should students of varying abilities be required to take the same set of compulsory subjects?  Should compulsory subjects consist of a variety of full or short courses and how much flexibility should remain with schools?  Yet again, there was no mention of history and geography; in fact one would not <Col N="598" /> know where one stood with regard to them.</P>
    <P>What many teachers took from those comments was that, in some way, one could include history and geography as a module along the way, that one could touch on one of these subjects, dip in and out, gain some sketchy information or knowledge.</P>
    <P>We have heard very eloquent reasoning by Members from all sides of the House for the inclusion of history and geography as core subjects.  Indeed, if teachers, students and others concerned with teaching history and geography at that level in schools had not engaged in a very effective campaign we would not have had the Minister's welcome about-face here last evening.</P>
    <P>Many people have stated very forcefully that they want to see history in particular regarded as a core subject and have given very many good reasons for so advocating.  Of course, we cannot consider history merely as a subject about wars, revolutions and battles but as pertaining also to the very basic fabric of our society.  I would go even further on the matter of teaching of history &mdash; perhaps divulging my age in so doing &mdash; I was one of those victims of Carty's History of Ireland which I studied for the intermediate certificate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which gave an outrageously biased view of Irish history. We have come a long way since then, but I should like to go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended a very interesting conference on education recently in the Netherlands at which the subject of history was discussed.  It may interest the gentlemen of this House to know that a core subject was introduced in that country, without any great support from many teachers, on women's history which portrayed a much better view of their social fabric and history, widening their scope and knowledge to the extent <Col N="599" /> that, when it was suggested that this subject be dropped, there was an outcry; they moved from an initial negative response to a very positive one.  That is the type of development I should like see take place with regard to history here.  Deputy McGinley spoke eloquently as Ghaeilge and proposed the adoption of a joint approach, North and South, to teaching history and stated how that would greatly contribute to understanding between the two communities. At a later stage he cited famous people in history, but it was regrettable that he could not name a woman among them.  I am sure that was not intentional, but his attitude stems from the manner in which he was taught.</P>
    <P>Most people referred to history and some also referred to geography as core subjects.  The Geographical Society of Ireland successfully lobbied to maintain geography as a core subject.  It argues that a knowledge of one's land, landscape and the broader global context in which we live is an essential part of educational formation, and that is very true.</P>
    <P>I have two children, both in secondary school, one sitting the junior certificate next week and the other in fifth year.  Both have benefited greatly from studying geography and history.  I would not wish young people to be at the loss of the knowledge of those subjects.  I am pleased they will remain as core subjects, not because of the views of the Minister who has sought to rewrite recent history and to downgrade those subjects, but because of pressure that has been exerted.  It is important that we make it clear that those two subjects remain as core subjects for the junior certificate.</P>

      <P>It is refreshing to have this type of discussion on education.  I commend Deputy Martin for creating the conditions under which that has been made possible.  We have spent countless hours recently talking about education <Col N="600" /> in terms of ownership, control and structures, but we have not spent enough time talking about what and how we teach our young people.  It is important that we should have a philosophy and vision of education.  Whatever else we lacked, we have always had a good system of education, that stands up well in comparison with education systems in other developed countries, and that is widely acknowledged.</P>
      <P>There is great pressure on our system to meet new demands that appear to come on-stream every day, partly arising from the social problems in society. It is fundamental that in meeting those demands we would not take any step or measure that would downgrade or in any way dismantle our fine system of education.  I regard a knowledge of history and geography as being of core importance to any young citizen in this or any succeeding generation.  To seek to tamper with subjects as fundamental to self-knowledge, self-worth, self-respect and self-esteem as history and as fundamental to a knowledge of one's natural and physical environment as geography, highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of education in shaping a young person and a community.  We should seek to upgrade the teaching of both in terms of methodology and content.  There has been some bad teaching of history in the past and some bad practice on the part of history teachers, of whom I was one until nine years ago.  Given the challenges facing young people in this age of advanced technology, mechanisation and consumerism, the best weapon we can give them is a good education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is a discipline and I know of none that is better than the discipline of history well taught.  What is the methodology of teaching history and what does history do for people?  It teaches them to evaluate facts, to separate them from opinions and fiction and to make a judgment on what is true and what is false.  Is that not one of the most <Col N="601" /> important gifts?  I do not have children, but if I had there is nothing more I would want to give them than the ability to be able to separate what is true from what is false.  Those of us in politics know what can happen with the big lie and the soundbite.  What better way can we equip young people to be able to make judgments than to give them a good grounding in history?  Anybody who has respect for people would consider the thought of downgrading history unthinkable.</P>
    <P>What of geography?  It is the lesson most people need to be able to read maps, the map of life and have a knowledge of and respect for their natural environment.  It is unthinkable that geography or history would be downgraded in any respected system of education. I would love to talk for an hour on this motion, but time does not permit that.  The key message I send to the Minister is not to dismantle our decent system of education.  We must build on and improve it.</P>
    <P>On the eve of the Northern elections, the philosophy of Wolfe Tone, if taught properly, is relevant &mdash; what matter if at different shrines we pray unto one God; what matter if at different times our fathers won the sod?  Is that not the philosophy we should pass on to young people and substitute the common name of Irishman for Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter?  That is our history, the one we should acknowledge in our every day thinking, that should shape our political decisions and that we should pass on to the next generation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of important decisions were made by the Minister for Education on the status of history and geography.  The status of history and geography will not change &mdash; they will remain part of the core curriculum at junior cycle.  The status of history and geography has been enhanced by a number of measures <Col N="602" /> implemented by the Minister.  They include the introduction of civic, social and political educational, CSPE, as a compulsory examinable core curriculum subject for all students at junior cycle from September 1997.  CSPE has obvious links with history and geography. One of the four units of CSPE &mdash; our local community &mdash; allows for common areas of study with history and geography through the study of how that community develops over time, an analysis of local development issues and how the community reacts to these issues.  This will give the breadth, balance, relevance and coherence enunciated in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme is available to all second level pupils in all schools since 1994.  It is expected that almost 29,000 pupils in 558 schools, 74 per cent of all schools, will follow the transition year programme in the next school year.  The important role of history and geography in the transition year programme is highlighted in both the transition year guidelines and resource materials published by the Department of Education.  It should be noted that where transition year participants subsequently elect to take history or geography at leaving certificate level, these students will have had an opportunity to study either or both subjects for six years at second level in addition to six years at primary level.  The Evaluation of the Transition Year Programme (1994-1995), carried out by the inspectorate of the Department of Education, noted that many schools were providing pupils with as wide a range of learning experiences as possible.  Excellent activity based learning projects involving history and geography were very much in evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development and expansion of the European studies programme, a cross curricular programme involving history and geography, has brought not only innovative approaches to teaching and learning but these approaches have <Col N="603" /> been transferred into the teaching programmes of history and geography right across the second level curriculum.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to advise her as a matter of urgency on how best to meet the competing demands of a very wide range of subjects for inclusion in the core curriculum at junior cycle level. There are the conflicting requirements of a broad and balanced curriculum and the need to avoid overcrowding it.  In addition, some flexibility must be left to schools to develop their own curriculum in accordance with their own perceived needs and requirements.  The NCCA, in making its recommendations, has been told that the study of history and geography is to be part of the core junior cycle curriculum.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the contradiction between the contributions of some of the opposition Deputies to this debate. On the one hand there was proper reference to the need to adapt the curriculum to meet the needs of the 21st century. On the other hand there was a reference to the importance of a basic curriculum making a distinction between learning and technical knowledge. This seems to be a reversion to late 19th century and some 20th century thinking where a distinction was created between academic and vocational-technical education.</P>

      <P>This is not the way that many, if not most, of the OECD and other developed countries are developing their education system.  The impact of new technology, globalisation of the labour markets and the changing nature of work organisations have led to an increased need for multiskilling and for young people to be well educated in the broadest sense, to be adaptable self-starters, problem solvers, able to adapt <Col N="604" /> to change and be familiar with new technologies.  The thrust of the curriculum reforms in the White Paper is to ensure that 90 per cent of 18-year-olds will complete full second level education by the year 2,000 through the provision of an effective foundation of general education with a strengthened and expanded vocational orientation. The EU's White Paper on Education and Training has, among its five major objectives the encouragement of the acquisition of new knowledge, the combating of exclusion, including the need to promote social integration, and enhancement of employability and personal fulfilment for all our citizens.</P>
      <P>Ireland's highly respected educational system is quite similar to that of most other countries in the Western World. It must bring on board the use of new technologies such as multimedia and the Internet which provide educationalists with new tools for teaching almost every new object.</P>
      <P>Knowledge is seen as a vital component in maintaining and enhancing a country's competitiveness.  The new technologies must be used critically and integrated with the learning process right across the curriculum from history to physics and from geography to mathematics, construction studies and business. The study of history and geography provides opportunities for pupils to develop the skills of researching, locating, storing and retrieving information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This board general education system with a strong vocational orientation should and will continue.  The curriculum must evolve.  History and geography are evolving and must evolve.  The syllabus for history and geography at leaving certificate level are under revision at present.  I am confident that with all the various changes under way and the decision to maintain the status of history and geography in the junior cycle core curriculum, the position of history and geography in the broader <Col N="605" /> second level curriculum will be copper-fastened and expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing Deputy Martin's time and I appreciate his giving me that opportunity.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear, from the observations of the Minister of State and the earlier statement by the Minister, that there appears to be a thaw in Government thinking on this subject.  I commend our spokesman on putting forward this motion because it contributed to the thaw in the past week on the place of history and geography in our school curriculum.</P>
      <P>There are a few short points I would like to make.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Quill quote the famous words of Thomas Davis in relation to the different shrines at which we worship, because it has always seemed that a solid foundation in our national history will contribute to greater rather than lesser national reconciliation.  The view which was taken at the outbreak of the horrific Troubles in Northern Ireland some years ago, that we must suppress our history to promote reconciliation, was misplaced.  With the passage of time it is clear that a deeper understanding of the different traditions and the varied cultures that make up this island contributes in no small way to the securing of that peace which all of us in this House wish to see in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has ignored the enormous revolution in Irish historical and geographical scholarship in the past two decades.  There has been an explosion both in historical and geographical scholarship in this country and on subjects relating to it in the past few decades.  Plainly the fruits of this research should be made available to children in schools, yet this Minister apparently contemplated a step which would deprive the younger generation of the fruits of that scholarship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not want to dwell exclusively on the national dimension of this aspect. <Col N="606" /> There is a very important European dimension.  If, as all our educational research nowadays suggests, we must lay greater emphasis on the place of modern languages in our curriculum, an essential foundation for the study of modern languages is, of course, a historical and geographical appreciation of the countries to which those languages relate.  I cannot see how we can deepen the essential knowledge of the younger generation in continental languages, in languages generally, without instilling a solid knowledge of the historical conditions in the countries which speak those languages and the geographical facts relating to them.</P>
    <P>The humanities have a very important part to play in our educational curriculum, and one reason for the much vaunted excellence of the Irish educational system is the emphasis it places on the humanities.  There has been a great decline in the study of Greek and Latin in the secondary school curriculum in recent years.  That makes it all the more important that through the teaching of history and geography the secondary school student and, indeed, the graduate of our educational system generally has a clear appreciation of where we come from and where we belong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  The tabling of a Private Member's motion was the final stimulus in changing the Minister's mind.  The first time the Minister used the term &ldquo;core curriculum&rdquo; in the context of history and geography was last Saturday in her speech to the Historical Association of Ireland.  Until then, even in replies to parliamentary questions tabled as early as February last, the Minister made no mention of history and geography as core curriculum subjects and avoided making any commitment in that regard.  In May, when further questions were asked by Deputy Keogh, myself and others, we were <Col N="607" /> given similar, evasive replies.  At no stage did the Minister use the term &ldquo;core curriculum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The debate so far has been extremely interesting, but the Minister's contribution was extraordinary.  Some Government speakers attempted to give the impression that our worries and fears were misplaced, that there was exaggeration and propaganda on the part of the Opposition, or that some teachers were reacting hysterically.  I ask Government backbenchers to read the White Paper on Education and the Green Paper entitled &ldquo;Towards a Changing World&rdquo;.  There is a fundamental difference in the treatment of history and geography in the Green Paper as opposed to the White Paper.  Not only are history and geography not mentioned as core subjects in the White Paper, they are not referred to.  There has been a clear attempt, from the time of publication of the Green Paper and since the Minister came to power, to downgrade the status of history and geography.  It was, therefore, necessary to put a Private Members' motion before the House to facilitate Members on all sides, because there are Members in the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Democratic Left who were appalled at the content of the White Paper and the Minister's direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let no one be under any misunderstanding, there was a clear policy to downgrade the status of history and geography as core subjects of the curriculum. It has taken about five months for the Minister to reverse that policy. It is extremely ungenerous of her not to support our motion but to table an amendment that is fundamentally &mdash; I regret having to say this &mdash; dishonest in its content.  The amendment tabled by the Minister suggests there is a &ldquo;commitment in the White Paper to promote and develop in pupils a knowledge and appreciation of their social and cultural heritage and environment through the <Col N="608" /> study of history and geography at junior certificate level&rdquo;... There is no such commitment in the White Paper and that is why I cannot vote for this amendment. It is dishonest.  It would be far better if the Minister was honest and having listened to the debate, read the letters to the newspapers and analysed the campaign, accepted my motion to amend the White Paper, acknowledging the broad wish to the Irish people to retain history and geography as core subjects in the junior certificate curriculum. It would have been better if she had agreed to amend the White Paper, which is the critical point of this debate. On the Order of Business this morning I asked the Taoiseach to clarify the status of a Government White Paper.  It was always my understanding that a White Paper contained Government decisions, that a Green Paper was a discussion document and that, following the Green Paper, there were various consultations, contributions and submissions before the White Paper was produced which contains decisions which are implemented.  That is why we specifically tabled a motion which seeks to amend the White Paper.  As I said last evening, the White Paper states on page 48: &ldquo;The programme for all students at junior cycle would include a core of Irish, English, Mathematics...&rdquo; and we want it amended to include history and geography.  It is as simple and straightforward as that.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the Minister's reversal of policy, nonetheless there is still ambiguity and serious concern, as Deputy Keogh outlined, that what we are now looking at is perhaps an attempt to introduce short courses or modules in history and geography, that we may end up with a new definition of a core curriculum and that history and geography will still be downgraded.  I respecfully suggest to the Minister and her advisers to heed the contributions from all sides of the House and to implement honestly the spirit of the <Col N="609" /> debate.  Even if the Government wins the vote I urge her to be honourable and accept the declared wishes as articulated by Members.</P>
    <P>It seems incredible that the Minister has returned yet again to the NCCA who advised the Minister twice that history and geography should be core subjects of the curriculum.  The Minister said she is asking it as a matter of urgency to revise the junior certificate curriculum, but that work has already been done.  We know the NCCA is being used as a political escape route to try to retain the Minister's credibility.  I do not think the NCCA should be used in that manner.  It seems that the entire issue of the junior certificate curriculum is again up for analysis.  The only legitimate way to do that is to amend the White Paper or say that the section of the White Paper that deals with the junior certificate is no longer valid and we need to take a fresh look at it.  I have noted the questions put to the NCCA and I have reservation about the direction it is leading us, the shortening of the history course and so forth.  It seems incredible that more than a year after the publication of the White Paper the Minister is going back to the NCCA asking it as a matter of urgency to deal with this issue.  The Minister decided to meet the NCCA on Tuesday and made her major U-turn speech on Saturday. That shows that parliamentary democracy can work or force people into certain action.</P>
    <P>I echo Deputy Lenihan's remark on the importance of the European dimension to education.  The White Paper lays great stress on the European dimension to education but I wonder if the authors of the White Paper bothered to read the Council of Europe report: The Learning of History in Europe, issued in Strasbourg in 1994 which says that history is a unique discipline and &ldquo;the Council of Europe's experts have argued that all <Col N="610" /> pupils should study history, at every level of their education, because it has a value that cannot be provided by other subjects&rdquo;.  History, they claimed &ldquo;is a unique discipline, concerned with a special kind of training of the mind and imagination and with the imparting of an accurate body of knowledge which ensures that pupils understand others' points of view&rdquo;.  It seems that those who wrote the White Paper never bothered looking at the various reports from the Council of Europe, including the Council of Europe Report: The Role of History in the Formation of National Identity. Strasbourg 1996.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not take these reports on board.</P>
    <P>We are interested in the debate on broadening the curriculum but not overloading it.  Nicholas Canning, a well known historian and chairman of the Irish Historical Sciences, wrote recently that, as it currently stands, history takes only one sixteenth of the junior certificate curriculum which does not in any way dominate the curriculum, the same applies to geography.  They are not dominant subjects in the junior certificate curriculum.  There have been attempts to evade and confuse the public. The Minister should accept our motion in good faith and commit herself to amending the White Paper.  Irrespective of who is in power, the White Paper is the policy framework for the development of education towards the end of this decade.  The document contains decisions and could be used by successive Ministers in future.  The commitments made now could prove transient and may not give the type of guarantees required by the History Teachers' Association and other groups such as the Geographical Society which have campaigned effectively on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I entered politics this is the saddest case I have had to deal with.  The person concerned, Kevin Moloney, was unconscious for 14 weeks in Beaumont Hospital following a road traffic accident on 11 August 1991.  In December that year he was transferred to the National Rehabilitation Centre, Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin where he remained until June the following year.  His initial response was poor.  He was disoriented and had no sense of time, place or of his physical or mental state.</P>
      <P>When he returned to County Mayo, family members living away from home came in turn to try to help him.  He became content, began to walk and, within a period of about one year, could meet his personal and hygiene needs under supervision.</P>
      <P>As his 75 year old father was the only relative living at home and other family members had to return to their places of employment in England, it was necessary to find a place for him.  In 1993 he was assessed by a neuro-surgeon who recommended a facility that ran a programme with activities related to his life before the accident.  To this end he was placed by the National Rehabilitation Institute in the National Horticultural Centre, Bantry, County Cork where he will remain until July.  This means a trip of over 200 miles for his father who cried in my arms when he came to see me in my clinic a few weeks ago.  He asked how he could be expected as an old man of 75 years of age to travel up and down from Cork to see his son.  He said he would die without seeing him.</P>
      <P>I have seen the reply prepared by the civil servants.  We would like the person concerned to be transferred to Swinford or, if this is not possible, to Castlebar or some location in County Galway.  Glenamoy is almost 70 miles from Ballina and over 200 miles from west Cork.  A Bill was presented to enable Irish prisoners in England to be transferred here so that they can be near their families. We are aware of their awful deeds.  The young man concerned was involved in a tragic accident in which he sustained head injuries.  He has received no compensation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State not to give me the typical Civil Service answer.  I intend to raise this matter at every opportunity until the person concerned is transferred to County Mayo or, if this is not possible, to some location in Connacht so that he can be close to his father.  This is not too much to ask.  I will not accept the excuse that to be placed in Swinford one has to be mentally handicapped from birth.  The surgeons, doctors and professional people accept that he needs full-time care and have provided the necessary references.  I plead with the Minister of State to give a positive response.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a disability in County Mayo is a matter, in the first instance, for the Western Health Board. The person concerned is placed on a Rehab course in County Cork.  I understand he was placed there because it was felt this facility ran a programme with <Col N="615" /> activities related to his life before the road traffic accident in which he was involved.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has informed me that Aras Attracta provides to persons with a mental handicap derived from birth or during the development period.  The board has indicated that, in general, agencies in the area providing services to people with a mental handicap, including Aras Attracta, do not provide services to persons whose disability has arisen as a result of a road traffic accident.</P>
      <P>The board has also stated there are no vacancies in Aras Attracta.  There is also a waiting list of persons with a mental handicap awaiting placement in residential facilities, such as Aras Attracta, and other mental handicap facilities in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I note the person's placement on the Rehab course is due to end in July.  I am aware of the difficulties the family have in visiting the person concerned because of the long journey involved.  In view of this, the impending conclusion of his current placement, I have asked the Western Health Board to liaise with Rehab to see what more appropriate services might be available for him closer to his home.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, day services are an essential component of an effective community care service for people with disabilities by providing stimulation, activation and therapy for them. I am aware that the special needs of people with head injuries who may experience complex physical, psychological and social problems require the development of services specifically for them which take account of their special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Review Group on Services for People with a Physical and Sensory Disability is finalising its report on the future service needs of people with disabilities. The group's report is paying <Col N="616" /> particular attention to the service needs of people with head injuries.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this vital issue which is causing mayhem throughout the country as the deadline of 31 May for applications for this scheme draws closer.  Having completed seven years in the third level system, I know only too well what it is like to live as a student.  I know the importance of gathering a few pounds during the summer holidays to make ends meet during the winter.</P>
      <P>I only became aware of the student jobs scheme last summer as it is not advertised in the Northern colleges.  It is a brilliant concept and as a county councillor I advocated it strongly over the summer and throughout the winter. Its immediate benefits were obvious, not only for students but for the community at large.  This year I anticipated great things happening as various community and voluntary groups were primed to have students on board, but what happened?  In reality, very few people are eligible for the scheme which was initially a replacement for social welfare payments.  Students on the scheme last year, who were relying on £800 to pay their rent and maintenance costs for the coming year, are told they are no longer eligible.</P>
      <P>Without meaning any disrespect to anyone, when one looks at the complexity of the four page application form it is a good job these are for third level students.  Those who received the £200 extra last year because both their parents were on social welfare are being told this year that they do not really need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> As originally conceived, the money from the scheme is not a reward for work but, as the Department of Social Welfare said, &ldquo;a means assessment and subsequent allowance with compulsory community work&rdquo;.  It cannot, therefore, suddenly be deemed to be unnecessary for the 3,375 young people and their families who qualified in previous years.</P>
    <P>While officially the scheme is reserved for those third level students who are not entitled to receive unemployment assistance during the summer months and who satisfy a means test, two questions are being asked of me and of other Deputies.  Who is entitled to the scheme?  Why are people who want to work, and who have a scheme place, being told to go on the dole instead?  That is a disgraceful ethos to promote for our young people.</P>
    <P>In reply to a recent question I posed, the Minister for Social Welfare complained about the upward trend in the number of students participating in the scheme since its inception.  What is wrong with opening up a source of employment that has positive repercussions for the students' local communities? They wish to see improvements in their localities but cannot obtain alternative employment.  They want to spend some of their time out of college in their home environment rather than having to work abroad to pay for their studies.</P>
    <P>Those who would ordinarily have received full unemployment assistance and a rent allowance in previous years will be £350 worse off this year if they are lucky enough to qualify for the student jobs scheme.  Many who were on the scheme last year are not eligible this year.  In addition, many areas that benefited from student work last year will be without that support this year.  Who are the winners?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the case made by the new Deputy for Donegal North-East for students, particularly <Col N="618" /> those who are totally reliant on State benefits.  The poorest of the poor are being denied £200 on top of a new incremental increase this year.  The Minister should re-examine this excellent scheme which does away with the mentality of the students' dole.  The scheme ensures that students get off on the right foot by doing useful community work.  The sponsors are pleased with them, it is a good scheme and should be promoted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>From the educational perspective, I am disappointed that this year's scheme represents a further cutback on last year's one.  Over 18,000 students in the further education sector are essentially being excluded from the scheme and have not been facilitated in applying.  This sector of our education system is an important one because many at third level are full-time students.  However, the new definitions of third level and further education are too rigid in terms of applying this scheme.  Very often students in further education will progress to third level. For example, in previous years leaving certificate students were entitled to apply but that was cut out last year.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the 18 years of age rule.  I tabled a question on Tuesday about a case in Cork where the student will be 18 on 5 June.  Because the applicant must be 18 on 1 June that student was excluded.  The Department said no, but the Minister said he would examine ways in which somebody in that situation could be facilitated.  The Minister should agree to allow them access to the scheme because they are bona fide third level students.  That some may be four days under the age limit is not a justifiable reason for excluding them from the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for giving me the opportunity to speak on this topic.  There are no cutbacks in the <Col N="619" /> students summer jobs scheme.  A sum of £3 million was allocated towards the scheme in 1994 and a sum of £6 million was initially provided for the scheme in 1995.  Arising from the improvements I made to the scheme last year, I negotiated an additional £4 million to cover the increased demand that arose from those improvements.  This year a sum of £10.2 million has been allocated for this scheme.</P>
      <P>The number of students participating in the students summer jobs scheme rose from 4,400 in 1993 to just over 16,000 last year and I am determined to ensure that those students for whom the scheme is intended find a place, if they cannot find other work.  The scheme has proved to be highly popular with sponsors who have offered an increasing number of jobs to students over the years.  The number of jobs on offer has increased from 9,000 in 1993 to over 21,000 last year.  Various surveys carried out by my Department since the scheme began, show a very high level of satisfaction with the scheme and its operation among both the third level student population and the various sponsors.  I have seen many examples throughout the country of the high quality work carried out by the students.  Both students and sponsors deserve the highest praise and encouragement for their commitment to the scheme and I am strongly committed to its continuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made significant improvements in the scheme in 1995 by increasing the amount payable per student from £520 to £600 and this support has been maintained this year.  I also allowed third level students with even a minimum entitlement under the means-tested unemployment assistance scheme to take part.  Up to then, a person had to have a minimum entitlement to £15 before they could qualify for the scheme.  That restricted the numbers considerably.  I abolished that requirement last year so that if a student is now <Col N="620" /> found to have an entitlement of only £1 per week he or she will receive the full £600 for the duration of the scheme. Most third level students participating in this scheme are benefiting more than they would have if they were still entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>These changes resulted in a very significant increase in the number of students participating in the scheme &mdash; in 1994 9,200 students took part, while last year the number increased to just over 16,000.  When I found that the budget allocation of £6 million was inadequate to meet the demand last year, I arranged for additional resources to bring the total amount available for the scheme to £10 million.  A sum of £10.2 million has been allocated for this year's scheme.  There has, therefore, been no financial cutback in the scheme. However, in order to ensure that the greatest number of eligible students could participate, I have made a variety of changes to better target the scheme this year, including dropping the bonus payable to some students, which was found to be anomalous.</P>
    <P>The underlying purpose of the scheme when it was introduced in 1993 was to provide income support for the less well off third level students who were disqualified by the then Fianna Fáil-led Government from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months where they could not find work.  The primary focus of this year's scheme is, therefore to provide places for students who have no other means of income support.  Students who are entitled to receive unemployment assistance, such as mature students and students who have completed their courses, can qualify for unemployment assistance if they satisfy a means test and are genuinely looking for work. This provides them with the necessary income support during the summer months and they are not, therefore, eligible for this year's schemes.</P>
    <P>I reiterate and emphasis that there <Col N="621" /> are no financial cutbacks in this year's scheme.  The same amount of money is being provided as was available in 1995. I am refocusing the scheme this year to ensure that the maximum number of eligible students who need income support from my Department, and who would get it but for the abolition of their unemployment assistance entitlement by a Fianna Fáil-led Government, are allowed to participate.</P>
    <P>I want to address some of the points made by the Deputies opposite in their contributions.  Deputy Keaveney said that few people will be eligible but, based on the rate of approvals to date, 16,000 people will participate in this year's scheme.  That is on par with the numbers approved last year.</P>
    <P>I take the complaint that the forms are too complex with a grain of salt.  We are talking about third level students who have gone through primary and secondary school to third level education and who at least have their leaving certificate.  These students would not be in college unless they were capable of reading.  To argue, therefore, that the forms are too complex is stretching the point.</P>
    <P>The point made in relation to the 18 years olds is valid.  We are currently examining the possibility of enabling people who turn 18 during the course of the scheme to take up the scheme at that point and work through the full 12 weeks from that date.  In that way they will not be at any loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that now the official position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On the occasion when I replied to the Deputy's question &mdash; I have had a number of other questions since then &mdash; we were examining the position to find some kind of solution.  That will now be the position.  Few people have been declared ineligible on that basis but we intend to include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> In relation to the 18,000 students on PLC courses referred to by the Deputy, we are allowing those engaged in courses of more than one year to participate in the scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that although we have increased the allocation from £6 million last year to £10 million this year, to include a further 18,000 on top of the 16,000 will require at least another £12 million to £14 million.  Those resources are simply not available.</P>
    <P>I would like to enable every student to participate in the scheme but clearly there are resources implications.  We are targeting the scheme at third level students who no longer have a right to unemployment assistance.  I believe that is the fairest way of allocating the resources available to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to intervene in the Aer Lingus dispute which has resulted in 4,000 of its workforce being put on protective notice.  There is no doubt Aer Lingus will face a period of industrial unrest of crisis proportions if this dispute goes ahead.</P>
      <P>The background to the dispute is that SIPTU, which represents the Aer Lingus cabin crew, voted to take industrial action from Tuesday next over the issue of a Delta flag carrier operating on Aer Lingus New York flights since 1 May.  Representatives of the 800 Aer Lingus cabin crew fear that the use of one Delta person on each Aer Lingus flight could lead to job losses in the short and longer term.</P>
      <P>The proper industrial relations machinery has been used in this conflict and the Labour Relations Commission proposals, which would allow the Delta person to be on the flight but not part of the crew, combined with a review taking place in the autumn, were finally rejected by SIPTU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that cabin crew staff suffered a great deal during the Cahill <Col N="623" /> rationalisation plan and made a considerable and significant contribution towards the recovery of Aer Lingus. Currently there are considerable tensions between management and the workforce.  The move by Aer Lingus management to put all 4,000 of its staff on protective notice from Friday was far too heavy-handed.  Aer Lingus has managed to put an impressive business plan in place but this plan has not been successfully communicated to the staff and the human dimension of change, and its effect on the staff, needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The new Delta link-up is vital for the long-term survival and development of Aer Lingus.  Because of its size Aer Lingus needs a strategic partner to improve its transatlantic service.  The irony is that if the Delta relationship works, and I believe it will, there will be an increased number of jobs in the company which will more than likely lead to Aer Lingus acquiring a fifth aircraft.</P>
    <P>An all out strike in Aer Lingus would have disastrous consequences for our tourism industry and the economy in general as we head into a busy holiday period.  Since industrial relations machinery has already been tried and has failed, the Minister now has no option but to intervene, behind the scenes if necessary.</P>
    <P>The distance between the sides in this dispute is not impossible to bridge; management gave an overall guarantee today on jobs which is a positive development.  The Minister should now involve himself proactively, bring an immediate end to this dispute and ensure that the company can get on with the business of increasing its market share.  That will not happen unless the management takes account of the sensitivities involved in the significant changes that have and continue to take place in Aer Lingus in recent times.</P>
    <P>The future for Aer Lingus is potentially bright and the Minister cannot <Col N="624" /> afford to stand aside and allow this dispute to escalate.  He should intervene now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this issue which is not only of serious concern to the Government but also to me as a north Dublin Deputy.  I am acutely conscious of the clear threat to livelihoods this dispute would pose if it escalates.  The Deputy has clearly outlined the background to this dispute and some of the developments. It would not be useful for me to go over those again.  It is important to recognise that both sides in the dispute agree that the strategic alliance is important to the long-term future.  The difficulty has arisen in the context of implementation.  That is clearly a problem which must be resolved ultimately by the two sides.</P>
      <P>I have to part company with the Deputy when he prescribes the response to this as intervention by me, as Minister. He will recognise that we have developed extremely effective problem solving machinery for industrial disputes, both through the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  If the sides cannot through their own procedures resolve their dispute, it is necessary that they avail of the services of the Labour Relations Commission and-or the Labour Court which stands ready to assist them in any way it can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be helpful for a Minister to intervene in such a dispute.  I am not adopting a new position in this regard as this approach has been taken by a number of Ministers from all sides of the House.  It is tried and tested.  The solution to these problems must be found between the sides.  We will offer them assistance through our skilled personnel, but it is not helpful to politicise these disputes.  I recognise that use has been made of the dispute settling agencies but if has been unsuccessful so far. I urge the parties to continue their <Col N="625" /> efforts to find an acceptable solution and to avail of the assistance of the LRC and the Labour Court in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter which relates to the production of electricity for the national grid from farm waste.  It is done effectively and profitably in England where poultry producers are even paid for the litter.  I visited a plant which burns 300 tonnes of litter per day.</P>
      <P>I will outline the background to the problem.  In the early 1990s and using INTERREG funds, Monaghan County Council in conjunction with Teagasc had a farm waste study carried out.  It identified the damage to the major water catchments of the Blackwater and the Erne and the need to recycle this waste.  The waste is disposed of in various ways.  It cannot be used in the growing season but it is spread on land during the winter.  However, most of it was dumped into bogs and old quarries. Many of the growers depended on contractors to clean out the houses.  In one area one would collect 2,000 tonnes of compost per week.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago one of the major contractors got notice from Monaghan County Council that he could no longer use the landfill he had been using.  I am most concerned about one woman who borrowed £70,000 to build three plastic tunnels and ancillary buildings.  The contractor who had taken the waste compost will no longer be able to do so. Monaghan County Council do not have any ground on which to dump it.  This is what confronts the large numbers of people who had depended on the contractor to clean those houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I identified this problem years ago.  I have contacted the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  However, each of the Departments stands alone and there is <Col N="626" /> no co-operation between them to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a competition for generating electricity from waste.  We were very disappointed when the Monaghan proposal was not included.  When the results of the competition became known none of the 100 megawatts came under the heading of biomass, but under headings relating to wind farms, dumps and the combined energy and power from breweries.  There is another competition this year.  A sum of £7.5 million from the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme will be provided for a project to be selected in October.  If the county is not successful in having its project accepted, it will mean not alone that there will be no further development but there will be a serious curtailment of the current development.</P>
    <P>I ask for co-operation between the Government Departments as hundreds of people are employed in picking and processing in a £50 million industry in the county which is being threatened by the fact that thousands of tonnes of waste cannot be used.  All it would produce is some ash from the generating stations.  Will the Minister highlight the urgency involved and the need to safeguard a useful industry?  As it is, the industry must make do for another 12 months before a project could be in place.</P>

      <P>A competitive scheme to secure an electricity generating plant of up to 30 megawatt using biomass or wastes as a fuel was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, on 21 December 1995.  A grant of up to £7.5 million has been made available for this initiative under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expression of interest stage of the competition closed on 29 February 1996, and tender packs were issued to applicants.  The deadline for formal submission of a technical application was 30 <Col N="627" /> April 1996.  The process of appointing an independent assessor for the competition is currently in train.  In the circumstances, it would be wholly inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>
    <P>Under the recently published &ldquo;Renewable Energy &mdash; a Strategy for the Future&rdquo;, a target of a further 7 megawatt of installed electricity generating capacity using biomass or wastes <Col N="628" /> as a fuel source has been set for the next three years.  This installed capacity will be secured through competition, and capital grant assistance, from the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, of £65,000 per megawatt installed, will be available.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Western Development Partnership Board has stated that 7 per cent of the population live in the north-west and that small rural towns have experienced depopulation and emigration: and whether the Government has a regional policy for the west.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10943/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to supporting the development of the west.  This commitment has been clearly demonstrated by <Col N="408" /> the appointment of my colleague, Deputy Carey as Minister of State for Western Development and Rural Renewal.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with particular responsibility for western development, the Minister of State Deputy Carey, has responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's response to addressing the primary issue of population decline which has a greater effect on the western region than any other area in the country.</P>
      <P>In respect of his particular brief, there are three key initiatives which support and we compliment the Government's overall efforts to support the development of the west.  These initiatives are the action plan of the Western Development Partnership Board; the co-ordination of the Government's response to improving and developing the standard of living of our offshore island communities and the implementation of a pilot programme on public service provision in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The action plan for western development, recently launched by the Western Development Partnership Board, provides a strategic focus for the economic and social development of the west.  The Government response to the plan has been positive and includes a number of important initiatives which will be coordinated by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  These initiatives include the establishment of a Western Investment Fund to provide long-term venture capital and a Western Development Commission to replace the Western Development Partnership Board on the completion of its term of office at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The achievement of population stability is a central theme of the Western Development Partnership Board's action plan.  The Taoiseach announced recently, in response to a recommendation in the board's plan, that the National Economic and Social Council is to undertake a study on settlement patterns in the interests of a more balanced population distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Government has <Col N="409" /> agreed to the setting up of a working group of departmental officials whose task will be to develop proposals for the design and operation of agricultural and fisheries policies which will more adequately secure the future of low intensity farms and small scale marine enterprises.  This initiative demonstrates the Government's support for the view that the future viability of rural communities is rooted in a strong agricultural base.  This will have a particular significance for communities in the west.</P>
    <P>The pilot programme initiative for the development of a more integrated approach to the delivery of public services in remote rural areas is a direct response to one of the key recommendations in the National Economic and Social Council's report <i>New Approaches to Rural Development.</i> The assessment of the proposals for inclusion in the programme are at an advanced stage and my colleague plans to announce shortly the establishment of a number of pilot projects to be located in the western region.</P>
    <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, which the Minister of State, Deputy Carey chairs, established a coherent and comprehensive basis for Government policy in relation to the economic and social development of our offshore communities.  This committee has been given a three year mandate and will report to Government annually.</P>
    <P>Through the implementation of these innovative initiatives which the Minister of State, Deputy Carey is overseeing and the positive response which the action plan of the Western Development Partnership Board has received, the Government has demonstrated in a significant way its continuing commitment to addressing issues of particular concern to the west.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, it is proposed that the Curragh Hospital will provide a 30 bed in-patient facility for patients who do not require surgery or significant medical treatment.  The hospital will also continue its present out-patient and occupational medical services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The out-patient facility at the Curragh Hospital has down through the years been available to the dependants of members of the Defence Forces living in married quarters in the Curragh Camp.  The historical basis for this arrangement was the absence of a civilian medical practitioner in the Curragh Camp and a lack of transport to enable soldiers' dependants to obtain medical treatment outside the Curragh Camp. However, it appears that in recent years dependants of soldiers living outside the Curragh Camp were also availing of the service at an increasing rate.  As a result the military authorities have proposed that the facility should be confined to persons living in married quarters in the Curragh Camp.  I have directed that this proposal should not be implemented until I have had the opportunity to consider all the implications of the change, <Col N="411" /> and to allow consultations with the representative associations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 15, 33 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>Current investment programmes, totalling some £31 million, for the modernisation of the fleet and the vessel decommissioning scheme are geared to improving the structure, efficiency and age profile of the fleet while delivering on our mandatory EU fleet targets. Continued good take up of modernisation grants and decommissioning premia will contribute directly to those overall objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the modernisation scheme, 131 vessel modernisation projects involving total investment of over £15 million and grant aid of over £4 million have been approved since 1994.  Under the decommissioning scheme 59 vessels have been <Col N="412" /> approved for decommissioning grants to date.</P>
    <P>The age and size characteristics of the vessels in the Irish fleet vary depending on the particular segment in which they operate.  The average age of the fleet overall is just over 24 years.  Within that average there are considerable variations by reference to size of vessel and type of fishing activity.  The most modern parts of the fleet are the pelagic and the larger so-called polyvalent vessels which target white fish and other species with a variety of different fishing methods.  As a result of the significant private investment in the Irish pelagic fleet in recent years it is now one of the most modern in the world.  There has also been a trend in the polyvalent fleet to introduce larger and comparatively more modern second-hand vessels from abroad, to replace a number of the older, smaller and less efficient vessels.</P>
    <P>The fleet safety debate has brought about a renewed focus on the broader issue of the economic development needs of the Irish fishing fleet.  A thorough reappraisal of the options for renewal of the fleet, and the white fish fleet in particular, is both necessary and timely from all perspectives.  I have, accordingly, requested my Department to comprehensively review the future direction of the fleet policy including the relative socio-economic and commercial merits of the introduction of new vessels into the fleet.  To assist in this review, a consultancy study will analyse the options of renewal, taking account of the opportunities and the constraints, the economics of realising available fishing opportunities and the ongoing EU policy to address the overall EU fleet overcapacity problem.  The study will also assess the impact of the various renewal options on future employment in the catching sector.  I will be consulting closely with the industry in this detailed consideration of fleet policy issues.</P>
    <P>I am giving the highest priority to addressing the safety issue in the fishing industry.  It is a complex matter involving a wide range of factors.  In view of <Col N="413" /> the complexity and seriousness of the issue I established a high level review group of fishing vessel safety earlier this year.  The group is analysing the many factors which have a bearing on fishing vessel safety, and I expect to receive its report very shortly.  I will consider very carefully the recommendations in that report on how we and the industry can best set about improving safety standards in the Irish fleet.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The representative associations in the Defence Forces are being fully consulted on issues arising from the Efficiency Audit Group's review of the Defence Forces which come within their remit and scope.  The EAG implementation plan, with which the military authorities are in full agreement, was approved by the Government last March.  This plan is strategic in nature and sets out the parameters within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place.</P>
      <P>At all stages throughout this process of reform I have been at pains to ensure that the representative associations and the personnel whom they represent are kept fully informed of all developments as they happen.  Participation in the process of change by the representative associations will guarantee its successful implementation.  I have met representatives of both the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association on six separate occasions in the last year, both to hear their opinions and discuss with them my own views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> The Permanent Defence Force representative association have been repeatedly promised consultation on all aspects of the implementation plan and these undertakings are being honoured. Consultation and discussion have taken place and continue to take place under the auspices of the Defence Forces Conciliation Council.  This is the most appropriate forum in which to deal with any issues which either side may wish to raise.  I have told the associations on a number of occasions that there will be flexibility in the way the plan itself will be implemented and I stand by this statement.</P>
    <P>Further discussions will take place at a meeting arranged for tomorrow, 30 May 1996, and it is envisaged that a conciliation report finally allaying fears in relation to enforced redundancy will be adopted in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into account the experience of the EU Presidency in 1990 and the expansion of the Union since then, it is clear that existing Air Corps aircraft will not be able to meet all ministerial air transport demands arising in the period of the 1996 Presidency.  Having considered a range of options, it was decided that the use of an air taxi service would be the most suitable way of meeting all the additional requirements. A tender competition was held by the Department of Defence in accordance <Col N="419" /> with EU competition regulations for the provision of an air taxi service capable of carrying up to eight people to all major cities within the European Union. The competition was advertised in the <i>European Journal</i> in February 1996 with a closing date for the receipt of tenders of 11 April 1996.  The award criteria were set out as being the &ldquo;economically most advantageous tender in terms of price, quality, date able to take up contract and ability to meet specification.&rdquo; A total of seven tenders were received.</P>
    <P>The tenders were fully evaluated on financial and technical grounds by the Department of Defence.  This evaluation involved consultation with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps.  Following the evaluation, the contract was awarded to Hunting Avi-action Ltd. on the basis of the award criteria to which I have already referred. It is not the practice to disclose specific details regarding any particular tender received.  This is in accordance with public procurement procedures.  The overall cost of the air taxi service will be dependent on the number of flying hours involved.</P>
    <P>It was not a condition of the tender specification that the contractor should be the owner or operator of the aircraft to be used in providing the service.  In submitting its tender document, Hunting Aviation Ltd. provided full details of the aircraft which it proposed to use in providing the air taxi service.  These aircraft are being supplied to Hunting Aviation Ltd. by Heathrow Jet Charter Limited and Aravco Limited of London.</P>

      <P>The civilian employees referred to in the question provide maintenance and services at Finner Camp.  No civilian employee staff at the camp have been let go in the recent past and there are no arrangements in preparation to make any staff there redundant in the future.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the Deputy's concern about civilian employee positions based at Finner Camp may relate to some speculation about the impact of the Defence Forces review implementation plan &mdash; phase I &mdash; copies of which issued to all Dáil Deputies.  In that connection I repeat my recent reply to a related similar written question from other Deputies where I pointed out that the review plan sets out under a heading of &ldquo;Building Maintenance and Furnishing&rdquo; in Chapter 6 &mdash; Logistics and Material &mdash; that:</P>
      <P>The maintenance of military installation buildings will continue to be undertaken by existing civilian employee maintenance staffs for the Barrack commander.  Supervision will be provided by engineers from the Logistics Battalion.  The evaluation of alternative means of maintaining barracks will be examined during Phase I.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of relevance also in the &ldquo;Civilianisation&rdquo; section of Chapter 8 &mdash; Special Studies &mdash; of the implementation plan which includes the statement that:</P>
      <P>There is a need for a detailed study to examine the role and disposition of all civilian personnel under the new arrangements.  This will be carried out during the phase one plan and will be undertaken in conjunction with a study to identify areas where tasks undertaken by military personnel under the new arrangements might be civilianised or contracted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any changes that the proposed study may recommend in relation to existing civilian employees will be notified to, and discussed with, all appropriate parties at as early a date as possible.  The <Col N="421" /> civilianisation study, along with a number of other special studies identified in the implementation plan, will be carried out over the three year timeframe allowed for in phase I of the plan.</P>
    <P>No civilian employee staff redundancies at Finner Camp, or elsewhere, are contemplated at present.</P>

      <Quest>if he will improve the schemes available for fishermen choosing to retire early from fishing in order that they are at least as beneficial as schemes with similar objectives available to farmers in view of the fact that fishermen often face hardship after decommissioning, such as inadequacy of funding to clear overheads and a lack of any pension for ex-fishermen.</Quest>

      <P>The fishing vessel decommissioning scheme established last year provided for the payment of premia to fishing vessel owners volunteering to decommission their boats.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 October 1995.  Fifth-nine boat owners have been approved under the scheme.  The national rates of payment were set by reference to the relevant EU regulation governing such schemes as well as available funding and the relative market value of vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good take up under the scheme will assist in the achievement of our mandatory EU fleet targets by the end of the year and will help to improve the overall age profile of the fleet.  The scheme also represents an opportunity for older fishing boat owners, or fishermen planning to move into alternative activities, to avail of financial assistance to voluntarily retire from the sector.  In addition, under the PESCA Community Initiative funding is also available to assist fishermen to successfully respond to changes in the sector and to diversify into other activities.  I have just announced a <Col N="422" /> further round of 45 PESCA projects representing total funding support of £2 million for alternative economic activities right around the coast.</P>
    <P>I can advise the Deputy that the EU Council agreed last year, with my support, to the introduction of an early retirement scheme for fishermen in the context of restructuring the Union fleet and consequent socio-economic implications for fishing communities. However, no additional funding has been provided by the EU to support such a scheme.  This means that any scheme would have to be funded from existing FIFG allocations which would mean taking scarce funding from our other investment programmes such as fleet modernisation and fish processing where the priorities are job maintenance and job creation.  I will, however, continue to encourage the Commission to explore the possibility of providing funding for an early retirement scheme from other sources such as the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>I can also advise the Deputy that the Department of Social Welfare is currently undertaking a thoroughgoing review of the position of fishermen under the social insurance system.  The review is being informed by discussions with my Department and the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute has commissioned a new research vessel at a cost of £1.741 million to replace the research vessel <i>Lough Beltra</i> which is nearing the end of its useful life.  The vessel is being 75 per cent funded by the European Regional Development Fund under the Marine Research Measure of the Fisheries Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>The specification and design of the vessel was developed through wide consultation with researchers, scientists and marine sectoral interests.</P>
      <P>Following advertising in the national press, trade journals and the Official Journal of the European Union in September and October 1995, seven shipyards submitted tenders based on the specification and plan prepared by the Marine Institute.  Two of these shipyards were Irish.</P>
      <P>The tender documentation provided that the contract would be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender with regard to the following: demonstratable relevant experience and technical merit; price quoted and value for money; awarding authority inspection of financial records and at its option the furnishing by the supplier of a performance guarantee; compliance with appropriate national and EU tax clearance procedures; period for completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A technical evaluation committee established by the Marine Institute considered the tenders received.  All seven tenderers were invited to meet the techical evaluation committee to discuss their respective proposals.  Five, including the two Irish tenderers, accepted the invitation and met the technical evaluation committee between 19 and 21 December 1995 to discuss price, design <Col N="424" /> and machinery and equipment options. All yards were afforded an opportunity to re-examine their quotation to ensure; (a) that their final offer was in line with the requirements; and (b) that all quotations could be analysed on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>The five yards which met the technical evaluation committee subsequently reduced their quotations.  The technical evaluation committee concluded that the tender from Scheepswerf Visser, BV, Den Helder, Holland best fitted the published criteria.  In particular, this tender was the lowest and offered the shortest timeframe for completion.  The board of the Marine Institute accordingly recommended that the contract be awarded to Scheepswerf Visser BV.</P>
    <P>Public procurement procedures require that unsuccessful tenderers should be informed without undue delay.  Contracting authorities are recommended to adopt a policy of releasing general information to companies inquiring as to why their tenders were unsuccessful.  In doing so authorities should not reveal information about other tenders which could enable the price or other commercially sensitive details of individual tenders to be identified.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the unsuccessful companies which were invited to inquire why their tenders were unsuccessful confined their subsequent inquiries to the identify of the successful tenderer.  I am also advised that the Marine Institute is still available and willing to discuss with the unsuccessful companies the reasons why their tenders were unsuccessful.  Such discussions must, of course, have due regard for the commercial confidentiality of the successful tenderer, but could usefully assist the yards in question to become more competitive in the future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>MVF Antonia</i>

      <P>MVF Skellig Dawn</P>
      <P>
        <i>MVF Utopia.</i>
      </P>
      <P>During the operational phase the ten Irish vessels were fitted with continuous position monitoring equipment which provided data on the position, speed and course of each vessel as it went about its normal fishing activities.</P>
      <P>The pilot project was one of a series undertaken by member states in the context of the new EU fisheries control regime agreed by Council in 1993 and which provided for the carrying out of practical trials in order to evaluate the technical feasibility of satellite technology as a tool for improved fisheries control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and other member states are currently compiling detailed reports on the results of the projects to the Commission which will inform the Commission's assessment of the feasibility and cost benefits of satellite technology in fisheries control.  In light of this practical experience to date, the Commission is scheduled to bring forward proposals to Council on Union-wide implementation of satellite monitoring <Col N="426" /> during the second half of the year.  We will work constructively during the Presidency to progress these proposals. I will, of course, be consulting closely with the fishing industry on all aspects of these proposals as they develop.</P>
    <P>Satellite monitoring, along with other applications of modern technology, notably computerised catch data, has the potential to be a very effective tool in the monitoring and control of fishing activities.  It would enable fisheries protection services to operate in a much more focused way by pinpointing the location and duration of fishing vessel activity.  I also believe that it will, in the longer term, reduce the costs of communication for the fishing industry itself and will have an added safety dividend for fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>The effectivness of satellite monitoring will, of course, depend on the willingness and ability of member states to communicate data to each other on a regular basis.  There were teething problems in relation to timely data exchange between flag and coastal states during the pilot projects.  It is essential that these difficulties are addressed prior to implementation of any permanent system. This underlines once again the imperative need for greater co-operation and co-ordination by all member states in fisheries control matters.</P>

      <P>I have every confidence in the future of the Irish fishing industry and in the ability of Irish fishermen to rise to the very many challenges facing the sector. I am committed to working with the industry to meet those challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Common Fisheries Policy is <Col N="427" /> concerned with the orderly management of the industry and the conservation of fish stocks so as to ensure a future for the industry.  Despite the constraints substantial progress has been made in recent years to enhance the economic contribution of the Irish fishing industry within the overall framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Fisheries is currently providing for a total investment of £140 million in the industry in the period 1994-99 which will assist the creation of up to 2,000 new jobs in processing and aquaculture, while maintaining jobs in the catching sector.  To improve the efficiency and age profile of the fleet over £17 million has been earmarked for boat modernisation and the decommissioning scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to current investment support strategies for the sector, I have asked the Department to specifically review, in light of all relevant factors, the future directions of fleet policy, including the relatives socio-economic and commercial merits of the introduction of new vessels into the fleet.</P>
    <P>Looking to the long-term, the single most serious threat to the future of the fishing industry worldwide and here at home is the depletion of fish stocks through over fishing.  Conservation of the resource requires careful management and constant vigilance in protecting and monitoring stock level.  Ireland has been at the forefront in seeking to ensure that EU regulations optimise the management and conservation of the resource and in pressing for tigher controls.</P>
    <P>At successive EU Fisheries Councils I have stressed the vital need for unequivocal commitment by all member states to the conservancy and management principles, backed up by strict enforcement, to ensure the long-term future of the industry.  I know that I have the welcome support of the Irish fishing industry in pursuing those aims and which I intend to make the priority themes of the forthcoming Presidency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> With the industry's support I will continue to pursue policies both at national and EU level which will offer the best guarantee for sustainable development. The bleak results of overfishing elsewhere leading to the closure of fisheries and fleets being tied up send us a clear message.  We must make sure that everyone gets the message and that we put in place the positive steps to ensure the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>I have received the report and recommendations of the salmon management task force.  I am working to finalise a comprehensive strategy for the future management of the wild salmon sector based around the task force recommendations and grounded in the various policy objectives which I have previously outlined to the House.</P>
      <P>Salmon management policy and its future direction is a matter of national importance and concern.  I intend, therefore, to present the task force report to Government shortly, together with my proposals on future management strategies, following which the report will be published in full.  I also intend to afford the House, or an appropriate committee of the House, the opportunity to have a full debate on the report and on future strategic directions as soon as this can be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic premise underlying policy is that the balance of advantage on conservation, environmental and economic grounds will lie increasingly with redirecting salmon stocks away from interceptory commercial fishing at sea and towards recreational fishing.  In developing the necessary strategies to bring about that transition, salmon policy objectives must have full regard for the interests of those with legitimate <Col N="429" /> rights in salmon exploitation, be they commercial or angling.</P>
    <P>There will be complex and delicate balances to be struck in delivering in an integrated way on the strategic framework required.  There are numerous issues critical to the conservation of wild salmon stocks to be taken into account in developing that framework.  I will be weighing all of these with a view to putting in place the best possible practical measures to secure the future for the wild salmon resource.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record at this time my thanks to the chairman and the members of the task force for their commitment and hard work in delivering this report.</P>
    <P>I would also like to thank the numerous individuals and organisations who made submissions to the task force and actively participated in the consultation process around the country.  The involvement of so many from all sides of the debate has been a valuable and essential part of the review process.</P>

    <P>EU policy on aid to shipbuilding is currently set out in Council Directive 90/684/EEC of 21 December 1990 as last amended by Directive 9473/EC of 19 December 1994.  Tugs of 365 kw or <Col N="430" /> above all within the scope of the Directive. Aid is allowed, to the yard or shipowner, up to 9 per cent of a contract value, if this is equal to or higher than 10 million ECU.  For contracts of a lower value, the aid limit is set at 4.5 per cent of the contract price.</P>
    <P>However, in December 1994 an international agreement was signed within the OECD, under which all direct or indirect aid to shipbuilding is to be considered unlawful.  This agreement, to which the EU is a party together with the USA, Japan, Korea and Norway, has not yet entered into force.  This should have happened on 1 January 1996 but is expected to do so in the near future.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission, however, has already signalled that it will no longer approve grant aid for tug projects as it would be against the spirit of Union policy to seek such support given the pending imposition of a blanket ban on aid to shipbuilders and shipowners.</P>
    <P>While this OECD agreements would appear to preclude the EU from grant aiding a tug project, I have asked officials of my Department to continue dialogue with the Commission on this subject.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 148 together.  Dublin Port and Docks Board has submitted the following proposals for development in the port:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> 1.  South Bank Lo/Lo Terminal</P>
    <P>This development of a Lift On/Lift Off facility was approved for funding from the Cohesion Fund on 9 April 1996.  This project can now be progressed forward.</P>
    <P>2.  North Quay Extension</P>
    <P>This development of a Roll On/Roll Off facility at the North Quay Extension was approved for funding from the Cohesion Fund on 13 April 1994.  This project is substantially complete.</P>
    <P>3.  Dublin Freight Terminal</P>
    <P>This development of a Terminal 1 Lift On/Lift Off facility was approved for funding from the Cohesion Fund on 13 July 1995. This project is proceeding according to plan.</P>
    <P>4.  Vehicle Traffic System</P>
    <P>Upgrading the Vehicle Traffic System. This project is at present under consideration by the Commission for funding from the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>5.  Storage Facilities</P>
    <P>Construction of handling and bulk storage facilities.  This project was approved for funding under the Operational Programme for Transport on 27 March 1996.  Tenders for the project are currently being evaluated.</P>
    <P>6.  Alexandra Quay</P>
    <P>Provision of a bulk crane and hopper. This project will be put forward for funding from the Operational Programme for Transport. The project is due to commence in 1997 subject to satisfying programme criteria and availability of funding.</P>
    <P>7.  Dublin Ferry Port</P>
    <P>Upgrading of facilities for new superferry.  This project was approved for funding under the Ireland/Wales Maritime INTERREG Programme on 24 January 1996.  The project is substantially <Col N="432" /> under way with the new linkspan already in operation.</P>
    <P>8.  Four other projects viz;</P>
    <P>Breakwater Refurbishment</P>
    <P>Fire Protection</P>
    <P>Environmental Landscaping</P>
    <P>Capital Dredging</P>
    <P>These projects will be put forward for funding under the Ireland/ Wales Maritime INTERREG Programme.</P>
    <P>The projects are due to commence in 1997-98.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can see from the above development programme, at an estimated cost of £33.415 million &mdash; EU grant aid of £17.946 million &mdash; that I am providing every assistance and encouragement to Dublin Port and Docks Board into efforts to develop the port.</P>
    <P>The substantial increases in shipping services, frequencies and tonnage throughput since 1993 in the port prove that this support is producing the desired results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The threat of pollution to the marine and coastal environment posed by shipping accidents is of major concern.  The recent <i>Sea Empress</i> incident shows the importance of preparedness measures to prevent or reduce the effects of major spills of oil or hazardous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the task of ensuring the availability of emergency towing facilities, i.e. professional salvage vessels and personnel suitable to help in case of an accident at sea or to handle drifting vessels to prevent grounding is an important precautionary measure. There has, however, been a reduction of available commercial dedicated salvage <Col N="433" /> tugs in Europe over the past five years due to the infrequent demand on their service.  The problem of the shortage of such vessels has been identified and is being examined by the European Union and Contracting Parties to the Bonn Agreement i.e. countries bordering the Baltic and North Sea.  Ireland has observer status at Bonn Agreement meetings and is represented by an official from the Irish Marine Emergency Service so that we can learn from this particular examination.  The UK, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany have already put in place dedicated state towage facilities.  In Ireland we have available to us harbour authority vessels and vessels of opportunity i.e. vessels passing our coastline at time of pollution.  The Minister is empowered to demand assistance from such vessels in response to a vessels in distress.</P>
    <P>The serious issues in relation to the management of such incidents as that involving the <i>Sea Empress,</i> in particular in relation to the emergency services response as the incident unfolded, will no doubt arise in the official review of the incident in the UK and in a separate report to be produced by the EU Commission. In view of the proximity of Milford Haven to our south-east coast we will be closely examining the findings of these reports with a view to helping to ensure that threats to our coastline are minimised.  The availability and capability of towing facilities in Ireland to respond to similar incidents in our waters will be reviewed in this context.</P>

EU funds under Ireland's Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99 are not currently being allocated to vessel construction projects.  Accordingly, no EU funding could have been provided in the case cited by the Deputy.  As the Deputy is aware, I have requested the Department to review the future directions of fleet policy.</P>
      <P>The Department is in touch with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, in relation to the specific matters raised by the Deputy and I will communicate further with the Deputy when I have examined the BIM report on the case.</P>

      <P>At a recent working group meeting of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, OSPAR, Ireland called on Contracting Parties to the Convention to incorporate into its Quality Status Report, (QSR), an inventory of sites which had been used for the dumping of munitions.  The completion of an inventory would be the first step towards the development of guidelines for the management and monitoring of such sites. Ireland was represented at that meeting by an officer of the Marine Institute. Our proposal has been agreed to at OSPAR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparations are under way for the completion of an environmental QSR for the entire area covered by OSPAR. <Col N="435" /> For the purpose of the report the Convention area has been divided into five sub-regions.  Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of Region III which includes the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, the area to the west of Ireland and the area to the west of Scotland.</P>
    <P>The UK authorities have advised me that they do not have specific details of the quantities of munitions dumped off the Irish coast because very few records for the period in question are still available. They assure me that they have supplied the Department with all information available to them which I in turn have made available to all Deputies in response to a number of parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>The best scientific evidence available at this stage is that if sites are left undisturbed, they will pose no danger.  The UK authorities have assured me that if monitoring of water quality and marine life which they carry out on a regular basis indicates any impact from the various munitions dumpsites in UK waters, consideration will be given to surveys and other investigations.</P>
    <P>The problem which arose in the Beaufort's Dyke dumpsite was due to disturbance of the munitions during the laying of the gas pipeline.  As the Deputies are aware the UK authorities have undertaken a survey of this site, the results of which are expected to be available later this year.  An official from the Marine Institute is liaising with UK scientists throughout this survey.  I will be meeting with the Scottish Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and the Environment and the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State, Ministry of Defence in Dublin to assess the results of the survey and to discuss what further steps are required at that stage.</P>
    <P>I will continue to seek both internationally at OSPAR and bilaterally with the UK for the development of guidelines for the management of dumpsites and where appropriate the putting in place of monitoring programmes.</P>

      <P>Galway County Council has included Tawin Island among its top four priorities for protection.  These were submitted to my Department for consideration for aid under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99.  My Department was concerned about certain aspects of the Tawin Island proposals and requested the county council to reconsider its application in the light of these concerns.  As a result the council has submitted revised proposals which are acceptable to the Department.</P>
      <P>As it will not now be possible to proceed with a major project in 1996, a revised coast protection programme for 1996 is now being prepared.  I have, accordingly, asked my officials to examine the priority proposals as submitted by the coastal local authorities with a view to identifying alternative works for completion this year.  Tawin Island is being considered in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.  The Department of Foreign Affairs consists of a headquarters in Dublin and 49 Missions located throughout the world.  In fulfilment of Ireland's international obligations, headquarters staff regularly travel to meetings and conferences abroad, particularly in the context of our membership of the European Union and the United Nations.  Diplomats posted abroad are required to travel regularly within and between the countries to which they are accredited.  My Department also incurs costs which arise from Presidential and official visits and from the transfer of officers and their families between posts.</P>
      <P>My Department's provision for all travel and subsistence costs in 1995 under the Foreign Affairs Vote was £3.863 million.  The 1995 outturn showed expenditure of £3.247 million for travel costs in total.  Not all travel costs arising in a particular year can be brought to account within the same year.  Of the travel costs charged in 1995, some will fall to 1994 and equally some 1995 costs can only be charged in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the travel policy in my Department is aimed at achieving the maximum in economies.  Requests to travel are vetted by designated travel officers in each division of the Department and close and regular monitoring of expenditure <Col N="440" /> in this area is the norm.  While business class air tickets are used where necessary, the Department tries as far as possible to maximise the use of economy tickets, including APEX/PEX tickets.</P>
    <P>Within the Vote for International Co-operation, the bilateral aid programme contains a small element for travel by civil servants in connection with Ireland's overseas aid programme.</P>
    <P>Accounting records do not readily identify the cost of business class travel and each destination to which officials travelled.  A considerable length of time and level of resources would be required to elicit this information in a comprehensive and accurate manner. The diversion of scarce resources could not be justified in this case.</P>
    <P>Total travel costs charged in 1995 from the Vote for the Office of the Tánaiste were £47,000 from a provision of £60,000.</P>

      <P>The European Council meeting in Copenhagen in June 1993 agreed that the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union and stated that accession would take place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership by <Col N="441" /> satisfying the economic and political conditions required.</P>
      <P>Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.  Membership presupposes the candidate's ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>These pre-conditions for membership of the Union apply equally to all associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Slovak Republic.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting in Essen in December 1994 decided a comprehensive strategy for preparing the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe for accession to the European Union.  The strategy is tailored to the needs of the associated countries, including the Slovak Republic, and its goal is to provide a route plan for the associated countries as they prepare for accession.  The strategy's core element is the preparation of the associated countries for integration into the EU's internal market, through the phased adoption of the Union's internal market acquis, with flanking policies to promote integration by means of financial assistance, dialogue and co-operation in a wide range of issues.  The Slovak Republic, in common with the other associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, participates in the pre-accession strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The even-handedness of the European Union with regard to the application for membership submitted by the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe is also clear from decisions taken by the European Council meeting in Madrid last December. On that occasion, the European Council asked the Commission to expedite preparation of its opinions on the applications made so that they can be forwarded to the Council as soon as <Col N="442" /> possible after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, and to embark upon preparation of a composite paper on enlargement.  The conclusions of the Madrid European Council explicitly noted that this procedure will ensure that the applicant countries are treated on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>At the bilateral level, the Europe Agreement in force between the EU and the Slovak Republic is the basic framework for the Union's contractual relations with that country.  Like the Europe Agreements with the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the agreement with the Slovak Republic is very wide-ranging and contains a clause recognising that the Slovak Republic's objective is membership of the Union.</P>
    <P>The second meeting of the EU-Slovak Association Council, established under the terms of the Europe Agreement, took place in February 1996.  The Association Council, which comprises representatives of the Union and its member states and of the Slovak Republic, welcomed the Slovak Republic's application for membership made last year.  The Union reiterated its commitment to assist Slovakia, as well as the other associated countries, in meeting the criteria for EU membership as set out by the Copenhagen European Council.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 55 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that eight Customs officials are assigned to the passenger terminal at Cork Airport, 14 to the passenger terminal at Shannon Airport and 16 to the passenger terminal at Dublin Airport with responsibility, as part of their normal duties, for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling.  Additionally, specialist units of the Customs national drugs team are assigned to the three airports viz. an intelligence unit to Cork Airport and an intelligence unit and a sniffer-dog unit each to Shannon and Dublin Airports.  These specialist units are engaged exclusively in combating drug smuggling both by air travellers and in commercial cargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normal Customs checks are applied to passengers and their baggage arriving at the airports on flights from non-EU countries.  Deputies will be aware that in the Single Market situation passengers from other EU countries cannot be required to clear Customs by entering the red or green channels and cannot be subjected to normal Customs checks. Certain checks on these passengers and their baggage, in particular checks to prevent and detect drug smuggling, may <Col N="444" /> be carried out, but they must be unobtrusive, selective and highly targeted. Similar criteria apply to Customs checks on cargo from other EU countries.</P>
    <P>The Customs Service continuously monitors the movement of passengers and cargo through the airports and in particular it monitors the movement of known or suspected drug smugglers. Because of the constraints on intra-Community checks to which I have referred, Customs now rely on special measures, including intensive gathering of intelligence, close co-operation with airlines and air courier companies, direct personal and computer links to Customs Services in other jurisdictions, as well as profiling and risk analysis techniques to pinpoint suspect consignments and to target the smuggler or suspected smuggler.  They also work in close collaboration with the Garda.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the anti-drugs smuggling measures now employed at the airports, the ordinary traveller from an EU country will generally be unaware of Customs activity and surveillance.  The measures taken are nonetheless effective, as evidenced by the level of seizures and arrests made. Since 1993 drugs with an estimated street value of £6.1 million have been seized at the three airports and some of these have been quite substantial.  For example, in the past six months, individual seizures of three kilograms of heroin and one kilogram of cocaine have been made at Dublin Airport and a seizure of 148 kilograms of Khat, a drug similar to cannabis, has been made at Shannon Airport.  Over the past three years more than 20 people detected by Customs smuggling drugs through Dublin and Shannon Airports have been subsequently charged with these offences in the courts.  To date, there have been 15 convictions and jail sentences ranging from three months to six years have been imposed in 13 cases, with further cases still pending before the courts.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied with the present staffing levels at Cork, Shannon and Dublin Airports to combat drug trafficking.  Staff numbers <Col N="445" /> assigned to this work at these airports are, of course, kept under review by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The total net amount paid in respect of domestic and overseas travel, subsistence and miscellaneous costs associated with such travel undertaken by officials of my Department was £271,930.19, of which £64,769.24 is accounted for by business class air travel.</P>
      <P>The destinations to which officials travelled most frequently were Brussels, London, Luxembourg and Paris.  Other destinations visited included Amsterdam, Beijing, Cannes, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Geneva, Madrid, Nancy, Nice, Ottawa, Seville, Strasbourg, Stockholm, Toronto, United Kingdom, various locations, Washington and Zurich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has a policy of encouraging officials to seek out the method of travelling which offers the best value for money and tries to ensure that only such travel is undertaken as is consistent with the efficient discharge of official duty.  Business class travel is <Col N="446" /> used where the necessary flexibility which this mode of travel provides is required.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to the creation of vibrant and competitive markets in every sphere of economic activity with the aim of promoting economic development in Ireland.  The concept of a third banking force is not just about the creation of another banking entity, rather, it is about the construction of a framework which of itself supports and encourages a competitive banking market, and, within the context of this framework, to identify the role which the State banks and the TSB, with An Post and the credit unions, can play.</P>
      <P>The Government has been making steady progress on the creation of such a framework.  In this regard, a Credit Union Bill which will broaden the range of services which credit unions can offer is being drafted.  Moreover, the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which is going through the House, will strengthen the role of the Competition Authority by giving it enforcement powers and will provide for heavy fines for those found to be engaging in unfair competition.</P>
      <P>Within this framework there are a number of options for restructuring the State banks, including sale and possibilities for mergers and strategic alliances.  Each of these options would have varying impacts on competition, employment and the delivery of cost-effective, customer-based services.</P>
      <P>The various options are being examined by myself and a number of Government colleagues with a view to identifying the most effective solution having regard to the nature of the individual institutions, their particular customer markets, the needs of the whole community in its broadest sense and developments in the EU.  This is a complex and difficult issue.  We will only have one chance to get it right, and getting it right must, therefore, be given priority.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The total cost of all travel, including subsistence, undertaken by officials in my Department during 1995 amounted to £419,157.72.</P>
      <P>The total cost of foreign travel, including subsistence, undertaken by officials in my Department during 1995 amounted to £245,640.68.  Based on the results of a special exercise undertaken in 1995 on an analysis of travel costs generally about 80 per cent of air travel is undertaken in business class. However, it should be noted that the attributed costs would include an element of hotel costs, which are frequently part of a package arrangement.</P>
      <P>The reply to the question put down on 21 May 1996 on the total cost of ministerial travel in 1995 includes the cost of officials accompanying both myself and my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Shea and Currie.</P>
      <P>Details of the destinations to which officials travelled, including accompanying ministerial missions, follow.</P>
      <P>The policy in relation to travel by officials in my Department is that such travel is only undertaken where necessary and in particular to fulfil Ireland's commitments within the EU and the WHO and, where considered appropriate, to contribute to and be apprised of the health service initiatives and developments in other countries.  The cost of such travel is strictly in line with the various rates as set out in Department of Finance circulars which issue from time to time.  Particular attention is given to the procurement of the appropriate travel and hotel arrangements on the most economical basis.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons aged 16 to 25 including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The decision on whether a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the cheif executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.  Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are <Col N="454" /> assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that when assessing the medical card entitlement of a family, the income guidelines include an allowance for each dependant and where that dependant is in full-time third level education and is not grant-aided, this allowance is doubled.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons, be they parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> There are currently two consultant urologists employed in the public sector in Cork, one in the Mercy Hospital and one in Cork University Hospital.  Arrangements are in place for cross-cover between the two hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a key recommendation of the recent comhairle review of consultant manpower needs for the Cork region was the establishment of a pan-hospital structure. This structure is designed to act as a vehicle for achieving consensus between the agencies in Cork with regard to the priority consultant posts and the location of these posts within the Cork hospital system.</P>
      <P>I understand that the consultation process set up under the pan-hospital structure, in association with the management of the agencies concerned, is almost complete.  I anticipate detailed proposals in relation to agreed priority consultant posts in the near future.</P>

      <P>In practice individual schools of nursing have operated higher requirements than the Bord Altranais minimum due to the numbers of applicants applying for places in nurse training each year. The requirements actually operated have also differed between schools.</P>
      <P>The education requirement applying to the registration-diploma programme is based on the Bord Altranais minimum, adapted to take account of third level requirements.  This education requirement is: grade C/C3 or higher in two higher level papers and grade D/D3 or higher in four ordinary of higher level papers in the subjects Irish, English, mathematics, another language, a laboratory science subject and one other, accumulated over not more than two sittings of the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applicants who satisfy this requirement and who are 17 years of <Col N="456" /> age by 1 January of the year of application are eligible to compete for places in all schools offering the new programme. This standard entry requirement facilitates centralised processing of applications by the nursing applications centre which enable applicants to apply to all schools offering the registration-diploma programme by way of a single application.  The result is a streamlined system for applicants avoiding the need for a multiplicity of applications to individual schools which applied previously.  It should be noted that 50 per cent of the participating schools of nursing accept applications for the new registration-diploma programme on the basis of a lower educational requirement than they previously applied.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> To date this year, 181 cases of hepatitis A in the population as a whole have been reported to the Department of Health.  The data available under the reporting system do not identify those cases which relate to pupils in schools.</P>
      <P>The Department is, however, aware of an outbreak of hepatitis A involving two national schools in Bagenalstown, County Carlow.  The outbreak, which started in late December 1995, is also present in the community.  The total number of case notified to date is 85, and 40 of these occurred in school children attending Bagenalstown national schools.</P>

    <P>The South Eastern Health Board informed parents and teachers, both in <Col N="458" /> writing and at meetings, of the facts relating to the disease and the hygiene control measures required to limit its spread.  Appropriate hygiene measures were implemented.</P>
    <P>All pupils in the schools were tested for vital antibody levels to determine which children might benefit from immunisation against the disease, and parents were invited to bring those children for immunisation.  The majority of the children involved have now been vaccinated.</P>
    <P>The outbreak within the two schools appears to be coming under control. However, because of the incubation period of two to six weeks, it will be another month before the health board can be certain that this is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The key issues for my Department for the Irish Presidency are in the areas of drug dependence, blood safety, and reduction of tobacco consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to drug dependence, I look forward to a successful conciliation procedure with the European Parliament <Col N="459" /> under the co-decision procedure of the Treaty on European Union followed by the adoption of the EU Programme of Action on Drug Dependence under the Irish Presidency.  This programme is one element of the European Union Action Plan to Combat Drugs which is primarily the responsibility of Ministers for Justice.</P>
    <P>The drug dependence programme will be the first of its kind and provides for actions in the areas of improving public awareness, using opportunities provided in other Union policies, instruments and programmes to combat drug dependency, and supporting initiatives and actions relating to young people of school-going age.</P>
    <P>The programme will run for five years and has an indicative budget of 28.5 million ECU.</P>
    <P>In relation to blood safety, my aim is to help pave the way towards development of an integrated EU programme on blood safety and self-sufficiency which would (a) guarantee the safety of the blood supply chain and (b) ultimately make the EU self-sufficient in blood and blood products.  To this end, I am arranging for a conference to take place in Limerick in September which will include experts, administrators and policy makers in blood safety.  I am also inviting my colleagues, the EU Ministers for Health to attend.  I hope that, resulting from the recommendations from the conference, a resolution calling on the Commission to draw up an integrated programme can be produced at the Health Council in November.</P>
    <P>With reference to tobacco, a proposal for a directive imposing a total ban on advertising has been under discussion in the Health Council since 1991.  Ireland supports the proposal but it has not been possible to secure majority support for it.  I am concerned to maintain the fall in smoking levels which we have brought about through our own national policies which include limitations on advertising budgets.  It is important therefore to maintain the momentum at EU level and it will be a priority under <Col N="460" /> the Irish Presidency to keep this issue at the forefront of discussions with our EU partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Funding in the sum of £2.49 million in 1994, £2.37 million in 1995 and £2.5 million in 1996 was/is being provided to the Blood Transfusion Service Board to support various programmes associated with hepatitis C. These include screening programmes to identify persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of blood products or blood transfusions; counselling services for persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C and an <i>ex-gratia</i> expenses scheme to ensure that persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product are in a position to avail of the screening, counselling and treatment services put in place for them.</P>
      <P>Treatment for persons who have tested positive for hepatitis C from the use of blood products or blood transfusions is provided at special consultant-staffed clinics at six designated hospitals in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Total funding in the sum of £1.8 million was provided for these services in 1994; £1.98 million was provided in 1995 and £2 million has been made available in 1996.  Treatment, including prescribed medication, is provided free of charge from the six designated hospitals.</P>
      <P>Funding has been provided to support groups for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of blood products or transfusions.  A total of £5,000 was made available in 1994, £79,800 in 1995 and £149,500 in 1996 to Positive Action, Transfusion Positive and the Irish Haemophilia Society.  An application for funding from the Irish Kidney Association to support its members who have contracted hepatits C was received by my Department this month and it will be given every consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal to provide compensation to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of human immunoglobulin-Anti-D, whole blood or blood products was established on 15 December 1995.  The awards of the tribunal are calculated by reference to the principle which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort.  I am not <Col N="462" /> therefore in a position to estimate the cost of providing compensation but £60 million was set aside in a special fund under the Appropriations Act, 1995 in respect of awards expected to be made in 1996.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has to date heard 64 cases &mdash; two of which have been adjourned for further hearing.  Awards have been made in the other 62 claims, the total amount awarded being £6.67 million.  The size of awards ranges from £15,000 to £324,321 and no award has been rejected.  To date, approximately 1,400 persons have been identified as positive for hepatitis C infection.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the Centre for Independent Living's proposal for the establishment of an independent living fund to finance the provision of a personal assistance service for people with physical disabilities.  Officials from my Department recently met with representatives of the Centre for Independent Living to discuss this proposal as well as other service needs of people with disabilities.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will wish to know that there are currently eight designated short stay beds in the accident and emergency unit at Cork University Hospital.  These beds are used primarily for patients who require overnight observation or short stay.  All patients in the accident and emergency unit are initially placed under the care of the A &amp; E consultant, and are subsequently referred on to other services, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, during 1995, the Southern Health Board established a working group to review the organisation and management of the accident and emergency services in Cork.  Central to this review is the question of bed management.  I understand that the report of the group has recently been completed and is being considered by the board.  I expect to be in receipt of this report shortly.</P>

      <P>The total cost of business class travel incurred in 1995 by civil servants of my Department was £35,800 approximately. Of this total, approximately 73 per cent represents EU related travel, a substantial proportion of which is recovered from the EU.  The destinations involved were Amsterdam, Birmingham, Brussels, London, Luxembourg, Madrid, Paris and Strasbourg. The business class travel facility, or executive class travel as it is sometimes referred to, is availed of when the other travel options have been evaluated and deemed not to be viable.</P>
      <P>The total cost of all travel, including business class travel, incurred in 1995 by the civil servants in my Department was £64,500 approximately.  When engaging in travel, within the State or elsewhere, staff of the Department try to ensure, having regard to all the circumstances, that the most economic means possible is used and that best value for money is obtained.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of a general EU policy banning the recruitment of persons of more than 35 years of age, although I understand that the European Commission operates an age limit of 35 for basic recruitment grades with derogations in certain circumstances. The practices of the various institutions of the EU in relation to conditions of recruitment are primarily matters for the institutions concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland I will shortly bring forward employment equality legislation which will prohibit the arbitrary imposition of age discrimination in employment.  This <Col N="465" /> will build on improved age limit provisions in Irish public service employments. An upper age limit of 50 years now applies to posts in the Civil Service, which were previously restricted to those under 30 years of age, and to most posts in health boards and local authorities.</P>

While I have no proposals to amend the regulations at this stage, I intend to review them in the light of experience of their operation.  I do not think it would be right to initiate any such review until at least one year after the commencement of the regulations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>In response to the report from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the report, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected large schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway urban areas.  In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage will receive a targeted programme of supports.  Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has been commissioned to contact the target schools and invite applications for consideration for support under this new initiative.  The Education Research Centre has indicated that schools will be contacted very shortly.  On the basis of information currently available to the Department, the school mentioned by the Deputy will be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All schools applying for support under this initiative will be required to declare their position under a range of specific criteria which have been devised by the Education Research Centre.  The criteria in question take on <Col N="473" /> board the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency and are designed to identify the prevalence of educational disadvantage in both urban and rural settings.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted and will advise my Department of the outcome.  My Department will then invite each of the selected schools to submit a five year development plan. Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and to put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage over the period of the plan.  Qualification for support under the initiative will be dependent on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>Under section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995, provision has been made for tax relief on tuition fees paid by students who are attending private third level colleges which are outside the scope of the free fees initiative.  Such students or their parents, as appropriate, may now avail of the standard rate of tax relief on tuition fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years' duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy codes of standards laid down by me.</P>
      <P>Tax relief will be available on tuition fees for full-time undergraduate courses up to a maximum level of £2,500.  This figure applies uniformly for all approved courses, and is generous enough to cover in full the fees for the vast majority of third level courses in private colleges.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1996, provides for tax relief at the standard rate on tuition fees paid by part-time students, including evening students.  This relief will apply to undergraduate courses of a minimum of two years' duration in third level institutions which are recognised for the purposes of higher education grants.  The relief also applies to similar courses in private third level colleges which satisfy the codes of standards. The tax relief will be available to those in work who are paying for their course of study from their own income.</P>

Shortly afterwards a Department psychologist visited the school last attended by the pupil and was informed that the pupil was attending a specialist clinic and a psychological assessment would be carried out there.  I understand that this assessment was carried out in mid-April. The Department has now received copies of this assessment and of previous assessments in the case and will be participating in a forthcoming case conference organised by the various services concerned.  My Department will then consider what educational provision is required for the pupil concerned.</P>

      <P>The national programme of training in remedial education for teachers of first and second level pupils is available only to teachers in permanent posts, who are fully probated and employed as teachers in officially designated remedial posts.  As the teacher in question is not employed in such a capacity, it would not be possible for her to attend the course.  I regret it is not possible at present to make a further remedial teacher available to this school.</P>

      <P>I have published the codes of standards for the approval of colleges and courses.  There will be no delay in the implementation of the codes.  They take effect in the 1996-97 academic year.  Tax relief is available in the 1996-97 tax year in respect of colleges and courses which satisfy the codes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a requirement in the code of standards for the approval of colleges which will not take effect until the 1998-99 academic year.  This will require colleges to offer a minimum number of courses validated by the National Council for Education Awards, NCEA.  The <Col N="480" /> requirement is that there or one third, whichever is the lesser, of their full-time undergraduate courses will have to be validated by the NCEA.  A transition period of two years is being allowed to enable colleges to meet this requirement. Colleges do not have to meet this requirement to secure approval for tax relief purposes in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 academic years.</P>
    <P>The listing of approved colleges and courses is now being drawn up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, my Department is responsible for six Votes: (1) Office of the Minister for Justice, (2) the Garda Síochána, (3) Prisons, (4) Courts, (5) Land Registry of Deeds and (6) Charitable <Col N="481" /> Donations and Bequests.  The approximate total cost of travel, foreign and home travel for civil servants, including prison officers, court clerks etc., in the areas in question was as follows: (1) Office of the Minister for Justice, Department of Justice, £461,660; (3) Prisons, £854,055; (4) Courts, £397,068; (5) Land Registry and Registry of Deeds £13,198 and (6) Charitable Donations and Bequests £48.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of foreign travel, it was not possible, in the time available, to provide a breakdown of the cost between civil servants and non-civil servants under the Votes for which I have responsibility.  However, I am able to provide an approximate breakdown of the total foreign travel costs as follows: (1) Office of the Minister for Justice, Department of Justice, £244,097; (3) Prisons, £9,191; (4) Courts, £19,391; (5) Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, £2,475 and (6) Charitable Donations and Bequests, nil.</P>
    <P>It is the practice in my Department, when making travel arrangements for officials, to have regard to the requirements of the individual travelling &mdash; meeting time, duration etc. &mdash; and, on this basis, to book the most economical flight, having obtained quotations from a number of sources.  Business class travel is used where appropriate.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The total cost of all travel and subsistence in Ireland and abroad undertaken by civil servants in my Department in 1995, net of EU refunds, amounted to £2,543,124.</P>
      <P>The total cost of business class travel abroad by civil servants in 1995 amounted to £99,468, of which £36,270 was refundable by the EU.</P>
      <P>Of the total figure of £99,468 for business class travel, £41,809 was incurred in connection with international consultancy work on behalf of the EU and World Bank undertaken by officers of the Department, the cost of which was recovered from the fees earned.  Therefore the net cost of business class travel abroad was £21,389.</P>
      <P>The business class destinations covered were as follows: Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg, Paris, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Amsterdam, Munich, Athens, Florence, Vienna, Vilnius, Warsaw and Tirana.</P>

    <P>It is the Department's general policy <Col N="485" /> to ensure that only such travel as is necessary for the efficient discharge of the Department's responsibilities is undertaken.  In the case of air travel, business class is used where flexibility and interchangeability of flights are required.

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 120 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Last March, the Government approved proposals in relation to the recommendations of the Task Force on Security for the Elderly and work has been under way since then in implementing the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The extension of income tax relief to persons who install security systems in the home of their elderly relatives living alone was included in this year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was made available to provide grant aid to voluntary groups for security initiatives for the elderly.  An advisory committee was established to devise a suitable scheme for the distribution of grants.  The scheme, entitled Scheme of Community Support for Older People, is being advertised today, Wednesday, 29 May in the national newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been agreed between my Department and Telecom Éireann that <Col N="486" /> pensioners who are receiving a living alone allowance but who do not have a telephone at present will be eligible to install a telephone line for £75.  This represents a substantial reduction on the normal installation cost.  The Department will shortly write to each of these pensioners giving them details of this offer.  As soon as the pensioners obtain a telephone, they will be eligible to claim free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>In March 1996, my Department wrote to sponsors of the student summer job scheme asking them, when planning for this year's scheme, to consider projects which would enhance or develop security measures for the elderly who live in remote areas to help make them more secure in their homes.  Examination of the applications received from sponsors is currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>Discussions are currently taking place between my Department and the Department of Justice to set up a campaign to provide elderly people with specific information and advice on how to improve personal security both inside and outside their homes.  It is intended to initiate this campaign shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The total cost of all travel and subsistence by officials in my Department was £323,734.21 in 1995, inclusive of £102,360.08 in relation to travel on EU business, which is recoupable from the EU.  The detailed information sought by the Deputy in relation to specific destinations to which officers travelled is not readily available, and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.  Policy in relation to officials travelling abroad for business purposes is that they avail of the class of travel which offers the most appropriate degree of flexibility required, consistent with the general requirement for value for money.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>The cost of domestic and foreign travel, including subsistence and other associated costs, by officials of my Department in 1995 was £1,043,963.50. This figure includes the travel costs of the staff of the Department, the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Companies Registration Office and the evaluation unit for the EU Industry Operational Programme.  The cost figure does not take account of any refunds from the EU and other sources which may already have been received or are due in resepect of trips undertaken by officers of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department that only essential travel is undertaken and that, having regard to suitability of schedules, advantage is taken of the most economical means of transport available at the time of travel.  It is also the policy that unless there are good reasons to the contrary only one officer should attend meetings and the attendance of more than one officer must be justified.  My Department's policy in relation to business class air travel is that, when available, first or similar class travel may be used by Minister, Ministers of State, officers of secretary and assistant secretary rank and corresponding grades.  It may also be used by an officer of lower rank when, in order to deal with official business which cannot otherwise be dealt with, s/he necessarily travels with an officer entitled to travel at such class.  Despite this entitlement, the secretary and assistant secretaries in the Department have agreed to avail themselves of economy class travel where appropriate.  In relation to air travel on the Dublin-Brussels route, <Col N="490" /> officers generally use restricted business class tickets.</P>
    <P>Where officers use their private cars on official business the normal Civil Service rates and conditions apply.</P>
    <P>Schedule of destinations outside Ireland to which officers of the Department of Enterprise and Employment travelled in 1995: Seville, Bonn, Florence, Palma, Malaga, Warsaw, Copenhagen, Luxembourg, Barcelona, China, Helsinki, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Geneva, Dusseldorf, Strasbourg, London, Munich, Athens, Toulouse, Madrid, Paris, Zurich, Alicante, Turin, Vienna, Berlin, Brussels, USA, Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Irish beef industry exports beef to approximately 90 countries throughout the world. However, in the immediate aftermath of the BSE crisis a number of important third country markets were closed to Irish beef and cattle.  Following intensive efforts by the Government, most of these are now open again.  I am continuing with my efforts to seek the reopening of the few remaining markets still closed.  However, I am not aware of any new markets acquired since the scare.</P>

This includes the cost of foreign travel by the Minister and Minister of State which has already been addressed in a written reply to the Deputy on 21 May 1996.  My policy in relation to official travel is that it is only undertaken where it is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>I understand that CIE invited the residents of Arran Quay Terrace to a meeting in Heuston Station on 22 May 1996 to facilitate discussion of matters, including matters of a personal nature, of concern to the residents.  I also understand that CIE is now proceeding with plans for further meetings with the residents and their public representatives.</P>
      <P>Management of the public consultation programme on the proposed light rail network is a matter for CIE and I do not propose to dictate to the company how the process should be run.  I am satisfied that there will be circumstances where one to one meetings or consultation with small groups will be necessary and it would be wrong of me to rule that out.  However, as I indicated in my reply to Question No. 311 of 21 May 1996 I am satisfied that CIE or its public relations consultants are not pursuing a policy of excluding public representatives from meetings to discuss the proposed light rail network.</P>

      <P>One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the Efficiency Audit <Col N="496" /> Group was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  At present the average age of privates is 33 years and of non-commissioned officers is 36 years.</P>
      <P>The fixed term contract will allow greater scope for regular intakes of new recruits and thus contribute to a lowering of the age profile of non-commisioned personnel.  The Defence Forces need a regular injection of young, fit personnel to maintain their operational effectiveness.  In addition, the fixed term contract will provide the opportunity to a much larger number of young people to avail of the valuable training and experience of service in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of personnel on five year contracts was introduced following consultation with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Association, PDFORRA.  Further consultation on this matter will take place with PDFORRA in the context of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan.</P>
      <P>The implementation plan which was recently approved by Government provides for an intake of a total of 1,000 recruits over the next three years, including 200 recruits this year.  The recruits will be selected by means of an open competition which will be advertised in the public press.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in that regard shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department's primary objective in relation to the safety of passenger ferries operating on Irish routes and in Irish waters is to ensure that the highest standards of safety are set and enforced.</P>
      <P>Irish-registered passenger vessels are subjected annually to through inspection by my Department's Marine Survey Office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  These vessels are required to be equipped, maintained and inspected to the highest international standards.  Foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports are also inspected regularly in exercise of Ireland's obligations as a port State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a large international dimension to maritime safety legislation which is governed primarily by the International Maritime <Col N="500" /> Organisation &mdash; IMO &mdash; and, increasingly, the European Union, the IMO's conventions are the cornerstone of maritime safety regulations throughout the world.  My Department gives the highest priority to introducing into Irish law the IMO's constantly evolving standards for ferry safety.</P>
    <P>The European Union has introduced a regulation to make the IMO's International Safety Management &mdash; ISM &mdash; code mandatory for all regular ro-ro passenger ferry services from July 1996, some two years ahead of the timescale envisaged by the IMO.  The ISM code will enhance the safe management, operation and pollution prevention of ro-ro ferries.</P>
    <P>In November 1995, the IMO Assembly adopted a number of additional amendments to the Safety of Life at Sea &mdash; SOLAS &mdash; Convention, based on proposals put forward by an IMO panel of experts on ro-ro passenger ferry safety, which was set up following the loss of the <i>Estonia.</i> While welcoming these amendments, a number of north-west European countries, including Ireland, were of the opinion that more stringent safety standards in relation to ship stability were warranted. In the absence of global consensus on this issue, the IMO had made provision for regional agreements within the SOLAS framework.  As a result of protracted negotiations on this issue the north-west European countries produced &ldquo;the Stockholm Agreement&rdquo; on enhanced stability standards for ro-ro ferries in north-west Europe and the Baltic Sea.  All ro-ro passenger ferry routes between Ireland and the United Kingdom and Ireland and France are included.  I am very satisfied at the outcome of these regional initiatives which will significantly enhance the safety of ro-ro passenger ferries.</P>
    <P>Irish shipping interests were consulted during the negotiation of this agreement and their submissions taken into account.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for coastal protection lies with the property owner, whether it be a private individual or a local authority.  The Department of the Marine, under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, in support of local authorities will invest some £5.1 million in priority protection works around our coast. Twenty-five per-cent of this must be provided by local authorities.</P>
      <P>To identify priority protection works for consideration under the programme, the Department of the Marine sought prioritised proposal for protection works from the coastal local authorities. Any works to be funded under the programme are required to show a positive cost benefit over their designed lifetime.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the proposals submitted exceeds £25 million.  Therefore, it will not be possible to undertake them all.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the figures I mentioned that the present allocation is not adequate to meet our needs.  I am reviewing how additional funds for coastal protection can be secured.</P>
      <P>Present funding is particularly limited and securing additional funds will be difficult.  In view of this, aid will be given only in circumstances in which the erosion problem has been fully studied. Too often in the past works have been undertaken to address the immediate problem without reference to long-term solutions.  I am more interested in aiding works what will provide a long-term solution, if such is possible, and would like to see more investment by local authorities, in conjunction with my Department, in considering the long-term situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and No. 151 together.</P>
      <P>The total cost of all travel undertaken in 1995 by civil servants at the Department of the Marine amounted to £861,808.  This figure includes costs of payment of subsistence at standard Civil Service rates.  The figure also includes expenditure on travel by technical staff in connection with vessel safety surveys, which costs are recouped from shipowners. In addition, an amount of £114,848 is recoupable from the EU in respect of EU-related travel.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Department to keep travel costs to the minimum necessary consistent with the discharge of its domestic and international obligations. The Department of the Marine has responsibilities which extend throughout the State, together with significant international obligations eg. EU fisheries and maritime fora, the International Maritime Organisation and others which necessitate travel by officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amount of £144,909 was incurred on business class travel.  The bulk of this related to EU travel, costs of which are refunded by the EU.  In making travel arrangements the Department takes into account such factors as suitability of flight departure times and special fares &mdash; which can include one night's free accommodation for the Brussels and London destinations.  From time to <Col N="503" /> time, the business class option is the only one available because of time or other constraints.</P>
    <P>Officials using business class fares travelled to Aberdeen, Bergen, Bristol, Brussels, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Gothenberg, London, Luxembourg, Palma, Paris, Reykjavik, Rotterdam and St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.</P>
