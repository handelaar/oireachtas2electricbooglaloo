      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10 and 11; No. 11 shall be taken at the conclusion of the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 20 and the order shall resume thereafter.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the resumed debate on No. 10: (i) the speech of the main spokespersons for <Col N="902" /> the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party, who shall be called upon to contribute to the debate first, shall not exceed 40 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; and (iii) Members may share time.  (2) The statements on No. 11 shall be confined to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party; the Minister for Justice; the Leader of the Progressive Democrats Party; and the Minister for Social Welfare; and shall not exceed ten minutes in each case.  (3) Private Members' Business shall also be taken tomorrow between 12.45 p.m. and 2.15 p.m. and the proceedings on the Second Stage thereof shall be brought to a conclusion at 2.15 p.m. tomorrow. Private Members' Business shall be No. 26.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 10 is the resumed budget debate, which prevents Members of the Opposition tabling questions to the respective Ministers for at least three weeks because of the anticipatory rule, in other words, the questions would be ruled out of order because they would be seen as anticipating the debate on that Minister's speech. Yesterday I asked the Government Chief Whip to allow a question and answer session with the respective Minister or Minister of State after his or her speech.  That was refused.  I now formally propose an amendment to item No. 1, to insert after (1) (ii): &ldquo;After the speech by a Minister or Minister of State there should be a 15 minute period for a question and answer session with the relevant Minister or Minister of State on the content of said speech&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to that. I had the impression the Opposition knew all the answers because they seem to voice their opinions without waiting <Col N="903" /> to hear the facts.  Such a request would render the debate impracticable.  Each speaker will have an opportunity to state his or her position and other speakers will be able to follow those debates and answer any points that arise in the Minister's speech.  Unfortunately, Deputy McDowell is not present this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In due course such a facility will enable Members to put a point to a Member in possession whether they be in Opposition or in Government.  It is among the proposals being brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the reasonably near future.  I am sorry I cannot agree to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is yet another example of the openness and accountability of the Government.  In view of the Taoiseach's refusal to accede to this request will the Government Whip agree to a relaxation of the anticipatory rule regarding parliamentary questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the matters being considered as part of the package of proposals on Dáil reform. The appropriate way to raise a question of that nature is through the Whips.  I do not have a closed mind on the matter; it should be considered.  I realise the problem having experienced occasions in the <Col N="904" /> past where the anticipatory rule regarding the budget debate continued for much longer than three weeks &mdash; one could not ask questions about budgetary matters for two or three months.  At least the three week period is much less than obtained in the past.  The Deputy's suggestion will be considered.  There are many good aspects in the budget and we welcome all questions because they give us an opportunity to say more about what is in the budget.  This is a budget that will appear better with age.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an opportunity to read the report about which I am generally positive.  Will the Government consider putting forward a motion on this matter?  If the report were approved by this House, it would be powerful.  I put forward that suggestion because I want to maintain the all-party approach to these issues and I will not be putting forward a motion.  Perhaps before the debate begins the Government will consider putting forward a motion approving the commission's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a constructive proposal which will be considered carefully. The Government is most anxious to proceed, in conjunction with the British Government, with the follow through on this report.  We are engaged in intensive dialogue with that Government on the matter.  If a resolution of the kind suggested by the Deputy would be helpful in that process, and it might well be, we would be most anxious to act on that.  I ask the Deputy to allow us some time to consider the matter.  I see no reasons or principle for not putting forward such a motion; it is tactical considerations that might influence one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have agreed the form of debate on that matter.  If the Tánaiste is anxious to put forward a <Col N="905" /> motion, I would be open to that procedure. On initial examination of the report we welcome it, but I would like to see the terms of a motion before we debate the matter in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason for not debating the issue in the form of a motion today.  We should allow time for discussion between the parties in the House on the form of a motion and give the Government the opportunity to pursue its discussions with the British Government and with all parties so as to achieve the best outcome.  It is a matter on which there may be discussion during the coming week or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I briefly raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the Bills dealing with justice matters which it is expected will be published prior to Easter.  The Taoiseach informed us that the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill is the only Bill listed by the Government, although other Bills are at various stages of drafting.  In view of the increase in crime, murders, missing persons and other matters about which everybody in the House is gravely concerned, will the Taoiseach agree to debate in Government time the Misuse of Drugs Bill for which many people outside the House are calling?  In the last year our spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, our senior backup team, legal officials, criminologists, lay people and others worked on a Bill dealing with this matter.  During the term of office of Fianna Fáil Governments two or three Bills introduced by Deputy Shatter were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not discuss the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to take this Bill in Government <Col N="906" /> time?  I accept there is a difficulty with parliamentary draftsmen but if the Bill is not perfect it can be amended in the House.  I ask the Taoiseach not to wait until March or April but to take the Bill in Government time and we will accept any amendments put forward.  There is a call by the public for this House to act early in this session on the crime issue and I ask the Taoiseach to agree to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government is at a very advanced stage of work on a Bill on precisely that topic.  I expect the text of that Bill will be approved within the next three weeks or so and it will then be published.  I have expressed my appreciation of the work Fianna Fáil has done in presenting its Bill.  I assure the House all the matters contained in the Fianna Fáil Bill will be actively considered by the Government in the finalisation of our legislation, which we expect to present to the House very early.  Three weeks is not an unreasonable delay. There are obvious advantages in involving in preparation of the legislation people who enforce the law.  The Garda Síochána and justice authorities have been involved in the preparation of the Government's Bill and it would be best and most sensible in terms of having a law that works to allow the Government to present its Bill, taking into account the proposals and ideas in the Fianna Fáil Bill for which I have expressed appreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the only legislation the Government is preparing to deal with crime.  We expect that the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be ready in the spring.  We are also preparing a Criminal Law Bill to change the distinction between felonies and misdeameanours and a Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill to deal with the plea of insanity in criminal offences.  There is a range of other measures in prospect in this area including the additional provision in the budget for prison places. This will include a significant reorganisation of prison accommodation which <Col N="907" /> will make available a very substantial number of places to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Taoiseach's remarks about our Justice spokesperson and others involved in drafting of the Bill.  The information I received from the Taoiseach's office dated 17 January lists only one Bill on this matter for publication this session. Even if a Bill is published around Easter we will be lucky if it is signed by the President before summer.  It is not likely to be taken before the autumn.  The Minister for Justice issued the heads of this Bill last July but our group had been working on the legislation a long time at that stage.  I contend &mdash; this is open to debate &mdash; that our Bill is much more detailed and comprehensive than that outlined by the Minister, although she may have moved away from what she outlined.  Since major legislation is urgently demanded by the public to deal with crime it seems reasonable to take this Bill and if the Government seeks to put forward substantial amendments we will readily agree to them.  The Judicial Separation Act, 1989, was handled this way and, therefore, it seems reasonable to ask the Taoiseach to accept our proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to recognise that any legislation in this area will involve a substantial reduction of the rights of accused or potentially accused persons.  That is something that requires the very best legal and constitutional advice available to the Government. The Government is preparing the legislation in that light because we want the legislation to work, we do not want it open to constitutional challenge, we do not want to pass legislation just for the sake of it and find it does not work in the courts.  Therefore, we are taking the necessary constitutional and administrative advice from our legal and security advisers to get this legislation right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have assured Deputy Bertie Ahern <Col N="908" /> that we will carefully consider all the proposals prepared by his party to ensure that, if not already included, the best of them will be included in the Government package.  We intend to present that Bill within the next month or so.</P>
    <P>The reason there is one item of legislation only in the programme is that, over many years, I have noticed an optimistic tendency to include items of legislation in the programme for a session which did not actually appear on time. We have given very strict instructions for this session to include only those items of legislation we are absolutely sure will appear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach says about the rights of accused persons.  Certainly in any civilised society their rights must be protected but victims also have rights and, with that in mind, we need more than legislation because there is a knee-jerk response whenever there is an escalation in crime, as at present, to introduce more laws.  We need to examine the management of the Garda Síochána and the management of our prisons, expenditure on prisons has risen by 50 per cent over the past five years whereas the number of prisoners increased by 7 per cent only.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House an undertaking to have a debate on crime because, given the level of public concern and as elderly people in particular are very frightened, it is unreal not to have such a debate?  The Minister for Justice gave an extensive interview on a radio programme yesterday.  I really believe we should have a comprehensive debate on the issue in this House as soon as possible and ask the Taoiseach to give that consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of victims of crime in our society is the top priority of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as well the Taoiseach told us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="909" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Government to tackle the causes of crime and not to rely solely on legislation. It is very important to make the association between long-term unemployment, drug abuse and crime.  We must remember that 80 per cent of heroin users are young, male, long-term unemployed people and that 80 per cent of the male prisoners in Mountjoy have a record of drug use.  There is a direct association between long-term unemployment, drug abuse and crime.  That is why this united Government &mdash; all parties contributing &mdash; has placed so much emphasis on tackling long-term unemployment, recognising that, unless it is tackled there is no hope of tackling the causes of crime.  We believe that the issue of long-term unemployment is not just an issue of social justice but also one of social protection.  Indeed people who are lucky enough to have money and jobs will be safe with that money and in those jobs only if the crime problem is tackled and, to do that, we must also tackle long-term unemployment.</P>

      <P>While not disagreeing with what the Taoiseach said, what about a comprehensive debate on the issue in this House?  The first duty of Government is to protect citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty of this Government is to tackle the causes of crime.  In this budget and legislative programme we are determined not just to introduce headline-grabbing measures or engage in soundbite politics as far as crime is concerned.  We are determined to tackle the problem of crime in society at its roots.  The roots of crime in this society are to be found in the fact that there are 140,000 people who are long-term unemployed, who have been passed by in the record economic growth we are enjoying at present.  As a united Government we are determined to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment, thereby tackling the problem of drug abuse and making <Col N="910" /> people safer in their homes than they are at present resulting from the policies we inherited which did not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not endeavouring to hype up the escalating crime, rather to render this House relevant so that it can respond to the very real public concern about recent armed criminality. In the light of the fact that the Minister for Justice is not due to take Question Time until 23 February and has not answered parliamentary questions since before Christmas, I appeal to the Taoiseach to facilitate a debate on crime in the light of recent armed robberies, missing persons and violent crime against elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice was present in the House yesterday to support the budget which will help tackle the causes of crime by tackling long-term unemployment.  The Minister for Justice is not in the House this morning because she is having a meeting with the Garda Commissioner to discuss the events to which the Deputy referred and is doing her job effectively in that regard.  The Minister for Justice will bring forward proposals for additional prison spaces in the near future as the Government acknowledges that additional prison spaces are necessary.  Even though the Government does not perceive imprisonment as the sole solution to crime we acknowledge that more prison spaces are necessary. The Minister for Finance has made provision for them.  The Minister for Justice will be coming before the House <Col N="911" /> to discuss her plans to deal with the provision of additional prison spaces.  We look forward to the support of the Deputy and parties opposite for the Minister's proposals in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Under item No. 24 on the Order Paper under Private Members' Business there is listed the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (No. 2) Bill, 1995, in my name.  I am rather surprised to hear the Taoiseach question the legality or constitutionality of Fianna Fáil legislation, bearing in mind that the Minister for Justice was obliged to lift virtually every section of that Bill in order to give adequate efficacy to the provisions of her Bill regarding the prohibition on the publication of incest proceedings.</P>
      <P>I might point out to the Taoiseach that the Fianna Fáil Party has presented the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996, and there is a widespread view throughout society that there is a real need for all-party consensus&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be embarking on a speech. Let us have a proposal to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in tackling the drugs menace.</P>
      <P>Another Bill on the Order Paper is the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, which the Government had no difficulty in accepting from Fianna Fáil. Therefore, I question the Taoiseach's motivation in rejecting the Fianna Fáil Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996.  I put it to the Taoiseach that petty politics is now taking precedence over tackling the crime issue in this country.  I now understand, Sir &mdash; when you likened the Minister for Justice yesterday to Kevin O'Higgins &mdash; why she sat there with a smile like moonlight on a tombstone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously Deputy O'Donoghue is a glutton for praise, so I will again praise him.  I praised the Fianna Fáil Party on its production of <Col N="912" /> this Bill.  I have assured the Fianna Fáil Party the Government will take the suggestions contained in that Bill fully into account in the drafting of its legislation expected to be approved within the next three weeks.  It is important that the Government avails of all advice available to it, in terms of constitutional advice to ensure that the legislation &mdash; to the extent it involves trenching on the rights of accused persons &mdash; is constitutionally valid, and Garda advice to ensure that it works in the most administrative and security enforcement effective way.  Therefore, the Government will present its Bill in the near future.</P>
      <P>Again, I compliment Deputy O'Donoghue on producing this Bill.  We will take every good idea from it, incorporate it in our legislation and give him credit for it.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Quill that there is no conflict between introducing more effective legislation and tackling the causes of crime; both must go hand in hand.  I expect the juvenile justice Bill will be available in late spring.  I am not sure if it will be available before the recess and I will not give a categorical commitment in that regard.  I am aware of Deputy Quill's continuous interest in this subject in that she has raised it more frequently than any other Member.  I assure her that we will bring forward this legislation as quickly as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Front Bench decided not to introduce a Bill dealing with crime during Private Members' time but to try to get the Government to introduce it in Government time to ensure it is enacted quickly.  We thought that was the most sensible approach.  The Progressive Democrats and others have called for a debate on crime.  It would be unsatisfactory if the Government were to refuse to give us the opportunity to have this Bill introduced.  This Bill has been checked by five constitutional lawyers, all of whom are known to the Taoiseach, and are of high standing.  They know how to draft a constitutional Bill and are very aware of the dangers involved in that process.  Alternatively, we could introduce the Bill during Private Members' time next week, but I <Col N="914" /> ask the Government to seriously consider not opposing it and to allow it be passed to a committee when it could be integrated with the Government's Bill in time.  It is wrong for the House to divide on a very important matter; we should deal with the problem.  It is not a matter on which we are trying to score party political points, otherwise we would have introduced it during Private Members' time this week.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider this matter.</P>
      <P>This side of the House in particular has been working for many years on measures to deal with the long-term unemployed.  From my experience, drug barons, warlords, drug criminals and pushers do not come from the long-term unemployed.  They do not need the £62 per week benefit.  We must deal with those organising the drugs scene.  If we were to tackle that problem, we could deal more easily with the other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that drug barons only exist because people buy drugs from them. Eighty per cent of hard drug users in the Eastern Health Board area are people who are long-term unemployed, 80 per cent of them are male and 92 per cent are under 35.  Those people whose lives are without hope are being exploited by drug barons.  We want to deal with the drug barons, go after their money and the market they are exploiting by offering a better life to the people buying drugs and we can do this by tackling long-term unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1996 budget represents a poor return from a booming economy.  From a taxpayer's point of view it is one of the most disappointing and insignificant budgets for many years.  It is a complacent budget which does far too little for the PAYE taxpayer, the income needs of the long-term unemployed and the old.  It is largely a marking time exercise which does not significantly advance progress where it is most needed, and does not deal with the major issues.  Even if the Minister did not turn up in the House or in his Department this year, he started off with about £700 million being raised through the system.  There are no proposals in the budget for capping our £30 billion debt, reducing our burden of taxation, making our tax and PRSI systems more competitive and the creation of employment more attractive.  None of these issues has been dealt with in any more than a glib manner.</P>
      <P>The underlying financial situation has deteriorated.  The general Government deficit, which has been between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent of GDP since 1990, has reached its highest level of 2.6 per cent.  That is the true measure of the public finances.  The primary budget surplus has been steadily falling.  We continue to tolerate a situation where high marginal rates of tax are being paid on low incomes.  We are missing the opportunity for real tax reform, at a time when overall tax levels can be reduced. We have low inflation, falling interest rates, buoyant tax revenues but even more buoyant public spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the international recession out of the way and the backlog of special pay awards cleared, there was a unique opportunity in these last two years to accelerate a process of fundamental tax reform, already set in train by me in the 1992 and 1994 budgets on behalf of the <Col N="919" /> Fianna Fáil Party, some of which is still working its way through the system. Instead, all the available resources have gone on increased Government spending.</P>
    <P>This budget is clearly the best that the three warring partners in Government can agree on with the Fine Gael Ministers largely pushed out of the way in the spending stampede.  That is why we face looming problems in the health sector. Cutbacks are on the way in several areas of the health service and other Departments and, as we saw outside the gates of Dáil Éireann last night, the nurses are on the march for the first time in over 15 years.  There is no discernible overall economic strategy.  In terms of content, it is a budget of bits and pieces, very thin on content.  It will not frighten the horses on the international markets but it will not propel our society forward either.  We will be relying even more heavily on our track record since 1987.  When the social partners, the employers and the trade unions have more time to reflect on it, I doubt if they will be very satisfied.</P>
    <P>The budget for all intents and purposes will be found in the revised Book of Estimates, that is why the Minister's speech was so short yesterday.  If this Government cannot get it right in these boom conditions, it will never get it right.  The whole thrust of this Government's policy is to underpin vast spending programmes which are not even always concentrated on essentials.  We should spend more on the real priorities and less on the not so urgent items and optional extras.  A few crumbs are being thrown to the low paid, employers and the well off.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving away nothing in this budget.  This morning I want to go back over the figures and analyse them the morning after, as I am sure many people around the country will be doing.  He is handing back to taxpayers by way of rebate a tiny and derisory percentage of what he hopes to raise from them this year.  If you subtract the additional taxes that he hopes to raise, <Col N="920" /> you are left with £60 million, being handed back.  The cost to the Minister is further reduced by buoyancy effects to £12.5 million.  For every pound the Minister collected in tax last year, he is collecting another 6.5p this year; for every pound paid in taxes, the Minister is handing back, on average, a rebate of about a halfpenny in the pound, which is costing him in net terms even less, one-tenth of one penny in the pound, or if one prefers one penny in every £10 collected.  In other words, the Minister is giving back next to nothing after yesterday's great give-away budget.  Over two years going on his pre-budgetary estimates, the Minister has made net tax concessions that cost him a princely £9.5 million.  The buoyancy effect is a tacit admission that this year's tax cuts are nearly 50 per cent self-financing, a concept the Department of Finance was always loath to admit.</P>
    <P>If the Government had kept strictly to its own current spending targets, it would have had an extra £212 million available to eliminate the current budget deficit, which is the policy of my party, and to provide an additional £130 million in tax or PRSI reliefs.  There might be even more taking account of additional savings on the national debt interest from eliminating the current budget deficit, not to mention buoyancy effects.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue will increase by £733 million this year.  Without anything happening, £733 million more will be taken through the tax system.  Of that almost £600 million or 82 per cent is being swallowed up by increased Government expenditure.  This is based on the Government's figures of yesterday given to us in this House.  Surely that proves, on its own admission, that we have a tax and spend Government.  Fine Gael, especially the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, when I was Minister for Finance, used to go on in this House about tax and spend.  They are strangely silent now.  They are not even here.  Agriculture was hardly mentioned yesterday, except for a reference to the mandatory EU refunds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Our record growth and positive budgetary situation is the fruit of eight years' consistent economic performance under Fianna Fáil management with the support at different times of other parties and underpinned by social consensus outside of this House.  It was a period in which we twice achieved 7 per cent growth in 1990 and 1994 and averaged over 4 per cent for the period.  Last April net employment grew by 140,000 as the Minister stated, to the highest level since the 30s.  Within two years of 1987, we moved within the Maastricht guidelines, and have remained there, with Exchequer borrowing below 3 per cent of GNP.  Inflation remained in low single figures.  In short, it was Fianna Fáil that transformed the worst performing economy in Europe into the best.  Ireland was being portrayed as the Celtic warrior and tiger in 1994, well before the present Government came into office.  The Government can claim the merit that the boom has continued under it, but that is all they can claim.</P>
    <P>If we wish to continue on this path and avoid painful and disruptive adjustments in the future, as Deputy McCreevy pointed out yesterday, we have to think strategically and face up to serious challenges that lie ahead.  The Minister, at the beginning of his budget speech, did not list the areas where we were underperforming last year.  We have a huge national debt to which we added £1 billion last year and which went over £30 billion for the first time.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we find it both sad and amusing that the Government say we had a great year of celebration last year, a year we should all be happy about, yet we borrowed £1 billion more and thus increased our national debt to £30 billion.  Public expenditure is not being kept under control and the Government's own targets have been missed by a large margin, even though it has been only a year in office.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment as measured by the live register increased, not decreased, averaging 12,000 above last year's budget target and was 5,000 <Col N="922" /> higher at the end of the year than at the end of the previous year.  The Government's efforts to tackle it were an abject failure last year.  In many areas our tax and PRSI system is uncompetitive and inhibits employment growth especially in the light of our strong economy and strong currency.  Our inflation performance has slipped compared with other countries.  Most of our partners had a rate below 2 per cent last year.  I have no doubt this is creating major concern in the Central Bank and in the Department of Finance.  A year ago we had one of the lowest inflation rates in the ERM countries; now we have one of the highest inflation rates and it is rising all the time with the indirect tax increases in yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>The servicing of the national debt this year will eat up £2.3 billion, more than 20 times the nominal value of the Minister's budget tax concessions.  Last year the Exchequer borrowing requirement of £627 million resulted in a £1 billion addition to the national debt, pushing it up to more than £30 billion.  Depending on exchange rate movements, this year's EBR may add another £1 billion to the national debt.  This will have to be serviced this year, next year and into the far distant future.</P>
    <P>In 1994 I, on behalf of my party, succeeded for the first time in almost 28 years in eliminating the current budget deficit.  Last year the Minister not only restored the deficit but exceeded his target, coming in with an end year deficit of £362 million after a surplus of £15 million the previous year.  The pre-budget White Paper on receipts and expenditure, with a small opening surplus, shows clearly that a current budget balance is within easy reach if there is more restraint in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, ESRI economists and the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, believe one of the budget's main priorities should be to avail of strong economic conditions to eliminate the deficit now and all borrowing by 1999.  This is our target and political point of view. There are several reasons for this.  At a time when the economy is growing it is <Col N="923" /> prudent economic management to let borrowing fall.</P>
    <P>I am glad that, despite the Minister's original target, the EBR fell from 2.2 per cent of GNP in 1994 to 1.9 per cent last year, even though this was not by the full half percentage point I considered desirable.  If Fianna Fáil was in Government the EBR would fall to approximately 1.5 per cent this year and 1 per cent next year.  That was the aim of the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  Unfortunately the budget gives no indication that this is the Minister's target and, consequently, we are left to hope that conditions will be better than forecast.</P>
    <P>The EBR figures are, of course, heavily manipulated as between 1995 and 1996, with payments and savings being transferred between years.  For example, the 1995 savings on the national debt have been brought forward to this year while the hepatitis C payments have been brought back to last year.  The purpose of this is to make the comparison between this year's EBR and last year's EBR look less bad and to mask the deterioration.  The European markets and our colleagues in Europe judge our performance on the basis of the general Government deficit rather than the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit.  The budget proves that there has been a deterioration in the general Government deficit from 2 per cent last year to 2.6 per cent this year, the highest increase since 1990.  Unfortunately, the bad old days are drifting back again.  While our colleagues in Europe may say that our economy is doing well the reality is that the general Government deficit has increased by 0.6 per cent, and they do not know the rest of the facts.</P>
    <P>One of the features of Fianna Fáil's economic management during its eight years in office was its counter-cyclical approach.  Between 1987 and 1990 we greatly reduced Government borrowing and the debt-GNP ratio.  During the more difficult years from 1991 to 1994 when growth was expected to be lower <Col N="924" /> we increased expenditure.  The criticisms by the Government of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government for increasing expenditure at a higher level than the present level are wide of the mark.  Given the depressed international conditions it was, broadly speaking, the appropriate response.  In 1994 budget growth was forecast at between 3-4 per cent but it subsequently turned out to be 7 per cent and expenditure was set in the light of this.  However, having got rapid growth a different response was necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government has been boosting expenditure in a pro-cyclical manner in the full knowledge that there was a period of high growth.  The difficulty will be to sustain such levels of expenditure if growth falters, which it will eventually, without breaching the Maastricht limits so that we can ride out the next international recession by causing as little damage to the economy as in the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>The Government should be creating ample room for manoeuvre but unfortunately it is not doing so.  The German Finance Minister is essentially correct in pushing for a 1 per cent borrowing limit during the good times and our Minister is wrong to oppose it.  The general Government deficit of 2.6 per cent is much too close to the ceiling for comfort.</P>
    <P>Another reason for eliminating borrowing is that we have the benefit of very substantial EU Structural and Cohesion Funds at present.  Given the rapid progress made in catching up with our EU partners these funds are unlikely to continue at their present levels post-1999.  If we wish to maintain the current levels of public investment we will have to do more from our own resources.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental reason for eliminating borrowing is that it would give us a free hand to create a highly competitive low tax economy which would generate greater employment.  This can be achieved in the present conditions without damaging the quality of our social services or our caring approach to <Col N="925" /> the least well off in our society.  In order to lay the basis for a low tax economy all we have to do is slow down for a period the rate of growth in public expenditure so as to bring expenditure and revenue into balance.</P>
    <P>Despite its claims to the contrary the Government has not been exercising the necessary restraint.  Last year current day-to-day Government expenditure increased by more than 8 per cent, in breach of the 6 per cent target.  Nevertheless last year the Minister presented a budget consistent with that target. This year he has presented a budget which is already in breach of this year's target.  This is some feat given that this is only 24 January.  In a footnote to the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; the Government defines the increase in net current spending as 6.2 per cent.  As those who have checked this document will know, one would need a microscope to find the figure of 6.2 per cent but it is there.  There is one thing we must say about the Department of Finance; it will put in the figure somewhere, it will not go along with the Government and try to hide it.  The figure of 6.2 per cent has been achieved by removing the £140 million in equal treatment payments from last year's base.  This footnote signifies that the Government will increase current spending by 4 per cent in real terms this year rather than 2 per cent. This means that the target in the <i>Programme for Renewal</i> has effectively been abandoned.  There is not much use looking at that document any longer as it is based on financial parameters which have been thrown out the window by the Government, and once this has been done one might as well tear up the rest of the document.  It will be interesting to find out from what programme the Government is working &mdash; and my party will endeavour to find out this as the year goes on.</P>
    <P>The Government claims that the rate of increase in expenditure is lower than under previous Governments in the early 1990s.  That is not true as far as 1995 is concerned.  If one includes all the equal treatment payments and excludes <Col N="926" /> the once-off amnesty expenditure, as promised by me in 1994 on behalf of the then Government of which the Minister Deputy Quinn, was a member, the underlying rate of increase in day-to-day expenditure in 1995 was 10.6 per cent.  By way of comparison, the underlying rate of increase was 6.9 per cent in 1994 and 8 per cent in 1993.  There was no excuse for last year's double figure increase in expenditure during boom times and it is thoroughly misleading and economically illiterate to compare it with an increase of slightly more than 11 per cent in 1992 at the height of the international recession and the currency crisis.</P>
    <P>From his jibes here it is clear the Taoiseach gets a few one liners from his handlers, spin doctors, programme managers and others and from what he said yesterday it appears he is economically illiterate.  As I reminded him yesterday, a man who failed to get a Finance Bill through the House is obviously economically illiterate.  I also had to deal with an overhang of special pay increases which has been frozen in the late 1980s.  I managed to get those out of the system, thus making it easier for my successor to hold down public spending.  The Taoiseach does not know anything about those agreements as he did not believe we should pay them, he did not believe in social consensus.</P>

      <P>Members on this side of the House look forward with some relish to seeing the Taoiseach trying to negotiate with the 92 unions, employer bodies and the farming organisations while at the same time trying to deal with our colleagues in Europe.  I wait with bated breath to see if he ever gets around to having a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister can undershoot his spending targets and come in with a current budget surplus this year we will welcome it.  It would not have required a great effort on the part of the Government to have maintained a balanced budget on current account this year and <Col N="927" /> it would have given a great boost to confidence. Most of the budget is contained in the Book of Estimates and the public capital programme.  While the public capital programme is not referred to in the budget it has mushroomed very rapidly in recent years and has increased by more than £800 million or 38 per cent. While much of this is related to Structural Fund expenditure and is to be broadly welcomed, Exchequer capital spending increased by 14 per cent last year and will increase by 8 per cent this year.  Exchequer capital borrowing of between £600 million-£700 million per year over the past three years is too high and needs to be gradually reduced and phased out.</P>
    <P>To come back to my net point, if the Government had stuck to its original spending targets, which are little more than a year old, it would have been possible to bring in a balanced current budget yesterday and to have at least £130 million to spare for additional tax and PRSI concessions.  The tax and PRSI concessions announced in the budget are minimal from the point of view of all but the lowest paid individual taxpayers.  On the tax side, there is indexation plus, with a marginal widening of bands, allowances and exemptions.</P>
    <P>In 1994, I widened the personal allowance by 8 per cent and the standard rate band by 7 per cent.  The Minister is increasing the allowance by 6 per cent and the standard rate band by 5.5 per cent.  The Taoiseach said this was a great achievement.  Obviously, he does not remember the achievements of recent years.  In a time of boom the Government has failed to match those figures.  In 1992, I widened the standard rate band for a married couple by at least £1,500 compared with a figure of £1,000 this year or by 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>No attempt is made at tax reform.  For the first time in many years it is not mentioned, not even lip service is paid to it.  I accept that some low income families will be a little better off, but for the middle income family quoted by the <Col N="928" /> Minister, even on £15,000 a year &mdash; I am not sure if this could be considered to be in the middle income band any more &mdash; the difference will be extremely marginal, representing less than 1 per cent of gross income.</P>
    <P>For most taxpayers the budget is a damp squib.  It offers poor reward for pay restraint under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> All the available money has gone towards extra Government spending both this year and last.  As a result, apart from catering for the low paid, the cupboard is bare. Those on middle incomes will still find themselves taxed at a marginal rate of 56.75 per cent whereas the better off will face a marginal rate of just over 50 per cent.  If one looks at the tax tables, the benefits are more modest than those provided in, say, the 1992 or 1994 budgets. Moreover, the benefit is least for the large middle income group who, intelligent as they are, will today consider the measures announced.  A married couple with two earners, paying full PRSI, and with two children will gain just over £200 on incomes between £13,000 and £24,000.  While this is billed as increasing the incentive to work the effect will be minimal.  The vast majority of middle income earners will get next to nothing and remain over taxed.</P>
    <P>I introduced the ambitious 1994 budget against a background of doubts about whether there would be a new national programme, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which was subsequently ratified.  I do not believe trade unionists and employers will ratify a new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> on the basis of the 1996 budget.  Paragraph 2.43 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> stated: &ldquo;The Government's priority in taxation reform for the period of the new Programme is to improve the treatment of earned incomes from employment and self-employment, with particular reference to the position of tax progress on lower middle incomes&rdquo;.  It went on to refer to major reliefs in general income taxation.  There was little for anyone on middle incomes.  The <Col N="929" /> Government will have to do much better next year if it wants to underpin social consensus.  The fact is that those on middle incomes have been conned and cheated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has only tinkered with PRSI at the margins.  The full rate of employers' PRSI at 12.2 per cent will be reduced to 12 per cent and the lower rate to 8.5 per cent with a marginal increase in the threshold.</P>
    <P>The total social welfare budget has increased by 28 per cent in the past two years.  The two year increase given to married old age pensioners and the long-term childless unemployed unable to supplement their incomes is a mere 5.5 per cent.  I welcome the increase in the living alone allowance at £1.10 a week, but it will only benefit those living alone.  The Government has short changed the old and, despite its professed concern for the long-term unemployed while trying to improve a little their employment prospects, it has not done anything for their incomes while they are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the incentives to improve the security of old people in their homes.  Another horrific death was discovered yesterday and many people have been reported missing.  I regret the measure is discriminatory and, as Deputy Power pointed out on the Order of Business, nonsensical as most old people do not have a taxable income and, therefore, will not benefit.  It is not fair that only the better off should be helped.  Any old person can be viciously attacked, regardless of financial standing. A subsidy would have been more equitable and we will table an amendment to the Finance Bill to this effect. An old person with a taxable income of up to £2 million could invest in the film industry and obtain relief, but such people do not exist.  If the Government wants to give old people a few pounds, it should give them a grant.  Those aged 65 and over have pension books and are readily identifiable.  We should not insult them.  As we are all aware, many <Col N="930" /> are afraid to complete tax returns.  I welcome the new one parent family payment scheme in place of the lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit scheme as a humane and progressive measure.</P>
    <P>The budget contains a limited number of measures to help the long-term unemployed to which my colleagues will refer.  The Minister has restored the 1,000 places cut from the vocational opportunities training scheme and taken the credit, but this was included in our policy document on long-term unemployment. We welcome it, nonetheless. A pilot full time jobs option for 1,000 people compares with the more ambitious proposals we included in our document.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the £1 million provided for a recruitment subsidy for the long-term unemployed.  We should stop conning the people and pretending this is a great scheme.  Yesterday my party's Front Bench decided &mdash; this was good manners &mdash; not to interrupt the Minister who said he was doing us a big favour.  When we examined the Principal Features of the Budget, however, we discovered that what he had said was not true.  If it is not possible to give us a copy of the Principal Features in advance, perhaps my former colleagues in the Department of Finance will try to convince the Minister to include more information in the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>Despite all the talks about helping the long-term unemployed only £1 million will be provided for the recruitment subsidy.  A subsidy of £80 a week or £4,000 per annum means that it would fund a grant total of only 250 of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>We are extremely grateful to the Government for introducing this huge measure.  We will draw lots to see who gets what.</P>
    <P>I accept there are some measures to tackle the tax wedge with family income supplement being raised and the retention of the child unemployment payment and medical cards for three years. This too is Fianna Fáil policy.  The medical card is highly valued and those <Col N="931" /> already in low paid employment will inevitably look with some envy on the retained privileges of those entering employment.  However, the medical card system needs to be reviewed.  Our policy document published last week by our deputy leader, Deputy O'Rourke, and finance spokesperson, Deputy McCreevy, states: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is examining the proposal that medical cards should be decided out of disposable income, after rent, income tax and PRSI have been deducted.  The party will be proposing a system of tiered medical cards for those marginally over the present limit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The budget leaves in place the residential property tax which was strongly criticised by Fine Gael and Democratic Left when in Opposition.  Our view remains that it is unfair and should be replaced.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, can claim that the Labour Party won the battle on that issue and that Fine Gael failed in its efforts to get rid of it.  Unfortunately, we cannot see where Fine Gael won in the budget, but our backroom staff are working on it.</P>

      <P>There is very little in the budget for the farming community with the exception of the relief on capital acquisitions tax.  Many in the farming sector could have benefited from a reduction in income tax.  There is nothing either for the tourism industry. My party's spokesperson, Deputy Andrews, was almost ill since the Government had indicated repeatedly that it would give priority to this industry, but there is nothing in the budget for it, although it is one of our most important industries.</P>
      <P>In the Book of Estimates Bord Fáilte's budget has been cut back by £3 million.  Once again, as a Fine Gael Minister is responsible for tourism that area received nothing in the budget and those involved in tourism will know that is the reason they lost out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> The motor industry benefited by a marginal measure relating to benefit-inkind and it is difficult to understand how it works.  It was probably the Revenue Commissioners, not the Department of Finance, who proposed the measure.  To benefit from it company representatives must be out of the office for 70 per cent or more of their time and travel more than 5,000 miles, which would be difficult not to do unless they were walking.</P>

      <P>One must be out of the office for 71 per cent of one's time and travel between 5,000 and 20,000 miles to benefit from a 30 to 26 per cent reduction under this so-called progressive measure.</P>
      <P>There are no changes in stamp duty thresholds for housing, with the 6 per cent rate impacting increasingly on firsttime buyers.  Some indexation would be desirable in that regard.  While the exemption from health and employment levies for workers resident in the State but employed in Northern Ireland is welcome, I am not convinced it is sufficient to resolve the problem.  I congratulate members of Fianna Fáil who fought for this measure in the debate on last year's Finance Bill and forced the Minister to promise that he would at least examine the matter.</P>
      <P>The Book of Estimates shows the low priority this Government attaches to tackling crime.  While Department overheads increased by 8 per cent, there was no increase &mdash; there was even a slight decrease &mdash; in the provision for the operational services of the gardaí, the prisons and the courts.  Again, as a Fine Gael Minister is responsible for justice matters, the Department must suffer cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main change in section 35 relating to film making, in particular the <Col N="933" /> reduction of relief to 8 per cent, is illadvised, but we have not had an opportunity to examine the matter in depth. The film incentives introduced by Fianna Fáil and Labour have been successful in attracting major films here, to the envy of our British neighbour.  As we are in danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, this measure should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's lack of influence in Government is shown by the absence of implementation of the policies it put forward before the last election.  One of its main documents, <i>Towards the Jobs Economy,</i> published in May 1992, stated that a current budget deficit would not be allowed and that the EBR would not exceed 2 per cent of GNP.  It promised to reduce employers' PRSI to 6 per cent and there was a promise of an annual tax free allowance of £5,000 for every person up to the age of 23.  The Fine Gael Party is the back marker in this Government and economic policy has been hijacked by Labour and Democratic Left, a party with 1 per cent of national support.</P>
    <P>In its policy document, Ireland 2000, Democratic Left stated that it wanted to make us all love our tax cuts and its members lectured us on how they would seek to convince people of that.  Its document stated: &ldquo;Democratic Left will seek to convince people ... that taxation is not an evil but a positive&rdquo;. While undoubtedly there will probably be an election tax package next year, rainbow Governments prefer to spend and do not have a deep commitment to tax reform.  The only hope for the people is that this Government's time in office is sufficiently short to prevent it from inflicting real economic damage. We must have real tax reform if we are to create more employment and achieve European living standards.  We in this party are proud of having pulled the country out of the doldrums.  When we came into Government in 1987 the World Bank and the IMF were at the door, the country was in economic ruin. I listened with amusement yesterday to Deputy Dukes ridiculing Fianna Fáil <Col N="934" /> policies.  It is amazing what one will get away with if one has a hard neck.  During his time in office the Exchequer borrowing requirement was approximately 12 per cent and we borrowed roughly £1.5 billion in one year.  His current budget deficits were unbelievable.  He holds economic records in Europe for all the wrong reasons, yet he lectures our party who turned the country around.  The Taoiseach is not the only economic illiterate on that side of the House.</P>
    <P>We have outlined our tax policy in Pathways to Work, that is assuming we create the necessary fiscal space of a low introductory tax rate and PRSI combined with the benefit of middle income earners and a range of measures to tackle long-term unemployment, including reduced and more competitive employers' PRSI rates, reform of the medical card system and a more ambitious small business rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be on this side of the House for next year's budget.  However, if that is the case I advise the Government to start working on it now and introduce a coherent policy.  The Minister's initial reaction may have been to concentrate on the PRSI area, but he was pulled and dragged in different directions.  Minister De Rossa and Minister of State Rabbitte wanted more. Minister of State Rabbitte called a press conference &mdash; the first time for a Minister to do so &mdash; to demand that he get £10 million but one week later he got only £4 million.  The £6 million was probably spent on Minister De Rossa's handlers and spin-doctors and he could not argue about that.</P>
    <P>There is no coherence.  The economy is booming because of the healthy state in which we, in Government with Labour and the Progressive Democrats, left it.  My colleagues were harassed by various sections of the public but we stood firm.  It took us from 1987 until 1993 to get it right and one year later the Minister stated on television that the people believe he did nothing during the year. If he had played golf and stayed away <Col N="935" /> from here we would have better results. It is the scroungers who make him spend more money who are causing the problems.  If he had stayed out of sight during the year the officials in the Department would not have agreed to the expenditure and our economy would prosper.  Instead, the general Government deficit has increased from 2 per cent to 2.6 per cent and inflation is increasing <i>vis-á-vis</i> our other partners. While difficulties with our exchange rate continues, the Minister did not mention a market development fund or an alternative in the budget.  There is nothing in it for the food sector, agriculture or for many of the key industries which would help the country to prosper. The Government is ticking out its time in office, hoping that nothing will go wrong on the international scene before a general election.  The large capital programme allows it to spend money like confetti at a wedding or snuff at a wake.  If it continues to spend in this way we will not have money to spend.  I know from previous experience that the officials in the Department do not agree with such spending.  In a few years' time, the international recession will worsen, growth rates in our economy will decrease and we will be left with expenditure cast in stone.  We all know how difficult it is to cut back on expenditure for programmes already in place.  European money will diminish, there will be no Cohesion Funds and our EBR and current budget deficit will increase.  Once again we will become the laughing stock of the world.  I know that is the advice the Minister is receiving but, unfortunately, he is not listening. We are facing a slippery slope and a great deal of trouble.  All both parties on this side of the House can hope for is that sooner rather than later we can get this Government out and get away from the leaks and so on.</P>
    <P>I have sat on this side of the House for many budgets.  I have been a Member for almost two decades.  Ministers used to turn up to listen to the Opposition. I thank the Minister of State, <Col N="936" /> Deputy Stagg, for turning up today but there are 34 Ministers and Ministers of State and nobody else is here.  They are all out trying to thank Mr. Mitchell &mdash; we thank Mr. Mitchell as well &mdash; but they would do well to listen to us.  They would do well to listen to what is going wrong with this country.  We ask them during 1996 to look at what this party achieved in Government with the Progressive Democrats and with Labour. We ask them to try to keep this country and this economy right, and not to put us back into the mess we inherited in 1987 when debt was doubled, inflation was rampant and interest rates were through the roof.  When I walked out of the Department of Finance only 14 months ago I asked them not to put us back in the mess we were in, but they did not listen to me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal in depth with the content of yesterday's budget, I will speak for a moment about the episode we experienced in the run-up to the budget. The extent of the leaks of Government information was unprecedented.  Yesterday in this House I drew attention on the Order of Business to the fact that on page 14 of <i>The Irish Times</i> we were not alone given details of what might be in the budget but we were informed of the <Col N="937" /> order and sequence of the Minister's speech and the various paragraph headings. This was all laid out before us and it is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>Last year a Minister of State was made a scapegoat because of budget leaks.  This year the Department of Finnace and to a large extent the Minister for Finance lost control of the budgetary process as the Government in exile in Busáras dictated the pace.  It is a serious matter that the Minister's speech was given in fair detail to one of our leading business journalists.  The budget debate and the budget speech itself have become somewhat a farce.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, had this to say about Government leaks on 15 November 1994, while in Opposition in column 369 of the Official Report of that day: &ldquo;If a Government leaks it is because it is not managed on a partnership basis, because people feel they are not getting an adequate hearing at the Cabinet table and must therefore make their views known to the media.  Far from representing some form of excuse for the Taoiseach's behaviour, the fact that matters discussed at Cabinet have become public is an indication of a serious failure to leadership on his part&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  It has been unedifying over the last few weeks to see the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, call a press conference and issue a press statement to tell us he was going to lobby the Cabinet for an increase in the science and technology budget.  My party put in a priority question for tomorrow to discuss this serious matter but it has been ruled out of order on the basis of Cabinet confidentiality.  What a joke.  We need to take the budgetary process seriously because otherwise we undermine confidence, not just in the budget but in the management of our economy.</P>
    <P>Many people are seriously concerned that the left wing parties in this Government are running the show.  This is not just my view.  It is the view of many voters, of business people, of many members of Fine Gael.  While Fine Gael is in Government it is certainly not in <Col N="938" /> power.  Martyn Turner's cartoon this morning summed the situation up.  Fine Gael was making the tea &mdash; presumably it was Barry's tea.  There was a time when Fine Gael was the opponent of Democratic Left and Labour, now it is merely their appendage.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and Deputy John Bruton in particular have placed great emphasis on the need for openness, transparency and accountability.  The opening page of the Programme for Government speaks about the fact that Government and the people are damaged if the Government is not open and accountable.  The leak of information is no substitute for accountability or openness.  Instead of this Government being known for openness, transparency and accountability, it will be known for secrecy, evasion and deception.  In this House yesterday legitimate questions to the Taoiseach about whether or not he was involved in discussions about the appointment of the QMP company to handle the Government's information contract were transferred by him to another Minister.  I want to know if the Taoiseach was involved in any discussions about that matter and when he was told by the Labour Party that this company was to be given the contract.</P>
    <P>This is an important matter because we are talking about the expenditure of public money.  Whether it is £500,000 or £500 million the principle is the same. We must ensure that the procedures for awarding Government contracts are open, transparent and fair, that those procedures are followed, that everybody who tenders for Government work tenders on a fair and equal basis and that they are at least given the courtesy of being told when they are not successful.</P>
    <P>I find the manner in which this issue has been handled very disturbing.  We have heard from nobody over the past ten days since this came into the public arena except an unelected Government adviser.  In my experience, when Ministers are in trouble, they roll out their advisers or their unfortunate civil servants to take the rap, but when it is good news the Minister is never shy <Col N="939" /> about taking all the credit.  I want to hear from the Taoiseach and Fine Gael when they knew about this matter.  It is important in the interests of accountability; it is important if we are committed to transparency and it is certainly important if we are committed to open Government.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the left wing parties are dictating the pace in regard to economic matters in this Government and that is a fact.  The only people who were happy last night were the left wing parties, and Democratic Left was happiest of all.  Prionsias De Rossa and his politburo, some of whom I spoke with last night, are happy because they know they got their way.  One measure in the budget in relation to work trials &mdash; I am not certain what they are &mdash; which is to be introduced by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, can only be done after he has consulted the Minister for Social Welfare.  The one thing that a Fine Gael Minister is going to do has to be done with the approval and support of the Minister for Social Welfare, the real leader of this Government, following consultation.</P>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday to the fact that over 80 per cent of the voters voted for policies that were different from the policies of Democratic Left and Labour, yet that 80 per cent are not represented, for the first time ever in an Irish Government.  Fine Gael is voiceless and powerless.  It is so desperate to hang on to power that it will literally agree to anything.  Fine Gael voters and supporters must be disillusioned with the manner in which their Government is behaving, not just in regard to economic matters but in relation to crime and issues like openness, transparency and accountability.  I call on the Taoiseach in particular to assert his authority, to take control of his Government, to reassure people that the Government has regard for the 80 per cent of people who voted in the last election.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the specifics of this budget.  We have heard great play <Col N="940" /> being made of the reform of income tax. A couple on £15,000 per year &mdash; not big earners, a very average income family &mdash; will get £2.49 extra per year as a result of the measures introduced yesterday. That is hardly the price of a pint in many Dublin pubs.  Net current spending as a result of this budget will go up by 6.2 per cent, that is, 4 per cent above the rate of inflation.  That is as a result of what we see in Table F in the Prinicipal Features.  In the text of the speech delivered yesterday the Minister told us a very different story.  He tried to make the claim that this was the lowest increase in public spending for many years.  That is not a fact.</P>
    <P>Income tax will rise this year by £260 million according to the information supplied in the budget.  This means that the average income tax payer will be hit for an extra £200 per year, or £4 per week, in taxes during 1996.  A single person with gross earnings of £247 per week will pay 57 pence in every extra pound they earn in tax and PRSI to the Minister for Finance.  This kind of worker is earning well below the average industrial wage.  What kind of message does that send to that person? Somebody earning below the average industrial wage is expected to give 57 per cent of their marginal earnings in tax to the Government.  That is not an incentive to work.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder we read in this morning's newspaper comments from the head of RGDATA that the Irish Grocers Association is finding it difficult to fill 500 jobs in the retail sector because State benefits to the unemployed and the tax system act as a disincentive. Recently the chambers of commerce reported that their members were finding it difficult to recruit unskilled workers.  Unskilled workers do not need to go on a FÁS course or to be trained, yet 22 per cent of companies according to the chambers of commerce in their economic quarterly survey for the third quarter of 1995 said that they were finding it difficult to find unskilled workers.</P>

The high rate of tax is still 48 per cent and the low rate is 27 per cent.</P>

      <P>Ireland is the only country in the OECD where below average earners pay super tax.  This budget has done nothing to change that. Some smug commentators in this morning's newspapers seem to have been taken in by the Government's propaganda. Last week these people were calling for radical tax reform, but that did not happen in the budget.  How long must we wait until they return to tell us we need radical tax reform?  We need radical tax reform because people who work and make an effort are becoming disillusioned each year as they realise that it is almost not worth their while in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke at length this morning about long-term unemployment. Those of use who know something about it know that if somebody leaves school and is idle at home for a couple of months or a year, it will not be long before he finds something to do. The lack of opportunity and the failure to provide work even at low wages for young people is the reason we have such <Col N="942" /> a high level of crime among that category. Many people in that situation feel there is no reason to get up in the morning and feel they are cast aside.  My colleague Deputy McDowell referred to them as human set aside.  Until we realise that people working even for low incomes is better than people not working, we will not make a serious indent into many of the crime problems as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have many new things to say.  On the rate of corporation profits tax, I welcome the reduction from 38 per cent to 30 per cent for companies earning profits below £50,000.  However, I regret no move was made to reduce the general 38 per cent rate.  It is the first time for a number of years that there has been no move downwards in that regard.  The reason that is important is that after the year 2010 the <Col N="943" /> derogation we have in relation to the 10 per cent manufacturing tax will end.  At that stage we will need a low standard rate of corporation tax &mdash; perhaps the 20 per cent and the 10 per cent could be married to an overall 15 per cent &mdash; or we will need to substantially increase the 10 per cent manufacturing tax.  We cannot do that in one fell swoop; it must be done gradually and we must move in that direction.</P>
      <P>I know for many the year 2010 is a long way off, but multinational companies and international investors are now making decisions on the basis of what will happen in that year.  For them the horizon is close and there is no worse disincentive for investment than uncertainty.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's concentration on the issue of long-term unemployment. Social alienation and loss of dignity is experienced by so many families with a number young people unemployed. However, the Government's response is very bureaucratic and, in many ways, it is an effort to massage the figures so they will look good by the end of the year.  Some £1 million will be allocated in the middle of next year to provide 5,000 jobs for long-term unemployed people for a six month period. What effect will that have?  It is a mere six month stop gap measure to massage the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of years ago the Progressive Democrats published proposals on community employment.  There is a great deal of work and many unemployed people in our community. People, particularly young people, working even for social welfare rates is better than people not working.  They would be more fulfilled if they were involved in their community rather than being isolated.  I urge the Government to ensure that every young person currently unemployed does some work on a part time basis, perhaps for two or three days a week, in return for existing unemployment benefits.  We could start with young people under the age of 25 years.  I have discussed this with many <Col N="944" /> representatives of this sector and, contrary to a popular perception that this is right wing, many young people would like to be involved in a worthwhile activity for a number of days per week and their parents would support this. They would gain experience, feel included and would not be marginalised and isolated.  Unless we do that, we are only tipping the iceberg by providing various schemes and we will have no effect on the long-term problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in employers PRSI by 0.2 per cent.  The reduction is small but at least it is a recognition that PRSI is not social insurance but a penal tax on labour.  We have five taxes on work if we include the different taxes, levies and PRSI.  I can think of nothing more the Government could do to make work illegal than to impose those five taxes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to introduce multi-annual budgeting. However, this will not happen until he leaves office.  He gave us the reasons it cannot happen next year and anyway the Government is coming to the end of its term.  For some time my party has advocated the need for multi-annual budgeting.  In addition, we need a unified budget.  Unless we make the spending, tax and revenue decisions together, the focus will never be on tax reform.  It is inappropriate that in the middle of one year Government Ministers sit down to look at the spending options for the following year with each trying to get more for his or her Department, and then a number of months later the Minister for Finance must look at the revenue implications of trying to raise that money.  It would be akin to a family sitting down at the beginning of the year to decide how much they wanted to spend and then trying to find a job to match their spending needs.  We need to turn the process around.  In particular, we need to make decisions in a unified way, which I very much favour.</P>
    <P>In addition, we need to look at the whole issue of public sector reform. Excluding those who work for the commercial semi-State companies in <Col N="945" /> Ireland, we have 222,000 employees who work for the State.  The current public sector pay bill is £4.8 billion, which is 40 per cent of current Government spending.  It is £600 million more than we raise in income tax.  It is the one area of Government spending that is most difficult to control because of the sheer numbers in the public service.  I appreciate that many members of the public service are badly paid.  For example, clerical assistants on £178 a week are among the worst paid in this economy.  However, I do not believe we will subsequently increase the pay of public servants unless we introduce performance related pay and control the sheer numbers in the public service.  It is the numbers that cause the problem. There are ways of reducing the numbers. Through natural wastage and generous career breaks we could reduce the numbers by about 5 per cent per annum. That alone would save £200 million.</P>
    <P>Recently at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs I put forward my ideas on how we could introduce performance related pay in the public sector.  Each Government Department has to be autonomous as far as budgets are concerned.  The management of each Department must have cash limits for pay and decide whether to employ extra people or have fewer people and pay them better.  The incentive must be given to public servants to deliver the service and give better value for money.  Unless public servants have that incentive, unless they benefit from delivering the service in a more efficent and cost effective way, we will not bring about the kind of change many of us would like to see.  Change will only be effected if we bring the huge number of employees in the public sector with us. Those public servants deserve that. They have given great service to this country.  They have loyally served Governments of different political persuasions. Many of them work extraordinarily hard, but the system does not reward effort because of the way it is structured and because of the way pay is structured.  There is much talk now <Col N="946" /> about reform.  We will get meaningful reform only if we introduce some of the reforms I referred to earlier.  With technological advances we could do the job with fewer people.  Many different jobs that were done by the public service are becoming obsolete &mdash; for example, customs officials are no longer necessary. There is much we could do to improve productivity and get more out of fewer people, but that will only happen if public servants are rewarded for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred yesterday to a new national pay agreement to follow the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I am concerned that such agreements are drawn up in an anti-democratic way.  There are essentially agreements reached by non-elected people and with nobody representing the unemployed at the table.  The whole focus of these agreements should be to increase employment in this economy.  It is my view that an outgoing Government that has lost the confidence of the people, as this Government has, does not have a mandate to negotiate a new social agreement with the social partners, Whoever negotiates it, it must concentrate on net take-home pay, not on growth pay increases.  Nominal pay increases are useless.  What matters to workers, whether they work for the State or in the private sector, is what they take home.  The tax changes advocated by my party &mdash; which could be implemented over four years if we had prudent management of the public finances and if public spending was kept to the rate of inflation &mdash; would allow us to have rates of tax of 20 per cent as a standard rate and 40 per cent as the higher rate.  If the Progressive Democrats' tax plan was introduced, a clerical assistant on £178 a week would gain £21 a week.</P>
    <P>Let me move now to the issue of public spending.  There are parties in this House and many individuals in this country who think that more and more Government spending will solve every problem.  Since 1990 spending on the health services has increased by 65 per <Col N="947" /> cent or £900 million.  No one could seriously argue that the public spending increase of 65 per cent has led to a matching improvement in the quality of services.  Equally, expenditure on the prison service has gone up by 50 per cent in the last five years, but the number of prisoners has increased by merely 7 per cent.  My point in giving those figures &mdash; I could give many more &mdash; is that more and more public spending does not guarantee improved service. We need to get better value for money.</P>
    <P>We need to be more imaginative and more innovative.  In particular, we need to reduce the size of Government.  We have over 30 different Government Departments and offices and 32 different Ministers.  If Westminster had the same number of Ministers per head of population as we have they would have 540 Ministers.  I am not talking about the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who may be superfluous to requirements; I am not talking about any one person.  We have to reduce the size of Government not just in terms of ministerial positions but also in terms of offices, bureaucracies and quangos.  This country has become paralysed through establishing quangos, task forces, reviews and committees with all the people that are required to service them.  Do we need to have FÁS offices nation-wide looking after the needs of unemployed people and also Social Welfare offices paying out money to the same group of people?  Do we need to have the Revenue Commissioners collecting tax from people right around the country and the Department of Social Welfare paying out money to people in exactly the same place?  We have to go for a slimmer, leaner way of running this economy.  We have to lead by example. We have to ensure, because of the way public servants touch our lives, that we have an efficient and effective public service and that we administer this country in the cheapest and most effective way possible.</P>
    <P>We need a competitive economy.  We will not get competition unless in the <Col N="948" /> first instance we look at the possibility of privatising many State assets and opening them up to competition.  One of the things that disturbs me is a recent announcement by the Government that the ESB, in return for reducing manning levels, is to be given permission to build two more power stations.  If that happens there will be no need for a competitor because there will be an oversupply and the ESB will control it all.  I am very disturbed that this Government is not committed to competition.  For example, a very reasonable proposal from Ryanair to open a private airport at Baldonnel has been shot down by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  In 1984 and 1985 when my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, argued in this House for competition with Air Lingus in the airways, he was told that the country could not sustain competition, that it would be bad for the economy and bad for Air Lingus.  We all know the effect of that competition &mdash; cheaper fairs, a boom in tourism revenue, increased employment, an increase in the number of passengers coming into Ireland.  Ryanair now has the greatest number of passengers of all the carriers on the Dublin-London route.</P>
    <P>We must have a competitive economy and we will only do so if we begin to tackle the anti-work tax system that is in place.  A worker in Dundalk on £300 a week is £20 a week worse off than a worker earning the same amount in Newry.  There has been much emphasis in this House on the need for an all-Ireland approach to so many things, about the need for North-South executive bodies, etc.  We have economic partition here and yesterday's budget went further down the road of reinforcing that economic partition.  It costs an employer in the Republic 50 per cent more than an employer in the North to give an employee £2 more in take-home pay.  If we really want to create a single economy in Ireland we have to begin by lowering the anti-work tax levels that exist.  Now that there is peace in Northern Ireland and it is a more attractive <Col N="949" /> place for inward investment, this economy will lose out unless we begin to tackle our anti-work system.</P>
    <P>We should control public spending, maintain low numbers in the public service instead of increasing them as we plan to do.  Neither should we have redundancy packages as we had when Ray MacSharry was Minister, which cost us £130 million and in spite of which we have ended up with 30,000 more working in the public service than we had even then.  That is not the way to go about it.  We need pay-related remuneration in the public service which can be implemented through natural wastage and career breaks.  We need to reform our tax system for public servants and all workers, and we need to make sure that this economy is proenterprise and pro-business.</P>
    <P>I want to return to where I began and talk about Fine Gael's role in this Government.  Some may think I take great pleasure from the fact that Fine Gael has been sidelined.  It may be in Government but it is not really in power.  It is a sad reflection on our political system that we have reached the stage where the left wing parties, who command less than 20 per cent support of the electorate, now control the economic policy and economic outlook of this Government of renewal.  That is damaging for the economy and damaging and disillusioning for taxpayers.  In particular, I am critical of the manner in which the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, held a press conference to tell us he intended to lobby his colleagues in the Cabinet for more money for science and technology. The Minister for Social Welfare went on radio and, before we had even read about the report in the paper, rubbished his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.  What a humiliating way to treat a fellow colleague in Government.  That is a serious matter and one to which voters will respond when they next get the opportunity.</P>
    <P>We need a Government which has an economic vision and which knows <Col N="950" /> where it wants to take us in terms of spending, the national debt and taxation. This Government does not have any targets.  When the Minister was talking yesterday about multi-annual budgeting he did not give us any idea of where he wants to take this economy as far as unemployment or tax is concerned.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech last year, the Minister said he had budgeted for an average unemployment level of 265,000 during the year.  The live register figures published at the beginning of this month show that that figure is 285,000, 19,000 higher than the average for which the Minister budgeted in last year's budget. This Government does not have a coherent view and it is not committed to radical reform of the economy, particularly of our anti-work tax system.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the escalating rise in crime.  People, particularly the elderly in our community, are genuinely frightened. Giving a tax allowance of £800 at the standard rate to taxpayers aged 65 or over who live on their own to provide an alarm is a cynical exercise.  It sounds like a real bureaucratic solution to a serious problem &mdash; there is a problem, we must be seen to do something &mdash; so a scheme is introduced.  The people who need help most will be unable to avail of this scheme because they do not have taxable incomes in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The way to deal with crime is not through gimmicks of that-kind which is how I would describe this scheme.  The way to deal with crime is, first, to have effectve laws and, second, to implement them.  On the Order of Business every week there are calls for more and more legislation; it is either more quangos, task forces, reviews or laws.  If we implemented our current laws and efficiently use available prison spaces, we would not have the kind of problems we all woke up to hear about this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to examine the management and operation of the Garda Síochána. <Col N="951" /> The gardaí, too, must inspire confidence. We must ensure that the force is organised and managed on an efficient basis and that it is modernised to deal with the sophistication of modern crime. We need to ensure that our prisons are managed efficiently.  If the prison expenditure has increased by 50 per cent and the prison population by only 7 per cent we must ask questions about the effectiveness of the management of our prisons.</P>
    <P>We must also ask questions about our laws and the way they are implemented. Why is it that one of the godfathers of crime who availed of a tax amnesty two years ago was awarded a Dublin Corporation contract?  It is an absolute scandal that a leading criminal known as &ldquo;The Monk&rdquo; was awarded a Dublin Corporation contract in relation to the MOT testing for the Department of the Environment.  There is something really sick in a society where that person, having availed of a tax amnesty, can now get Government work.  We need to seriously examine the kind of laws we have in this country because that is what disillusions people so much.  It is not the lack of legislation but the failure to implement it.  If different laws and a different system of justice are necessary to capture the godfathers of crime, then let us have it.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said this morning, the rights of accused persons are important, and that is true in any civilised society, but the rights that must come first are those of the victims, the ordinary law abiding citizens.  They are getting a little fed up with all the rhetoric and the promises.  We need laws to protect them because the first duty of any Government is to protect its citizens. I would prefer to see the Government doing much less in areas in which it should not be involved and much more in areas in which it should be involved, such as protecting its citizens.</P>
    <P>If there is any message that must come from this budget it is that we need a different approach to many of the problems confronting our people.  We <Col N="952" /> need a Government which has a genuine mandate, a coherent vision for the economy and a strategic view of how we will reach the stage where this can be a competitive economy.</P>
    <P>We currently get just under £2 billion in net receipts each year from our membership of the European Union but that will run out by 1999.  Enlargement of the Community means that an additional £22 billion per year will have to be spent if we have the same Common Agricultural Policy and the same Structural and Cohesion Funds.  The Germans, who fund 80 per cent of what is spent in the EU, will not make that kind of expenditure. We will have to survive on much less but there is not any recognition of that fact in yesterday's budget.  There is no mention of living within our means or reducing the burden of national debt.</P>
    <P>If this country is to survive following enlargement of the EU, particularly if we are in the European Monetary Union, we must get our house in order. As Deputy McDowell said yesterday, it is one thing to qualify for membership but it will be another when we are in the club.  He said also that we will be the sick member of that club unless we get our house in order.  The Germans may well insist on us complying with a 1 per cent budget deficit requirement.</P>
    <P>Unless we begin to live within our means and make this a more competitive economy that supports work and the worker, the entrepreneur and those who invest in business, and unless we begin to reduce the burden of national debt, this economy will be unable to survive in what undoubtedly will be a much more competitive European Union.  If we have a new Government with a different approach we can do that and I believe there are many exciting opportunities ahead for us if we can get our house in order.</P>
    <P>In rejecting the strategy of the Minister and the Government in this budget, the Progressive Democrats recently published an extensive programme for tax reform which can be implemented, which is costed and which is achievable but only if we have a Government with <Col N="953" /> the political will to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to many of the lobby groups, to return an incentive to work and to have public spending increases matched to inflation.  If we do all that we could have standard rates of tax of 27 and 40 per cent, we could return an incentive to the worker and those who are running this economy and paying all our salaries.  Every ten people at work have 22 dependants.  The more that figure of ten is reduced, the more difficult it will be for the dependants. Unless we make the national cake bigger by making this a more enterprising country, we will be unable to do a great deal in regard to social welfare, etc.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on the Government that social welfare payments will increase by 3 per cent but that the net take home pay of low paid employees will not be matched by that increase. That is a sad reflection on the dependency culture that has pervaded this country, particularly in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is innovation, as well as consolidation, in this Government's second budget.  The major innovation is that for the first time an integrated approach has been taken, by the Government as a whole, to framing a budget which focuses primarily on the country's most pressing social, economic and human problem: that of long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is a budget which is in every sense pro-work and pro-worker. It is a budget designed to encourage people to create new employment and to take up new employment opportunities &mdash; to make jobs and to take jobs.  It gives improved incentives for employers and potential employers; it improves the position of existing workers and taxpayers and and gives greater encouragement and support to people who have been out of work, perhaps for many years, in their attempts to join or rejoin the labour force, or access education or training to advance their employment prospects.  At the same time, this budget protects and improves the living standards of those people who <Col N="954" /> are outside the labour force for other reasons, such as illness or age.</P>
    <P>The special employment measures in this budget are of major significance. They are intended to give particular help to our unacceptably large number of people who are long-term unemployed because this group is not benefiting enough from the current dynamic growth in employment.  Many new jobs are coming on stream but people who have been out of the jobs market for a year, two years, or even longer are not getting them.  That group needs positive help and support and this budget provides it.  It does so not only through the employment and training opportunities it creates but also through social welfare changes which will ease their transition into paid work and through tax and PRSI changes which will ensure they are better off working.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of this budget is to stimulate economic activity and enterprise and to help people who are currently unemployed to share in this development.  The success of this strategy is vital not only to those directly affected but for society as a whole. Ireland is a small and close-knit society and the pain and indignity of long-term unemployment affects everyone in some way, directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>This budget gives employers substantial relief, both on tax and PRSI.  The new, low rate of corporation tax is something I have favoured and advocated as I believe that small and medium-sized enterprises, which will gain substantially, have a crucial role to play in the type of job creation we need. I hope that this more favourable tax regime, combined with the reduction of employers' PRSI and the new recruitment subsidy, will encourage new small and medium sized enterprises to establish themselves in the areas where unemployment is highest and the need for new enterprise is greatest.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare, with legal and departmental responsibility for ensuring that the social insurance fund can meet its short-term and long-term commitments, I want to record my <Col N="955" /> views on the somewhat controversial issue of PRSI.  Despite the oft-repeated wail that &ldquo;PRSI is just another tax&rdquo;&mdash; which we have just heard again from Deputy Harney &mdash; I must insist that it is no such thing.</P>
    <P>A growing proportion of the workforce, including the self-employed, now pay PRSI.  Together with employers they finance the insurance payments that make up some 44 per cent of all social welfare expenditure, with a very small contribution from the Exchequer &mdash; only 2 per cent last year.  What this means is that workers and employers, between them, are currently financing £1,870 million worth of schemes and payments to insured persons, on the basis of their PRSI contributions.  The cover provided to insured workers is substantial and compares more than favourably with the scope and quality of social insurance in the UK and elsewhere. Incidentally, this budget's PRSI changes mean, in relation to the UK, that our employee PRSI is lower at all income levels, our combined employer and employee PRSI is lower at all income levels over £110 per week, and employers' PRSI is lower where wages are between £210 and £250 per week.</P>
    <P>All PRSI contributors in Ireland get exceptional value for money and PRSI is also an integral part of the social contract. Insured workers gain from a range of benefits, not only when they reach pension age but also during their working lives.  Their employers gain indirectly through not having to provide as many occupational benefits as would otherwise be the case.  Paying PRSI means they need to spend less on sick pay, maternity benefits and even pensions provision, since the majority of occupational schemes are built around the social welfare arrangements.</P>
    <P>Also, of course, the State &mdash; the taxpayer &mdash; gains from the existence of a self-financing social insurance system which reduces pressure and dependency on the social assistance schemes that are entirely Exchequer-financed.  Hence the move, in recent years, to include more <Col N="956" /> and more workers in the system: first the non-manual workers on higher incomes; then the self-employed; then the part-time workers; and last year, new entrants to the public service.</P>
    <P>This year I am taking another step forward by bringing workers on community employment programmes into full class A social insurance.  This will improve their status and their entitlement to insurance benefits and payments and is a reform for which they themselves have been campaigning.</P>
    <P>Critics of PRSI should bear in mind that the social partners have developed this system over many years.  It represents a form of social solidarity between different generations and different sections of the labour force.  It cannot and should not be lightly dismantled but must be maintained and developed.  I intend, in accordance with the commitments in this Government's programme, to do precisely that.  It should be borne in mind also that if PRSI were to be abolished, as some Opposition Deputies have advocated, the cost of the benefits to which people have built up entitlements would have to be transferred to income tax payers. This would mean raising the standard rate of income tax from 27 per cent to 33 per cent and the 48 per cent rate would have to go up to 62 per cent.  I doubt if such increases would find favour with many taxpayers and I look forward to seeing these figures in the Progressive Democrats Party's next election manifesto, if they are determined to pursue this misguided notion.</P>
    <P>I will, in the near future, be publishing a discussion paper on PRSI which I hope will generate some fruitful and informed debate on this important subject.</P>
    <P>The social welfare dimension of today's budget is as important as tax and employment because it deals not only with the entitlements of insured workers but also with the entitlements and living standards of unemployed workers, of pensioners and of many thousands of families.  In round figures about 27 per cent of social welfare <Col N="957" /> spending goes to pensioners; another 28 per cent goes to the unemployed; and a further 28 per cent is spent on family income support.  Five per cent goes on administration and the rest on illness payments.  I now want to explain what the budget is doing for each group of beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>All weekly payments and all adult dependant allowances are being improved in real terms.  Inflation this year is expected to be 2.25 per cent and all payments will go up by more than this &mdash; on average by about 3 per cent. There will be at least an extra £2 per week on all personal rates and at least £1 extra on adult dependant rates, with special increases for carers and old age pensioners living alone.  The full list of new rates is shown at Appendix 1 which I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>In real terms, these are among the best improvements in the past decade. During that time, there were three years in which the order of real increases was the same or similar and only one year in which it was significantly better.  Contrary to Fianna Fáil propaganda, there were two years in which it was significantly worse and increases below inflation were given by none other than the then Fianna Fáil Ministers.  The Leader of Fianna Fáil was quite consistent when he said last month that social welfare expenditure ought to be in decline, as his party colleagues tried to start this process in 1987 and 1989.</P>

      <P>The Leader of Fianna Fáil recently called also for an end to what he terms &ldquo;endless incrementalisation&rdquo; in social welfare payments.  I am delighted to disappoint him.  This year real progress has been made towards achieving the target rate set ten years ago by the Commission on Social Welfare.  That target rate, updated from 1986, is now £68.10 per week.  To bring every social welfare recipient to at least that rate would have cost £114 million and unfortunately this was impossible given the Government's <Col N="958" /> other commitments and constraints &mdash; on public spending, Exchequer borrowing, stimulating employment and rewarding work.  However, I am pleased to announce that this year's improvements bring more groups up to that target rate, that contributory pensioners continue to be well ahead of it, that for the first time widows, widowers and deserted wives have reached the target rate, that carers and invalidity pensioners are now on 99 per cent and 97 per cent of the rate, respectively; and that all other groups are either at 92 per cent or 95 per cent of the target rate. This is a major development when we consider that in 1985 some groups were only at 64 per cent and 66 per cent of that rate.</P>
      <P>I very much hope that it will be possible to complete the process next year and to bring all groups to the Commission on Social Welfare's target rate. Meanwhile, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I have commissioned the ESRI to review the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and I look forward to their report on what, in their view, our new target rates should be in the light of all the changes that have taken place since 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to describe in some detail the main social welfare improvements in this budget.  The level of increase being given this year will ensure that the real standard of living of all social welfare recipients will increase in 1996.  Examples of how different groups are affected are given in Appendix II of the table to which I have referred.  This increase in weekly rates is by far the most expensive single item in the social welfare budget improvements this year, accounting for more than £57 million this year and almost £103 million in a full year.  The increase in monthly child benefit &mdash; of which more in a moment &mdash; will be more than sufficient to ensure that social welfare recipients are at no net loss as a result of maintaining child dependant allowances at their existing level.  Deputies will be <Col N="959" /> aware that increasing child benefit rather than child dependant allowances is part of the Government's strategy of working towards a basic income for children as provided for in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>The policy direction initiated by me last year with regard to financial support for children is being continued and further developed in this year's budget. Following the historic increases last year, child benefit this year is being increased by £2 per child per month from next September.  This will bring the monthly payment to £29 for the first two children and £34 for the third and subsequent children.  Taking the last two years together, a 45 per cent increase has been provided in respect of the first two children and a 36 per cent increase for other children.  In cash terms, real support is now being provided to families rearing children.  A family with four children will now get almost £30 a week in child benefit while a six child family will get almost £45 a week.</P>
    <P>Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is a universal payment which is very well targeted to middle and lower income families.  Over one million children and almost half a million families benefit from it.  Only 5 per cent of spending on child benefit goes to those with incomes in excess of £30,000 per annum.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes as it is not taxable; it is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and it is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, such as differential rents, medical cards, etc.  It cannot act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages; it cannot constitute an unemployment or poverty trap.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce a budget increase in allowances for the parents of twins.  This recognises the significant costs involved for the parents of twins. The current grant of £200 payable on the birth of twins is being increased to <Col N="960" /> £500 and a new grant of £500 is being introduced which will be payable on the twins reaching the age of four and the age of 12.  These subsequent increase are intended to help with particular points of financial pressure as the twins enter primary and secondary school.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was introduced in 1990 as an income maintenance payment for those providing full-time care and attention to pensioners and certain disabled persons.  I am glad to announce a further improvement this year.  The weekly personal rate is being increased by £5, which is well in excess of the general 3 per cent increase in other weekly rates.  The new weekly personal rate will be £67.50, which is an 8 per cent increase on the current rate.  This new rate represents 99 per cent of the target rate set by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Over 8,000 recipients will benefit from this special increase.</P>
    <P>For pensioners, as for other categories of persons, I have devised a number of targeted measures in addition to the general increase.  I am particularly keen to ease the position of pensioners on low incomes who find themselves just marginally outside the conditions or income limits for the various schemes. Accordingly, I am pleased to announce the following improvements: The living alone allowance is being increased to £6 a week, which represents an increase of 22 per cent on the current rate; the free schemes of electricity allowance, telephone rental allowance and colour television licence are being extended to low income pensioners who do not qualify at present because they do not get a social welfare pension.  The weekly income limit being fixed for this purpose will be the new maximum rate of old age contributory pension, £75 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.  Pensioners whose means are under these limits who only have access to free travel at present, will now, for the first time, have access to all the free schemes.  Many widows, lower-paid public servants and people with low UK pensions will benefit greatly from this extension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> The additional means which are disregarded when assessing people's eligibility for the national fuel scheme was increased last year from £5 to £10.  I am increasing the amount again this year to £15.  This is the amount social welfare contributory pensioners can have over and above their social welfare pension and still qualify.  The fuel allowance is worth a total of £130 to each householder over the 26 week period of the heating season from October to March each year.</P>
    <P>An important change of benefit to pensioners is being made in the arrangement for <i>pro rata</i> pensions involving mixed insurance.  There was an anomaly in the system whereby a person was not entitled to a <i>pro rata</i>, mixed insurance, pension if they qualified for certain other pensions, such as an EU <i>pro rata</i> pension based on insurance in more than one member state or a pension from a country with which Ireland has a social security agreement.  To address this anomaly, amended provisions will allow a claimant to qualify for which-ever of the pensions mentioned is payable at the highest rate.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of the free telephone rental allowance requires the pensioner either to live alone or with certain excepted persons, which includes children under 15 years of age.  I am now extending that age limit to 18 years of age.  It is estimated that this improvement will bring an additional 3,800 pensioners into the scheme.  My next proposal is also directed specifically to this vulnerable group, pensioners who live alone.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to do all in its power to improve the security, both financial and physical, of elderly people and particularly those who live alone.  The vulnerability of this group has been underlined by the horrific attacks and murders of recent days and weeks.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced that tax relief will now be available, at the standard 27 per cent rate and to a maximum of £800, to pensioners who live alone and wish to <Col N="962" /> install burglar alarms.  I urge all pensioners to take up this opportunity as soon as possible, if they are in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>In order to complement this initiative and urgently address the needs of pensioners who are not in a position to avail of this tax incentive because their incomes are below the relevant tax exemption limits, I am today setting up a task force, which will be chaired by the director general of my Department, Mr. Eddie Sullivan.  Following consultation with my Government colleagues, the task force will include representatives from the Departments of Justice, Health and the Environment and will also draw on expertise from companies, trade unions and voluntary and community organisations as required.  I have asked it to report to me by the end of February 1996 at the latest, with recommendations as to how the security needs of this most vulnerable group can be most urgently and effectively addressed.</P>
    <P>The traditional, more reactive &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; role of providing benefits to insured workers and income support to those who need it is no longer sufficient in the light of the problems facing our country.  The value and importance of that traditional role cannot and should not be understated, given the huge investment by my Department in ensuring that our income supports, covering a wide range of contingencies including a minimum income for those who fall through the net, are paid in a timely, efficient and courteous manner. However, an equally important role lies in the implementation of Government policies in the area of employment and unemployment, with particular reference to the needs of the long-term unemployed.  Social welfare policy and practice must be integrated with the overall fiscal and socio-economic priorities of our country.</P>
    <P>Taking on board this changed role has required a fundamental rethink and challenge to our old approach to unemployment. It is no longer acceptable to see unemployment as a passive state of long-term dependency on the State.  It <Col N="963" /> must be seen as a positive period of transition and development for people with the objective of returning them to the workforce as quickly as possible.  It is equally unacceptable to see social welfare expenditure on unemployed people as a burden on society in general and the taxpayer in particular.  The reality is that every pound expended is a social and economic investment in our people, our most valuable resource.</P>
    <P>The challenge we face is to provide unemployed people with every opportunity to participate more fully in society and we can meet that challenge in two basic ways.  First, we can devise new and positive measures which put unemployed people on a fairer footing in the labour market and, secondly, we can remove existing obstacles within the social welfare system which militate against unemployed people who look for work.  The social welfare system must be sufficiently flexible to provide a springboard into employment and, at the same time, be sufficiently robust to provide continuing support for people until they get a firm foothold in the labour market.</P>
    <P>It is a reality of the current social welfare system that, because of the widespread persistence of low pay and because welfare payments have risen in real terms, the system sometimes offers greater security to unemployed people to remain unemployed rather than risk taking up any employment opportunities which may arise, particularly if they are temporary or insecure.  This is because weekly unemployment payments, by contrast, are secure and known in advance, whereas net income after employment may not be readily calculated, especially when statutory deductions are taken into account.  This is particularly relevant where secondary benefits are payable in addition to normal weekly payments.</P>
    <P>This budget sets out to address those aspects of our social welfare system by reviewing our existing range of work related incentives and devising a significant package of pro-employment <Col N="964" /> measures which will facilitate unemployed people in seeking and taking up employment.  I am pleased to announce the following measures as part of that package and I hope to improve on it even further in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In this budget, employers, employees and the self-employed all receive substantial concessions in relation to their PRSI contributions.  Employees on full rate PRSI, 5.5 per cent, will not now pay any contribution until their weekly earnings exceed £80, an increase of 60 per cent over the £50 allowance introduced last year.  Meanwhile, the ceiling for their contributions has only been increased by about £15 per week, less than 4 per cent.  The cost of this is £39.2 million in 1996 and £64.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Self-employed and `modified' contributors will not pay anything on the first £20 per week of their earnings and the minimum annual contribution payable by the self-employed is reduced from £230 to £215 to reflect this.  The cost of this is £2.7 million in 1996 and £4.4 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The employers' package comprises a reduction in their lower rate from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent; a increase from £12,000 to £13,000 per annum in the threshold over which the higher rate is paid; a reduction from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent in the higher rate; and a modest increase in the ceiling from £25,800 per annum to £26,800 which will index the ceiling.  These changes will cost £30.6 million in 1996 and £51 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have supported and endorsed these very substantial PRSI reductions, which will cost a total of £72.5 million this year and £120.8 million in a full year, despite the fact that they represent a loss to the Social Insurance Fund and may mean a consequential increase in the Exchequer contribution to that fund in future. However, the purpose of the reductions is to stimulate new employment and to reward those workers and employers who are currently producing wealth and contributing to the State's finances.  I am confident this will lead in turn to further <Col N="965" /> increases in PRSI revenue; indeed, there is already evidence of considerable buoyancy in the fund so I do not consider that the concessions will in any way endanger its future.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the absence of the Progressive Democrats.  When Deputy Harney made her contribution, all she seemed to know about PRSI was that the employers' rate had been reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent.  She did not seem to be aware that the incentive rate had been reduced from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent or that the floor had been increased to £250 per week, at a cost of £120.8 million in a full year.  That significant contribution will benefit all employers, particularly those in labour intensive industry and those who compete directly with industry in the UK.  It was disingenuous of Deputy Harney to ignore that real benefit for employers.  One of the disincentives against taking up employment identified by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was the immediate loss of child dependant allowances when an unemployed parent takes up employment. This happens because the State compensates for the extra costs involved in rearing a family whereas an employer pays a wage which is not differentiated by reference to family size.  Arising from a number of recommendations made to me by the expert working group in advance of this year's budget, I have been examining ways in which unemployed people could be assisted in overcoming that disincentive.  I now propose to continue payment of child dependant allowances for a period of 13 weeks to people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more if they take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks.  This innovative measure will come into effect next June when the weekly payments increase.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement has proved to be a very important mechanism for assisting low paid workers with families. Accordingly, a number of improvements are being introduced from next June, as follows: the income thresholds <Col N="966" /> governing entitlement to FIS are being increased by £10 a week at each point thus ensuring that most current recipients will get an increase of £6 a week. The qualifying period of six months in employment is being reduced to three months.  This will ensure that an unemployed parent who benefits from the retention of child dependant allowances for 13 weeks can qualify for FIS, where appropriate, when payment of the allowances ceases.  The FIS scheme is being extended to job-sharers, subject to the usual condition being satisfied. Payment is calculated by reference to weekly income and the number of children will be adjusted immediately on the birth of a child rather than having to wait until the annual review of FIS entitlement takes place.  This will make the scheme more immediately responsive to workers with growing families. The number of hours which must be worked to qualify for FIS is being reduced from 20 to 19 hours a week to reflect the prevalence of the 39 hour week in most employments.</P>
    <P>To simplify the system and improve the incentive for unemployed people to take up casual or part-time work opportunities, the provisions for the assessment of earnings from employment are being revised.  The main features of the new arrangements are as set out in Appendix III.  The purpose of the change is to make it easier for people to calculate how much better off they will be if they take up part-time or casual employment; and to ensure they will be better off than they are under the present system, if they do so.</P>
    <P>Employment under the community employment programme is currently insurable under the Social Welfare Acts for the purposes of occupational injuries benefit only.  Participants in community employment currently receive credited contributions but from next April, they will be insured at Class A PRSI, which will give them a paid contribution for each week and put them on a par with other Class A workers.  The PRSI exemption scheme will be available to community employment sponsors to <Col N="967" /> alleviate any additional costs arising on their side.</P>
    <P>The range of support services which my Department provides to unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, has been developed in the context of assisting unemployed people to achieve their full potential and to participate in society with dignity. The most successful of those services has been the back to work allowance which to date has encouraged over 10,000 long-term unemployed people and lone parents to return to employment, either as employees or in self-employment. The number of participants was increased to 10,000 last year and I am very pleased, in the light of its success to date, to announce a further increase in the number of participants to 15,000 for 1996.  I have every confidence that the new target of 15,000 participants will be achieved by the end of the year.  Furthermore, I am providing an additional sum of £150,000 this year to assist participants engaging in self-employment ventures with business advice, technical assistance and relevant training.  I am also pleased to announce that the number of places on the student summer jobs schemes, which has proved very popular, will this year be maintained at its greatly-increased 1995 level.</P>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is an important element of our family income support mechanisms. It provides assistance to families with school-going children at a particularly expensive time of the year.  It is paid in the period June to September each year and benefits some 114,000 families with 270,000 children.  The allowance is being increased again this year from £40 to £43 for each child in primary school and from £55 to £58 for each secondary school child.  These new allowances represent increases of 23 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in the past two years.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the supplementary welfare appeals system has attracted considerable criticism in recent years.  Amongst those who have <Col N="968" /> expressed concern about the adequacy of the system are the Ombudsman, agencies such as FLAC and Combat Poverty, and many Deputies in this House, including me, who have been made aware of the difficulties involved through contact with their constituencies.</P>
    <P>I have now had the opportunity to consider the results of a review of the procedures in this area.  To be effective and to gain the confidence of the public, an appeals procedure must be able to demonstrate independence, an adherence to fair procedures and a consistency of approach.  The social welfare appeals system &mdash; administered by the Social Welfare Appeals Office &mdash; has those characteristics in abundance.  This has been widely acknowledged by welfare rights groups and other commentators.</P>
    <P>I have decided, therefore, that the Social Welfare appeals office will, in future, also take responsibility for SWA appeals.  The SWA system plays a very significant role in the overall income maintenance arrangements.  The quality of the valuable service provided by the various health boards across the country can only be improved through the existence of a demonstrably independent appeals system.  The necessary legislative changes to give effect to this decision will be provided in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996.  In the meantime, my Department is examining the administrative and other implications arising from this decision with a view to its implementation as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>In line with announcements which have already been made in this regard, the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit schemes are being replaced with a new one-parent family payment which it is envisaged will be introduced with effect from next January.  The necessary legislative changes to bring this new payment into effect will be provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, 1996.  The new arrangements will ensure equality of treatment between men and women in the area of lone parenthood and will also remove <Col N="969" /> the existing conditions requiring that desertion be proved.</P>
    <P>Two measures are being introduced for the benefit of blind or visually impaired people.  First, in relation to the means test for the blind person's pension, the maintenance element of the higher education grant will be disregarded with effect from next April. Furthermore, the free travel companion pass is being extended from July next to blind and visually impaired children. This will be of particular benefit to children attending special schools and who have to commute on a daily or weekly basis, by allowing them have a person of their choice travel free with them on their journey.</P>
    <P>One of the contribution conditions for the receipt of dental and optical treatment benefits requires at least 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year of which at least 13 must be paid contributions. There are currently a number of categories which are exempt from this condition, such as the long-term sick and the long-term unemployed, and I am extending those exemptions to include recipients of carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am improving the access to treatment benefits for widows and widowers whose late spouse was entitled to these at the date of their death.  Their entitlement is being extended for life, irrespective of the age of their deceased spouse at the date of death.  Currently, this concession is available only in respect of those whose deceased spouses were over age 60 years.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the vital role that voluntary and community groups can play in improving the quality of life for people dependent on social welfare and in empowering them to change their situation for the better.  My Department has had a leading part for some years in supporting local self-help and community development initiatives and I am delighted to be able to make additional resources available in this budget for those purposes.  Overall, an additional £1,270,000 is being provided <Col N="970" /> bringing the total allocation for 1996 to £9.15 million.  The additional provision in 1996 includes an extra £775,000 for moneylending and budgeting advice services, an extra £425,000 for projects under the community development programme and an extra £70,000 for the scheme of locally-based women's grants.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length last year about my conviction of the need for all citizens to have access to an independent community information service which would operate outside the scope of the official information providers.  My Department has taken over responsibility for the National Social Service Board since last June and since September I have appointed a new chairperson and board. I am glad to provide an additional £600,000 to the board to enable it to further develop and fund its network of citizens' information centres around the country.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare makes weekly payments to more than 800,000 people and nearly one and a half million people benefit from these. Over a billion pounds goes directly to supporting families, over a billion to pensioners and over a billion to the unemployed.  Much of the expenditure that goes to the unemployed, to pensioners and to people who are ill helps to support families.  Some 315,000 children depend on recipients of pensions, disability and unemployment payments. In addition, nearly half a million families receive monthly child benefit payment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare is about far more than dispensing weekly and monthly payments.  It provides vital employment support services and supports many voluntary and community groups.  It has a labour market impact, through the social insurance system which provides a range of entitlements for insured workers, through the FIS which supports low-paid workers, and through the way in which it assists unemployed workers.  This labour market impact is being improved substantially by the pro-employment measures I have just described and my intention <Col N="971" /> is to carry out even more improvements of this kind.  I will soon be receiving the final report of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare and I am confident that this will assist me further in this task. Many of that group's interim recommendations are included in today's budget package.</P>
    <P>In addition to its practical support for workers, pensioners and families, the Department of Social Welfare has a significant and growing role in developing policy and strategies for long-term social and economic development.  It has, under its aegis, three important organisations &mdash; the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Service Board &mdash; which each contribute to policy formation and planning for important aspects of society's present and future needs.  In the past year I have also got up and running, with the Government's encouragement and support, a National Anti-Poverty Strategy and a Commission on the <Col N="972" /> Family.  The former is carrying out an in-depth assessment of the institutional and other changes required in order to overcome poverty.  The latter is considering the future role of Government in relation to families, given the many changes which have been taking place in Irish family life and the need for an integrated strategy to strengthen and assist all families to carry out their functions effectively in future.</P>
    <P>This year I look forward to receiving further advice and recommendations from all these bodies and to being able to act on them in next year's budget.  I view this year's budget as the second in a three-part series and I expect the third part to consolidate the improvements in the first two and introduce further innovations. In the meantime I am pleased that this budget represents a mix of pro-work and pro-family measures which add up to very significant reforms.</P>

    <P>* A single person on long-term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare assistance will get an increase of £2 p.w. or 3.2 per cent giving them a new weekly rate of £64.50.</P>
    <P>* A carer with two children in receipt of the carer's allowance will receive a new weekly payment of £107.20, taking account of child benefit, which is an increase of £5.90 or 5.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>* A carer without dependent children will receive a new weekly rate of £67.50 which is an increase of £5 or 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>* An old age pensioner couple on old age (non-contributory) pension will have a new weekly payment of £129.00 which is an increase of £4 or 3.2 per cent on their current payment.</P>
    <P>* A pensioner who lives alone will receive a total increase of £3.30, taking account of the living alone allowance.  This brings his/her pension to £81 per week, an increase of 4.3%.  If this pensioner is over 80, his/her pension rises to £86 per week, an increase of 4.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>* All rates have moved closer to the Commission on Social Welfare's `target rate' (now £68.10 per week) except contributory pensions, which have moved further above it.  They are now 110 per cent of the `target' rate and the lowest payments (SWA and STUA) are now at 92 per cent of the target.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the equality and law reform aspects of the <Col N="979" /> budget.  The Government reneged on the promises it made before the divorce referendum in that it provided no money for families experiencing marriage breakdown.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform in the recent debate on the divorce referendum assured the House and the people that in the event of the people voting for divorce the Government would provide all the necessary services to protect the families experiencing marital difficulties. The Minister and the Taoiseach welcomed Fianna Fáil's five year strategic action plan to support and protect the family in the new environment of legalised divorce.</P>
      <P>It has not taken long to expose the hollowness of the Government promises and assurances.  The Estimate of expenditure for the Minister's Department published before Christmas contained no additional financial provision for any of the services that will be needed.  No money was provided for additional counselling services.  The existing voluntary counselling services, although achieving wonders on the scant resources available to them, are unable to cope with present needs.  Similarly, the mediation service, notwithstanding its excellent work, cannot meet even the present demand.  The amount set aside in the Estimates for the Legal Aid Board will cater only for the existing level of demand.  No money has been provided for the services that will be necessary as a result of the introduction of divorce, the effects of which will be experienced by the board in the second half of this year &mdash; people with legal separations are already queuing up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No money has been set aside for the measures outlined in our five year strategic action plan, which received a warm welcome before the referendum from the Minister and the Taoiseach.  They stated their support for an action plan for the first few years after the introduction of divorce.  It is now apparent that the Government did not use the budget as an opportunity to fulfil the assurances given before the referendum.  That is <Col N="980" /> barefaced duplicity.  Has the Government any shame?  Its behaviour in failing to meet its promises to the people before the referendum is typical of the underhand way the referendum campaign was managed, as we now know from recent relevations in the High Court about Quinngate, or the Finlay affair.</P>
    <P>What we are witnessing now are the tattered remnants of openness, transparency and accountability.  It is difficult to comprehend the breathtaking hypocrisy of the Government.  It has debased these laudable virtues by using them as a camouflage for deceit and insider dealing.  The Minister misled this House and failed to live up to his assurances to the people.  He should take the honourable course open to him.  As a member of a Government who preached <i>ad nauseam</i> about openness and accountability, he should practise what he preaches and ask the Tánaiste to resign.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Tánaiste are responsible for the referendum contract debacle.  In a written reply to a parliamentary question yesterday the Minister for Equality and Law Reform said he was not aware of the letter to Mr. Fergus Finlay, special adviser to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, until it was read out in court. In replying, the Minister failed to address the question of whether he was aware that in effect QMP has been given the contract.  All he said was that he and other members of the Cabinet and Cabinet subcommittees on divorce were not aware of the letter until it was read out in court.  That is disingenuous.</P>
    <P>The core issue is how that letter, in particular, the following phrases, should be interpreted?  First: &ldquo;Following our discussions on May 2nd concerning our appointment to handle the advertising&rdquo;? Second: &ldquo;In the event that there is any comment within the Dáil or the media which suggests that our appointment is questionable&rdquo; and, three: &ldquo;The announcement of our appointment should be low key&rdquo;?  Taken with the overall tenor of the letter, these <Col N="981" /> expressions reflect a position which any reasonable person or court would construe as meaning that an agreement had been reached that QMP was to be awarded the contract.  The Minister simply avoided the reality of the communications revealed and appears unwilling to face the unavoidable consequences of the true meaning of what was indicated in that letter.</P>
    <P>The only construction that could be placed on that letter was that the contract had been committed to QMP.  A parole contract had been made and it only remained for the Minister to complete the technicalities.  Therefore, these presentations on 22 June 1995 were simply a charade to placate and involve the Fine Gael and Democratic Left parties.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for this shabby dealing must lie with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs whose unelected special adviser in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Fergus Finlay, was up to his neck in manipulating the position and with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who carried responsibility for the procedures adopted in awarding the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In commenting on the budgetary measures I must emphasise that the Government has not delivered on its promises in relation to the referendum on divorce.  That was why I wanted it to <Col N="982" /> give a commitment, prior to the referendum, but it replied that it would give its commitments thereafter.  We know how hollow that rings and I understand how little the Government wants to hear about that at this stage.</P>
    <P>This budget is a poor reward for pensioners and taxpayers in times of plenty, high growth, low inflation and low interest rates.  This happy economic environment is one of the main products of the social partnership initiated and led by Fianna Fáil in Government. Under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and its predecessor, workers agreed to restrain their wage demands in the interest of creating jobs and a competitive environment for industry and the farming and services sectors, which has largely been achieved.  The pay-off for workers and society in general was to have been forthcoming in terms of tax reductions, in improvements for those dependent on social services and general improvements in the quality and standard of life here.</P>
    <P>This budget fails to deliver on those promises in any real way.  The country is awash with money which is being frittered away to the extent that its benefits are almost non-existent.  When one sees a current budget deficit of 0.2 per cent one is forced to the conclusion that the Government may be misleading the House, that it really expects growth to be greater than indicated and the deficit to be translated into a surplus by the end of the year.  If that is the reality, the Government is playing a very dangerous game because those dependent on social welfare and who pay income tax deserve better as a reward for their restraint and social partnership.</P>
    <P>This is a bitterly disappointing budget for widows, pensioners and other social welfare recipients who last year received a derisory 2.5 per cent increase, the lowest for 30 years.  We must remember that growth was substantial in 1995, when the work done in preceding years was beginning to pay off, when it was possible to have done much more <Col N="983" /> for those most dependent on social welfare payments, widows, pensioners and others, it was not done.  They were cheated last year in a time of plenty.</P>
    <P>This year's budgetary provision of a 3 per cent increase in personal rates is miserable in these buoyant times; not only is that increase inadequate in 1996 but it does nothing to compensate for pensioners' deficit carried forward from 1995.  At the end of the year, when it transpired that economic growth had been even greater than the Government had forecast at the beginning of the year, pensioners were fully aware that, at the very minimum, they had been cheated of 0.5 per cent.  Last year, as a very minimum, pensioners should have received 3 per cent right across the board.</P>
    <P>In the case of a widow with three children that reduction entailed a loss of an extra £1.90 per week or a total of almost £100 in a full year, which does not amount to very much in her case or that of a pensioner.  While Members like to come into the House and talk glibly about percentages, about the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare back in 1986, what do percentages mean when one has only a couple of pounds in one's hand?  Percentages do not mean anything to those people.  What widows and pensioners need is a few extra pounds per week, so that they can begin to live and enjoy some of the economic growth and general development.</P>
    <P>With all this extra money in the economy will the Minister for Social Welfare now pay pensioners those arrears and raise this year's increase to 3.5 per cent to compensate for the built-in loss in current personal rates for widows, old age pensioners and the long-term unemployed? It should not be forgotten that the 2.5 per cent awarded last year was not a once-off; that henceforth it will be built into their entitlement, will remain lost to them.  There is no question that a 3 per cent increase was the absolute minimum that could have been awarded them this year with any semblance of <Col N="984" /> decency.  The Minister for Social Welfare did not cheat widows and pensioners in this budget, he awarded them the absolute minimum for which I suppose, like them, we should be grateful. Nonetheless it is a very poor reward for them and those genuinely unemployed in a time of plenty.  We must not forget that this is a time of growth and plenty when many others are faring much better in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister for Social Welfare would like to sell this budget as representing a gain for those on social welfare, the reality is it is yet another dismal disappointment to widows, pensioners and the unemployed.  Indeed, the position was set out very clearly in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning, pointing out that, in the case of an unemployed married man with three children, his net gain at the end of the year will be £3.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the net financial position of the unemployed will not be improved to any great extent as a result of this budget.  They cannot afford to wait for times to get better to be given something more.  These are good times and the unemployed are getting virtually nothing.  It is not good enough to tell them that things may improve in the future.  They have been neglected.  Many of them live on or near the breadline and some below it and will not thank this Government for neglecting them. They know the increases given are derisory and that child dependent allowances are frozen.  They will not be fooled.  They know the Government proposes increasing ESB charges and television licence fees.  They know they have been forgotten by this three-headed committee style Government which is desperately clinging to power, but they will not forget this shabby treatment.</P>
    <P>There is no sign in the budget of the definitive policy for the unemployed. During the past ten days or so this budget was put forward as the definitive document that would provide the solution to the unemployment problem. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, <Col N="985" /> was right to protest on an RTE programme when the Tánaiste described his report as the Government's definitive response to unemployment.  The Minister of State was also right in saying it was not an adequate programme. Now that Fine Gael and Democratic Left have added their input to that of Labour, it is clear the three parties do not have a worthwhile idea between them.</P>
    <P>The plan as revealed in this budget will not make any significant impact on the provision of worthwhile sustainable jobs.  It is a rerun of existing schemes and projects.  Even the needs of successful area partnerships have been ignored. Area partnerships were set up throughout the country to break the cycle of long-term unemployment and give people support.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brendan Butler from the northside area partnership, who has experience of dealing with the unemployed and is working to implement the programmes of the Social Partners, said on a radio programme this morning that he was disappointed with the provisions in the budget and did not think they would assist the people he is trying to help. Changes in the northside area partnership may be taken as an example of changes occuring in other area partnerships. The population with which that area partnership deals has increased from 35,000 to 70,000.  The number of long-term unemployed in that area has increased from 5,000 to 10,000.  That area partnership is experiencing real success but it requires £1 million to meet the needs of its increasing population and £1.5 million to introduce the new initiatives spread over the next four or five years as it has a placement programme until 1999.  These people are doing the work but this Government is all about exercises in PR, fancy statements, fleets of advisers and PR merchants who are turning out scripts and feeding the media which have an insatiable desire for scripts and daily presentations.  In the past the daily newspapers were the next day's chip covers.  I do not know where they end <Col N="986" /> up now but they are ephemeral.  The people working in area partnerships are doing the real work to tackle unemployment, but they are ignored and have been forgotten in this budget.  There is no allocation in the budget to assist the people working in those areas.  They have made representations, but they have not been given anything.</P>
    <P>We should face reality and consider if this budget will make a significant impact.  I believe it will not.  The plan is a rerun of various schemes where even the needs of the successful area partnerships have been ignored.  Last year unemployment rose on average by 12,000 per week.  A few years before the numbers of unemployed had fallen, but suddenly last year the number increased.  People question why that has happened.  The Ministers and their staffs who are dealing with this problem daily, know what is happening and they should do something to tackle it rather than send out more PR messages.  Last year the number of unemployed rose from an average of 266,000 to an average of 278,000.  That figure will fluctuate, but the hard underlying figure is 278,000 unemployed.  Before Christmas it had increased to 285,000.</P>
    <P>This budget offers only token improvements which will have little beneficial effect on the underlying rate of unemployment.  The cost of the special employment measures for the long-term unemployed in 1996 is estimated by the Minister at approximately £5 million which will be partly offset by savings in the Social Welfare Vote, reducing the figure to £2 million or £3 million.  That was included in the Minister's statement yesterday and represents the Government's special contribution to the unemployed &mdash; the definitive response to tackling the problem. The unemployed could be excused for laughing at the cynical public relations, pre-election exercise of a Government which is out of touch.</P>
    <P>There is no improvement in income tax rates.  They stand at 27 per cent and 48 per cent.  The improvement in the standard rate tax band is welcomed, but <Col N="987" /> it is not substantial.  Perhaps its effect is best summarised in the tables which show that the overall apparent gain in net income for a married couple with two children where one partner earns £18,000 per annum, including PRSI, tax liability and the increase in child benefit from September 1996, amounts to 1 per cent.  That gain will be lost quickly when additional costs in terms of ESB charges, lower mortgage tax relief, television licence fees, petrol costs and Government bank charges are taken into account.</P>
    <P>This is no compensation for the low wage increases accepted by the PAYE worker.  The integrity of this Government in honouring its side of the bargain in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is in serious question. This is not a good budget.  People have been forgotten including people with disabilities, women at work who require child care facilities, homemakers, Women's Aid which is tackling domestic violence but needs assistance, the rape crisis centres and area partnerships. I welcome the £3 increase in the carer's allowance, the increase from £10,000 to £15,000 in the back to work scheme &mdash; that figure is rising and it will be allowed increase to £15,000.  That is a scheme about which I know a good deal as I introduced it.  I welcome the increase to 1,000 in the number of places on the VTOS, the improvements in the BIK and the tax relief for the elderly towards the purchase of alarm systems. However, the manner in which the Government introduced that measure is not the best approach.  It ignored the opportunities to introduce a system through voluntary local groups who are in touch with people.  That, rather than giving a tax allowance to the elderly, many of whom will not be able to avail of it, would have been a more appropriate approach.  I welcome the changes introduced in the community employment programme, the living alone allowance and the extension of the payment of child dependant allowances for <Col N="988" /> 13 weeks.  Those measures are all welcome. I would be interested to know the deficit in the social insurance fund and how much is being provided by the Exchequer for it.  It appears there is a £79.3 million deficit in the fund in which there was a surplus of approximately £50 million when we left office.</P>
    <P>This is not a good budget.  It tinkers with all the elements, but comes up with nothing.  It smacks of a Government which is in a state of paralysis.  The three heads of Government and their armies of special advisers and handlers are pulling in different directions.  This budget, like this rainbow coalition, is not good for anybody.  It is not good for pensioners, the unemployed, taxpayers or business.  Matters can only get worse as we approach the next general election. The sooner we have a general election the better it will be for the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Constitution Review Group furnished to me provisional reports, with relevant background material, on a number of constitutional issues on 20 December 1995.  The Government has agreed to the publication of the reports and I have arranged to have copies placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I will shortly put proposals to the Opposition Leaders on the establishment of an All-Party Oireachtas Committee as envisaged in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
      <P>The review group has indicated that the provisional reports may be revised in some respects before it submits its final report which is expected by Easter 1996.  General comments by the review group are being reserved for the foreword to its final report.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank the group for the work they have undertaken and particularly for meeting the very tight deadline given to them.</P>
      <P>I would particularly like to emphasise that.  It is fair to say that Dr. Ken Whitaker, as chair of this body, and all the members have shown tremendous dedication in mastering, in a short space of time, a comprehensive mass of material concerning our Constitution.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in complimenting the Constitution Review Group.  While the review group has reported on a number of aspects of the Constitution it would appear at this stage, and from the press release issued by the Government, that it has left out a number of important <Col N="990" /> issues, namely in relation to the structure of our courts, the trial of offences and the whole issue of fundamental rights which have been the subject of many court reviews over the years. What will happen in relation to those issues?  The press release, other documents and even the report itself appears to be silent in that respect.  The Constitution was drafted and put to the people in 1937.  Following a number of amendments, court actions and constitutional actions it has stood the test of time.  It is indicative of the review group that it has homed in on a number of areas which are not that controversial whereas over the years there have been more controversial areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not disagree with anything Deputy Ahern has just said.  He is right in saying this preliminary report deals with a series of issues on which the body had come to conclusions. Naturally, the more controversial or far reaching issues are ones on which I presume it has not yet come to conclusions and, therefore, are ones that will be dealt with in its final report, if dealt with.  The group was asked to provide us with an interim report which would provide us with at least some material on which an all party committee could be working pending receipt of the final report.  The final report is expected by Easter 1996.  Allowing for the normal delays that arise in regard to the setting up of committees, by the time the committee gets into its stride it will have a much more comprehensive document available to it.</P>
      <P>So far as the second part of the Deputy's question is concerned, his point of view is one that would be widely shared. There are other points of view too.  The process we are adopting of having an all party committee, where all points of view can be canvassed, is the best approach.  That is a matter on which I will be making proposals to the Deputy's party Leader and to Deputy Harney in the reasonably near future.</P>

      <P>Given the deadline of Easter 1996 for the final report of the committee, will the Taoiseach agree that it is extremely unlikely that any referenda will be held arising from this report in the lifetime of this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily. Either way the report is expected by Easter 1996.  To a degree that is a selfimposed deadline.  If particular matters arise on which early action can be taken, there is no reason that early action should not be taken.  That is a matter we are committed to discuss in the context of an all party committee before coming to any conclusions.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach on complimenting the Constitution Review Group on the work it has done to date.  Will the Taoiseach agree that to a large extent, since the terms of reference were so politically filleted, many of the more substantial issues, such as bail, confidentiality and so on, were not referred to this committee for consideration?  Is it intended to hold any referenda on those matters this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's description is not a good one.  There were four items on which work was already ongoing which it was felt should not be included in the remit of the committee to avoid duplication.  Those issues are: Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution which are being dealt with in the context of all party negotiations; votes for emigrants on which the Government will be presenting a discussion paper shortly to one of the committees of the House for discussion; the issue of bail on which the Minister for Justice is working and will soon finalise proposals for Government for consideration; and the issue of Cabinet confidentiality on which the Government is currently drafting proposals, having agreed the principles on which those proposals should be drafted.  Those are all important issues but they represent only a tiny minority of the important issues <Col N="992" /> that arise in regard to the drafting of the Constitution.  I would refer the Deputy to Deputy Dermot Ahern's supplementary question in which he referred to a number of important issues within the remit of this body which will, I presume, be dealt with in the report of the body and which are of great political interest.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take a pragmatic view about that.  It would probably be unrealistic to hold a referendum on Cabinet confidentiality on its own and to ask the electorate to come out to vote on it, say, next June.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> On the question of North-South executive bodies which require constitutional change, does the Taoiseach agree there is little point in having a referendum on this issue and that it would be better to deal with it in the context of the overall settlement?  Articles 2 and 3 are being dealt with separately and the wording has been more or less agreed, subject to the Government living with that.  Why has the issue of a referendum on North-South executive bodies been highlighted?  It would be better to put the full package &mdash; the final outcome of all-party talks and the necessary constitutional change following those talks which hopefully will start next month &mdash; to the electorate, North and South, in the way proposed during the past year or so rather than to put the issue of North-South executive bodies separately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it there is much sense in what the Deputy proposes but some people may suggest that the Government should show its willingness and determination to provide for this issue by making arrangements for facilitative constitutional amendments in advance of the conclusions of the negotiations.  I am not arguing that point but some people might argue that such a move would be helpful in building confidence.  As of now I do not envisage doing that and there is no particular demand for it.  Nevertheless it is probably best to keep an open mind on these issues.  This matter will be discussed in an all-party context when the committee is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that holding a referendum in the Republic only on North-South executive structures would have the opposite effect to building confidence?  I disagree with the views of the group in this regard as it may cause more difficulty.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the position on this matter, if not today then as soon as possible, as it may be used by obvious people in a later conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not be <Col N="994" /> looking for a problem under every stone.  This proposal was put forward by the group which was asked to look at the Constitution.  We are all aware that there is a problem in regard to the constitutionality of the treaty making powers of the State under the Constitution. That problem arose in the Crotty case and while the problems in regard to the EU have been resolved by way of a constitutional amendment the problems in regard to other extra territorial obligations the State might undertake have not been resolved.  There is a problem and the group was correct to highlight it in so far as North-South bodies are concerned so that we would at least be aware of it.  When we choose to do something about it is an entirely different matter and, on balance, I agree with the Deputy that it should not be dealt with separately.  Given that all parties have not sat down together to discuss the report, it is premature for the Deputy to ask me to announce a position on any of the recommendations. We should discuss them together and look at them in the proper context. There may be an argument in favour of dealing with the issue separately and we should keep an open mind on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government given any consideration to the possibility of framing a new Constitution? The group has reported on certain matters but it has yet to report on many of the more important issues such as private property and the role of the family and women.  Does the Taoiseach agree it will be difficult to amend the Constitution in a piecemeal fashion given the history of referendum debates and that it might be preferable and more effective in the long-term to consider the entire Constitution with a view to putting a new document before the public?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with that proposition is that it denies the <Col N="995" /> public the opportunity to vote on individual Articles and they are basically being asked to buy a job lot.  Asking the public to vote <i>in toto</i> on a politically honed compromise between the politicians has certain elitist connotations. A more democratic approach would be to ask them to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; on individual amendments to Articles. However, this would also create a difficulty in that people would have to vote on 100 different proposals.  There would also be drafting problems and one would have to ensure there was no inconsistency between any of the proposals and that people would be free to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on one amendment and &ldquo;no&rdquo; on another without contradicting themselves.</P>
      <P>There are practical reasons against adopting the more democratic approach whereby people vote on each amendment. It should be recognised that presenting a comprehensive new Constitution without allowing people to vote on individual Articles has certain elitist connotations which would not find much sympathy in many quarters. My personal preference would be to allow people to vote on each Article as it is more democratic.  However, it may not be possible to do this.  At the end of the day we may find that so many issues have to be addressed that a comprehensive approach is the only one we can adopt.  By discussing the matter together in the committee we will ascertain the best approach.  We should not adopt fixed positions on either side of the argument at this early juncture.</P>

The review group has adopted the course of action embarked upon by the then Fianna Fáil Government in late 1994, that is to review the entire workings of the Attorney General's office.  It has now been admitted that the workload is such that delegation should take place.  Will the Taoiseach comment on this matter and on the recommendation which states, in effect, that the Taoiseach of the day should decide whether he should reveal the advice given or recommendations made to him by the Attorney General? It also refers to the two roles of the Attorney General &mdash; the Programme for Renewal stated that the Government would examine this issue.  The review group has come down in favour of maintaining the <i>status quo</i> as regards the separation of the two roles of the Attorney General as legal adviser to the Government and guardian of the public interest.</P>

The truth is that the Government has not formed any view about them at this juncture because it is committed to discussing them in an all-party context.  That is the best approach.  If the Deputy wishes to raise some of these issues on their own merits, separate from the report, and tables a question, I will try to answer it, but I am not going to tell him what I think of each individual recommendation as that would not be a useful exercise.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was rather dismissive of my view that we should have a new constitution.  He thought it would be elitist and undemocratic if parties came together to put a new constitution to the people.  I doubt if any Government would promote a constitutional referendum without widespread political support.  All the referenda put to the people in recent years have had cross party support.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a view that almost everything must be mentioned in the Constitution?  We should seek to have a constitution that is short and deals with basic fundamental and communal rights and no more.  The American Constitution which has stood the test of over 200 years and only been amended on about five occasions is the kind of document I have in mind.  Does the Taoiseach agree that we should go for a shorter, more succinct constitution which would have widespread popular support and deal with the rights I have mentioned and not necessarily stray into areas which can be dealt with by legislation?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Harney that, as far as possible, there should be all party consensus on recommendations to change the Constitution. This does not mean, however, that one necessarily has to present them as a new constitution where people cannot pick and choose between the Articles.  There is an argument, which I have advanced, that one should do so Article by Article or amendment by amendment rather than as a job lot.  There are also arguments in favour of the Deputy's point of view.  We will have plenty of time and opportunities to rehearse them at the all party committee.  There is no need for me to go any further in discussing the issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>When I attended the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, I said that one of the major objectives for this Government is to make the delivery of quality service the ethos of all who work for the State.  I want to see a programme of devolution of decision making power to front-line staff and rewards for risks taken in pursuit of a better service. I said, in this context, that we will have to look at performance related pay but noted that there are difficulties associated with it.  I told the select committee that I regard performance related pay as an issue which is towards the end of the agenda rather than at the very top, because of the many practical difficulties in devising a scheme that will be fair and capable of being administered reasonably uniformly across different areas of service.</P>
      <P>On multi-annual budgeting, I said that I considered this to be essential if we are to make the strategic approach work.  Producing Estimates for just one year, and not giving Departments and offices an indication of the level of resources which will be available in subsequent years, will have to cease, if we are to manage our resources effectively over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also told the select committee that the second report to Government of the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries, established under the Strategic Management Initiative, has now been received and will shortly be considered by Government.  The report sets out a comprehensive framework for the renewal of the Civil Service.  Details of the renewal programme will be announced following Government consideration and that announcement will include decisions on all the specific individual issues raised in the questions today, which are addressed in the second <Col N="1001" /> report to Government, namely, delegation and devolution of decision making powers within the Civil Service; performance related pay, multi-annual budgeting and publication of strategy statements for individual Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us sympathise with the views expressed by the Taoiseach at the select committee.  The problem is that we are not clear about what he will do about any of them.  Does he still take the view that it is satisfactory and the right way to proceed to appoint an increasing number of advisers, as the Leader of Democratic Left did recently, and does he see any role for advisers in the new Civil Service structure about which he has spoken?</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need to appoint an increasing number of advisers.  We have just about the right number.  Decision making at Government level involves a mix of political and administrative concerns.  It is appropriate that Ministers should be able to avail of political advice in making decisions but the prime source of advice should be the permanent Civil Service.  The balance which has been struck is about right.  I would not favour any increase in the number of special advisers, neither would I favour a marked reduction.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach see any connection between the increasing army of advisers, at a cost in the region of £12 million a year, and the increased leaking of Cabinet papers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know from where the figure of £12 million comes but it sounds like a confection from some creative accountant who has been working for the Deputy.  I do not think it is accurate. It probably includes consultancy fees and other costs which have been incurred by Governments since the beginning of time to deal with <Col N="1002" /> administrative problems and do not relate, in most cases, with the giving of political advice.  The cost of programme managers and special advisers is comparatively small.  In the case of each Minister, it is the salary of two people.  It is reasonable that Ministers should have such advice available to them.  As the records will show, it has enabled us to get through Cabinet business far more expeditiously than has been the case under previous Governments.</P>

      <P>As a number of departmental strategic management initiative reports were completed this time last year, does the Government intend to publish them or at least lay them before a committee?  It was originally intended that the reports would form a comprehensive strategic document for Government, representative of all Departments and drafted by the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Finance. Will that document go before Government? So far none of the documents has reached the public or committee domain.  If the intention is not to publish the reports, what does the Taoiseach propose to do with them?</P>

      <P>I welcome the proposed move to multi-annual budgeting.  Does the Taoiseach agree that we also need a unified budgetary process, in other words that we should make decisions on spending and revenue at the same time? There will not be a proper focus on tax matters unless decisions on the manner in which money is raised is made at the same time as decisions on revenue.  Will the Taoiseach give consideration to that process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly agree that unless spending and tax decisions are made at the same time a proper balance or trade off between the two will not be arrived at.  If we make spending decisions first and treat tax as residual we will not proceed in the best way in terms of priority setting.  In preparing this year's budget we sought to make decisions on spending and tax in conjunction with one another, but I agree that there could be greater integration of the two processes in future planning and I hope that will occur.</P>

      <P>Given that 222,000 people, excluding those who work in commercial State bodies, work in the public sector &mdash; 15 per cent of the total workforce &mdash; and their pay bill is £4.8 billion per annum, more than we raise in income tax, does the Taoiseach agree that the only way to contain public sector pay is to rationalise numbers?  That can be done only by introducing greater autonomy for the management of Government Departments so that cash limits are set on salaries and management can decide whether to employ fewer people on higher pay and, through productivity and the use of technology, get more out of fewer people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1004" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the direction in which I would like to move.  Under the strategic management initiative it is the Government's intention to move towards a position where individual managers can make decisions about the deployment of staff resources to deal with particular problems.  As the Deputy is well aware, in the past the Civil Service has operated on the basis of a unitary service with analogues in terms of pay between people in, say, the prison and hospital services.  These set a precedent and if one moved up others also wanted to move up.</P>
      <P>In proceeding with the strategic management initiative it is important to cooperate with the trade unions representing public service employees.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, has put a great deal of effort into ensuring that the public service trade union movement understands that the strategic management initiative is not a threat to employees' rights.  Rather it offers them a freer environment in which to work, in which their talents will have greater scope for expression and in which they will have more freedom of initiative.  Given that the work may be carried out more efficiently there may be a cost saving because of the need for fewer staff.  However, it is important to point out that those working in the service will have a much more rewarding working life, not only financially but also in terms of the sense of self worth they will get from making decisions and being appreciated for the work they do, rather than the current position in which many public servants consider themselves a cog in a wheel performing a role set for them by a person whom they do not meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, stated that she believed the process of the strategic management initiative would take seven years to complete.  I agree that it should be planned over the long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I initiated the process of multi-annual budgets in the Department of Finance. While there has been a great deal of talk <Col N="1005" /> about such budgets, I have yet to hear anyone define the term.  People speak of them as an effective means of dealing with public expenditure.  However, under the present system a multi-annual budget could be a way of not getting rid of something that has outlived its usefulness. Under annual budgets something that proves ineffective can be got rid of. If there is not an in-built review such budgeting could turn out to be a nightmare for taxpayers.</P>
    <P>There is talk about accrual budgets. Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be wise to discuss all these initiatives in a White Paper?  It is the people outside the public service who pay for them. The audit review group is also carrying out a survey.  All these initiatives are being taken independently and do not meet in a coherent way.  If we are to achieve anything we must discuss them together and present them to the public in a coherent manner, rather than in buzz words that mean nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a great deal of work to do on the detail of how multi-annual budgeting would work.  I agree that it could result in rigidifying inefficiency over time rather than for one year.  On the other hand, as some decisions may not cost very much in their first year but could cost a great deal in the second or third year, we must know their long-term cost implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need rigorous thinking about the medium term consequences of the decisions we make.  Multi-annual budgeting is not a paper exercise involving the production of vast documents.  It simply requires decision makers to think through in a systematic way the consequences of decisions for the following few years and I doubt if anyone could disagree with that.  How it is structured in terms of exact procedure and so on will be a difficult issue which will take time to work out.  I am satisfied with the level of commitment to this subject within the Government and am glad the Minister included this in his Budget Statement.  I agree that it will take some time to work out its full implications, <Col N="1006" /> but that is not an excuse for not starting on the road now.</P>

      <P>When will the Taoiseach's proposals in regard to performance related pay in the Civil Service be implemented?  In particular, does he see it applying to the heads of semi-State companies like the Chief Executive of Bord Fáilte or Telecom Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not &ldquo;the Taoiseach's proposals&rdquo;; that was the way they were reported in one newspaper. These proposals were contained in the strategic management initiative in all its incarnations from the previous Government.  Performance related pay has already been introduced in the Assistant Secretary grade, so it not something I have come up with; it is not a new idea.  I have said that I see many practical difficulties with it and that I do not see it as the number one item on the agenda, but rather as being towards the end of the agenda.  However, I accept that if an individual working in the public service saves the taxpayer a huge amount of money as a result of a decision or course of action, not to reward them in some way for that would encourage them to seek employment in other areas where they will be rewarded for exceptional performance.  I do not regard promotion as necessarily the best way of rewarding good performance, because sometimes promotion means moving someone out of a job they are good at into a job they are not so good at.</P>

The way we have chosen of giving the Taoiseach overall responsibility for the strategic management initiative, while the main operational responsibility rests with the Minister for Finance, is probably the best way of achieving the impetus for public service reform. However, there is no problem with individual Members of the House or of committees who are overseeing these sort of issues putting forward different views.  We all benefit from debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>I visited Italy, the current holder of the EU Presidency, on 16-18 January 1996 as part of Ireland's preparations for its Presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year. During the visit I had detailed discussions with President Luigi Scalfaro, Prime Minister Lamberto Dini and the President of the Senate, Carlo Scornamiglio. I was pleased to learn that the priorities for the Italian Presidency of the EU coincide to a very large extent with the priorities Ireland intends to have during its Presidency.  These priorities include the effective management of the Intergovernmental Conference, the development of successful EU initiatives for employment, the fight against organised crime and drugs, and the progressing of the Economic and Monetary Union process.  As a result of these discussions, I am certain that Italy will, as on previous occasions, provide a highly effective EU Presidency.</P>
      <P>I agreed with Prime Minister Dini that structured arrangements will be developed to ensure continuity and a smooth transition from the Italian to the Irish Presidency, not least in relation to the chairing of the Intergovernmental Conference.  This structured arrangement will begin this week with consultations at official level on the arrangements for the Intergovernmental Conference which will open in March under the Italian Presidency and will continue under our Presidency.</P>
      <P>During my visit I also visited the Holy See and I had the privilege of a private audience with his Holiness Pope John Paul II.  I also met the Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano.  In the course of the meetings I had an opportunity to provide a briefing on the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also had an opportunity to learn of the Holy See's concerns in the field of international affairs including, in particular, issues of religious liberty in regions of the world where this principle is violated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> During my visit I also had very useful meetings with representatives of the Irish Community in Rome, including a visit to the Irish College, and a meeting with members of the Italian business community who have invested in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say he discussed European Monetary Union with the Italian President?  Has the Government given any consideration to the membership criteria, rather than the qualifying criteria for European Monetary Union?  All the emphasis in this debate seems to be on meeting the criteria necessary for getting involved, but once in there is very little discussion about the criteria for continuing membership. Is the Government giving consideration to this matter and is it likely to be raised during our Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost certain it will be raised.  The Deputy is aware that the German Finance Minister, Mr. Waigel, has placed quite an emphasis on this question of ensuring that not only do member states meet the entry criteria, but that there are criteria, which members will be enforcing, for continued membership after the European Monetary Union has come into being. This is a particular concern of Germany because of its historical experience of inflation.  This matter will be covered in the study commissioned by the Minister for Finance which will be published when ready, some time later this year. The Minister for Finance and I are already discussing this matter at every opportunity with our ministerial colleagues in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Italian Presidency cleared the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference to be launched in six or seven weeks' time?  I know, because of the difficulties Prime Minister Dini is having in his own country, that there is some doubt about how he will move on that but I also note it is agreed to go ahead with the launch.  Is <Col N="1010" /> it clear at this stage how the business will proceed from Easter onwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a discussion on that.  The Prime Minister gave me an indication that the Intergovernmental Conference would probably proceed by dealing with Pillar I issues first, then with Pillar II issues and then with Pillar III issues in that order, but there was no more detail as to the precise working of the agenda.  I expect the Italian Presidency is doing further work on that in advance of the meeting in Turin to launch the conference but it is fair to say that the members will decide the order of the day rather than the Italian, Irish or Dutch Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider the list of priorities he has outlined for the Irish Presidency in his discussions with the Italian Prime Minister to include the crucial area of the environment?  This is a matter on which the Irish people have deeply held views, as can be seen in the court case about to be taken in relation to the whole question of Sellafield.  Issues of the environment should feature very strongly, as they did during our green presidency last time around.  I was surprised that the Taoiseach's list did not include matters of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the issue of environmental protection at European level will be a matter of considerable importance during the Irish Presidency.  I was simply singling out a number of immediate issues with which we will have to deal, which include the Intergovernmental Conference and the matters I have just referred to, but of course environmental issues will be a major concern.</P>

During his audience with his Holiness the Pope at the Vatican, was there a discussion on the Irish language in Ireland? Will the Taoiseach inform the House of the details of the discussion, if any, which took place on both of these issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss the position of the Irish language with the Italian President.  It is a matter which may, however, be raised in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference. There was no substantial discussion on Irish language matters with His Holiness the Pope either, although he asked some questions about it during the photo-call.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that in his last visit to the European Parliament the late President Francois Mitterand made glowing references to the cultural and heritage value of the Irish language.  He used it as an important example to highlight a point he was making.  It is interesting that the Pope also referred to the Irish language. However, we were surprised by the Taoiseach's answer in which he failed to point out that there was a Gaeltacht area in his constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not issue such an invitation as I did not think it would be appropriate to do so without giving the matter considerable thought.  The Pope would be welcome to visit and we would like him to do so whenever he can.  He conveyed his blessings to the people and his concern about their welfare and the peace process, in particular.  In the discussion the Pope demonstrated a deep interest in this country and in the historical identity of the common work of the people with those of his native country, Poland.</P>
      <P>The Pope has concerns throughout the world and works tirelessly despite his years, travelling to various countries where people wish to see and hear him. He would be welcome if  schedule permitted him to visit.  I reminded him that his visit here in 1979 is remembered by everyone, in particular his words as regards peace and his rejection of violence as a means of political action.  His speech in Drogheda in that regard is particularly engraved in the minds of people who work for peace.  His Holiness will take any opportunity to promote the cause of peace in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 36, 39 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The open tendering competition organised by Bord Fáilte on my behalf to develop the national conference centre terminated because, in the considered opinion of the Bord Fáilte assessment team and the independent product development management board, none of the 13 candidates was prepared to participate in the development of the centre within the parameters set out in the project invitation document.  They concluded that while individual submissions failed to meet requirements under various headings, the key area of deficiency to emerge was in relation to funding proposals for ongoing operating costs, including proposals relating to revenue from casino gaming which is currently prohibited by Statute in Ireland.  I do not anticipate that any legal or cost implications will arise for the State from termination of the competition.  In line with standard practice on grant applications under the <Col N="1014" /> tourism operational programme, the cost of preparing submissions is borne by the applicants.</P>
    <P>I have now asked Bord Fáilte to pursue further a proposal from the Royal Dublin Society to develop a national conference centre at their Ballsbridge site.  As a non-profit making body the RDS will seek EU assistance at the higher aid rate reserved for public bodies and they intend to operate the centre without subsidy from external sources. At this stage it is too early to state the number of jobs which the construction and operation of the national conference centre will provide.  I expect to be able to keep to the original time sequence which envisaged commencement of work on site by December 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked and horrified that the Minister did not express the slightest remorse or apologise to the 14 groups, excluding the RDS, at the manner in which this competition was called off.  Groups which made submissions in this competition have been treated in an appalling way.  They entered the competition in good faith and believed they were being asked to explain how the national conference centre could be achieved.  Many of the groups feel they complied with the spirit of the parameters and reject the claim that they have not done so.  Instead of being a genuine competition, it appears it was a figment of the Minister's imagination.  It was a phoney competition and the groups which applied were given false parameters.  Given that under the parameters they were required to put entire teams in place, does the Minister plan any remedies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this is a matter of fundamental importance, it was necessary for me to lead up to a number of questions.  The Minister made the point that there was no legal or cost implications.  Has he taken legal advice on whether what he is doing complies <Col N="1015" /> with EU law?  My advice is that what he is doing is in breach of EU public procurement rules.</P>
      <P>The Minister has singled out only one group which he believes can do the job. It is questionable that none of the other 12 or 13 applicants could do the job.  If an action is taken on the matter, it could be set aside by the High Court under the remedies directive.  Will there be a comeback in the context of EU rules and regulations?  Is it the Minister's intention to compensate these people? In one case in excess of £200,000 was spent preparing the documents required.  Will the Minister answer these questions on this serious situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note what has happened.  I listened to Deputy Andrews earlier this week when he spoke of shock, horror and dismay at the termination of this stage of this proposal. I received a Government authorisation on 26 May last year to invite tenders from the private sector based on 50 per cent grant support under the Operational Tourism Programme for the provision of an international conference centre in Dublin.  That was advertised in the normal way through official channels and there were 14 applicants under that scheme.  One dropped out subsequently and 13 were fully assessed. These applicants were assessed not only by Bord Fáilte's professional assessment team but also by the Independent Product Management Board which Deputy Andrews referred to as being appointed by me but which was in fact appointed by my predecessor, the Minister for Tourism and Trade at the time, Deputy McCreevy, who was a member of the same Cabinet as Deputy Andrews.  This is an independent board with very reputable people and they, in their wisdom, asked Bord Fáilte to consult the applicants to satisfy themselves that they, the applicants, were in accordance with the criteria of the tender documentation. It transpired as a result of those investigations that none of the 13 being then fully assessed could comply <Col N="1016" /> with the criteria of the tender documentation in that they required either a Government subsidy on an ongoing basis or revenue from a casino gambling operation.  I had no option, therefore, but to conclude that stage of the process.</P>
      <P>The Independent Product Management Board then recommended that an alternative strategy should be pursued, which is what I am doing.  There is nothing underhand about this.  It was an above board official tender operation designed so that the tender process would be done in stages.  What was involved here was the pre-qualification stage so that companies wishing to apply would not be put to the expense of submitting final documentation.  They were asked individually if they were happy with their tenders.  This is a normal business plan.  Nowhere in the Operational Plan for Tourism is there a case where defraying of costs for application to tender for such a project is considered.  As far as I am concerned we are now awaiting a series of proposals from the Royal Dublin Society in respect of seeking aid as a public body to provide this centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that since the scrapping of the competition a number of the participants have revealed they suggested means of funding the conference centre other than a casino or straight Exchequer funding, thus operating within the so-called parameters set out in the project invitation <Col N="1017" /> document?  What the Minister is saying is that most if not all the groups were seeking day-to-day subsidies.  My information is to the contrary.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Nobody is suggesting any wrongdoing or anything sinister in connection with this.  What we are concerned about is the manner of the scrapping of the competition and the damage that has done to the groups who in good faith put forward their views.  It seems extraordinary to scrap the competition and pluck one of the competitors from the group of 14 and give it special consideration.  That is the main concern.  Why, after the competition was scrapped, was the RDS alone invited to submit a proposal on the national conference centre?  Is it true that as a result of all this the competition rules of the European Union have been breached, and that the 75 per cent EU funding the Minister suggests may come to the RDS by virtue of the voluntary nature of their make-up will be endangered as a direct result of the non-competitive aspect of what the Minister is now doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This was an independent operation.  I was mandated by Government to trawl the public sector in respect of expressions of interest in this conference centre, the idea for which has been around for quite a long time.  The professional assessment team of Bord Fáilte, and the independent board, which has nothing to do with me, found that none of the 13 applicants who were fully assessed was able to comply with the requirements of the tender documentation in that they required either a Government subsidy on an ongoing basis or revenue from a casino gambling operation, which is prohibited by statute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary I would like to have it.  I am categorically assured by the Independent Product Management <Col N="1018" /> Board, which is a very reputable body appointed by my predecessor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that each of the applicants who submitted tenders was asked specific questions, and on no occasion was any of them in a position to proceed without some form of subsidy. I was not, therefore, in a position to offer any such subsidy or revenue from gambling.  On that basis I took the advice of the Independent Product Management Board and am awaiting proposals in respect of this matter being dealt with by a public body.  Apart from that, no decision has been made.  If and when proposals come before me, they will be fully costed and analysed.  They will then have to go before the Government for approval before proceeding to the European Commission for further approval.  If they are approved the RDS will then have to put them out to public tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking account of all that, what special competence do these wonderful people in the RDS have that the other groups do not?  This concept of a conference centre has been going on in the minds of Bord Fáilte since 1978, 1979 and 1980.  Is the Minister telling the House that we are now reaching <Col N="1019" /> a stage where it might be a white elephant? I hope not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews is perfectly clear on the difference between the two things in question.  The tenders which were invited from the private sector were based on receiving 50 per cent grant aid from the Operational Programme for Tourism.  There is a facility within that whereby a public body or a voluntary body deemed for this purpose to be a public body could avail of up to 75 per cent grant aid.  The RDS believes it is now in a position to meet these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>From that point of view it made the point, initially, that it has been working in this area of exhibitions and conferences for many years, and that a great number of the requirements for international conference centres are already in situ.  On that basis I have asked it to submit its proposals, which I await.  That is based on the clear understanding that there will be no annual Government subsidy and no revenue from casino gambling which is prohibited by statute at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 20, 28 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised in the Deputies' questions relate to the provision of air services for tourists to the western region and to concerns about air services to the south and south west expressed by hoteliers in a recent survey, which otherwise was very optimistic about the prospects in the short-term.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has overall responsibility for the regulation of air services to and from Ireland and for policy in relation to regional airports.  Since my appointment as Minister for Tourism and Trade both I and my Department have been in regular contact with the Minister and his Department on the development of more competitive, regular and good access links with our main markets.  I am particularly anxious that opportunities for expanding access to Ireland and the regions generally should be fully exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> I am glad to say that some progress in this area has been made, with an increasing number of European tour operators undertaking direct charter services into airports outside Dublin, including Cork, Kerry, Shannon and Knock.  Nearly 180,000 seats are now provided annually on inbound charter services with very competitive prices from mainland Europe.  Eighty per cent of these go to airports other than Dublin. I am especially pleased with the decision of tour operators from Germany to commence services to Knock for the first time in 1996.  In addition to the charter services, Aer Lingus schedule services from Germany are now servicing Kerry directly.</P>
    <P>Increased competition on the London-Shannon route has now been facilitated by the commencement of services on that route by AB Shannon since December 1995.  In addition, Aer Rianta has announced that new carrier development at Cork and Shannon will be further facilitated by a package of landing charge rebates which exceeds the incentives available at Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand from preliminary figures provided by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications that combined passenger movements at all regional airports in 1995 were 20 per cent higher than the 1994 figure, reaching over 350,000, and that Cork and Shannon airports reported terminal traffic increases of 21 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>The marketing sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Tourism provides for particular priority being given to the marketing of additional capacity and new routes.  I would hope that as our international marketing efforts continue to attract more and more visitors to Ireland, the demand for direct access to the regions will grow and further new services will be developed.</P>
    <P>However, in the final analysis it is important to bear in mind that the initiation of new services, including the expansion of existing services, is a matter solely for decision by the individual <Col N="1022" /> airlines on the basis of their commercial judgment.  The development plans, traffic potential and viability of the regional airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister's optimistic reply becomes a reality because as he knows considerable concern has been expressed in this regard, particularly by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, which is the umbrella organisation for the other organisations. Recent Irish Tourist Industry Confederation research has indicated that tourism, particularly in the past two years, has been growing much faster in the east than in the west.</P>

      <P>Kerry was up by 101 per cent and Waterford was up by 44 per cent.  It is important to note also that 54 per cent of the revenue spent on tourism is spent in the western region. Too often a pessimistic view is taken of this matter.  Every visitor who comes to <Col N="1024" /> any part of Ireland is a potential visitor to other counties.  I am well aware of the hoteliers' concerns and for that reason we must have a good programme of investment and in that regard we have invited worthwhile projects to be applied for under the European Regional Development Fund programme. On the west coast, special designated tourist resort areas for tax purposes were approved in last year's budget for the provision of up-to-date quality facilities.  The general economic climate outlined in yesterday's budget will help both employment and investment in terms of tourism facilities.  I am not in any way despondent about this matter.  I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, on securing easier access to our regional airports and I will continue to do that.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>As was indicated in response to similar questions on 5 October and 15 November 1995, the provision of the necessary infrastructure for designated resort areas is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>In this regard I understand that the Minister for the Environment is at present considering proposals in relation to new and improved water and sewerage services at a number of designated resort areas in the context of his Department's 1996 water and sewerage schemes programme.</P>
      <P>All reliefs and allowances claimed under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas in respect of qualifying investment in tourism facilities are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. The scheme was introduced with effect from 1 July 1995 and I understand that tax returns covering the period since then are not required by the Revenue Commissioners until February 1996, at the earliest, for purposes of corporation tax or 31 January 1997 for income tax. While I understand there has been a significant level of interest to date in the scheme, obviously it will be some time before the benefits become evident on the ground in terms of new or improved tourism facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole parliamentary question procedure is not very satisfactory but I realise this is not the time to raise that matter.  I asked the Minister the extent to which new developments have been initiated and I do not believe I received an answer to that question. This scheme was announced in last year's budget.  We are now 12 months down the road and many meetings have taken place in the resorts to explain the Government's scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve months after the scheme was initiated I want to know what has been its effect.  How many new projects are being initiated as a result of <Col N="1026" /> the incentives the Minister announced, including the details which were put together afterwards and which were explained at these meetings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Local Government Deputy Molloy knows well the consideration that must be given before one can proceed to provide a hotel complex, holiday village complex or whatever.  It requires some thought on behalf of the promoters.  It also requires detailed discussions with their accountants in addition to all the other practical matters that must be taken into account before facilities can be put on the ground.</P>
      <P>Having visited a number of resorts since the pilot scheme was announced I know from personal experience there are indications of an intense interest in property and in its movement.  A number of environmental schemes which were on stream before the announcement of the scheme by local authorities have commenced and are not strictly related to the pilot scheme.  This will be an added advantage to the provision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy knows as well as I do that there is a major proposal for Salthill, Galway.  I have not seen anything beyond the newspaper reports of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should listen to the reply in the first instance. The scheme was introduced on 1 July 1995.  The relief is given by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the project qualifying.  The tax returns which have to be submitted by the individual operators in connection with this scheme are not required by the Revenue Commissioners until February 1996 in respect of corporation tax and 31 January 1997 in respect of income tax.  It will be some time before one can give an accurate reading on this.  All I can say is that the Deputy is as wise as I am, if not wiser.  He is aware of the interest in the movement of property on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only come to the conclusion that the Minister is not aware of developments initiated as a result of the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us details of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat that any developer or individual may apply for a development in any of these resort areas and if they wish to be included under the relief given by the scheme, they do not have to submit their documentation to the Revenue Commissioners until February of this year for corporation tax purposes or until January 1997 for income tax purposes.  I cannot give the Deputy an accurate reading of what relief will be sought from the Revenue Commissioners until the documentation has been submitted to them.  However, I am aware of planning applications and the movement in the property market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question did not refer to the relief being granted by the Revenue Commissioners but to the Minister's knowledge of the effect of the scheme and the developments initiated as a result of it.  Members welcomed the scheme and hoped it would be a success but its terms were drawn up subsequent <Col N="1028" /> to that by the officials.  I am seeking to establish if the minutiae of the scheme are an obstacle to people participating in it because that is what I hear.  I had hoped that the Minister for Tourism and Trade, who announced the scheme, would be able to inform the House 12 months later of the level of development resulting from it.  I am not talking about developments that have been completed because that would not have happened under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was initiated between the Departments of Finance and Tourism and Trade following discussions with the Revenue Commissioners and was drafted quite generously. If Deputy Molloy has specific evidence of the minutiae of the scheme causing difficulties, I will certainly be glad to have those difficulties explained to me in writing.  I have had a number of queries clarified quite quickly by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  I will be happy to have any difficulties the Deputy has clarified if he submits them to me in writing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>All in this House share with the public a deep sorrow and concern for those people who have been so viciously attacked or murdered and for their families, relatives and friends.  We feel a profound repugnance for the sort of person who would contemplate such acts of savagery, let alone carry them out.  While we are shocked by these acts, it would be dangerously naive to hold out the pretence that there are single solutions or actions and it would underestimate the complexity of crime and its roots in our society if the only messages from this House were demands for simple, single solutions.  The matter is of such a serious nature that we should not allow ourselves to become caught up in some political game and lay blame on any aspect of our society.</P>
      <P>Major criminal occurrences, not just now but also in the past, have generated public concern.  It is right and understandable that they should do so.  It is also right and understandable that we should share the concern that is reflected both inside and outside this House.  We have been hit by the appalling tragedies in the past 24 hours involving the deaths, apparently through violence, of three people in different parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf, I extend deepest sympathy to the relatives and friends of the <Col N="1030" /> people who have been killed in such a way.  It is part of our duty also to see to it that no effort will be spared in finding the culprits of these heinous crimes and ensuring that the due process is applied to them, which they have savagely and callously denied to their victims.  I have been in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and senior members of his management team this morning and I assure the House that they have assured me that no effort is being spared, or will be spared, in bringing those guilty to justice.  A tactical deployment team of gardaí was already in preparation before the most recent crimes and this will be in place very shortly to confront criminal activities in rural Ireland.  Members will understand that I cannot go into detail of what exactly that tactical deployment involves, for the very obvious reason of not giving the same information to those who have been carrying out these crimes.  The Garda authorities have assured me they are satisfied all the necessary resources in this regard are available to them.</P>
    <P>Inevitably in such inquiries, the Garda must and will rely to a great extent on information provided by the public.  The House is aware of the traditional high level of co-operation between the public and the Garda in the investigation of crime.  I am sure all Members wish that type of co-operation to continue and join me in appealing to the public, who have any information which might be helpful to the Garda in the investigation of these offences, to come forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The availability of such co-operation and information has already led to the arrest of a number of people for some of the crimes of this nature which have been committed and others are under investigation by the Garda.  People known to have been involved in this type of crime are being sought.  As public representatives, it is also our duty, and my duty in particular as Minister for Justice, in dealing with the issue of crime to ensure our facts are correct. <Col N="1031" /> Without this, we have no real prospect of tackling the problems we face.  Former Ministers for Justice will recognise the validity of my comments.  They said it themselves, and correctly so, when faced with similar crime situations.</P>
    <P>Provisional crime figures indicate that crime increased by 1 per cent in 1995. In this regard the increase in crime follows on from successive increases recorded since 1990.  However, it is important to note that offences against the person, such as murder, sexual offences and assault, make up a small fraction of overall crime.  For example, in 1994, the last year for which complete figures have been published, there were 1,327 offences against the person from a total of 101,036 indictable offences recorded.</P>
    <P>Certain crime trends are a cause for a great deal of concern.  For example, an upward trend in the level of reported sexual crimes has been evident for a number of years.  Reports of rapes doubled in the period 1990 to 1994 and there was an increase of 25 per cent for the period January to November 1995. On the other hand, the commission of serious crime involving the use of firearms decreased overall in 1993 and 1994.  This downward trend continued in 1995.  The overall trend with regard to such crimes is welcome in the sense that the figures are decreasing.</P>
    <P>Regarding attacks on the elderly, it is useful to put the current position in context, although this in no way takes from the horror we experience at the recent spate of this type of crime.  It should be noted that there were 432 attacks in 1984 where the injured party was 65 years of age or over, living alone in a remote area and some form of confrontation took place.  Following determined action taken by the Garda at that time to deal with this problem, the number of attacks decreased significantly in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>For example, by 1988, 118 attacks of this nature were recorded by the Garda. This figure continued to fall in the following years.  There were 66 attacks in <Col N="1032" /> 1991 and 1992.  By 1993, this figure began to increase slightly to 80 attacks. In 1994 there was once again a reduction to 69 attacks.  I understand the 1995 figure, which is not available yet, will show an increase on the 1994 figure, particularly over the final part of the year.</P>
    <P>Having provided the facts about crimes against the elderly, I will provide other facts relevant to the questions raised today.  The capacity of prisons needs to be increased and I never denied that fact since becoming Minister for Justice.  There is space for approximately 2,200 offenders at present and more capacity is required. Within a short time &mdash; a matter of weeks rather than months &mdash; I will bring my proposals to Government which are designed to increase prison capacity within the shortest possible time frame. The problem has been growing for years and all the options needed to be examined, not just those for new buildings which would provide places in two or three years when places are required now.  I have completed my examination of all the options and the capital injection in the budget yesterday of £3.7 million will be used to maximum benefit.  I will bring my proposals to Government without delay.</P>
    <P>More judges and a modern system of operation of the courts are required. The enactment of the Court and Court Officers Act has taken action in that regard.  Other elements of that legislation are now in place, such as the membership of the Judicial Appointments Board and the Courts Commission, which I established under Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  They are working vigorously at their tasks, making recommendations for changes in the operation of the courts.</P>
    <P>Law reform is required to match the need caused by the changing nature of crime.  I stress the following point in case the public thinks the only way crime can be tackled is to continue introducing a plethora of legislation. The House is aware that a vast range of criminal law is already on the Statute <Col N="1033" /> Book.  This is successfully used daily in the investigation of crimes and bringing the perpetrators to justice.  However, the Government also recognises that more can be done in this regard.  This is why, since becoming Minister, a major progress of criminal law reform has been under way in my Department.  I believe a wide range of new criminal justice measures will be placed on the Statute Book this year and that the vast amount of ongoing preparatory work in my Department will bear fruit.  I can provide more details if the Houses wishes.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to pretend that extra places, extra judges or any form of law reform will eliminate all serious criminal activity.  I wish that were so, but we know that would not be the case.  It would be misleading in the extreme if I said any of the appalling crimes which have become known in the past 24 hours and in recent months would have been prevented necessarily by any of these measures.  At this point we do not know and in the absence of actual knowledge we should not seek to confuse the broad issue of response to crime and crime prevention generally with the question of preventing the three recent deaths, which have left families bereaved and shocked and communities saddened.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult in the aftermath of any tragedy of this nature to try to dispel the sense of fear and hopelessness it engenders for those who are most vulnerable, it is our positive duty, and mine in particular, to do so.  It is wrong in the extreme &mdash; former Ministers for Justice made this point previously following similar spates of crime &mdash; to add needlessly to fear at such a time.  We owe it to the public to point out that people can take sensible measures themselves in conjunction with local organisations and the Garda.  By pointing out that people can take measures, I am not diminishing my responsibility or that of any other person.  I hope people will accept my comments are realistic.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the most hideous aspects of attacks on the elderly, <Col N="1034" /> particularly in rural areas, is that the aftermath creates a climate and fear, particularly among elderly people living alone.  Attacks of the nature of those which occurred recently, more than most other crimes, have indirect as well as direct victims.  Thankfully, there is an acceptance by local communities in rural areas that they have a part to play. Hence the great success of the Community Alert System.</P>
    <P>I recently received deputations from representatives of Muintir na Tíre, the IFA and the ICMSA and a medi-alert scheme was suggested.  I am already holding consultations with other Ministers to examine whether this type of scheme can be implemented for people of a certain age living alone or in isolated areas.  I also welcome the burglar alarm scheme introduced in the budget yesterday.  While it does not diminish the seriousness of the present situation, there was a spate of similar attacks in the past.  The Garda gave priority to it and that is one of the main reasons the criminals were apprehended and the attacks brought to an end.  In his report to me today the Commissioner assured me the Garda are giving this matter high priority.  I am confident their proposals and mechanisms will be successful and that they will have the support of all right-thinking people for the sustained and comprehensive manner in which they undertake them.  The message must go out to those who commit these crimes that they will be caught and punished in a way that shows our repugnance of their crimes.</P>

      <P>It is the duty of every public representative irrespective of his or her political persuasion to raise matters as serious as this in the House elected by the people.  To do otherwise would be a negation of duty.</P>
      <P>From the Minister's figures, it would appear that a further 1 per cent increase in indictable offences in 1995 means that in excess of 102,000 indictable offences were committed in 1995.  Does the Minister agree that the backlog of murder and rape cases in the Central Criminal Court where a trial date has not been set for in excess of 24 murder cases contributes to the public perception that people can literally get away with murder? The next list to fix dates for trials in the Central Criminal Court will be on 21 March.  There are 24 murder cases and 54 rape cases awaiting trial dates. Only one or two judges are available to hear those cases.  Does the Minister agree there is a serious obligation on her to rectify that matter?  Not only does it give such a perception to the public but it clearly sends out the wrong message to hardened criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the process of appointing additional judges.  As soon as they are appointed they will tackle the backlog of cases.  That is partly the reason I brought the Court and Court Officers Bill back before the House.  I have told Deputy O'Donoghue many times that at least 12 other measures in that legislation will speed up the procedures which solicitors, barristers and others associated with the courts take so much time to complete in the pre-trial stage.  When that legislation impinges on the work of the court we will see a reduction in the backlog.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said.  It is wrong that there should be such delays in hearing cases but priority is given to criminal matters.  That is why, in some instances, there are delays of up to three and four years in hearing civil matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the condolences offered by the Minister and Deputy O'Donoghue to the bereaved families and to the families of those who are still missing.  The Minister stated there were 69 attacks on elderly people in 1994 and it is anticipated that figure will be higher for 1995.  What specific evidence have the Garda to link any or all of these attacks with a person or persons on temporary release or categorised as &ldquo;unlawfully at large&rdquo; of which there are over 1,000?  If there is evidence of a link between an offender absconding from an open institution and his or her involvement in an attack on elderly people, what steps have the Garda taken to recapture this person or these persons without warrant, which is permissible under the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the Garda operational dividend from the ceasefire?  How many <Col N="1037" /> gardaí were redeployed from Border areas to deal with escalating crime against vulnerable old people in rural areas?  Is it possible that the Government's only response is to give them tax relief if they install a burglar alarm? When those alarms go off will they be heard in the Garda station or by sheep? Is that the Government's only response to such crime?</P>
    <P>In spite of the Minister's and the Commissioner's mututal assurances, is she unaware of the community's lack of confidence in the capacity of the Garda to deal with such crime?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell the Deputy if any of those arrested for some of the crimes committed are on temporary release because investigations are ongoing.  Any prisoner on temporary release caught committing a crime can be arrested immediately.  There is no evidence available to me &mdash; I asked the Garda for this &mdash; that any of the people they suspect of committing these crimes are on temporary or early release.</P>

      <P>I will not know who the people are until they are captured.  That category consists of people who were on temporary release over the last four or five years and did not return to complete their sentences.  I am precluded from going into too much detail on Garda operations and how they apprehend criminals.  Nobody has been brought to court for these crimes but those suspected of committing them were apprehended as they attempted to leave the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the number of gardaí who have been deployed from Border areas.  I do not have that information as the question did not deal with that issue.  However, since the ceasefire, the deployment of gardaí to Border counties has virtually ceased.  Recruits from Templemore who heretofore would have been sent to the Border <Col N="1038" /> regions are now deployed in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether I am satisfied that the Garda will be able to tackle these crimes.  The Garda have informed me they are deploying a tactical force to rural Ireland which is targeted to respond to the crimes committed.  I will not go into detail on where that force will operate from day to day, but it is important that it operates effectively. As a result of good intelligence to the Garda a number of people have been arrested on their way to commit crimes. It is not acceptable to create the impression that the Garda are helpless and that nothing has been happening. Some people are under surveillance with a view to their arrest, some have been arrested and others have been stopped on their way to commit crimes.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister that we had to raise the question of the Courts and Court Officers Bill over a long period in the House to have it introduced.  Is the Minister in tune with the depth of public concern about crime?  It appears not.  From the published Estimates for her Department for 1996 the Garda received only a marginal increase, about the equivalent of inflation.  Does the Minister believe such an increase is appropriate in the light of escalating crime?  Will she agree that the current liberal bail laws contribute to the present murder epidemic since a person arrested today for the crime of murder, the most serious crime one can commit, is unlikely to get a trial date before late 1997 and remains at liberty until then?</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting there is a single solution to this problem but I have a responsibility to remind the Minister that it is her duty to do everything possible to minimise or resolve the problem. In the last year she did not introduce one Bill to tackle crime.  I suggest it is time she ended her clear belief that invisibility is the best from of transparency.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that I am fully in tune with the depth of concern and alarm at the crimes committed in our community.  I probably have more access than any other Member to information on the alarm and concern expressed by the public.  I met many deputations and am well aware of the extent of alarm at this problem.  I have taken numerous actions to bring about the necessary changes in operational matters in the Department and in terms of the Garda.  The Deputy may think it is useful to describe in colourful expressions my action &mdash; or inaction as he perceives it &mdash; but such criticism of me does not solve the problem.  I know what I am doing and the steps I have taken have had a dramatic effect on crime.</P>

      <P>The drugs problem has existed for a few years, and there is no point in pretending otherwise.  I am putting in place measures in our prisons that, I hope, will give drug addicts who end up there a chance of rehabilitation so that they will not commit further crime when they are released.  Deputies need have no fear that I am ill-informed or not in tune with the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Donoghue is aware of my views on bail.  The Law Reform Commission, at the request of the Deputy's party in Government, prepared an extensive report which I received in early October and I am finalising proposals in that regard.  In putting a referendum to the people &mdash; if that is the Government's decision &mdash; places must be available for those who are remanded without the right to bail. There is no point in bringing in a system that will not work.  We must be practical about this matter.  If a referendum on bail were held tomorrow Deputies would stop asking me questions, but it would make no difference to the system unless places are available for those to whom judges refuse bail.  There is no point in Deputies shaking their heads and waving their hands.  As I stated on <Col N="1040" /> many occasions during Question Time, prison places must be available to provide for an effective bail system. Deputies can be assured that when I am ready, I will bring my proposals to Government.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said to Deputy O'Donoghue this morning, he has put a great deal of effort into preparing legislation. I accepted a Bill introduced by him and Deputy Eoin Ryan.  It was slightly mischievous of him this morning to imply that since I accepted that Bill I should accept others.  In accepting that Bill in principle &mdash; I could not disagree with it &mdash; I pointed out at least seven or eight issues that would have to be amended.  I have not seen the Deputy's new Bill but he can be assured I will consider elements of it for inclusion in legislation that I will introduce on drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>I remind the House of the legislation that is available for use in serious drug related crimes: the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977-84; the Misuse of Drugs Regulation; the Criminal Justice Act, 1984; the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876, the Customs Act, 1956, and the Customs and Excise Act, 1988.  The impression is given outside this House that the crime problem may be tackled by the volume of legislation enacted, but it is not necessarily tackled by making public announcements about legislation.  There are about 12 Bills in preparation in my Department, which will be published as soon as they have been properly scrutinised and prepared, and they will add to, rather than detract from the corpus of legislation available to fight crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I hope I will be more successful this time in eliciting information. Will the Minister say how many women are missing in suspicious circumstances? Has she information to suggest <Col N="1041" /> there may be a serial killer, particularly of women, at large?  Are the Minister and the Garda Commissioner happy that sufficient manpower resources are being deployed in the wake of the sad murders of Marlyn Rynn and Joyce Quinn?  Josephine Dollard has been missing since 10 November last, Fiona Davis since 21 July, Margaret Glennon since 22 May.  The list goes on.  Are sufficient Garda resources being deployed on those investigations?</P>
      <P>How can this Government persist in claiming to place crime at the top of its agenda yet place it last in its budgetary choices this week?  Does the Minister agree with the Taoiseach that this Government is ruminating on the root causes of crime?  Does the Minister not agree with me that effective law and order must not await this worthy analysis of the root causes of crime?</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's failure to answer a specific question about the suspected link between attacks on elderly people in rural areas and a person who absconded from Loughan House, is she aware of a Garda report to the effect that there is such a link or is she formally denying that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can anticipate Deputy O'Donnell's reaction but it is wrong to heighten in any way the sorrow and sadness of those who have already lost female family members through murder or who remain missing by implying that somehow there is a serial killer out there.  I have no evidence of that, nor does Deputy O'Donnell or the Garda.  I suggest that such emotive terms should be avoided, which is why I endeavoured to use temperate language in this debate.  There is no such evidence and to imply there is by posing such a question is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the reason so many young people are involved in crime, is that successive Ministers for Justice failed to do what I am endeavouring to do &mdash; to tackle the root causes of crime and examine it in a much broader manner than has been done for years.  There is no point in Members opposite shaking <Col N="1042" /> their heads; they know that to be the case.  The young people now in our prisons needed help when aged five, six or seven.  The youngsters of today who will be 18 and 19 year olds in ten years time and the communities within which they live also need help, particularly families whose members may already be engaging in criminal activity.  That is what the experts, the people working on the ground with these people, tell me.</P>
    <P>The House will realise that I am combining my activities with immediate action and responses, while at the same time endeavouring to ensure that some future Minister for Justice ten years hence will not have to stand up here and ask why the Minister for Justice in 1996 did not recognise that this 16-year-old killing or beating people over the head was in need of help then.</P>
    <P>It is unforgiveable of Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; who knows more about this issue than many other Members of the House &mdash; to appear to minimise the importance of getting to the root causes of crime. For the past two weeks we have listened to lectures about public expenditure. This Government is giving law and order top priority, accompanied by the largest ever budget being given the Garda this year, including a provision of £14 million for overtime.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied from my direct contacts with the most senior member of the Garda Síochána, the Commissioner &mdash; who has responsibility for deploying the force and spending the money voted for that purpose &mdash; that every resource is being made available to find the perpetrators of these murders and the missing women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might inform the House of the current toll of missing women going back some years.  In 1992 12 women went missing, three in suspicious circumstances; one was subsequently found murdered and the cases of two others are outstanding, which means that the remainder of those 12 are women who <Col N="1043" /> appear to have gone missing for their own reasons.  In 1993 four women went missing, two of whom were the subject of high profile investigation, Annie McCarrick and Michelle McCormack. In 1994 four women went missing, none in suspicious circumstances.  In 1995 three women went missing; the case of one, Josephine Dollard, who has not yet been found, is under active investigation. An average of five or six women annually go missing, not all in suspicious circumstances.  I met the Dollard family, her sisters and brother-in-law the day before yesterday and they are satisfied with the Garda resources being deployed on investigating her case.  I asked them whether there was anything more they thought the Garda could do to assist them finding her.  They replied that they are extremely satisfied with the co-operation they have been receiving from the Garda and reassured me that every bit of information they receive by telephone or word of mouth is passed on to the Garda and followed up fully.  I might add that very large numbers of gardaí are following up the Dollard case.  This morning, following the most recent tragic murder, a very large force of gardaí was brought in immediately.  There is no question of there being any delay on the part of the Garda in responding to these appalling crimes.  The Garda move in resources instantly when required.  The public will know that, in order to do so, they may well have to take members from other parts of a division but I consider that a reasonable price to pay to get to the root of these awful crimes.</P>

As a measure of this respect and co-operation, will she consider allocating Government time to the Fianna Fáil Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995 which proposes the abolition of the present wasteful District Court preliminary examinations procedure and its replacement with a fast-track trial system which will guarantee a trial within 90 days of arrest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is blatantly dishonest of him to continue to use the word &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo; when that was not the term used in the Government statement.  I will deliver on anything to which I have given a commitment here today by bringing my proposals to Government in a very short time.  I hope at that time he will support them.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the international body has been laid before the House of the Oireachtas today.  The Houses will recall that the two Governments established the international body last November, with a mandate to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  The report of the international body was presented to both the Irish and British Governments simultaneously on Monday, 22 January, and launched this morning at a press conference hosted by the body in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I address the content of the report, I would like on behalf of the Government, and I am sure on behalf of this House also, to express our warm <Col N="1104" /> appreciation to the chairman of the international body, Senator George Mitchell, and to his colleagues, former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri and General John de Chastelain.  The three members of the body and their staff have displayed enormous commitment, skill and energy in the discharge of their difficult mandate.  The Irish and British Governments and the peoples of these islands have every reason to be profoundly grateful to them for the service they have rendered to the cause of peace.  I take this opportunity also to place on record our thanks to their respective Governments for the practical and moral support they have given to the work of the body.</P>
    <P>The essential goal we seek through the twin-track process is to bring the parties around the table.  The ceasefires are an unprecedented opportunity to resolve a tragic conflict on an exclusively peaceful and democratic basis.  The democratic process, and the future welfare of all our people, will be poorly served if we allow this opportunity to be lost.  The report puts the choice before us very simply.  It states:</P>
    <P>This is a critical time in the history of Northern Ireland.  The peace process will move forward or this society could slip back to the horror of the past quarter century.</P>
    <P>For some time there has been a dangerous impasse between two deeplyheld and opposing views: was decommissioning the prior condition for political progress, or, on the contrary, was political progress the prior key to decommissioning?  The two Governments launched a twin-track approach, aimed at replacing that essentially sterile and circular debate by a search for complementary progress on both fronts.</P>
    <P>The time-frame allocated to the body was extremely short, reflecting the urgency of the Governments firm aim of launching all-party talks by the end of February.  In spite of this pressure, the body consulted very widely, and I believe its report shows that it used that process to establish a very impressive grasp of the situation and of the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> It is also clear from the report that they have gone to great lengths to be fair to all viewpoints and to acknowledge the genuine concerns on all sides. This report, represents the unanimous and impartial view of three very distinguished individuals, from very distinct backgrounds.  It offers all of us a clear and very practical road map to the negotiating table.  It sets out the guidelines necessary to ensure that the negotiating process is fully democratic and untainted by any threat or use of force. We accept it without reservation.</P>
    <P>The body, with its valuable outside perspective has helpfully drawn attention to some positive factors in the present situation which those of us who are totally immersed in it may sometimes be inclined to undervalue.  They point to the strength of the deep consensus behind the peace.  The very widespread acceptance of the need for total decommissioning, including by former paramilitaries, offers a potentially valuable starting point for the search for an acceptable solution to this problem. They also remind us of the need to give due weight to the sustained observance of the ceasefires, notwithstanding the reprehensible killings and beatings which they so strongly condemn.  Our understandable concern with the problems we still need to solve should not blind us to the great gains already made.</P>
    <P>I was particularly impressed at this morning's press conference by Senator Mitchell' passionate appeal to avoid a point-scoring approach to his report. This was, he reminded us, a matter literally of life and death.  I hope his appeal will be heeded by all and that the report will be given the careful and positive consideration it so clearly deserves.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the focus in the report on the underlying issue of trust, or more accurately, the lack of trust, for which the decommissioning debate is in many ways an over-simplified code.  The body has very skilfully sought to disentangle the different components of the problem, and to treat each in the appropriate way.  It recognises that the lack of trust is an essentially political problem and must be addresed by political means.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> The six principles it sets out are a stringent and challenging test of commitment to democratic and peaceful methods, including during and after negotiations.  Accepting and honouring them would be a very persuasive test of the commitment required under Article 10 of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>However the body also recognises that there are genuine practical problems arising from the existence of unauthorised weapons which must be resolved as an essential part of a process of total and verifiable decommissioning. These are set out in a realistic and flexible way, leaving many of the details, quite properly, for subsequent negotiation and agreement.</P>
    <P>The report of the body replaces the polemics which had sprung up around the so called &ldquo;Washington Three&rdquo; debate with an alternative, more logical, and ultimately more promising approach.  To solve both aspects of the problem in the way they suggest, is ultimately to solve the problem as a whole. That is the crucial point for both Governments, not whether it must be achieved in one step rather than two, or according to one particular prescription rather than another.</P>
    <P>While the body was anxious to stay within its remit, it nevertheless usefully listed a number of further confidence-building measures which, while not the subject of formal recommendations, are flagged for the attention of the parties. I believe all these issues should be on the agenda for talks.  That includes the proposal for an elective process which, as the report points out, would have to be broadly acceptable if it is to contribute to confidence &mdash; or even, I would add, if it is to happen at all.  That consideration means that it is for those who support the idea to persuade those who do not.  The talks process is there for that very concept.</P>
    <P>The next step is for the two Governments working on the basis of the report and addressing also, of course, the various other issues in the political track to intensify still further the round of preparatory talks so as to achieve the <Col N="1107" /> launch of inclusive negotiations.  Both Governments remain fully committed to the firm aim and time frame set on the November communiqué in this regard.</P>
    <P>The report sets out, in very direct and straightforward terms that every citizen can understand, the unanimous view of the body on the way forward.  I hope it will be widely read by the public at large.  Even more, I hope all the parties will avail themselves of the opportunity it offers.  The Unionist parties would gain, perhaps most of all, from an agreed settlement which protected their position and heritage.  Political impasse is dangerous for everyone.  I believe many Unionists recognise that.</P>
    <P>The process of negotiation now on offer contains guarantees for the Unionist community at every level.  The principles set out by the body guarantee that any attempt to use force or to threaten force will be incompatible with the basis of talks, and will be rejected.  The Unionists themselves, by participating in talks, will be able to monitor compliance with that directly.  Second, they have the guarantee that the outcome will be subject to what Prime Minister Major called the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo;, including the most stringent possible test of democratic validation, through the process of referendum.</P>
    <P>A refusal to negotiate, given all of these safeguards, is only too likely to be decoded as a refusal even to acknowledge the existence of problems for the Nationalist community.  That attitude has taken a heavy toll in the past, and I hope we can all put it definitively behind us.  Negotiations in relation to Northern Ireland are not a luxury, and not a favour for any one side to grant or withhold.  They are quite simply a necessity, if we are to have a better future for all.  Both Nationalists and Unionists have the duty to listen to each others proposals carefully and constructively across the table, and to seek a just and honourable accommodation of their differing view points.</P>
    <P>The report points the way, but acknowledges that only resolute action <Col N="1108" /> by the parties themselves will produce progress.  It challenges all sides to take the necessary risks for peace.  The greatest tribute we can pay to the body for their dedicated work will be to rise to meet that challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I warmly welcome and fully support the unanimous report of the international body published today.  Senator George Mitchell, General John De Chastelain and former Finnish Prime Minister, Harri Holkeri, and their staff are to be congratulated on the exceptional quality of their report, and its expeditious delivery after intensive talks and consultations.  I join with the Tánaiste in thanking Senator Mitchell and his colleagues, not for the first time, who have made an invaluable contribution to the Irish peace process.  We should also thank President Clinton for giving the exercise the full backing of his administration.</P>
      <P>In Belfast, I was the first party leader to commit my party in advance to support the Mitchell report, in effect to accept it as a form of arbitration.  The content of the report is very much in line with our thinking and with the spirit of what we put forward to the body, as the party most intimately associated with the peace process in its formative stages.</P>
      <P>The report provides the means for breaking the logjam over decommissioning, which has stalled the peace process for over a year and it should be firmly grasped.  The body listened to the different positions on the decommissioning issue and has produced, in our opinion, an excellent compromise formula which deals fairly and justly with the legitimate concerns of all parties and recommends a formula that will pave the way for all-party talks in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamental to participation in all-party talks is an absolute and unqualified commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence.  This was at the heart of the Downing Street Declaration. These commitments were <Col N="1109" /> given in very clear terms at the time of the IRA ceasefire and in joint meetings between the Taoiseach, past and present, and the Nationalist leaders of Northern Ireland.  It is right that they be affirmed and amplified by all parties at the outset of negotiations, in the manner recommended by the body.  In my letter to Senator Mitchell on 22 December I recommended that:</P>
    <P>political parties associated with paramilitaries would reaffirm unequivocally their commitment to maintain in all circumstances the complete cessation of military operations and their definitive and binding commitment to the success of the democratic process.  The rule of law is an integral part of the democratic process.  The parties concerned would publicly pledge to use their influence to bring paramilitary shootings and beatings to an end, before talks would start.</P>
    <P>The six principles put forward by the body involve an absolute commitment to democratic and peaceful means of resolving political issues.  They also involve a commitment to the total disarmament ultimately of all paramilitary organisations in a verifiable way, in effect their disbandment, and a renunciation of the use of force or the threat of force to influence negotiations.  They also involve a commitment to abide by the agreed outcome of negotiations and to seek to alter anything disliked in that outcome by exclusively peaceful methods.  It also involves a commitment to making best efforts to stop and prevent punishment killings and beatings, which are not consistent with the absolute commitment to democracy and non-violence that is required.</P>
    <P>There has been much heated argument about whether decommissioning should be or was a precondition to talks. We put forward a clear and consistent view on that issue.  The body accepts that the fears of the arsenals and a possible renewed resort to force were real. The principles, if affirmed and adhered to, would remove the basis of that fear. <Col N="1110" /> I am glad the body found a clear commitment on the part of both loyalists and republicans to achieve full and verifiable decommissioning.  I agree with former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, that it represents a major step forward that paramilitary organisations have been prepared for the first time in their history to agree to verifiable decommissioning.  This commitment comes not from political parties but from those in possession of arms.  It is important and should not be undervalued.</P>
    <P>The body came to the conclusion that all parties in this House have come to, that the paramilitary organisations will not decommission any arms prior to all-party negotiations.  They state, I think with much authority that is the reality with which all concerned must deal.  It is a great pity the Irish Government and responsible parties in this House were not listened to on that score and that the British Government was badly advised assuming its demand was maintained in good faith.</P>
    <P>The body accepts the legitimate concern of those who insisted on prior decommissioning that the commitment to peaceful means of those formerly supportive of politically motivated violence is genuine and irreversible. Equally, it accepts the concerns of those who need to be reassured that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiation is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify. We have sympathy with the concerns of both sides in this regard.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the body's six principles of democracy and non-violence is to overcome the impasse over decommissioning. The solution transcends the argument on both sides and provides an alternative way forward.  It seems reasonable to us that all parties attending talks would affirm their adherence to the six principles at the outset.</P>
    <P>Progress on decommissioning is situated in the context of all-party negotiations. If, for example, the British Government or the Unionist parties <Col N="1111" /> really attach the high priority to decommissioning that they say they do, then it is important for them to adopt the only route outlined in the report that will lead to decommissioning, engagement in all-party talks as promised in the Downing Street Declaration.  A delay in all-party talks means a delay in taking weapons out of circulation.  Fianna Fáil recommended to the body, particularly in our second submission before Christmas, that, as the body puts it, &ldquo;the parties should consider an approach under which some decommissioning would take place during the process of all-party talks&rdquo;.  I said in my letter that substantive disarmament has to be a subject for negotiation.  I also suggested, as a basis for progress, that it would be understood and accepted by all concerned that decommissioning and a wide demilitarisation of Northern society would proceed in parallel on a phased basis with the progress of the political talks, and that paramilitary organisations would thus have to accept that disarmament could not be left to the end of the day.  Such phased implementation would provide confidence building during the talks process.  We have always said that decommissioning should receive a high priority in all-party talks.</P>
    <P>We support the establishment of an independent commission to provide for verification and we agree the legal safeguards and amnesties required to make the process viable.  In our main submission we recommended that &ldquo;the last solution, in our view, would be if the technical expertise of the Irish army were to be made available to assist in the decommissioning of IRA weapons&rdquo;. We also said:</P>
    <P>Some verification would be essential if the positive effects on confidence-building are to be achieved. Alternatively, the IRA might undertake the task itself with accredited observers.  In any of these circumstances, an amnesty in relation to possession of weapons would have to be <Col N="1112" /> implemented, and the full co-operation of State authorities would be required in any case.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the commission's report is consistent with our ideas and no doubt those of other parties.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government our primary concern, apart from any threat of a resumption of violence, was that arms should not be misappropriated prior to decommissioning.  We strongly emphasised that decommissioning had to be mutual rather than unilateral.  As regards an independent commission, when the time comes serious consideration should be given to appointing the Swiss based International Red Cross which is neutral and has access to all possible expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>The body recognises &mdash; this is also our long-term thinking &mdash; that continued action by the Governments on prisoners would bolster trust.  I welcome the release on parole of three long-term prisoners in Britain.  While there is no equivalence with weapons held by the security forces, there should nevertheless be a commitment by both Governments to continue to take responsive measures as the threat reduces.  In our main submission we referred to the need for &ldquo;a steady corresponding reduction in the number of licensed weapons&rdquo; and &ldquo;the importance of a civilian and largely unarmed police force acceptable across the community and broadly representative of it&rdquo;.  The report refers to normal policing, a review of legally registered weapons and the use of plastic bullets and continued progress towards more balanced representation in the police force, the key issue in the reform of policing.</P>
    <P>On the face of it the body makes a mildly positive but non-ocommittal and neutral reference to the idea of an elected body and inserts three caveats: it would need to be broadly acceptable, have an appropriate mandate and come within the three strand structure.  The proposal put forward by the Ulster Unionist Party for an elected body does not come within the three strand structure, which it now appears to reject, and, therefore, could not be entertained <Col N="1113" /> within the terms of the report.  As made clear to the body, it is mainly for that reason the idea is not acceptable at present to the Nationalist parties.  Any proposed assembly or elected body needs to be discussed in all-party negotiations, which is the only way it can come within the three strand structure and be broadly acceptable.</P>
    <P>I hope that following further reflection the British Government will give its complete support, without reservation, to the Mitchell report and accept its compromise on the decommissioning issue.  The report should be seen by all concerned as providing a direct route to all-party talks.  Given a positive and constructive response by Sinn Féin and the loyalists parties I want the two Governments to move together to convene all-party talks before the end of February, as they promised.  I strongly appeal to the British Government not to move the goal posts yet again and to act in good faith in accordance with the communiqué of 28 November last year.  I regret that before the ink is dry the British Prime Minister appears to have effectively rejected the body's report as a means of moving directly towards all-party talks.  The proposals on an assembly was only put forward in the event that the Mitchell report failed to resolve the impasse on decommissioning. The only reason it does not resolve the impasse is that the British Government is continuing to insist on Washington 3, which nullifies the exercise. With political goodwill on all sides, the body will succeed in resolving the impasse.  For that reason I appeal to the Governments to commence all-party talks.  Will the Tánaiste assure the House that the Government remains committed to all-party talks on the basis of the November communiqué?  Given the British Prime Minister's statement this afternoon, I am afraid the British Government has taken the Irish Government for a spin on a merry-goround. John Major said he had discussed the idea of an assembly with the Taoiseach yesterday and he looked forward to discussing it further with him.  I am sure that, like me, Nationalists would like to know if we are tied into <Col N="1114" /> moving the assembly idea prior to all-party talks.  I heard what the Tánaiste said last week and I accept what he seems to be indicating now.  It seems from what the British Prime Minister said today that he can move the Irish Government into a different process. That will not be accepted by Nationalists and we will not go down that road.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the mandate given to it in the joint communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the British Prime Minister, John Major, the international body presented its report to the Irish and British Governments last Monday.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the international body was an essential component of the twin-track process launched by the joint communiqué on 28 November last year.  As part of that process the international body was given a wideranging brief and a very demanding timeframe within which to complete it. This timeframe reflected the wish to both Governments to see all-party negotiations launched by the end of February this year.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the report, I wish to pay tribute to its three distinguished members &mdash; Senator George Mitchell, its Chairman and the Special Adviser to the United States President for Economic Initiatives in Ireland; General John de Chastelain, the former Chief of Defence Staff of Canada and Mr. Harri Holkeri, the former Prime Minister of Finland &mdash; for accepting the invitation of the Irish and British Governments to serve on the international body and for the great skill and enormous commitment they have shown in completing their task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also deeply grateful to the Governments of the United States, Canada and Finland for facilitating the participation of Senator Mitchell, General de Chastelain and Mr. Holkeri in the work of the international body and for the continuing assistance they provided to the members of the body in undertaking their task.  A special word of appreciation is also due <Col N="1115" /> to the staff of the international body who were drawn from the United States, Canada and Finland and who came to Dublin and Belfast at very short notice to assist the body with its work.  They have played an important part in ensuring its success and I am sure the House will wish to join me in expressing our appreciation to them.</P>
    <P>The mandate given to the international body in the joint communiqué of 28 November was, in summary, to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue; to report on the arrangements necessary for the removal from the political equation of arms silenced by virtue of the welcome decisions taken last summer and autumn by those organisations which previously supported the use of arms for political purposes; and, in particular, to: identify and advise on a suitable and acceptable method for full and verifiable decommissioning and to report whether there is a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Today's report is the product of a wide process of consultation undertaken in the course of meetings held in Dublin, Belfast and London during December and earlier this month.  That process of consultation included both Governments and the political parties here and in Northern Ireland.  I was among those privileged to meet them during their consultations with the Government and was deeply impressed by the commitment they showed to completing their task fairly and impartially, their grasp of the issues involved and their searching questions.</P>
    <P>The report is, in its own words, the body's &ldquo;best&rdquo; and &ldquo;independent&rdquo; judgment on the decommissioning issue. The fact that it represents the unanimous judgment of three independent and extremely distinguished international figures clearly adds enormously to its weight and credibility.  The report needs and deserves close reading in its entirety.  There are challenges in it for <Col N="1116" /> all sides.  There is no room for an <i>à la carte</i> approach to its findings or for approaching it with a win/lose mindset. All sides need to accept its challenges as well as its comforts for them.  By adopting this approach all sides will win. Decommissioning has not only been a difficult issue to resolve but, up until now, it has also been an obstacle to the all-party negotiations aimed at a political settlement based on consent, which is the shared objective of both the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in the time available now to comment on all the findings of the report or to adequately summarise its contents.  There are nevertheless some central themes which show clearly that the report is intended to challenge all sides and I invite the specific attention of the House to those.</P>
    <P>First, there is the finding that the decommissioning issue itself is a symptom of a larger problem namely, the absence of trust and its recognition that both those who insist on prior decommissioning and those who have been persuaded to abandon violence need reassurance.  The report recognises that those who insist on prior decommissioning need to be reassured that the commitment to peaceful and democratic means by those who formerly supported politically motivated violence is genuine and irreversible, and that the threat or use of such violence will not be invoked to influence the process of negotiations or change any agreed settlement.  The report equally recognises that those who have been persuaded to abandon violence for the peaceful political path need to be reassured that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiation is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements which they can identify.</P>
    <P>The international body recognised that absence of trust and need for reassurance requires new approaches.  It has set out the framework for such a new approach, including adherence by the parties to any negotiations to six principles, which would represent a <Col N="1117" /> comprehensive commitment to democracy and non-violence.  The body also draws attention to the value of some decommissioning during the process of all-party negotiations in order to build trust and confidence during that process. It also suggests that decommissioning should have a high priority in all-party negotiations and provides a basis on which those discussions could take place.</P>
    <P>The report is, in the first instance, a report to the Irish and British Governments. The two Governments have undertaken in the Joint Communiqué of 28 November to consider carefully the recommendations the report contains and give them due weight on their merits. The Irish Government agrees with the report and is convinced it provides the basis to move forward confidently and with renewed vigour now in the political track so as to reach all-party negotiations by the end of February.</P>
    <P>We sincerely urge all the parties to follow our lead.  We urge them to accept the report in its entirety and on its merits.  As I indicated earlier, there will be a temptation for parties to find fault with the report because it does not reflect their preferred agenda to the exclusion of others. It is incumbent on all parties to resist that temptation, because, in the words of the report itself, &ldquo;rigid adherence by the parties to their past positions will simply continue the stalemate which has already lasted too long&rdquo;.  All parties must, in the interest of all those they represent, heed the advice in the words of the report that &ldquo;reaching across the `peace line' requires a willingness to take risks for peace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The international body recognises that while it can indicate the way in which certain factors should be addressed so that decommissioning of arms and all-party negotiations can proceed, only resolute action by the parties will produce progress.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Government is already involved in an intensive round of preparatory talks intended to achieve agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda for all-party negotiations aimed at a political settlement based on consent within the political track.  Those talks have been <Col N="1118" /> ongoing since the launch of the twin-track process in November.</P>
    <P>The Government believes the immediate requirement now is to ensure progress continues to be made in those talks.  We want to see substantive negotiations getting under way by the end of February in accordance with the timetable set out in the Joint Communiqué. The Government will, therefore, seek with the British Government to intensify the preparatory talks process, working on the basis of the report and against the background of the very worthwhile discussions which have been ongoing in the political track.</P>
    <P>The international body has rightly observed that this is a critical time in the history of Northern Ireland.  It has also indicated that the potential reward is great &mdash; a future of peace, equality and prosperity for all the people of Northern Ireland.  The onus is now on all of us to secure the progress essential to realise that potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I welcome the publication of the report of the international body on decommissioning. Like the Tánaiste and other speakers, I express my appreciation to the members of the international body, Senator Mitchell, General de Chastelain and former Prime Minister Holkeri for their tireless work in recent weeks to provide a basis to move the peace process forward towards all-party talks.</P>
      <P>When I met the members of the international body, with my party colleagues, I was deeply impressed by the level of their commitment and concern to ensure that the process was consolidated and all-party talks would begin. All those who co-operated with the body in its work and all the parties who met it have a duty to accept its findings. It was asked by both Governments to independently analyse the decommissioning issue and come up with a formula to break the impasse reached in recent months.  We have a duty to accept its findings as the findings of an arbitrator.  If we are not prepared to do so, the chances of breaking the impasse are slim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> There are options in the report which would not be my preferred option nor I am sure the preferred option of many others, but nonetheless I sincerely believe, as I said ten days ago, that if we want to move the process forward the only way is to accept the analysis of these three independent experts.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the idea of an elected body as sometimes we in this House and elsewhere are inclined to accept the things we like and shoot down the ones we do not.  I have serious reservations about holding elections in Northern Ireland prior to a political settlement.  The hallmark of elections in Northern Ireland has been campaigns of extremism as each party looked over its shoulder at the extreme elements within its own community.  That would be dangerous.  If the elections were to be boycotted by any party, they would be meaningless.  For those two reasons I am concerned about holding elections in the present context.  The peace process is a very fragile process.  However, we should have an open mind and explore what others wish to see happen.  This should be done, as the international body indicated, in the context of the three stranded approach.  Elections desired by one side but boycotted by the other or which see a return to extremism, given that there has been a move towards moderation during the past 16 months or so, would pose major threats to the process.</P>
    <P>Like many others, I would prefer, for reasons I have explained in the House before, if a gesture was made on decommissioning. I accept that paramilitaries could always re-arm &mdash; unfortunately, it is easy to make explosives.  I am not naive enough to think that if one takes away the arms, this will remain the permanent position.  I have always seen this issue since the process commenced 16 months ago in the context of trust and symbolism and symbolism is important in Northern Ireland.  These arms and the people who hold on to them on both sides are the arms which killed the loved ones of so many people in Northern Ireland.  They represent a barrier to peace and reconciliation.  For this <Col N="1120" /> reason mainly, a gesture or commitment by those who hold them, to travel down the road of decommissioning would provide a powerful momentum to the peace process.  It would create the minimum level of trust to allow all-party talks to be effective.</P>
    <P>If the all-party talks are to be effective, people must come to do business. They can be in the frame of mind to do business with others only if there is a minimum level of trust.  Irrespective of my views on decommissioning, which I forcefully expressed to the commission, I must accept the unanimous recommendation of the commission when it states that &ldquo;the paramilitary organisations will not decommission any arms prior to all-party negotiations&rdquo;.  It reached that conclusion having spoken to people in the security forces on both sides of the Border and representatives from the churches, community organisations and political parties.  I must accept that unanimous recommendation even though it may not be my preferred option.  I urge others, in relation to decisions they may not like, to adopt a similar approach.</P>
    <P>If we are to break the impasse on arms decommissioning that has dogged the peace process for approximately one year, we will do so only by accepting the findings of the Mitchell Commission.  It has not been able to remove the impasse but cleverly it sought to provide a mechanism for us to get around it and we should accept that.  In particular, the six principles enunciated in the commission's report should be accepted, as it suggests, by all parties who want to be involved in the talks.  They are comprehensive and could provide a basis for creating the minimum level of trust we all want if we are to have effective talks.</P>
    <P>The commission wants all parties to the talks to accept that they can achieve their political aims only through democratic and exclusively political means.  It wants a commitment that paramilitary organisations will disarm and that that will be verified by an independent body. It wants everybody who comes to the table to do everything possible to end punishment beatings and killings and in that regard it mentions taking effective <Col N="1121" /> steps.  It wants everybody who comes to the talks to agree that they will not use violence or the threat of it to affect the course of the talks or change their outcome. It wants everybody at the talks to do whatever they can to stop those over whom they have influence from threatening the use of force.  They are comprehensive and far-reaching principles and if accepted by all parties to the talks they will unlock the deadlock.  If Sinn Féin accepts them the two Governments should move speedily to call the all-party talks that are so necessary.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the attitude some members of the Unionist community may adopt.  Some may be happy that there is peace.  However, Northern Ireland, in its symbols, emblems, its British administration at Stormont and its parliamentary representation at Westminster, represents Unionism and the voice of the Unionist.  The identities and aspirations of Unionists are reflected in everything that is Northern Ireland and some Unionists may believe that if they enter into talks they will lose out as the position of Nationalists will have to be bolstered.  Northern Ireland will have to become a partnership where the identity, emblems and aspirations of Nationalists are equally recognised.</P>
    <P>I would like Unionists to realise the potential that exists for them in having a Northern Ireland that is at peace and where there is a political settlement.  We will translate the peace process into a peace settlement only if Unionists and Nationalists &mdash; in particular, the moderates on both sides &mdash; reach agreement in all-party talks.  Irrespective of how much the Governments do, they cannot reach that agreement for them.  They will have to do it themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope the talks will be called soon. They present a great challenge for representatives of the two communities to come to the table and strike a peace settlement and that is an opportunity from which reasonable politicians would not wish to walk away.  We need only reflect on what happened in the Middle East at the weekend and on what has happened in South Africa and in so <Col N="1122" /> many other parts of the world where people with courage and determination decided to enter into dialogue.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is another example of where talks can develop their own momentum.  A level of trust evolves once people begin to talk.  Irrespective of the criticisms of the forum, it has kept people talking and people have been able to forge links and relationships with each other which has been good for the political process on this island.</P>
    <P>The format used on the last occasion, where as many as 30 or 40 people got around the table, is not always an effective way to strike a political settlement. These talks may take on a different format. When the Government published the twin-track approach before Christmas I said I welcomed the talks about talks process and believed we should explore various combinations with a view to striking a political settlement. I still believe that to be the case.</P>
    <P>Senator Mitchell and his commission produced a balanced report and provided a mechanism to allow us get around the impasse.  If all parties accept it, it can have a powerful effect in moving the peace process to the next stage. The report is balanced and seeks to address issues other than decommissioning. For example, I was struck by the reference to policing and to the question of legally held arms, although I note the absence of a reference to consent. The report is comprehensive, balanced and fair.  In the context of the conflict that exists in Northern Ireland, it is the best we could have expected.  I can think of no more fitting words than those of the late John F. Kennedy in his first presidential address in 1961 when he said, &ldquo;let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate&rdquo;. Those words are very apt at this stage. If Sinn Féin accepts the six principles in the report people should not be afraid to negotiate.  Acceptance of those principles by all the parties who want to be involved in the talks process will provide the mechanism to unlock the deadlock and to resolve the impasse.</P>
    <P>I thank the commission for its work which was done in a fair and even <Col N="1123" /> handed fashion and I am delighted that all the parties here are prepared to accept the report.  It is important that as far as possible we maintain an all-party approach to Northern Ireland.  It is far too important an issue with which to play party politics.  I hope the example given in this House will be followed in Northern Ireland where it is much more necessary.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to Senator Mitchell, his colleagues and team for the report of the international body.  In the Dáil we sometimes have to make statements of thanks or tribute which are more notable for form than for enthusiasm. Today I can say with complete confidence that the report of the international body is a highly impressive and authoritative piece of work.  It is slight only in its size.</P>
      <P>In measured tones, it sets out a lucid analysis of the current political position in Northern Ireland and it picks its way surefootedly through the thicket of genuinely held mutual fears to suggest a reasonable and balanced way to move forward.  The body, quite correctly, has defined the core issue as the absence of trust between the different traditions in Northern Ireland and directed by these traditions towards the two Governments in varying degrees.</P>
      <P>The report also asserts a fundamental truth about the ceasefires &mdash; that there were no winners or losers, no defeat or victory.  Rather, there was a decision to enter the democratic process on the part of both sets of paramilitary traditions, and a decision on the part of both Governments to facilitate entry to the democratic family through mechanisms such as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the bilateral and trilateral talks with the Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other part of the bargain that the Governments made with the representatives of the republican and loyalist traditions was to ensure that the identity and allegiances of both sets of people, <Col N="1124" /> indeed of all people in Northern Ireland, must be recognised and protected in whatever settlement may be reached between the Northern Ireland parties and the two Governments.  That is a commitment we can and must honour.</P>
    <P>In making progress towards a durable settlement we must also make progress in enshrining the rights in law and in practice of people from both oppositional traditions and people who merely prefer to consider themselves Northern Irish.  As the body's report states, &ldquo;what is really needed is the decommissioning of mind-sets&rdquo;.  It is not within the power of the Irish Government or the Irish and British Governments acting together to achieve this, but we have an important part to play.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the two Governments cannot browbeat parties in Northern Ireland into talks.  Intimidation is not a mechanism which a democracy can wield.  What the two Governments can do is act to allay that visceral fear which still is rampant among the parties in Northern Ireland; we are in a better position to persuade all parties to take that courageous step into all party talks if our own talk and behaviour reflects an even handed approach and a readiness to consider all sides of the argument. Education for mutual understanding should begin at home.</P>
    <P>The report of the international body is a compromise.  However, it is a compromise firmly on the side of democracy and non-violence.  This is greatly to be welcomed.  Also to be welcomed is the fact that everyone the international body spoke to &ldquo;agrees in principle with the need to decommission&rdquo;. There is almost universal support for &ldquo;the total and verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary organisations&rdquo;.  This is in line with public opinion, North and South, which expresses a strong commitment to &ldquo;democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The six principles outlined by the international body will, if supported and adhered to by all relevant parties, do much to establish the trust necessary for all-party talks.  Despite the ceasefires, <Col N="1125" /> trust has not been re-established between the two communities.  The confrontations of last summer with their clear sectarian overtones and the continued punishment beatings have scarred the peace enjoyed since the autumn of 1994.  The cultures of grievance and siege remain intact.  Add to this the legacy of hurt and suffering brought about by 25 years of violence and the complex nature of the problem becomes clearer.</P>
    <P>However, we accept that the ceasefires are for real: that while political progress has been incremental and uneven, there is no desire on the part of any of those previously engaged in violence to re-engage in the so-called armed struggle.  It may well be the case that many expectations at the time of the ceasefires have not been met.  However, perhaps one of the first lessons of politics is that expectations and reality can be worlds apart.  What is politically desirable and what is politically feasible are not always the same.  That does not require participants to abandon their long-term goals or aspirations.  Neither is there any suggestion of victory or surrender.</P>
    <P>In this context, there has to be an end &mdash; in our time, among this generation &mdash; of the historic notion that a historical political wrong can be put right by selfsacrificing armed struggle.  There is a slowly growing recognition that armed struggle dispossesses both its adherents and their victims of self worth, dignity and rights.  I suggest that it dispossesses most of all the very people who perpetrate it.  Their actions indicate a lack of personal and group confidence, an inability or unwillingness to engage in debate and dialogue and an assumption that those with whom they disagree can be dismissed out of hand.  Decommissioning and mindset is as critically important as the physical decommissioning of arms and must be directed towards the self as well as urged on others.  In a democratic society the force of argument can be the only acceptable force deployed.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning should be a declaration of confidence in the political process &mdash; a determination to use peaceful <Col N="1126" /> and democratic methods exclusively to deliver political objectives and a willingness to accept the outcomes of political strategies as expressed at the ballot box by the people.  Acceptance of the sovereign will of the people is the cornerstone of all democratic politics.  In this context I particularly welcome the fifth principle of the six set out by Senator Mitchell, and his colleagues, as a clear recognition of the primacy of the democratically expressed will of the people.</P>
    <P>No matter how much it is publicly desired and needed, it is clear that the physical fact of decommissioning, even as a gesture, is not going to happen immediately.  The peace process, if it means anything, has to mean the primacy of politics.  The currency of politics is accommodation.  Accommodation is not weakness but confidence.</P>
    <P>I urge the paramilitaries to accept that decommissioning in the structured, balanced and flexible way outlined by the international body offers an honourable way forward from the current impasse.</P>
    <P>This Government has been very careful to differentiate the need for decommissioning from any suggestion that decommissioning is tantamount to a surrender. That perception, and the manipulation of that perception, creates an entirely false conflict.  Decommissioning is best viewed as an entirely positive process.  Decommissioning in parallel to political development should be a declaration of confidence in the political process, reflecting a determination to use the craft of politics to deliver political objectives and a willingness to accept the outcomes of political strategies as expressed at the ballot box by the people.  Acknowledging such acceptance of the will of the people is not surrender but confidence in the good sense of ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>The democratic process is about negotiation and compromise.  That might sound dull set against the macho world of direct action but I can vouch from my own experience, particularly over recent weeks, that democratic politics offer great excitement.</P>
    <P>The international body has provided <Col N="1127" /> us with a report which offers a constructive way forward.  It acknowledged frankly the huge problem of perceptions on both sides.  The most useful approach for all of us engaged in the peace process is to study the report and reflect in particular on its principles of democracy and non-violence and on the modalities of decommissioning it proposes.  I believe the report offers a positive way forward.</P>
    <P>Working on the basis of this report and addressing the many other issues involved in the political track, the two Governments will now intensify their consultations with the parties in the preparatory round of talks with a view to agreeing the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda for those negotiations. Once again I would like to thank Senator Mitchell, General de Chastelain and Mr. Holkeri for their valuable contribution to peace and democracy on this island.  They have certainly fulfilled the task entrusted to them by the two Governments.</P>

      <P>Is mór agam an deis seo a fháil chun labhairt sa díospóireacht seo faoi Cháinaisnéis 1996.  Ar ndóigh, is í seo an dara cháinaisnéis atá curtha i láthair ag Aire Airgeadais de chuid Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre. Ó cuireadh ceann an bliana seo caite i láthair, níl amhras ach go bhfuil éacht <Col N="1128" /> bainte amach i ndáil leis an mbainistíocht atá á déanamh ar eacnamaíocht na tíre seo agus ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le mo chomhleacaí, an tAire Airgeadais, an Teachta Ruairí Quinn, dá réir.

      <P>I wish to refer to the extension of section 35 film relief, about which there has been much comment.  Deputies will be aware that yesterday's budget signalled the decision to extend the section 35 tax relief for film production to 1999. At a time when all tax incentives have been the subject of the most rigorous scrutiny by Government in the context of containing both direct and indirect public expenditure, the decision to extend section 35 to 1999 represents a clear endorsement by Government of my conviction that the integrated range of strategies to promote the Irish film and television production industry which I introduced in 1993, and which was supported by the Government of which I was a member in that year; should be kept in place for a further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addressing the future or otherwise of section 35, I was faced with the reality that the Finance Act, 1993 provided that the measure would terminate on 31 March 1996 for corporate investors and on 5 April next for individual investors. The House should be under no illusion that the extension of section 35 was in any way an automatic option for the Government.  In order to inform the Government's thinking on future options for this measure, I was pleased <Col N="1129" /> to agree with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that a detailed review of section 35 was called for in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme in securing my objectives for the Irish film industry.  This review was carried out by Indecon economic consultants and I wish to express my warm appreciation of the quality and professionalism of the consultants' work in the short time period which I assigned to them last October to undertake their task.</P>
    <P>The Indecon report points to the dramatic increase in film production in Ireland since 1993 as a consequence of the section 35 tax regime.  Their best estimates analysis, however, suggests that the annual cost of the section 35 incentives exceeded the quantified benefits to the Exchequer by a range of between £6.1 million and £8.8 million. This conclusion is in contrast with the earlier IBEC economic database analysis which suggested that for 1993 and 1994, a net benefit accrued to the Exchequer from section 35.  Indecon's overall conclusion was that, on economic criteria, it would be hard to justify continuing the incentives in their present form.</P>
    <P>Indecon's recommendations were designed to address three core objectives by an amendment of the section 35 regime.  These were to: maximise the return to the Exchequer in terms of expenditure on Irish employment, goods and services; reduce the overall cost of the measure to the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone about which we can argue another day; and increase the investment pool to make use of section 35.</P>
    <P>The Indecon recommendations formed the basis for extensive discussions which took place between the consultants, officials of my Department, and officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in subsequent weeks.  They also informed my contacts with the Minister for Finance on this subject.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Indecon recommendations provided the focus for the final package agreed for the next three <Col N="1130" /> years between me and the Minister for Finance, and subsequently the Government.</P>
    <P>It was the clarity of the Indecon analysis which led us all to conclude that refocusing section 35 was warranted and I acknowledge Indecon's role in facilitating a satisfactory conclusion to our discussions with the Minister for Finance which offers the prospect of continued high levels of film and television production in the State in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The new measures introduced in yesterday's budget include: full retention of section 35 relief in respect of 60 per cent of the cost of production of projects under £4 million, targeting projects which, in the light of experience, offer better levels of Irish employment and spend on Irish goods and services; and retention of an important incentive to continue to attract higher-budget films to Ireland, also offering significant employment potential; the opportunity for the upskilling of our labour force; significant spend on Irish goods and services; and the raising of the profile of the Irish film industry and of Ireland in the international arena; in these cases, 50 per cent of the cost of production of the film can be raised from section 35 investments up to a ceiling of £7.5 million.</P>
    <P>The budget also facilitated reducing the cost to the Exchequer by restricting the tax relief on individual and company investments to 80 per cent from 100 per cent, by reducing the amount that can be raised for film budgets over £4 million from 60 per cent to 50 per cent by increasing the investor pool by means of a facility to allow individual and corporate investors to dispose of their shares at the end of one year instead of every three years as was the case hitherto and by increasing the limit to which a company or a corporate group may invest from £1.05 million to £2 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, the section 35 tax relief will now be triggered after the date of commencement of principal photography, addressing problems which arose where <Col N="1131" /> section 35 funds were being raised before film projects were available.</P>
    <P>Since I secured a radical amendment of the section 35 tax regime in the 1993 and 1994 Finance Acts, there has been an unprecedented increase in the level of film and television production in the State.  People are right to say that section 35 came into existence under the Finance Act, 1987, and it coincided with the decision to cease funding for the Irish Film Board.  In the six year period 1987-93, £11.5 million was raised under section 35.  In stark contrast, £55.5 million has been raised under the scheme in the two years and nine months since it was radically overhauled in 1993, and this significant shift in funding for production has been clearly translated into production gains.  Eighteen feature films and 11 television productions were made in 1994, while in 1995 I certified no less than 33 feature films and 16 TV productions, some of which will not be completed or even commenced until this year.</P>
    <P>The increased level of production in the State has led to tangible increases in employment in the industry.  Although the labour force surveys do not facilitate the extrapolation of precise employment data for the industry, the IBEC economic database records the factual position in respect of all films supported by section 35 and-or Bord Scannán na hÉireann in 1993 and 1994.</P>
    <P>This indicated that 4,191 persons, or 480 full time job equivalents, were directly employed in these projects in 1993.  For 1994, the figures were significantly different, indicating that 12,784, or 1,115 full time equivalents, were employed in that year.  When employment figures are taken for both the direct and indirect impact of the State incentives in 1994, it is estimated that some 1,228 full time job equivalents were secured in the industry in 1993 and 1,957 in 1994 &mdash; representing an increase of 59 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am confident the amendments announced in yesterday's budget have struck the right balance and will ensure <Col N="1132" /> sustained levels of film and television production.  The measures retain the core elements of the previous scheme in that they are designed to promote indigenous and non-indigenous production in recognition that non-indigenous production &mdash; apart from significant employment and value added for our workforce &mdash; is an important vehicle to upskill our workforce by providing them access to larger scale projects which the current scale of the industry here would not normally provide.</P>
    <P>At the same time, our focus on indigenous production reflects my conviction that film is by far the most powerful vehicle for cultural expression and it is essential that the Irish imagination and Irish stories be portrayed through this vehicle and to the widest possible international audience.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has taken a keen interest in this scheme.  When speaking yesterday on a financial motion she referred to the difficulties blockbuster films might encounter in Ireland given the amendment to the scheme.  Looking back over the almost 70 projects which I certified since becoming the certifying authority, one animation project and two feature films would have been affected.  I pointed to the advantages which these blockbusters gave us in phase I.</P>
    <P>Everything I have introduced in film should be seen in an integrated way. The most important measure taken was the refunding of the Irish Film Board, for which provision has been made until 1999.  I have made provision for the training initiative which will shortly get under way.  The independent commission of RTE has resulted in £12.5 million or 20 per cent of production and the independent sector has been involved in Teilifís na Gaeilge.  These hang together with Bord Scannán giving the lead as the core element of the future indigenous sector.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 35 which I have outlined represent the key elements of the Government's future strategy in this regard.  In the context of the Finance Bill, however, I intend to <Col N="1133" /> give further consideration to other issues, including some raised by the INDECON analysis, such as the definition of a &ldquo;qualifying film&rdquo; and the question of providing an off-seasonal incentive to maximise film production throughout the year.  Deputies correctly raised this problem of &ldquo;peaking&rdquo;&mdash; a concentration of production during a few months in the summer, which I am trying to address.  I am also trying to avoid &ldquo;overheating&rdquo; of our labour resources due to too many projects taking place within a confined period of months.</P>
    <P>To the extent that INDECON points to such issues as cost uncompetitiveness as a factor which reduced the benefits of section 35 &mdash; and specifically highlights the costs associated with intermediaries and financial and legal advisers as well as labour market entry restrictions and inflexibility in labour market practices &mdash; I look to all sides of the industry to come together to decide how best these issues can be addressed.</P>
    <P>The retention of section 35 sends out a powerful message to the industry that the integrated range of strategies which I have introduced to ensure its sustained development are assured up to 1999 at least.  This should enable the industry to plan its future with a degree of certainty not known before, and I would expect that demonstrable progress can now be made to achieve my objective of establishing a self-sustaining level of film and television production in the State.  Such an outcome will greatly enhance our national culture and artistic expression while also contributing significantly to the economic and social progress of the State.  In deciding to retain section 35, the Government is entitled to expect that these goals can be achieved over time in a spirit of partnership with the industry. As I was making my case to the Department of Finance, I read some comments in the public media regarding section 35. It would be hard to conclude other than that there was an element of begrudgery in it as if we could not, for example, handle a success, which it undoubtedly was.  The time has come to put to rest <Col N="1134" /> old prejudices that film does not neatly fit into manufacturing, nor is it a service like international financial services. What it is, of course, is an exciting and new form of employment through cultural expressions, and it is very good for this country for all of these reasons.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that I have warmly welcomed the extension of the business expansion scheme to include the music industry and to cover investment in the production, marketing and promotion of new artists' studio recordings and associated videos.</P>
    <P>This is a very significant and worthwhile initiative.  I have always contended that the cultural industries can make an enormous contribution to creating employment and assisting our overall economic development.  It is a crucial moment for our self-confidence when we realise this is a source of new kinds of jobs built on the imagination of the Irish people.  It was for this reason that I established a special task force, FORTE, to examine the needs and the potential of the music industry and to establish how co-ordinated, focused action by the State sector &mdash; in partnership with the industry itself &mdash; might help its further development.  FORTE's final report will be published shortly, but in advance of this publication I requested an interim report dealing with issues of taxation.  It was this interim report, backed up by a separate analysis carried out by an IBEC group, which provided me with the arguments and the rationale which I brought to Government when arguing for this type of BES relief.  The extension of the BES scheme to music demonstrates that the arguments made have been accepted and augurs well not just for music but for the future development of all our cultural heritage industries.  There can be no doubt that, in what has been described as the post industrial world, it is to those industries that we must look for much of our future development.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that the industries in the cultural heritage sector need the same supports and resources as any other industry or source of job creation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> They need management and marketing skills, continuous investment and product development.  In some ways the music industry has been a victim of its own success.  The focus of our attention has been on our major international artists such as U2, the Cranberries, the Chieftains, etc. leading to the perception that the industry is doing well enough on its own &mdash;&ldquo;if its not broken, don't fix it&rdquo; might sum up this type of thinking.  It is too important for that.</P>
    <P>FORTE and other groups have been able to isolate those segments of the music industry which need support and investment, in particular the development of new artists and bands.  Let us make no mistake, this is the very life blood of the industry.  Ireland is recognised as being a rich pool of creative talent. However, unless the investment is made and support given to new artists, we risk squandering that resource.  I am not prepared to see that happen, nor is this Government.  We have listened to the rational, convincing arguments of the music industry and we have responded with alacrity and imagination.</P>
    <P>I very much look forward to the positive response of Irish investors and the Irish music industry to this new initiative.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Údarás na Gaeltachta, ar ndóigh, tá béim ar leith leagtha ag an gcáinaisnéis ar chruthú fostaíochta agus is ar Údarás na Gaeltachta atá an cúram sonrach sin leagtha laistigh de theorainneacha na Gaeltachta.  Tá soláthar de bhreis agus £20 milliún á chur ar fáil don eagraíocht i 1996 le haghaidh forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Is soláthar caipitil é £17.6 milliún den tsuim sin.  Úsáidfear £11 milliún den tsuim sin chun deontais a íoc le tionscail Ghaeltachta d'fhonn an fhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus a mhéadú.  Is ionann é sin agus méadú de bhreis ar 2 faoin gcéad i gcomparáid le bunsoláthar na bliana 1995.  Tá suim £6.6 milliún á tabhairt don Údarás i 1996 chun clár tógála na <Col N="1136" /> heagraíochta a airgeadú agus chun scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcuideachtaí, etc.  Is méadú de 5.6 faoin gcéad é sin i gcomparáid le bunsoláthar na bliana seo caite. Caithfear an fuílleach de £2.5 milliún go príomha ar chostais riaracháin na heagraíochta agus ar chur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Is soláthar maith airgid é sin cibé slat tomhais a úsáidtear agus is léiriú é ar an tábhacht a chuireann an Rialtas i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta agus i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Beidh mé ag súil leis go gcaithfear an soláthar go coigilteach tíosach ar thograí fiúntacha a roghnófar trí dhianchritéir roghnaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tuigim ón eagraíocht go raibh torthaí fostaíochta an-sásúla acu arís i 1995 agus go bhfógrófar iad sin go luath.  Tá an iomaíocht thionsclaíoch ag éirí níos géire i gcónaí agus tá dualgas ar, agus ról ag, Udarás na Gaeltachta cabhrú le cuideachtaí Gaeltachta chun iad féin a chur in oiriúint do na fadhbhanna a chothaíonn sé sin dóibh.  Tá béim níos mó ag an Údarás anois ar thacaíocht a thabhairt do chomhlachtaí chun a gcumas iomaíochta agus éifeachtúlachta a fheabhsú.  Tá coimhlint mhór ann ó thíortha a bhfuil geilleagair íseal-chostais acu agus ní foláir do ghnóthais Ghaeltachta díriú ar riachtanais bhunúsacha ar nós na gceann seo a leanas le go mbeifear iomaíoch sa mhargadh: teicneolaíocht a uasghrádú; scileanna foirne agus bainistíochta a fheabhsú; agus tairgí ardchaighdeánacha a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá céadatán ard de na poist nua a cruthaíodh le roinnt bhlianta anuas i dtionscail Ghaeltachta á ghiniúint ag gnóthais sheanbhunaithe.  Is comhartha mhór dóchais é sin agus táim cinnte go leanfaidh an tÚdarás lena gcuid iarrachtaí leanúnacha chun comhlachtaí faoina scáth &mdash; cinn sheanbhunaithe agus cinn nua &mdash; a fhorbairt agus a neartú oiread agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Le bunú Theilifís na Gaeilge tá gealladh ar leith ag baint leis an earnáil léiriúcháin neamhspleách chun deiseanna fostaíochta breise a chruthú.  Beidh an tÚdarás ag tacú leis an earnáil sin chun an tairbhe is fearr is féidir, ó thaobh cruthú fostaíochta de, a bhaint amach don Ghaeltacht.  Beidh mé ag tagairt do Theilifís na Gaeilge arís ar ball.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Maidir leis na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht, ar ndóigh, bíonn obair fhiúntach ar mhaithe le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar siúl freisin le cúnamh na ndeontas a thugann mo Roinnse féin le haghaidh Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Is suim de £3.35 milliún a bheidh ar fáil i mbliana le haghaidh muiroibreacha, forbairt chomharchumann, hallaí agus Coláistí Gaeilge agus saoráidí ilghnéitheacha ar nós páirceanna imeartha, cúirteanna leadóige agus mar sin de.  Usáidfear cuid den tsoláthar sin chun an mhórscéim mhuiroibreacha ar Inis Meáin-Inis Oírr a chríochnú i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is eol do Theachtaí, ní foláir, gur fógraíodh inné nach mbeidh ar chumas mo Roinn-se cúnamh a chur ar fáil faoin sean-scéim chun bóithre sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú.  Cé go bhfuil méadú i mbliana sa soláthar atá déanta sna Meastacháin do na Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht, is amhlaidh go ndearnadh cinneadh an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar oibreacha a bhfeictear a bhfuil tosaíocht níos mó ag baint leo ná Scéim na mBóithre Áise &mdash; go háirithe ar mhuiroibreacha Gaeltachta atá á bpleanáil i láthair na huaire.  Dá thoradh sin, tá cainteanna ar siúl idir m'oifigigh féin agus oifigigh na Roinne Comhshaoil chun freastal níos fearr agus níos éifeachtaí a dhéanamh ar na riachtanais i gceist.  Beidh cainteanna againn chomh maith le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, eagrais phobail agus na comharchumainn.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a rá, ar ndóigh, nach mbíodh ach suim theoranta airgid ag mo Roinnse le caitheamh ar bhóithre, rud a chiallaigh nach raibh ar a cumas ach freastal ar líon beag den iliomad iarratas a fuarthas gach bliain &mdash; thart ar 80 bóthar as 800 iarratas a fuarthas anuraidh, cur i gcás.  Caithfidh go bhfuil slí níos éifeachtaí chun an riachtanas a shásamh.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a dúirt me, is suim £3.350 milliún atá sna Meastacháin le haghaidh 1996.  Táthar ag pleanáil go gcaithfear timpeall £2.35 milliún de sin ar mhuiroibreacha agus tá soláthar de £0.55 milliún ann chun deontais reachtála a íoc le comharchumainn Ghaeltachta, i <Col N="1138" /> gcomhréir leis na méaduithe suntasacha a cheadaigh mé dóibh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Is ar éigean is gá dom a rá go mbeidh mo Roinnse ag leanacht ar aghaidh ag tabhairt tacaíocht láidir do go leor scéimeanna tábhachtacha eile a théann chun tairbhe labhairt na Gaeilge agus muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh Scéim an bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, d'fhreastal beagnach 23,000 foghlaimeoirí ar na Coláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i 1995 agus d'fhan siad ar iostas i 740 teach Gaeltachta.  Is cuid antábhachtach d'eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta iad na Coláistí Samhraidh Gaeilge agus meastar go mbeidh thart ar an líon céanna foghlaimeoirí i gceist arís i mbliana.</P>
    <P>I gcás scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, meastar go n-íocfar deontas faoin scéim le thart ar 3,200 teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta i mbliana.  Tá an scéim nua seo tar éis cur le húsáid na Gaeilge i roinnt mhaith teaghlaigh ó cuireadh tús leí cúpla bliain ó shin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le deontas do thithíocht sa Ghaeltacht, ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thógáil chun a rá nach bhfuil deireadh curtha le deontais feabhsúcháin tithe sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; tá na deontais sin ar fáil i gcónaí agus tá soláthar maith airgid déanta lena n-aghaidh i mbliana.  Tá athrú sa scéim, áfach, sa mhéid nach gcuirfear oibreacha áirithe neamh-shubstaintiúla san áireamh feasta le haghaidh deontais.  Ina lán cásanna, áfach, ní dhéanfaidh sé seo difríocht ar bith, mar go mbeidh go leor oibre i gceist chun an tuasdheontas feabhsucháin a thuilleamh ar aon chuma.

    <P>Deputies will be aware that the 1996 Estimates have signalled, yet again, a significant increase in the allocation for An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council. The Estimates figure of £18.5 million has been reduced marginally in yesterday's budget by £100,000 as a contribution to the additional funding being allocated to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The council's revised allocation &mdash; now £18.4 million for 1996 &mdash; represents an increase of 13 per cent over 1995.  This represents an increase of just over 81 per cent on the council's allocation for 1992, the year immediately prior to my initial appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution historically of all my predecessors with responsibility in this area, but facts are facts and the figure I inherited when I became Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht was approximately £10 million.  The difference between £10 million and £18.4 is approximately 81 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware of my strong endorsement of the Arts Plan 1995-97 which was published by An Chomhairle Ealaíon in February last.  I am pleased to inform the House that Government approval of the strategic objectives of the plan was signalled in November last and that I was charged with the task of entering into discussions with the Minister for Finance about the future funding of the plan.</P>
    <P>In the light of these discussions, I agreed with the Minister for Finance that the funding targets set out in the plan could be realistically phased in over the five year period 1995-99, rather than the initial three years as proposed. I am pleased to inform the House that, at their first meeting for 1996 last week, An Chomhairle Ealaíon welcomed the level of funding secured by me for 1996 and decided to reschedule the plan to cover the five years 1995-99.  This was a prudent decision in the light of the historically high increases I have secured for An Chomhairle since 1993, and I am confident that the additional timeframe now proposed can secure the funding targets by 1999.  It was, of course, a document produced after considerable consultation and the further consultation in this rolling plan will be facilitated for the Arts Council by the extended time.</P>
    <P>As regards the cultural development <Col N="1140" /> incentive scheme, about which I am frequently asked, the Government's commitment to funding for the contemporary arts is not confined to the annual allocation of An Comhairle Ealaíon, significant though it is for 1996.  The £18.4 million allocation for An Chomhairle this year includes a capital allocation of £1 million designed to assist modest capital works, mainly on existing infrastructure requiring repair or upgrading.</P>
    <P>In addition to these funds, however, I have additional Exchequer and European Union funds at my disposal under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 to promote the development of an arts and cultural infrastructure in the State, notably in the regions. These funds will be disbursed under my cultural development incentives scheme which I announced last year and which, with matching funding from other sources such as local authorities, will enable me to facilitate the development of an arts, cultural infrastructure to the value of some £26 million from now until the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that an advisory committee which I have appointed to undertake an evaluation of the applications under the scheme and make recommendations to me thereon has commenced its deliberations on the 170 applications I have received to date. I hope to be in a position to announce some decisions on these applications within the next two months or so.</P>
    <P>In concluding this item, I should inform the House that the £26 million in capital infrastructure which I hope to be able to generate under the cultural development incentives scheme is additional to the some £5.7 million which I have already committed to flagship projects in the regions such as the Galway Municipal Theatre, the Longford Theatre, the Hawskwell Theatre in Sligo, the Hunt Museum in Limerick and the Crawford Municipal Gallery in Cork.  They are in a separate group.</P>
    <P>From March to August 1996 the planning that has gone on for the past three years both here and in France to <Col N="1141" /> develop the major celebration of contemporary Irish art and culture, &ldquo;L'Imaginaire Irlandais&rdquo;, will bear fruit across France.  I secured Government commitment to provide up to £1.5 million towards the project, the idea for which originated during President Mary Robinson's State visit to France in 1992.  At the end of 1995 over £500,000 had been spent on preparations and the balance of the funds for the project are provided in this year's Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>I am happy to record that the French Government agreed to make available a cash contribution of up to £500,000 to co-fund jointly agreed elements of the programme of events in France and that access is being provided to suitable venues in France for various facets of the project.  The project represents the fruits of continuing and long established contacts between arts groups, individuals and State agencies in the cultural arena throughout the island of Ireland. The emphasis will be not just on next year but on enduring contacts.</P>
    <P>The development of the programme, under the general guidance of organising committees in both countries, is in the hands of the full time commissioner appointed by me for the project, Ms Doireann Ní Bhriain, and her opposite number in France, Mr. Michel Ricard, of the Department of International Affairs in the French Ministry of Culture. The overall programme is being designed and developed in close collaboration with the project's French partners. Both sides are confident that, following the manifestation, there will be a greater awareness among French people of the people of this country as dynamic, innovative and looking with confidence to the future.  Irish creative artists will have entered the bloodstream of French cultural life and there will be long-term cultural and economic benefits for the people of both countries.</P>
    <P>On the national cultural institutions I must emphasise that I am equally concerned for them.  I have allocated significant increases to this purpose to the national cultural institutions since <Col N="1142" /> assuming office.  The amounts of the normal grants-in-aid allocated to these institutions have increased by 46 per cent between 1992 and 1995.  If funding for specific new or one-off projects is included, the grant assistance provided increased by 62 per cent over the same period.  In relation to the National Gallery, which has a separate Vote, increases of the order of 66 per cent have been allocated in the same period. I want to pay tribute to these institutions and thank their staff for all they have done.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that work is progressing well on a number of specific projects, some of which began during the time of the last Government.  I refer in particular to the clock tower in preparation for the relocation of the Chester Beatty Library to Dublin Castle.  The first phase of the redevelopment at Collins Barracks for part of the National Museum collections continues apace with, it is hoped, the opening to take place in 1997.  That is a major development for the city and the museum.  In this regard, I am finalising my examination of the report of the interim board of the museum and hope to implement as many of its recommendations as resources permit.  I am also pleased to note the exciting developments which have been progressing at the National Gallery in recent years, including the completion of the refurbishment of the 1968 wing and the planned development of the vacant site on Clare Street over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The National Library too will see the completion in the Temple Bar district in 1996 of its new dedicated photographic archive which will share its premises with the Photography Department of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  At last the library will be able to store, preserve and make available to the public copies of some hundreds of previously unseen prints and photographic plates.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the new measures in this year's budget for facilitating the development of the collections in the national cultural institutions.  Provision <Col N="1143" /> was made last year for a special tax relief for donations to national collections. A major gift under the scheme was to the National Gallery of Ireland of the archives of the artist Jack B. Yeats, including his many wonderful notebooks and sketch books.  The National Museum of Ireland also received a gift of a large historical group painting entitled &ldquo;HQ staff of the Irish Republican Army&rdquo; by the artist Leo Whelan.  I would like to express publicly, in the time given to me by Deputy de Valera, the great appreciation due to the donors for their co-operation.  Last year's provision of £0.5 million for this relief has been increased this year to £0.75 million.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ag an bpointe seo faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge. Thug cinneadh an Rialtais den 7 Nollaig 1993 údarás dom treoir a thabhairt do RTE dul faoi na hoibreacha capitil riachtanacha i ndáil le Teilifís na Gaeilge agus freagracht a ghlacadh don tseirbhís nua, go dtí go mbeadh struchtúr reachtúil ar leith bunaithe di.</P>
    <P>Tá RTÉ, faoi stiúir mo Roinne-se, ag gabháil faoi láthair don obair tógála is gá d'fhonn an bunstruchtúr do Theilifís na Gaeilge a chríochnú.  Tuigim ó RTÉ go raibh caiteachas caipitil £7.6 milliún den chostas measta iomlán de £16.1 milliún déanta acu faoi dheireadh 1995. Cuireadh deontas-i-gcabhair de £3.6 milliún ar fáil do RTÉ ó Vóta mo Roinne-se i 1995 agus cuirfear suim bhreise de £12.2 milliún ar fáil i mbliana i ndáil leis na hoibreachta caipitil.  Tuigim ó RTÉ freisin go bhfuil na hoibreacha caipitil ag dul ar aghaidh i gcomhréir leis an sceideal agus go bhfuiltear fós ag súil leis go mbeidh an tseirbhís nua ar an aer faoi Dheireadh Fómhair 1996.</P>
    <P>Maidir le costas reatha na seirbhíse, cuireadh suim iomlán de £3 milliún ar fáil do RTÉ ó Vóta mo Roinne-se i 1994 agus 1995 agus beidh soláthar de £10 milliún ar fáil don chuspóir céanna i 1996.  Tá an obair ag dul ar aghaidh go maith, faoi choimirce Chomhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge, i ndáil leis an bpróiséas <Col N="1144" /> chun cláir a choimisiúnú agus a charnadh sula dtosaíonn an chraoltóireacht ar ball.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have obtained an increase of £400,000 in 1996 or 22 per cent over the amount provided in 1995 for the Heritage Council.  I had support from Members of all sides of the enactment of the Heritage Act, 1995.  I am pleased to see the enthusiasm, energy, vision and independence which the members of the new council have already displayed in the first six months of their period in office.  The council has a wide and challenging brief and I wish it well.  The heritage services in the Office of Public Works are in the course of transfer to my Department.  The provision for these services at £42 million approximately represents an increase of £1 million on the 1995 provision.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I had the pleasure of launching a report by consultants Cairns on the future development of the Royal Canal.  There is a significant amount of development and work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great unease that we are increasingly moving from what was originally proposed in the Arts Plan.  With great fanfare and hype, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht announced the Arts Plan which had a price tag of £26 million to be spent from 1995-97.  Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, however, a shortfall of more than £3 million on the figure agreed as necessary to implement the Arts Council's <i>Three Year Plan 1995-1997,</i> the strategic objectives of which were adopted by Government in November. This makes an aggregate shortfall of £6 million, including last year's figures.  After the Book of Estimates was published, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht Mr. <Col N="1145" /> Higgins suggested to the Arts Council that the plan should run over five years instead of three, and this was accepted by the council.</P>
    <P>At Question Time before Christmas I asked the Minister if he intended to extend the time proposed for the Arts Council Plan and the words the Minister used on that occasion in the Official Report were &ldquo;certainly not&rdquo;.  I was most surprised to see, just a short time later, that it was agreed there should be an extension to five years.  These changes in regard to the Arts Plan have lead to the undermining of confidence in the arts world with regard to funding and the implementation of the Arts Plan. The Minister said through an adviser that the cut in the Arts Council grant of £100,000 is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the BES schemes for the music industry in the budget.  The industry has huge potential and I encourage the Minister to take on board the many suggestions in the IBEC submission on the music industry.  However, I would like the Minister to clarify the precise definition of new artists and whether under this definition, new artists only will be eligible to apply.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of section 35 relief for a further three years for investment in the film industry.  In view of the increase in film production since 1993, which is directly attributable to this relief, I am pleased it is being retained.  In particular, I welcome also the reduction in the holding period required for capital gains tax purposes from three years to one year and the increase in the investment limit for corporate investors to £2 million per annum.  I have some concerns, however, about the changes in the budget for the film industry.  The proposal to reduce the amount of expenditure on larger films which would qualify for relief will, in effect, undermine the film industry here and make it difficult, if not impossible, for the growing indigenous Irish film industry.  These large productions are necessary to create an infrastructure on which indigenous productions can build.  Rather than bringing in new proposals which would retard the growth of the film infrastructure, we would be <Col N="1146" /> helping to accelerate it.  Section 35 relief has been of net benefit to the country and we are aware of the benefit it brings in terms of tourism and expenditure in local communities.  After the demise of &ldquo;Divine Rapture&rdquo;, I called on the Minister to ensure that film producers should be required to present a bond which will guarantee all moneys due to Irish workers and suppliers.  At that time I suggested also that he should consider new measures to encourage the establishment of a truly Irish film industry, with Irish scriptwriters, producers and directors.  Unfortunately the Minister did not address these issues in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister has reduced by 20 per cent the tax benefit for personal investors in qualifying films.  Let me give a brief example.  This means that someone who previously would have invested £25,000 in a film and obtained £12,000 tax relief will now obtain tax relief of only £9,600.  The reduction of £2,400 in tax relief will significantly reduce the potential return on investment in film. In many marginal projects this may mean that the return received will be below a required commercial return and may discourage investment.  The Minister has not only reduced the tax benefit by 20 per cent but has also reduced the timing during which this tax relief will be available.  We are told that tax relief will now only be available from the date of commencement of principal photography. In the normal course of events this would be unlikely to commence in the tax year in which the taxpayer makes his investment.  Taking into account the cost of borrowing money, this further reduces the return available to section 35 investors.  Why is the Minister amending section 35 to this extent, given that it has worked successfully and has been largely self financing due to the direct and indirect tax revenues raised from expenditure on Irish goods and services?  Why is the Minister gambling with the relief which has been most successful to date at little or no cost to the Exchequer?</P>
    <P>Problems arose with the relief in the past.  However, these were not the fault of section 35 investors or the operation <Col N="1147" /> of the section itself but due in some cases to the management or promoters of a particular film.  I previously called on the Minister to grant certification only when full funding was in place for films.  However, the Minister has hit at funds which gathered section 35 investment to ensure finance was in place for potential film projects by not allowing investments from such funds to gain tax relief until photography has commenced. It is a classic chicken and egg situation.  On the one hand the Minister will not allow tax relief until principal photography has commenced while, on the other, principal photography is unlikely to commence until funding is in place.  Does the Minister realise that investors in small productions may not be willing to invest in a tax year if any delay in the timing of their tax relief is anticipated?</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the Minister's amendment to the tax relief for donations of heritage items of national importance.  While I welcome the relief and its implications for retaining heritage items for the benefit of the nation, is this the most efficient or effective method of obtaining such items?  Unlike film relief to which I referred, no significant spin off or additional employment is generated through this provision.  In effect, tax liabilities worth £750,000 are cancelled in exchange for the State receiving heritage items.  Would it be more effective to grant this money to individual bodies and allow them to increase their budgets by purchasing such items?</P>
    <P>Due to the means by which this relief is constructed, it is up to taxpayers to approach the relevant institutions rather than the other way around.  The selection committee for these gifts must review a large number of items, some of which may not have any cultural merit. Would this time not be better spent by these institutions going after particular items they wish to obtain with a budget of £750,000 rather than relying on taxpayers to come to them?  Under this alternative, heritage items the national institutions wish to obtain could be purchased in a far more efficient manner.  I <Col N="1148" /> ask the Minister to consider this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in a positive manner to the peak periods in film making and the question of seasonality.  I agree with his view and I made that point last night.  I am glad we are at one on this issue because more jobs in the Irish film industry would be generated in trying to spread the load over the full 12 months rather than the usual May to September period.  I am glad matters have progressed in that manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in particular to the National Library in terms of cultural institutions.  I am sure he is aware that Dr. Pat Donlon is unhappy with a number of aspects pertaining to the National Library.  She was most brave to come out publicly on those issues but it is a pity that somebody with her responsibilities feels she has no other choice but to make the matter public.  I congratulate her for doing so but it should not have been necessary.  The Minister and his Department should have addressed that need.  Even at this late stage, I hope the National Library, which is a major cultural institution, will be recognised and given any financial assistance it requires for its day to day work.  It is a fundamental element of our cultural institutions.  Other cultural projects should be promoted but the major cultural institutions cannot be forgotten. They also require assistance and support, not just with flowery speeches but with hard core funding.  I appreciate it is difficult to obtain funding at times but I ask the Minister to do his utmost to find the finance to deal with that particular problem.</P>
    <P>A Bill dealing with cultural institutions is awaiting the attention of the House.  I hope it will be debated as soon as possible because the museum and other institutions must be considered in terms of how they can be best assisted and promoted.  Since the beginning of the State, these institutions have provided a tremendous service in the areas of culture and heritage.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of Fianna Fáil's position on Teilifís na Gaeilge, which we supported from the beginning.  The promotion of Teilifís na <Col N="1149" /> Gaeilge was a Fianna Fáil initiative and we are happy to support the Government proposals.  However, I was disappointed to note the Minister's approach to the funding of the station and I am sure it was a surprise to RTE to discover that it had to set aside further moneys for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Teilifís na Gaeilge warrants firm funding of its own and I am sure the Minister accepts and acknowledges that point.  I hope he will promote that aspect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that point but the House wants the immediate initiation of Teilifís na Gaeilge and this can only be done through firm funding. I hope the Minister believes the station is of sufficient importance to the country and its culture that it should have its own funding mechanism rather than relying on other forms of finance.</P>
      <P>Other provisions in the budget do not come within my remit but as a public representative I wish to comment on them.  This Government inherited a very strong economy with high growth and low interest and inflation rates, but, by its actions, it has thrown away these benefits.  This budget can be seen as a lost opportunity to set out a responsible, strategic approach to our finances rather than taking the easy and short-term option of overspending.</P>
      <P>Much pain was inflicted in trying to get the economy back in shape and now the Government increased the national debt by £1 billion in 1995.  This budget could have been a watershed for the economy but instead it tinkered with the system as this is the only approach which can be agreed on by the warring parties in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the week we saw an unseemly squabble between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left, all jostling for position.  It was nothing less than a public demonstration of the deep divisions <Col N="1150" /> and tensions in the Government.  Coalition Governments, by their nature, are composed of more than one party and there will be tensions between them. Sometimes these can prove to be positive but in this case there are three parties with differing philosophies and approaches to the economy.  We saw the three parties doing their utmost to show that they had a particular view on how the budget should progress and seeking credit for the budgetary measures.  If the matter were not so serious it would be amusing for any student of politics.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left won the fight, not only in what was proposed in the budget but in terms of PR.  In the absence of an economic plan it is strange that economic policy is dictated by a party that holds less than 3 per cent of the national vote.  While that may go down extremely well with members and supporters of Democratic Left I wonder how the members and supporters of Fine Gael and Labour view it.</P>
    <P>What the nation should have expected in this budget was an honest look at and reform of the taxation system. Business should have been encouraged to employ more people and thus reduce unemployment.  The Government should have encouraged wealth creation while at the same time implementing measures for the low paid and unemployed.  Many in low paid jobs struggle to keep afloat and have great financial difficulty living from day to day.  As we know it does not pay many in low paid jobs to go out to work.  Much was made of policies to encourage the unemployed but I cannot see any great incentive for either the low paid or the unemployed in them.  We might have very nice policy documents and well expressed and thought out views from those in Government but it is not forthcoming when it has an opportunity to implement economic measures which would have a positive effect on the low paid and unemployed.  It has paid lipservice to those on low incomes and the unemployed.  For example, for a single person with full rate PRSI contributions the net gain, based on the Minister's figures, is £89 per year if the person's income is between £5,000 and £10,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> That is £1.71 per week.  For a married couple with four children and one earner earning £20,000 per annum, taking the increased child benefit into account, the benefit will be £185 per annum or £3.56 per week to be shared between the six members of the family. This Government will claim to be interested in upholding the values of the family.  For a married couple with one earner and no children earning between £12,000 and £20,000 the uplift in take-home pay is £86 per annum or £1.65 per week.  It would be encouraging if none of them smoked or drove a car as if they did they would be net losers.</P>
    <P>This Government has no commitment to the agricultural community which makes up 40 per cent of gross national output.  The increase in the VAT refund will not offset rising prices for food-stuffs, fertilisers, fuel and electricity. The REPS scheme proves the Government is not serious about the issues.  In 1996 less than half the funds necessary to fund the scheme have been made available.  What will the Minister do about the tens of thousands of farmers who will not be in the scheme?  What does he intend to do about farm investment? What are his plans for the 12,000 to 14,000 dairy farmers whom Teagasc say will go to the wall in the next five years?  To date, out of 5,000 applications for grants under the dairy hygiene scheme, 225 have been paid.  The control of farmyard pollution scheme has been closed to new applicants since last June.</P>
    <P>The only reference to crime in the budget is a proposal to help provide a burglar alarm for the elderly.  While I have no objection to this in principle it underlines the fact that the Government has abjectly failed to provide a safe environment for society, particularly the elderly.  Crime is on the increase in rural Ireland.  Is this the only response the Government is capable of making?  I come from a rural community in County Clare and there is great fear and anxiety especially among the elderly living in isolated places.  In County Clare there were less than ten cases of elderly people being attacked in their homes <Col N="1152" /> but the fact that it occurs in the county or the surrounding regions is a cause of great fear and makes prisoners of our elderly.  Surely they should be able to rely on the Government to implement laws to protect them and others in society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague the Minister for Finance on an innovative and well thought-out budget.  The Minister has succeeded in bringing in a budget which will create more than 30,000 jobs this year and will greatly help many of those among the long-term unemployed who until now have had little hope of re-entering the jobs market.  At the same time the Minister has succeeded in ensuring that Ireland's economic strategy is well within the Maastricht guidelines, which will ensure that we are well placed for participation in the single European currency in three years' time.</P>
      <P>This is an innovative budget, it rewards those at work, it promotes enterprise, it strengthens social solidarity and it underlines the importance of creating the right economic circumstances for all of us to gain from interest rate cuts in the future.  One national newspaper this morning described this as a &ldquo;go to work budget&rdquo;.  I agree with that analysis.  However, it is also a budget with a social conscience as is evidenced by the increases in carers' allowances, child benefit, living alone allowances, family income supplement thresholds and health allowances.  What is remarkable is that my colleague the Minister for Finance has managed to do so much while still ensuring that Government spending will not exceed little more than £12 billion this year. Extra spending is being met out of savings. This is a budget from which everyone will benefit to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for equality and for women's issues I am very pleased to see a number of specific proposals which will have the effect of helping large numbers of women. Increases in the carer's allowance and in <Col N="1153" /> child benefit are important and are very welcome.  The measures to help the long-term unemployed will provide considerable assistance to a vulnerable and marginalised section of Irish society.</P>
    <P>Estimates for my Department for the year to come certainly provide us with ample evidence of the ongoing commitment of this Government to equal opportunities policies and to support for family life.  The moneys provided in 1996 for family support services will enable the organisations concerned to continue their respective programmes of expansion and development, made possible by the additional funding which I have made available to them in recent years.</P>
    <P>Funding of the services of the Legal Aid Board, which provides access to justice to people who otherwise could not afford it, is being increased again in 1996, to £6.5 million.  This represents an increase of almost 5 per cent over the 1995 figure.  The funding now is almost double the 1993 allocation of £3.2 million. The level of funding over the past couple of years has facilitated a significant expansion of the service, involving the employment of significantly more solicitors and support staff and an increase to 26 in the number of full time law centres as against 16 in 1993.  As a consequence, the waiting lists in law centres have been drastically reduced and in many cases eliminated.</P>
    <P>The State Family Mediation Service which helps couples who have decided to separate to do so on an amicable basis, has been allocated £300,000 this year.  Its expenditure last year was £260,000.  The amount allocated this year will enable it to continue with its expansion programme. This will include a scheme for the use of private mediators in providing mediation on behalf of the Family Mediation Service. That arrangement when put in place will help to make mediation widely available.</P>
    <P>The organisations which provide voluntary marriage counselling services to couples have a long and distinguished track record.  In recent years, by providing them with grant aid, my Department has played a significant role in actively <Col N="1154" /> encouraging voluntary organisations in this area to develop and expand their services.  In 1994, and again in 1995, my Department expended £750,000 in support of these services.  Large sums were invested in upgrading premises and facilities and in providing advanced training for counsellors and supervisors.</P>
    <P>Similarly, substantial sums of money were invested in recruiting and training new counsellors to ensure that the groups could cater for all of those who wished to avail of their services.  I also intend to extend the grant aid programme to include voluntary organisations who provide counselling services to children who are in need of counselling because of marriage breakdown. The allocation to voluntary counselling organisations is being increased this year to £900,000 to reflect the extra demands being made on the marriage counselling services and the need to provide for children's counselling.</P>
    <P>New employment equality legislation is also among the priority proposals with which I am concerned at present.  My intention is that new legislation will prohibit discrimination, not only on the grounds of sex or marital status, but on a wider range of grounds including parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origins, including membership of the travelling community. Work on a Bill is well advanced in my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it before Easter.  The enactment of this new legislation will necessitate the restructuring of the Employment Equality Agency to reflect its wider responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In the course of this year, I hope to publish the Equal Status Bill which will deal with discrimination on a range of grounds in non-employment areas. When this Bill is published, it will be fully debated in these Houses and I will seriously consider any amendments put forward by Members or suggested by outside interests.  Meanwhile, the representations which have already been made to me in this matter will be fully borne in mind in finalising the Bill.  I stress that the legislation will offer no <Col N="1155" /> protection to anti-social elements, it will deal only with discrimination on specified grounds.  It is similar to legislation which has worked well in many other countries such as Britain, the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.</P>
    <P>In July last I received the very comprehensive report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community which dealt with key issues of concern to travellers such as accommodation, access to health services, education and training opportunities, discrimination and relationships between travellers and settled people.  The Government has established an interdepartmental working group of officials to consider its implementation, including, in particular, the costs involved.  We will determine what action is called for on the recommendations in the task force report as soon as the report of the working group has been considered.</P>
    <P>This year also I expect the finalisation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  This report is expected to recommend the most far-reaching proposals to end the marginalisation of Irish people with disabilities since the foundation of the State.  The report will probably require action from all Government Departments and State agencies.  I look forward to receiving it and beginning work on the implementation of its recommendations within a matter of months.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant events of 1995 for my Department was participation in the Fourth World Conference on Women.  At the conference, agreement was reached, with some reservations, on a Declaration and Platform for Action which, if implemented, will represent major progress towards equality between women and men worldwide.  I will shortly put structures in place to oversee implementation of the platform in Ireland and in this context, I will ensure appropriate involvement of non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>The 1996 budget is one of which this Government can be proud.  It maintains the necessary financial discipline <Col N="1156" /> required to remain within the Maastricht guidelines and it will significantly help in the creation of employment.  It will reduce the level of income tax by widening the standard rate tax level and increasing personal allowances.  It will reduce the burden of PRSI on employers.  It contains specific measures designed to promote enterprise.  It provides for an innovative plan of action for the long-term unemployed.  Opposition parties and economic commentators have had difficulty in constructively criticising this budget.  This is because an objective observer cannot fail to see its merits.  I have no doubt it will usher in a new era of opportunity for all of us in the year to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up the theme developed by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  There is no doubt that Opposition Deputies have been confounded by the quality of this budget.  Their only complaint relates to suggestions of division within Government, which are wide of the mark.  In their hearts they know this is an excellent budget, well put together, which maintains an excellent economic performance. In the last two budgets there is a very strong theme of fiscal responsibility. We are creating a very stable fiscal environment, which is in sharp contrast with other budgets.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note the record of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, who appear to be latter day saints in conversion to fiscal rectitude and tax reform, which is quite the opposite. When they left Government they had presided over a period of excessive, accelerating growth in public spending, then standing at 7 per cent per annum. Since then we have succeeded in restraining that rate of growth.  This Government introduced a budget yesterday showing real public spending growing at 2.5 per cent, almost one-third the rate Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats had bequeathed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very significant that we are achieving stability in fiscal terms.  In the programme for Government the three <Col N="1157" /> parties agreed targets for public spending and borrowing which established a good framework for economic development. We are beginning to see the fruits of that fiscal stability.  This year, for example, the current budget deficit will be close to nil, 0.2 per cent of GNP.  We also anticipate that the general Government deficit as a proportion of national income will fall again by 5 percentage points to 81 per cent.  This means we are achieving Maastricht criteria and continuing to reduce our debt.</P>
    <P>We are reinforcing that approach to our public finances by committing ourselves to a multi-annual approach to fiscal issues, a very positive development, thus reinforcing the notion of stability and planning so important to business. We are also seeing the fruits of that stable fiscal environment which is having a very positive effect on our economy.</P>
    <P>Last year we saw a record increase of 4 per cent in employment &mdash; 49,000 additional people at work.  That is as much achieved in one year as had been achieved in almost 30 years between 1960 and 1989, clearly demonstrating that Government policies in this area are working.  It is important to stress that we are reaping the rewards of solid Government policies.  We have seen that clearly in my Department in the performance of our industrial agencies. Last year was the best on record of the Industrial Development Authority, with a net increase of 6,500 jobs.  In addition Forbairt had one of the most outstanding performances yet on the part of the indigenous sector which over a number of years had been witnessing declining employment.  Last year we saw a net growth of employment on the part of indigenous companies in excess of 2,000 and the same was true of SFADCo.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment suggest that we should be complacent about this performance. I am at present taking steps to ensure our approach is carefully reviewed, that we are attuned to take advantage of the opportunities and challenges opening up to us.</P>
    <P>In the context of those challenges the pro-employment budget introduced yesterday will reinforce our ability to seize <Col N="1158" /> that potential.  Employers' PRSI has been cut by £51 million in a full year. Over the past two budgets the threshold for employers' contributions at the low rate of 9 per cent has been increased from £9,000 to £13,000 and the rate actually reduced to 8.5 per cent.  That is very significant progress, meaning that henceforth two-thirds, or 655,000, of all jobs in our economy will be subject to the low rate.  This effort is targeted at the creation and protection of employment and is crucial to many of our industries which have had to face very stiff competition, particularly resulting from currency changes.</P>
    <P>We have also improved the benefits of working through very significant reform of employees' PRSI, having reinforced a strategic shift in the structure of employees' PRSI by introducing an allowance last year of £50, rising this year to £80 per week, which will ensure that people who go back to work again. This will open up new opportunities for lower paid and all areas of employment.</P>
    <P>The poverty trap was an issue this Government recognised as presenting a serious difficulty.  We have made very significant progress, reinforced again this year by improved child benefit, improved family income supplement, reinforced further by making the child dependent allowance retainable by those who take up work for 13 weeks while allowing them retain their medical card for three years.  It is worth giving a small example of how that improvement has had a very practical impact in the case of, say, a married couple with three children who would receive just over £142 on social welfare.  If one spouse goes out to work at £180 a week the couple will pay no income tax, no levies, their only contribution by way of tax being the £5.50 PRSI contribution.  In addition they will receive a top-up family income supplement of £33.  To sum up, they will be better off by £65 than if they were on welfare and can retain their medical card for three years, a very significant change for lower earners. This means we are able to demonstrate real net gains of those taking up employment, a major problem we have had to overcome and on which we have <Col N="1159" /> made significant progress in the last two budgets.  Clearly there is further to go on this route but it can clearly be seen that we have made very significant strides.</P>
    <P>Child benefit, one of the most significant instruments used by this Government to improve incentives to work throughout our economy, has been increased in just two years by 45 per cent, from £20 to £29.  The action of Government speaks louder than words and we are demonstrably dealing with the poverty traps.</P>
    <P>Another area of major concern to all who have studied our economy in recent times has been the need to reduce unemployment.  We conducted a survey within my Department of the take-up of employment created by IDA and Forbairt. It is encouraging to note that approximately 40 per cent of those jobs go to people who are unemployed, which means we are making a real impact on reducing unemployment. However, what is not so encouraging is that the same cannot be said of those who are long-term unemployed, many of these new job opportunities passing them by.  We have done some research which shows that the probability of somebody who has been two or three years out of work finding employment within 12 months is extremely low, of the order of 20 per cent or less than one-third of the opportunity of a person who has only recently lost employment.</P>
    <P>It is clear we have to target the long-term unemployed.  We must also target young school leavers without formal qualifications who are experiencing very high rates of up to 70 per cent unemployment. This budget has introduced an innovative package to tackle both those problems.  As the House will know, the recruitment subsidy of £80 per week is targeted specifically at the long-term unemployed who have been out of work for three years.  This will give employers a very significant incentive to bring such people back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>There are also many other schemes targeted at 18 and 19 year olds who leave school without qualification.  We <Col N="1160" /> are introducing a significant new initiative, a progression programme for them. This will mean there will be a youth progression programme avialable to those in danger of drifting into long-term unemployment.  After six months of unemployment they will be required to register with FÁS or the LES and will have a programme tailored to their individual needs, including job counselling and placement, training, work trials &mdash; another new initiative &mdash; youth employment option and subsidised training in employment, otherwise known as the job training scheme.  Young people will be expected to participate actively in this initiative or have their continued eligibility for welfare support reassessed under existing social welfare provisions, with a possible disqualification of up to nine weeks.</P>
    <P>This has not been framed in a negative way.  It is a very positive, proactive programme, opening up opportunities for young people who could all too easily remain on the live register, drift into long-term unemployment and see their chances slip away.  It is very important that we get people committed to this endeavour, which is what this programme is designed to do.</P>
    <P>We are introducing many other initiatives, such as the work trials programme in which some 5,000 people are participating.  In addition, we have totally revamped the community employment scheme to ensure it is targeted at achieving progression for those who are particularly mobile, giving long-term work experience to those who are not so mobile, who need greater employment experience.  All of that is reinforced by the pilot job option scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a very significant underpinning of enterprise, particularly small businesses.  We have introduced a 30 per cent corporate tax rate on the first £50,000 profits of small non-manufacturing companies.  In addition, we have ensured that the transfer of family businesses or family farms will not be hit with huge capital acquisitions tax burdens at that crucial time when one generation hands on to the next.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Moffatt, McDaid and Batt O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>Over the last year I have had extensive contacts on a wide range of issues with disability organisations and people with disabilities.  One of the consistent themes which they have articulated to me again and again is their powerful sense of being marginalised within the official agenda of this State.  The causes of this go beyond the day to day problems faced as a result of the under-funding and inflexible policies which are so much part of official action; they extend to the myriad obstacles faced by people with disabilities when they attempt to participate as full citizens in the public life of the State.  Fianna Fáil has addressed these issues in our recently launched policy document Meeting the Challenge of Equality, the most comprehensive document on disability ever issued by an Irish political party.</P>
      <P>One of the more obvious of the barriers to participation faced by people with disabilities is the way in which our electoral system treats them as special cases for separate treatment.  It is overcoming the exclusion and marginalisation caused in this fundamental area and meeting the need for immediate statutory action that this Bill is designed to achieve.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was published last year, I have received letters of support from the major organisations which represent the people with disabilities affected by the failures of the current system.  They have told me that they support the Bill's passage and believe it merits cross-party backing.  In addition, I am aware that representatives of some of these organisations have also written to members of the Government asking them to support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last decade and a half this issue has been raised at official level on many occasions.  One aspect of this is <Col N="1162" /> that whenever electoral matters are being discussed in this House Deputies make reference to the lack of accessible polling provision and the unfair discrimination this causes.  During the recent Second Stage debate on the Electoral Bill, Deputies from all parties called for action on this.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that at some stage every Deputy has become aware of constituents who have been denied their right to participate in the electoral process on the same basis as the rest of the community.  It is no less than scandalous that such a fundamental right continues to be denied to many of our citizens.</P>
    <P>The practical basis of our electoral system is that democracy starts at the ballot box, yet we compromise this by placing ballot boxes in buildings and rooms to which large numbers of voters cannot gain access.  It is simply not good enough to say that there are alternative means available for casting a vote.  This is a classic example of where a disability is created for the individual which would not exist if proper consideration were given to simple requirements.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this Bill, Fianna Fáil is saying that we must not allow another election or referendum to take place under the current discredited and discriminatory system.</P>
    <P>The two basic principles of the Bill are that people should not be denied the right to vote at their local polling station with the rest of their community simply because they cannot walk and that people who cannot go to their local polling station because of physical disability or illness should be treated equally with other categories of voters who have postal votes extended to them.  The Bill employs a range of new provisions to ensure that these principles will be met in practice.</P>
    <P>I would like to, first, outline the full nature of the failure of the current system to include people with disabilities in the electoral process on an equal basis with the rest of the community, second, to explain how the provisions of the Bill would work to meet the Bill's objectives, and, third, to explain why these problems must be addressed by statute <Col N="1163" /> rather than regulation, as suggested previously by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A central element of our electoral system requires those who wish to vote to present themselves at an allocated polling station near their home.  The system of establishing where polling stations shall be sited is carried out by the local authority on a very infrequent basis.  Polling schemes, drafted by local authorities in accordance with the Electoral Act, 1992, are submitted once every ten years to the Department of the Environment.  In answer to a question I tabled last year, Minister Howlin stated that only two polling schemes were under review.  In practice, polling stations remain where they have always been and reviews cover only the impact of population and boundary changes. As a result buildings which fail to meet the needs of all voters continue to be used purely on the basis of tradition.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed me in response to another question that neither he nor his Department is in a position to say how many polling stations are accessible to wheelchair users.  A survey of polling stations in Britain showed that almost 80 per cent were inaccessible and there is little reason to believe conditions are significantly different here.  The Minister said that returning officers have been requested to make special arrangements to overcome small barriers and that guidelines had been issued on the subject. Following the divorce referendum, it was confirmed to me that this piecemeal approach has not had any major effect and that many people with disabilities continue to be unable to gain access to their local polling station.</P>
    <P>For these people the law has responded; they can vote somewhere else or stay at home and vote.  This is a classic case of perpetuating the idea that separate provision is all right, but it is not.  If voting with one's local community is the established norm, then this must include all members of the community. That said, even the right to apply to vote at another station is often-times merely academic because time <Col N="1164" /> limits are too restrictive and information on accessibility is difficult to come by.</P>
    <P>The special voters system requires that a person who, through physical disability or illness, is unable to attend at a polling station can vote at home.  Having applied for entry onto the list, the voters are called some days before polling by a presiding officer and a garda who supervise them voting.  This system was introduced by the Tánaiste in 1986 when Minister for the Environment.  In introducing this system, the then Minister and his Department ignored the report of a working party into the register of electors which had specifically recommended postal votes for people with physical disabilities and rejected the Department's warning that there is an undue risk of personation by allowing postal votes.</P>
    <P>The most offensive part of the special voters system &mdash; the requirement that those applying for registration produce a statement of their sanity signed by a doctor &mdash; was removed by Fianna Fáil in the 1992 Electoral Act.  However, this reform does not go far enough, the system needs to be abolished.  I have heard consistent reports from people registered under the system that it is always intrusive and often intimidating.  In addition, the distinct nature of the system implies that people with disabilities are somehow less trustworthy than others who are allowed full postal votes. Full postal voting includes members of the security forces and the 50,000 graduates of the universities who vote in Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>The antipathy felt by people with disabilities towards the special voters system can be seen by the fact that registrations on the special voters list have been falling by 350 per annum.  Last year only 3,293 people chose to register as special voters.  The total number be eligible to register is uncertain as the Government has no accurate estimates of the number of people with disabilities and the extent of their disabilities.  Evidence suggests that the numbers who choose to register are no more than one third of those eligible.  The special voters system also costs the State money in <Col N="1165" /> comparison with normal postal voting. Replies to parliamentary questions have shown that the special voters system costs roughly £9 per person to administer compared with only £3 per person for postal voting.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain the detailed proposals contained in the Bill to address these problems.  Part II deals with the accessibility of polling stations.  The key principle contained here is that if an accessible building is available it should be used in preference to an in-accessible one.  Further, a duty is placed on local authorities to search for such buildings and consult the public.  The specific mechanism used is through reforming the system of drawing up polling schemes and obliging returning officers to place stations in accessible places where the polling scheme permits.</P>
    <P>Section 3 requires local authorities to make a polling scheme every five years rather than the current once every ten years.  In making their polling schemes they would be obliged to appoint as polling places, where possible, only such places as would allow access to wheelchair users.  In all cases where they do not appoint an accessible place, they would be obliged to state their reasons for not doing so.  In addition, the public would be invited to make submissions in respect of the scheme.  This particular provision would potentially benefit the entire community by giving them a voice in the selection of the most appropriate place in their area to site a polling station.  Finally, the Minister for the Environment would be empowered to oblige local authorities to redraft their polling schemes where he considers inadequate provision has been made to allow for access.  These provisions would lead to a considerable extension in the number of accessible stations throughout the country.  However, there will continue to be areas where there are no accessible public buildings.  This Bill does not seek by itself to require the wholesale alteration of buildings, desirable as this may be; instead it simply says, if there is a suitable building available one must use it.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 returning officers would be obliged, where possible, to <Col N="1166" /> locate polling stations only in places which are accessible to wheelchair users. They would also be required to provide such arrangements in polling stations as would serve to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by voters who are wheelchair users.  This provision would give a statutory basis to the current general guidelines issued to presiding officers in relation to providing a low table and placing the ballot box on the floor.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 7 would reduce the final application date required from those seeking to vote at a polling station other than that to which they have been assigned from seven days to five before polling day.  In conjunction with latter proposals relating to the polling information card, this would give people a practical chance to avail of this second best option.</P>
    <P>Even with accessible polling stations there will continue to be people who are unable to vote in person due to physical illness or disability.  Because of this, some form of alternative voting arrangements will continue to be required.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in Part III would abolish the special voters list and extend postal voting to people who are unable to vote at a polling station as a result of physical disability or illness. This specific reform would bring our electoral facilities into line with many other countries, including France, Germany, Spain and Britain.  The current system of registration would be maintained, including the current set registration dates.  While there is definitely room for reform in this and other areas, such as provision for the visually impaired, the Bill seeks to avoid more general issues which should be dealt with through a wider Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to impress the seriousness with which any abuses of the system are viewed upon all those who come into contact with postal votes, section 8 also includes a provision that the form of receipt specified in the 1992 Electoral Act includes a statement of the offences and penalties which relate to postal voting. In addition, Part IV would deal with <Col N="1167" /> a seeming omission in the current legislation and require persons present, while a postal voter is voting, to maintain the secrecy of the ballot.</P>
    <P>In addition to the basic proposals concerning the location of polling stations and the extension of postal voting, the Bill deals with certain other, related matters.  It is surely reasonable that people with disabilities be given the right to have the same access to counts as everybody else.  For this reason section 8 proposes to require returning officers to appoint as counting centres only places which are accessible to wheelchair users.</P>
    <P>Section 13 relates to the accessibility of polling stations but this time refers to the availability of information.  It would require that the polling card sent to each voter state clearly if the polling station to which they have been assigned is not accessible.  In addition, the polling card would have to inform voters assigned to inaccessible stations that they have the right to apply to vote at another station if personally affected by this inaccessibility.  The final part of this section would require that the polling card be delivered not less than seven days before polling day instead of the current three.  This would give voters affected by the inaccessibility of their station a practical opportunity to apply to vote elsewhere in an accessible building.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is a temporary provision which would allow those registered on the special voters list at the time of the Bill's enactment to be entered on the postal voters list until such time as a new postal voters list shall have been compiled in accordance with the existing timetable.  This would ensure that there was no delay in sweeping away the present system.</P>
    <P>The need for action on this issue is obvious to all.  However, the Minister has previously stated that he feels the key issues affecting accessibility can be best dealt with on an administrative level.  I disagree.  Such previous administrative action, as I have pointed out, has <Col N="1168" /> had no systematic impact.  It is surely reasonable that the law of the land protect and promote the right of all citizens to equal access to the electoral process. Such rights should not be based merely on ministerial regulation and administrative whim.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that this matter has been taken as far as the Supreme Court.  In its judgment the court clearly stressed that it is the responsibility of the Oireachtas to enact legislation facilitating the citizen's right to vote.  This said, there are issues involved in accessibility which can only be dealt with by statute.  The proposed alteration to the polling scheme process, the obligation to consult the public, the changes to polling card delivery dates, the obligation to use accessible count centres and, most important, the extension of normal postal voting, all require legislation. Piecemeal regulation and occasional leaflets will not address the fundamental issues at hand.</P>
    <P>In relation to postal voting, I hope the Minister will not produce the ancient and discredited claim that there was widespread abuse under the postal voting system operated for local elections until 1986.  I would like him to explain how he can separate people with disabilities from public servants and university graduates as being uniquely untrustworthy when it comes to postal voting.</P>
    <P>In his amendment the Minister proposes to refer the issues addressed in the Bill to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  For a variety of reasons we reject this idea.  The issues are clear and the remedies obvious.  If the Government believes it can improve the provisions of this Bill, then it should produce amendments on Committee Stage.  I have already received suggestions on a number of possible amendments and have no doubt the Bill can be further improved.  However, this is no excuse for delaying action.  In addition, when the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs has had time to consider these issues, in the midst of its deliberations on the Finance <Col N="1169" /> Bill, the massive delays in producing Government legislation would inevitably mean that elections and referenda would continue to be held under the current system.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also take into account that this Government has undertaken a wide range of promises on disability issues.  The overwhelming majority of these promises have not been met and a large number of legislative, financial and administrative proposals have been delayed or side-tracked. Particularly in the light of the imminent report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the time has come for the Government to turn rhetoric into action.  This Bill gives a perfect opportunity to do something about promoting equality for people with disabilities; if the Government fails to support the Bill's proposals it will seriously call into question its commitment to action in other more difficult areas.</P>
    <P>In publishing this Bill, Fianna Fáil is saying that the widespread marginalisation of disabled voters within the electoral system must be challenged and we are providing some practical means for beginning to meet this challenge.  It is not a complex Bill but it addresses a fundamental issue and commands widespread support among those affected by the current discriminatory system.  It is a reasonable response to an important issue and I call on the Government to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the rather mean tactics adopted by the Government in dealing with this worthwhile and necessary Bill.  The Government has obviously realised that voting against it will lead to condemnation of it and, in an attempt to avoid this, it has resorted to the cowardly tactic of tabling an amendment which appears to mean one thing but which is really intended to do something entirely different, that is to consign the Bill to the waste paper basket.  The Government amendment seeks to postpone the Bill in its entirety until its provisions <Col N="1170" /> have been examined and reported on by a select committee.  The failure to set a timescale for this examination clearly indicates where people with disabilities are on the Government's list of priorities.</P>
      <P>Most schoolchildren are aware that on Committee Stage legislation is scrutinised and, if necessary, amended.  The Government's amendment implies that it agrees with the broad thrust of this simple Bill.  We are not talking about complex legislation which will require the attention of an army of the best legal brains available to the Minister. Why can the Minister not support the Bill and table whatever amendments he thinks are required on Committee Stage?  The Bill does not need to be put on the long finger, which is clearly the intention.  People with disabilities of one kind or another deserve better.  Deputy Mary Wallace is to be highly commended for the time and work she has put into the preparation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Every so often the issue of disablement is raised in the House, usually during Private Members' time. However, the admirable speeches made during these debates seldom result in any positive action being taken.  I am open to correction but I believe the last occasion any positive action was taken was in 1991 when Deputy O'Hanlon, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, introduced special building regulations designed to give people with disabilities proper access to buildings.  These regulations enshrined in law for the first time the right of people with disabilities to have access to a range of buildings.  They referred to the design and construction of new buildings only but had the effect of shaming a number of institutions such as banks into adapting their existing buildings, where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after my election to the House I suggested during a debate on a Private Members' Bill that a Minister of State could usefully be employed to co-ordinate the services to people with disabilities as well as those with severe or mild degrees of mental handicap.  This <Col N="1171" /> need still exists as the services are provided by a variety of Government Departments such as the Departments of Health, the Environment, Social Welfare and Education.  I said I had come across instances where Departments were dealing simultaneously with the same matter.  I was, therefore, delighted when the spokesmen for Fine Gael and Labour repeated my suggestion during a debate in the House on 10 and 11 December 1991.  The then spokesperson for Labour, Deputy Michael Ferris, said:</P>
    <P>The appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the services for the mentally handicapped would ensure the proper co-ordination of services for people with disabilities, the development of new services and the full right of equal citizenship for those with a disability.</P>
    <P>During the same debate the then spokesman for Fine Gael and present Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, said:</P>
    <P>We are talking also about the need for a coherent framework.  As Deputy McDaid rightly pointed out, we have services scattered throughout six or seven Departments, supposedly providing services for people with a disability. There is no framework within which we can know that the needs of those persons are being met as they go through life.  That is why Fine Gael and the Labour Party believe it is so important to have a Minister with overriding responsibility stretching across those different Departments to provide that coherent response.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mary Wallace's Bill mainly addresses the problems peculiar to polling stations I wish to quote the following passage from Deputy Bruton's speech:</P>
    <P>Public facilities are generally inaccessible; you only have to look at this House to realise that if a TD was confined to a wheelchair he or she could not get in or out of this Chamber.  We do not think in those terms which is an indictment of legislators.  The same <Col N="1172" /> is true of most polling stations which are not accessible to people with a disability.</P>
    <P>In 1991 there was agreement among the spokesmen for the three main parties on this issue.  What is preventing Fine Gael and the Labour Party supporting this straightforward Bill in the interest of some of our more unfortunate citizens?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wallace for sharing her time with me and compliment her on bringing forward this timely and necessary Bill.  This is a short Bill but it should be remembered that sometimes the best goods come in small parcels, and this is one such occasion. This forward thinking measure will afford people with a physical handicap an opportunity to participate to the fullest extent possible in society and, in particular, the political process by giving them the right of access to polling booths and an opportunity to vote in appropriate surroundings.</P>
      <P>Many polling booths are not accessible to wheelchairs and other modes of transport used by people who are physically handicapped.  Yet under our planning laws it is necessary for public offices, hospitals, clinics, hotels, recreational centres, swimming pools etc. to be accessible to the physically handicapped and people in wheelchairs.  It is not unreasonable, therefore, to expect the Government to make available through the Department of the Environment and, perhaps, the Department of Education the facilities for voting proposed in the Bill.  If the necessary facilities are not available in one location it may be possible to provide them in an adjoining building.  If this is not possible then better arrangements should be made for postal voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date planning for the provision of facilities for the handicapped has been done on a piecemeal basis.  This was recently highlighted by Deputy Wallace in her policy document on disability which demands that there should be better co-ordination in the provision of facilities for the handicapped.  She also stated that we should not &ldquo;medicalise&rdquo;<Col N="1173" /> physical handicap which may be a congenital or acquired condition or a sequel of a severe illness.  We are not talking about a small number of people.  The Bill refers to people who are 18 years and older.  Many of these people may have suffered birth trauma, had meningitis or suffer from MS, muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy or had a stroke. In other cases people may have been in a serious accident and suffered spinal injuries.  The Bill would be of benefit to all those people.  Lately, there has been much concern about meningococcal meningitis, a horrific condition which may result in death or the loss of a limb. People with a physical handicap should be afforded every opportunity to live life to the full, and this includes participation in the political process.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that an inordinate amount of money would be required to make the necessary modifications but I suggest the opposite is the case.  That is not a good excuse for rejecting this Bill. The Budget Statement, which we were told was wonderful, did not contain one single sentence about the physically handicapped.</P>

      <P>When one considers the appropriateness of this Bill, one need only think back to the arrival in Leinster House of former Senator Brian Crowley, now an MEP, to fully appreciate the extraordinary changes which have been made within a short space of time.  Something similar is required to bring about action on the proposals contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> The document produced by Fianna Fáil, Meeting the Challenge of Equality, is incisive, exciting and enlightening.  In that context, I especially welcome this Bill and praise Deputy Mary Wallace on its production because it would go a long way towards eliminating an obstacle which people with a disability believe has caused them to be marginalised.  It is important to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>A positive feature has been the participation of people with a disability in framing the basic tenets of this Bill.  It was of importance to them that the process was all-inclusive and that they were consulted about what should be included.  They are thankful to Fianna Fáil for affording them the respect they deserve through the good offices of Deputy Wallace.</P>
    <P>Every person has a disability.  The only difference is that in the case of people with a physical disability it is more obvious.  They have the same level of intelligence and motivation and the same aspirations, interests and needs as everyone else.  Do they not have the right under the Constitution to vote? Unfortunately, because of insensitivity on our part, they are, if not denied, then hindered in exercising it.  Is it any wonder that many of them feel they have been disenfranchised?</P>
    <P>They would like to see changes to the Electoral Act under which they are required annually to provide a medical certificate as proof of their disability. They can ill afford the cost involved &mdash; doctors charge £20 for a home visit.  As this is a nonsensical provision it should be changed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>It is discriminatory to ask people with a disability to cast their vote at home. Why should they have to do that?  The vast majority have been integrated into their local community which they enliven and embellish.  They should be able to gain access to the designated polling station.</P>
    <P>Tradition is a major factor in the selection of polling stations by the local authority or returning officer.  In the vast majority of cases cognisance is not <Col N="1175" /> taken of the accessibility of the station concerned.  In the United Kingdom 80 per cent of stations were found to be unsuitable and one can be certain that the percentage is far higher in this country.</P>
    <P>Can you imagine the embarrassment of a disabled person when, on their arrival at a polling station, they discover there is no ramp and they have to call for assistance negotiating the steps only to discover they have to turn back because their wheelchair will not go through the door?  This causes a furore, fuss, inconvenience and annoyance and amounts to an insult.  It cannot be allowed to continue.  I hope, that, as a perceptive and humane person, the Minister will accept the basic tenets of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the number of people with a disability who cast their vote has fallen appreciably in recent elections?  If they are successful in gaining access to the polling station, they are then confronted with another barrier &mdash; the shelf in the polling booth is too high. Is it too much to ask that at least one be modified and set aside for their use?</P>
    <P>Although legislation is in place to deal with new buildings it is not being enforced.  I cite as an example the refurbished courthouse in Cork, which was opened with great majesty and style by the Minister for Justice.  Although the building has been refurbished people with a disability have to meet in the corridor and be lifted in and out in order to gain access to the courtroom which is situated upstairs.  Whose function is it to ensure the legislation is adhered to? There is an onus on the Minister to ensure it is enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to refer this Bill to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs which is chaired by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  It is a case of &ldquo;Jim will fix it&rdquo;, irrespective of what Bill is introduced it is referred to him.</P>

He should accept that the Bill is meaningful, well intentioned and, more particularly, geared to the needs of the physically incapacitated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill until the proposals it contains have been examined, and reported on, by the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of the Bill is to aid the greater participation of people with disabilities in the electoral process.  I am in full agreement with this objective and, the wider objective of enhancing the position of people with disabilities in our society generally.</P>
      <P>This Government, and the previous Government of which I was a member, recognised the importance of allowing people with a disability to express their full citizenship.  That Government appointed a Minister with responsibility for the disabled and the disadvantaged. It also established a new Department of Equality and Law Reform.  As a consequence, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was established and I understand it is expected to submit its report next April.  The policy document, A Government of Renewal, states that when the commission has reported, the Government will put in place mechanisms for the full and equal participation of every citizen with a disability in every aspect of our economic and social life.  We remain fully committed to this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that Deputy Wallace, in putting forward the proposals in her Bill, is acting from a conviction that more <Col N="1177" /> needs to be done in the electoral area for this section of our community.  I recognise, appreciate and applaud her initiative but the reality is that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has been working on its wider remit and I am reluctant to go down the road of specific legislative proposals of the type embraced by this Bill without the benefit of the commission's views on the wider aspects, especially as we can have these views in a few months.  That is one of the reasons I suggest that we defer final decisions on these legislative proposals.  There are other factors too, arising from developments in relation to electoral law, which suggest that the course I propose is prudent.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to improvements in electoral procedures which would facilitate citizens in exercising one of their most important democratic rights.  In this context I want to build on the very important programme of reform of electoral law which has taken place in the past few years.  The programme began with the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1992, which consolidated and improved the law in relation to the conduct of Dáil elections and the registration of electors.  The Presidential Elections Act, 1993, and the Referendum Act, 1994, continued this process. Local elections law was updated in the Local Government Act, 1994, and the detailed rules for the conduct of local elections were consolidated in the Local Elections Regulations, 1995, which were also approved by this House.  Overall, the objective of the programme is to consolidate and update all the various branches of the electoral law and make each electoral code more meaningful and clear to the public.  I am happy to record that substantial progress has been made in that regard and further progress will be made this year when I introduce a Bill to consolidate the law on elections to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the work on specific legislative proposals, I referred an extensive list of suggestions for <Col N="1178" /> improvements in electoral law and procedures to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs last April. These include suggestions made in the course of the debates in both Houses on the Electoral Act, 1992.  I have been advised that the committee, despite its busy work schedule, will have detailed discussions on the suggestions referred to it, which cover a broad range of electoral matters.  The committee is to meet on 13 and 14 March to consider these matters.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the relevance of the committee's work to the proposals in the Bill, it might be of assistance to the House to outline the existing provisions in electoral law designed to assist electors who have difficulties due to physical illness or disability.  There are statutory arrangements in place to facilitate voters unable to get to their polling stations because of physical illness or disability.  There is also provision for voters, who, although mobile, have difficulty in gaining access to their polling stations and others who, due to physical impairment, have problems in casting their vote at polling stations.</P>
    <P>Under the special arrangements provided for in the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986, and subsequently restated in the Electoral Act, 1992, voters unable to go to the polling station to vote in person because of physical disability or illness may apply for entry on the special voters list.  At an election or referendum, the ballot paper is delivered to the special voter at his or her residence by a special presiding officer accompanied by a garda.</P>
    <P>Application for entry on the special voters list is made at the time of the preparation of the register of electors. The necessary conditions are that the elector must be unable to go to vote at the polling station by reason of physical illness or disability and that the illness or disability is likely to continue for the period during which the register will remain in force.  The facility is available in all cases where the illness or disability is likely to continue for the lifetime of <Col N="1179" /> the register, that is, for a period of about 12 months.</P>
    <P>In the case of a disabled voter who is mobile and capable of going to the polling station but finds access to the polling station difficult or impossible because of the situation or design of the building, there is an arrangement under which the voter may be authorised to vote at another more convenient polling station.  A voter wishing to avail of this facility must apply to the returning officer not less than seven days before polling day for authorisation to vote at an alternative station.  The applicant must satisfy the returning officer that he or she is unable to gain access to the polling station allotted to him or her because of physical illness or disability.</P>
    <P>There are also statutory arrangements in place to assist electors in voting. Where a voter satisfies the presiding officer that his or her eyesight is so impaired or that he or she is otherwise so physically incapacitated that the voter is unable to vote without assistance, that voter may have the ballot paper marked on his or her instructions by a companion or the presiding officer. Where the voter wishes to have the ballot paper marked by a companion, the companion goes with the voter to the voting compartment and there marks the ballot paper in accordance with the voter's instructions.  The companion then places the marked ballot paper in the ballot box.  Where the voter opts to have the ballot paper marked by the presiding officer, the presiding officer marks the ballot paper in the presence of the voter and personation agents present in the polling station, before placing it in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>Other measures have been taken on an administrative basis to facilitate disabled voters.  At each election and referendum returning officers are advised by my Department that they should, as far as possible, select buildings for use as polling stations which are accessible to people with disabilities.  In particular, they are advised that polling buildings should have level access and doors of <Col N="1180" /> adequate width to facilitate wheelchair users.  It is made clear to returning officers that polling stations should, in all cases, be located on the ground floor to provide easy access by disabled voters. It is also suggested to returning officers that in the event that a polling station cannot be reached without negotiating steps, they should consider providing a suitable ramp where this can be done safely.</P>
    <P>Presiding officers are asked to advise elderly voters or voters with physical disabilities that they may sit at a table provided for this purpose rather than using a voting compartment while marking their ballot paper, if this is more convenient for them.  Presiding officers are, of course, instructed that they should ensure that, where this arrangement is availed of by a voter, secrecy of the ballot in relation to that voter is not compromised.</P>
    <P>The arrangements, both statutory and administrative, already in operation go a long way towards assisting physically disabled voters and voters who are elderly in exercising their right to vote.  The Bill which is the subject of today's debate, in addition to providing for the replacement of special voting arrangements with postal voting, proposes to put on a statutory basis administrative arrangements already in place in relation to the selection of suitable buildings for use as polling stations, the facilitating of wheelchair users in marking ballot papers as well as other modifications to electoral law to facilitate disabled voters.</P>
    <P>I share with all Members the view that proposals to improve facilities for disabled voters should be welcomed and implemented where they are judged to be practicable and in the interests of the voters concerned and our electoral system as a whole.  However, I consider that the formulation of proposals on matters such as those provided for in the Bill would best be approached on a more considered basis with a view to bringing forward an integrated set of proposals dealing with this aspect of electoral law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> The extensive list of suggestions for improvements in electoral law and procedures to be considered by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs covers a wide range of electoral matters, such as the registration of electors, voting arrangements, statutory provisions relating to candidates and their agents and the inclusion of additional information on polling cards.  The list also includes &mdash; I know the Deputy will be interested in hearing this &mdash; specific suggestions closely connected with the matters dealt with in this Bill.  For instance, there are suggestions, now being considered by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, for facilitating electors with reading and writing difficulties and about the possibility of extending special voting facilities to those who incur a disability following the publication of the register of electors and to disabled persons entered in the supplement rather than the register proper.  I also invited the committee to examine the suggestion that braille on ballot papers, or braille templates, should be provided for electors with impaired eyesight.</P>
    <P>Matters such as those I have mentioned are directly related to the proposals contained in this Bill and I feel strongly that it would be best if all these proposals &mdash; not just dealing with elements of disability but the visually impaired and all the others that Members may wish to bring forward &mdash; could be dealt with in a composite and comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>Improvements to the electoral laws should, as far as practicable, have crossparty support.  For this reason, and because of the far reaching implications of some of the proposals in the Bill, I consider it would be of great benefit and assistance if the issues of principle involved were considered by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs before we decide to give this Bill a Second Reading.  The fact that it would be open to the select committee, in preparing its report, to seek submissions from interest groups, including those directly affected, and to have <Col N="1182" /> regard to any suggestions which any such group may make would be another advantage of proceeding in this way.</P>
    <P>It is important that we bear in mind, in considering any changes in the electoral law, that any new systems must be capable of being implemented within the short timeframe which exists at election time that is, between the declaration of an election and the ballot. Arrangements for receipt of nominations, printing of ballot papers, appointment of staff, organisation of polling stations and so on, must all be completed within strictly limited periods. We will need to look at the proposals in the Bill in that light.  Let us take one example: the proposal to reduce from seven to five days the period for seeking a transfer to a more convenient polling station may have practical problems having regard to the length of time required for posting correspondence between parties, publication of the supplement to the register, the issue of polling cards, etc.  Other sections of the Bill seem to recognise the practical problems by including the phrases &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall endeavour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The issue which will, of course, require the most careful consideration is the proposal in the Bill to replace the existing special voting arrangements with unsupervised postal voting.  In considering this, we have the benefit of experience of the operation of various forms of postal voting to guide us.  I know the Deputy did not want me to refer to our experience in this regard, but all parties were concerned about what happened after the 1970 local elections.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, a fairly openended system of postal voting was introduced for the 1974 local elections and available to electors who could not vote in person due to the circumstances of their occupation or employment or because of physical illness or disability. The system was tightened up considerably for local elections which took place in 1985 and additional safeguards were introduced.  However, the experience at <Col N="1183" /> these two elections was that unsupervised postal voting was open to abuse &mdash; that was a view shared by all political parties &mdash; that it had been abused and that there was every likelihood that it might be abused again.  I would like to stress that there was no question on either of these occasions that disabled voters themselves were the perpetrators of the abuse; on the contrary, there were instances in which such electors were the victims of abuse and had their ballot papers marked by third parties without their knowledge or consent.</P>
    <P>In the light of experience with postal voting on these occasions, the Oireachtas decided in 1986 to introduce the special arrangements enabling persons with disabilities to vote at home at all elections and referenda so that no third party would make the ultimate democratic decision on their behalf.  I am not aware of any widespread demand for the replacement of this system and a return to a form of postal voting.</P>
    <P>Under any system of postal voting, the elector and his or her ballot paper must be given the same protection and guarantee of secrecy afforded to an elector voting in person at the polling station.  This is a constitutional right which must be safeguarded.  In the case of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána to whom a postal voting facility is available, the electors are members of the security forces and adequate safeguards are built into the voting system.  Diplomats and their spouses posted abroad, who can also vote by post, must mark their ballot paper in the presence of a person authorised by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, normally the head of the mission, and have a declaration of identity witnessed by the authorised person.  Stringent requirements are in place for postal voting in the limited areas where it is allowed.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions contained in the Electoral Bill, 1994, for the extension of postal voting to those unable to vote in person due to the circumstances of their <Col N="1184" /> occupation, service or employment, electors will be required to go to a Garda station, to mark their ballot paper in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána and to have a declaration of identity witnessed by the garda.</P>
    <P>The disabled electors who avail of special voting arrangements are mainly persons who are housebound but we must build into any new system a guarantee of the secrecy and integrity of their vote.  How can this be achieved without a supervised postal voting system? If we accept that there must be supervision, how is this to be provided for?  These are important matters which, I am convinced, can best be teased out in committee and we should all reserve our position on them until that debate has taken place.</P>
    <P>I have long had a concern for matters affecting people with disabilities and trust that my reluctance on this occasion to endorse the particular proposals in this Bill will not be misunderstood.  As Minister for Health, I was particularly concerned to improve services for people with physical disabilities and in 1993, and again in 1994, I was able to secure additional funding of £1.5 million for the development of these services. A much greater sum was provided for significant improvements in services for people with a mental handicap.  This was the first time that development funding on this scale was provided for health services for people with physical disabilities. It was used to provide additional residential and respite facilities, community based therapy services, home support services, improved equipment and transport facilities as well as increased funding of voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a concern for many matters which impact positively on the daily lives of people with disabilities.  In 1994 and 1995, for example, over £750,000 has been paid in grants for implementing facilities for mobility impaired people in the Dublin area; works covered include the dishing <Col N="1185" /> of footpaths, provision of barriers, skid resistance work at pedestrian crossings, tactile paving and new traffic signals.</P>
    <P>Through the building regulations we are seeking to ensure that, as far as is reasonable and practicable, buildings should be usable by people with disabilities. There are specific requirements relating to access and use of buildings and the provision of sanitary conveniences in buildings, where appropriate. Some of these requirements, which apply to new buildings, extensions of existing buildings and works in connection with material alterations and material changes of use should, incidentally, lead to better access to polling places where they are located in new or renovated buildings.</P>
    <P>In the roads area, local authorities have been urged to pay particular attention to the needs of disabled people, including those of the blind, when planning and executing road works, pedestrian facilities and providing on-street parking facilities.  In the case of driving tests, an informal arrangement is in place whereby an applicant with a physcial or medical disability is tested by a supervisory tester; this allows a more flexible and relaxed approach and, if necessary, more time, since the supervisor is not constrained by a tight schedule.</P>
    <P>In housing, there are a variety of special measures for disabled people. We provide, directly or through the housing authorities, the disabled person's new house grants scheme under which the conditions restricting the floor area of the house and disqualifying those who previously purchased dwellings do not apply.  There is the disabled person's adaptation grants scheme and a scheme, introduced under the plan for social housing, which can be used to extend or adapt private housing for a disabled occupier who, in their own right or as a member of the household, has been approved for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I mention these schemes to illustrate <Col N="1186" /> that there are many positive developments to improve the position of disabled people and enable them to live full lives, and also to show that this Government, like its predecessor, is aware of the problems of people with disabilities.  We accept that further action is needed and will consider this in a comprehensive way when the report of the Commission for the Status of People with Disabilities is available. This report is probably the most important and comprehensive one ever commissioned by Government to address this issue of disability.  It brings together the disabled to argue and present their case.  There is a commitment from Government that the report will be acted on.</P>
    <P>I understand and have already applauded the positive approach adopted by Deputy Wallace in preparing this Bill.  I will be happy to work with her and other Members in devising and legislating for the best possible package of measures in the electoral area to facilitate and assist people with disabilities.  The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs or, if it is too busy, a subcommittee, as was established to deal with the issues in the Waste Bill, 1995, should deal comprehensively with the issues which impact on those with disabilities and the vindication of their right to be full citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>I ask the House and, in particular Deputy Wallace and the Fianna Fáil Party, to approve the amendment to the motion which does not seek to kill off this Bill or is not a neat way around addressing the issues which the Deputy rightly brought before the House but which will allow a comprehensive examination not only of the specific provisions in the Bill but many other related matters that directly impact on accessibility to voting places for people with a variety of physical disabilities.  I ask for a common and cross party approach.  I assure Deputy Wallace that I will react with equal generosity if she accepts the Government amendment in <Col N="1187" /> my name and does not divide the House on this important issue.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister and I am a little disappointed by the tenor of his speech. Obviously he has a long consultative process in mind.  He may have some proposals which are not included in this Bill but if that is so, then I have two suggestions.  He should accept this Bill and table amendments on Committee Stage to include any proposals he believes are urgent.  If in the future other reforms are required, there is nothing to stop him introducing another Bill, presuming this Government is in power.  Our experience of these processes is that they are very drawn out.</P>
      <P>The Minister has difficulty with postal voting, which surprises me.  Once again the poor Constitution, which is blamed for every difficulty, is at fault.  It is the same Constitution which gave me the right as a graduate of a university to vote in Seanad elections.  All graduates use postal voting and it is accepted that the secrecy of the ballot is maintained in that system.  It is an insult to the Seanad and those elected by a system which is predominately postal voting to say the system of voting is inferior and open to widespread personation.  The percentage of the electorate eligible to vote under the postal system would be small, unlike the Seanad where every graduate uses that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have problems with polling booths, some of which could be avoided with forethought, although there is no easy answer to others.  It can be difficult to get buildings with suitable access facilities, particularly in rural areas.  My constituency is revising the polling scheme and we have a difficult choice to <Col N="1188" /> make.  One building has about 15 narrow steps and people with disabilities have had to be carried into it.  It is totally unsuitable not only for those in wheelchairs but for those who are old or infirm.  Our dilemma is that the next nearest public building is five or six miles away and some people would have to travel 12 to 15 miles to vote because of the peculiar geography of the hills in the area in which I live.  There is a problem of accessibility in terms of being reasonably near a polling station and the buildings themselves.  It is a coincidence that the public building I have in mind is a health centre.  It is important that all public buildings be made accessible, and that will not happen overnight. There will be difficulties, particularly in rural areas where there are school buildings, etc., which do not have good access.  For this reason the facility for people with a physical disability to vote is important.</P>
    <P>The proposal to facilitate people with a physical disability is very important and reasonable.  We are talking about a small number of people &mdash; on the latest figures about 3,000 people nationally. Even allowing for a doubling or trebling of that figure on implementing the Bill we are talking about only 9,000 people. It is a small number, but we are talking about a fundamental right for which the people of this country fought hard.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why they cannot be given a postal vote as proposed.  I would go further and say that two major difficulties arise regarding voting arrangements for disabled persons.  They have to get on the list in November and are then on the list for the year, but they may forget to make sure they are on the list or have become disabled or infirm over a relatively short time as a result of a stroke or other physical illness.  I cannot understand why the date for applying to go on the special list cannot be the same as that on which the special supplementary list is completed.</P>
    <P>In the western world we think we know all the answers.  However, as an observer at elections in the Ukraine a few years ago I was very impressed by <Col N="1189" /> certain things they did.  They had an interesting and quite simple alternative which would certainly be worth examining. On the day of the election they had two ballot boxes at the polling station, a big one and a small one, and four people presiding.  All a disabled person who could not make it to the polling station had to do was ring the polling station and the ballot box was brought to him.  This would be a good way of dealing with this problem in cities.  I know that it might not be acceptable in our situation to allow this on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, but it shows that with a little ingenuity many problems could be solved.  Also, people who would be away on the day of voting could vote a day early and polling station were specially manned 24 hours ahead to facilitate them.  We are not the only ones who think about these problems of accessibility. It would be worth our while to look at what other jurisdictions do and not confine that, as we have a habit of doing, to our nearest neighbours.</P>
    <P>I hope that between now and tomorrow the Government will think once again about allowing the Second Stage of this Bill to be agreed.  It is a vast improvement on the present situation.  I have no doubt the Government accepts in principle that this is a reasonable proposal, and it could be amended if a committee comes up with further ideas.</P>
    <P>Cinnte, tá ceist vótála tábhachtach don phobal.  Tá go leor athruithe tagtha ar nósanna na ndaoine maidir le cúrsaí vótála.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go dtuigfeadh gach duine go bhfuil ceart vótála acu.  Molaimse an Teachta Wallace as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála.  Tá cúram faoi leith á dhéanamh aici de dhaoine a bhfuil máchail orthu agus molaim í as an obair atá á déanamh aici.  Chuir sé iontas orm nuair a chuala mé an tAire ag rá go raibh fadhbanna ag baint le vótaí poist a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bhfuil máchail orthu.  Creidim nach raibh leithscéal fíor aige agus dáiríre creidim gurb é atá ar bun ag an Rialtas ná nach maith leo a admháil gur féidir le tada fónta teacht ón bhFreasúra.  Is bocht an scéal é sin <Col N="1190" /> agus is bocht an scéal é go bhfuil gach seans ann anois muna nglacfar leis an mBille seo go rithfear an chéad Olltoghchán eile faoin sean réimeas atá i bhfeidhm faoi láthair.  Chiallódh sé seo go mbeidh daoine nach mbeidh deis cheart vótála acu ag an toghchán sin. B'fhéidir gurb é an fhadhb atá ann ná go gcreideann páirtithe an Rialtais nach mórán vótaí a fhaigheann siad ó sheandaoine nó ó dhaoine a bhfuil máchail orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an Rialtas athmhacnamh air seo idir seo agus amárach agus go bhfeicfidís amárach gurb é an rud ceart daonna a dhéanamh ná glacadh leis an Dara Chéim den Bhille seo, leasuithe, má tá a leithéid acu, a chur ar aghaidh ar Chéim an Choiste agus an Bille a bheith achtaithe cinnte roimh an chéad toghchán eile.  Níl a fhios againn ar aon taobh den Teach an gearr nó fada uainn an lá sin.  Ach rud amháin dearfa, beidh toghchán ann roimh dheireadh 1997.</P>
    <P>Mar sin molaim an Bille seo agus molaim an Teachta a chuir faoi bhráid an Tí é.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, for bringing forward this timely and necessary legislation. Neither the Minister for the Environment nor his Minister of State needs any advice from me.  However, if I was the Minister's political and spiritual adviser I would advise him most strongly to change his mind and accept this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wallace and I will not fall out if I say that the Bill is not earth shattering or revolutionary and will not shake the State to its foundations.  It is minimalist legislation designed to deal with one irritant in the electoral system. It concerns one of the disadvantaged groups in society, namely, the disabled. Its purpose is to give the disabled the same opportunity to vote as everybody else in so far as it is possible to do that. It tries to put the disabled person in the same position as an able-bodied person from the point of view of ability to exercise the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> People are invariably disabled through no fault of their own, and it is a sad reflection on society that in 1996 we are allowing an avoidable obstacle to stand in the way of a disadvantaged group exercising the franchise in the fullest and freest way possible.  The barrier that unfortunately, stands in their way can be removed quite simply by the Government indicating its intention to accept this Bill.  The avoidable obstacle that stands in the way of the disabled and increases their disadvantage <i>vis-ávis</i> society as a whole can be removed virtually at a stroke.</P>
    <P>This Bill presents the Government with the opportunity to do just that.  It deals with two categories of disabled persons.  First, for those whose disability is such that they can go to the polling station to exercise their franchise it provides that, where possible, polling stations accessible to them should be provided by the local authority.  The Minister is given a role in this regard and that seems eminently logical.  Where a local authority does not provide a reasonably accessible polling station in circumstances where it could easily do so, the Minister can compel it to do so. That is logical and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The second category of persons with disability which the Bill deals with is those people whose disability is such that they are unable to travel outside their homes to vote.  As we are all aware, arrangements are in place for that category of disabled person, namely, the special voter system.  The Bill proposes to change that and institute the postal voting system in its place.  That proposition seems to be unarguable.</P>
    <P>The postal voting system, as the Minister will be aware, already exists for members of the Defence Forces, Garda, prison officers, etc.  It is available also to university graduates during Seanad elections.  It is discriminatory and indefensible that a facility which is extended to members of the security forces and university graduates voting in Seanad elections is not available to people who <Col N="1192" /> are so disabled they cannot leave their homes to vote.  Instead, those people have foisted on them this special voter system which is unnecessarily intrusive and oppressive.  I talk from personal experience because a number of my close friends are disabled.  I keep in touch with disability groups within my constituency and people have made representations to me on this matter.  I did not have time before tonight's debate to ask people for permission to use their names in the House but I am sure if I had been able to contact them they would have allowed me use their names. I can communicate the names to the Minister if he so wishes.  They told me that because of the nature of the special voter system they would not exercise their franchise.  They felt disenfranchised by the special voter system supposedly designed for their benefit.  I do not have the figures, but I am sure that system is much more costly than the postal voting system.  It is also a gross waste of Garda time.  We are all aware of the remorseless rise in the crime rate and Garda time could be better used than in supervising the implementation of the special voter system.</P>
    <P>It is eminently logical &mdash; and I have not heard any argument to the contrary &mdash; to extend the postal voting system to people whose disabilities are so severe they are unable or would not wish to leave their own homes to vote.  A working party constituted in 1983 recommended the extension of the postal voting system but, 13 years down the road, nothing has been done about it.  The barriers placed in the way of disabled people are removable and this Bill proposes to remove them.  I hope the Minister of State will communicate the message to the Minister, that to allow any avoidable obstacle which prevents people with a disability from voting casts a blight on our democracy and challenges our claim to describe ourselves as a Christian society.  The case for the Bill is so obvious that very compelling reasons would have to be advanced by the Minister for his refusal to accept it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> In his contribution the Minister did not outline any such compelling reasons.  It was larded with terminology such as &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;, &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo;, &ldquo;discussion&rdquo;, &ldquo;discourse&rdquo;, &ldquo;study&rdquo; and &ldquo;examination&rdquo;.  The Minister said he wants to have the views of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities before he does anything. Virtually in the next breath he said he needs the views of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs which he said will invite submissions from individuals and perhaps other committees and groups who will study, consider, parse and analyse the recommendations. Does the Minister seriously think the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs or any of the groups or individuals who will make recommendations to either or both of those committees will have a different view to that of Deputy Wallace when she proposed this Bill tonight? Does he think any of those committees, groups or individuals will say we should not provide reasonable access to polling stations for the disabled, that we should not facilitate the disabled in every way possible or that we should not remove the artificial barriers which prevent disabled people from exercising their franchise?</P>
    <P>I have to conclude that the pious platitudes we heard from the Minister were simply tawdry excuses for inaction. It is especially ironic that the Minister was sent in here tonight to put up these obstacles to the Bill because when he sat on this side of the House as his party's spokesperson on health he practically had the people of the country in floods of tears with the passion with which he expressed sympathy and concern for all disadvantaged groups in our society.  I must conclude from watching the Minister's performance not only tonight but since he came into Government that all those tears were crocodile tears and all the guff we heard from that side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Just before Christmas the Government accepted Fianna Fáil's Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995.  That is welcome because it dealt with a very important matter, but it certainly does not compare in importance to the right to a full, fair and free franchise for the disabled.  One must question why the Government, which put up these road blocks tonight, accepted that legislation with some alacrity.  It would have been politically incorrect to turn it down &mdash; it would not go down well with <i>The Irish Times</i> and its editorial writers.  The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill dealt with a sexy subject but, unfortunately, the disabled do not seem to have the same priority with this Government. When we were in Government we accepted legislation from Deputy Shatter to deal with commercial mortgages because we believed it was good legislation. Commercial mortgages are important but they do not equate in importance to the right to vote and the right to a full and free franchise for the disabled.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to change his stance and remind him that it will not be a blot on his record if he accepts this Bill.  We realise that the Government is busy and cannot deal with everything.  If an Opposition party identifies a niche problem, carries out the necessary research, brings forward the necessary legislation properly drafted to allow the Government solve a problem it may not get to in the ordinary course of events, the Government should accept that legislation.  It can be debated in committee and we would be open to Government amendments to improve it &mdash; the Government can insist on them because it has a majority in the relevant committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> If the Minister accepts this Bill, the disabled people who will have proper access to polling stations will not remember who introduced it.  The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill was the subject of a two part article in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently.  The leader article actually mentioned the names of the Bill's proposers, Deputies John O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan, so I assure the Minister that accepting a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill will not be a blot on his record.  It will be a blot on his record, however, if he marches his troops in here tomorrow afternoon to vote against the disabled.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister, and his colleagues, to act responsibly and change their minds on this matter.  It was enough for the Minister for Justice to marshal her troops, including Deputies from both left wing parties, to vote against minimalist rights for the victims of crime without repeating the performance.</P>

Deputy Hugh Byrne gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter as to the problems caused by recent flooding in the south east.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The heavy rainfall in the Suir Valley in conjunction with the east winds caused considerable damage in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and the area between the two towns.  Such problems arose occasionally but in the 12 months of one calendar year they occured on two occasions.  There was severe flooding on 10 March last year and again in January of this year.  People who had mopped up the water, repaired their homes, replaced carpets and furniture have had to repeat the exercise.  That is why it is an urgent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that South Tipperary County Council estimates it will cost £1.986 million to repair the damage and cover the cost of services involved in dealing with the flooding, such as the fire brigade and civil defence.  Roads have been severely damaged in the east of the county and this has caused widespread disruption in the Dragan, Mullinahone, Cloneen and Fethard area.  One bridge was washed away isolating 25 families on the side of Slieve na mBan. I am disappointed that the Minister said yesterday that no extra moneys would be given for road repairs except through discretionary grants.  If we do not get additional moneys our good record for road repairs will be lost.  The estimated damage in Carrick-on-Suir is £303,000 and £610,000 in Clonmel.  The estimated cost of repairing damaged roads throughout the county is £800,000.  The people of Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir have had to cope with extensive flooding twice in 12 months.  The vast majority of those living beside the river cannot get insurance cover because of the frequency of the flooding of their houses in the past ten years but even if they were to get cover the premium <Col N="1197" /> would be so high as to make it uneconomic. People who have worked hard all their lives to make their homes beautiful have had them destroyed.</P>
    <P>In America they have a devastation fund to deal with such disasters and we should have a similar system.  I appreciate that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, received a sympathetic hearing when he sought aid from Brussels but it will be three months before we receive any funding.  In the meantime people have to carry out repairs and pay for them.  I compliment the Rotary Club of Clonmel for giving £3,000 towards the mopping up costs.  I call on the financial institutions to co-operate and provide interest free loans when the Minister announces the level of grants to be given to flood victims.  This will enable people to repair their homes speedily.  That is the minimum contribution the financial institutions should make to the people of Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir. Let me stress to the Minister the urgency of providing funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Davern for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  We agree on the problem in the Suir basin which has affected Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and surrounding areas.  There is a need for a contingency fund and, having listened to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, I am sure he will add money from his Department to the funding from Brussels.  We need to address the root of the problem so that people can feel safe in their homes. People live in fear if there is continuous rain at night.  The Red Cross has built up an expertise in dealing with the traumatic effects of flood damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The River Anner needs to be surveyed as some of the changes in the course of it have caused damage to bridges and other properties.  The result of such a survey will cause many red faces in south Tipperary.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney for <Col N="1198" /> travelling to south Tipperary and walking the streets and visiting the properties that were flooded in Clonmel and Carrick.  Senator Byrne, the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Davern and I are all at one in trying to address this problem.</P>

      <P>For the first 23 days in January the rainfall in County Wexford was on average 295 per cent of normal rainfall and reached 375 per cent of normal rainfall in one day.  These storms had a detrimental effect on coastal areas and county roads and houses were flooded.  On Friday, 12 January, Deputy Hyland, MEP, Deputy Browne and I travelled from Arthurstown in south Wexford to Courtown in north Wexford and visited 11 locations to survey the destruction caused by the flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three aspects to the problem one of which is coastal erosion.  The Wexford coastline is of a sandy nature, is very soft and is therefore very vulnerable. In response to my question at last week's county council meeting I was told that global warming has caused tides to rise by five inches in the past six years.  Until now most people regarded global warming as a myth but it is not and we must bear it in mind.  It must be pointed out also that 7,000 acres in south County Wexford are below sea level and protected by a bank of earth and stones similar to the polder in Holland. That land is under great threat at all times.  Duncannon in south Wexford has been eroded over the years.  I understand the county council intends to put matters right and the Minister should ensure that those works proceed as a stitch in time saves nine.  Cullenstown seaside resort village is in danger of falling into the sea.  Remedial work is ready to commence and a foreshore licence is awaited.  I ask the Minister to put his <Col N="1199" /> shoulder to the wheel and ensure the licence is available so the work can progress. The bowling alley, toilets and houses at the western end of the resort are also in imminent danger of collapsing into the sea.</P>
    <P>Rosslare, where a scheme was partially put in place, is in urgent need of phase two work.  The county engineer has stated that if this work is not carried out soon, there will be an island at Rosslare.  The money is committed and I ask the Minister to ensure it is spent. Ballyconnigar, Curracloe and Cahore have lost substantial pieces of the shoreline and it is tragic to see a house hanging over a sand cliff into the sea.  The position in Courtown is frightening. Mature trees of inestimable age were uprooted and the local population is fearful.  The entire problem must be addressed with an immediate survey and subsequently, urgent action.</P>
    <P>King's Street, South Main Street, Skeffington Street, Redmond Road and Arthurstown were flooded and the Clonmel disaster was mirrored many times in those areas.  The situation in King's Street, which was raised by Deputy Liam Hyland in the European Parliament last week, was unbelievable. For example, a sitting room which was recently refurbished at a cost of £7,000 was destroyed.  Seventeen other houses in the immediate area were equally badly damaged and compensation must be paid to those house proud people.</P>
    <P>When this matter was raised with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, he said the houses were covered by insurance.  However, the people informed Deputy Browne, Deputy Hyland and me that they cannot get insurance for their houses.  The county roads in County Wexford, as elsewhere, also need urgent attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Byrne for sharing his time.  In common with the Deputy, I visited King's Street and South Main Street in Wexford last week and witnessed the damage caused to houses, businesses <Col N="1200" /> and property by widespread flooding in that area.  Old people and families were devastated and their houses destroyed. Furniture, carpets and wallpaper were severely damaged and the losses run into thousands of pounds.</P>
      <P>Most of the people affected are old age pensioners, the unemployed and working families.  They are not in a position financially to replace the items lost. I call on the Minister to make compensation available through the Department of Finance to householders and business people in Wexford town and the following areas in particular: King's Street, South Main Street, Crescent Quay, Commercial Quay, Paul Quay, Common Quay, Monk Street, Skeffington Street and Redmond Square.</P>
      <P>It is said that insurance will cover the costs but people in the King's Street and South Main Street areas are unable to get insurance because the streets have been flooded so frequently in the past. Insurance companies do not want to know about these houses.  As a result, people are continually living in fear when flooding occurs in this part of town.</P>
      <P>There are three Ministers in County Wexford.  I congratulate Deputies Davern and Ferris and other Deputies from Tipperary who came together and made a strong case for the area.  However, the three Ministers in County Wexford are lagging behind in terms of seeking support for the county.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, should visit King's Street and South Main Street to witness the consequences of the damage caused by flooding there.  I call on the two Ministers at the Cabinet table, Deputies Howlin and Yates, to fight a battle on behalf of the people in County Wexford to ensure they receive adequate compensation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for generously sharing his time.  It was traumatic to visit the homes of flood victims in south Tipperary and witness the human misery.  In addition, we must not lose sight of the huge financial losses experienced by business people who <Col N="1201" /> were forced to keep their premises closed as a result of the flooding.</P>
      <P>Two issues arise, compensation and investigating why south Tipperary experienced such exceptional flooding. No comparable flooding has occurred for decades.  I am extremely grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, who showed exceptional solidarity with and compassion for the people who suffered. He presented an excellent case in Brussels which today resulted in the Commission supporting the application for compensation.</P>
      <P>I call for an independent inquiry into the exceptional flooding in south Tipperary, otherwise Deputies will be forced to raise this issue again in six or 12 months after another downpour and seek compensation.  People want confidence that, after they restore and redecorate their houses, they will not find them flooded again in the near future.  I am assured the Government will examine this matter with due consideration for the people affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney.  I have listened with great interest to what the Deputies have said about the problems caused by the recent flooding in the south east.  The picture they describe is very familiar to me and I am sure to people in many parts of the south and south east which experienced adverse weather conditions recently.</P>
      <P>These conditions comprised exceptionally heavy and prolonged rainfall over the period from approximately 29 December 1995 to 14 January 1996.  This led to high, and in some areas unprecedented, water levels in rivers which, combined with high winds and raised tide levels due to a severe low pressure system centred in the area, caused flooding and damage in a number of locations.  I pay tribute to the work of the various local services in responding to the flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate responsibility to take <Col N="1202" /> steps to try to prevent or limit the flooding and, where that proves to be impossible, to deal with the effects of flooding, falls primarily on local authorities.  They have the local organisation and personnel to deal with such situations in the most effective way, assisted where necessary by other agencies.</P>
    <P>There is a major emergency plan for each local authority area which defines the role of the local authorities, the Garda and health boards in the event of major emergencies.  While the major emergency plan does not normally need to be activated in the case of flooding incidents, its provisions generally guide the activities of the various agencies and ensure an orderly and effective response.</P>
    <P>The local authority staff, local Garda, fire services and Civil Defence personnel all responded magnificently to the emergency, as did many private individuals who willingly came to the assistance of their neighbours.  On behalf of the Government, I express appreciation of the efforts of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, has been aware both in general and specific terms from reports received from around the affected areas of the extent of the hardship caused to families by the flooding of homes throughout the south and south east, including County Wexford where, I understand, a substantial number of houses suffered flooding and from personal experience following his visits to Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary last week.  These two areas were particularly badly affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is also aware from preliminary reports, provided at his request by the local authorities to the Department of the Environment, of the nature and extent of the flooding and the resultant hardship in Counties Cork, Kilkenny and Waterford.  The Government is likewise conscious of the traumatising effect such flooding can <Col N="1203" /> have on individuals, particularly the elderly, and cannot but sympathise with the plight of the flood victims.</P>
    <P>While the Government cannot accept the principle that it has an obligation to meet requests for payment in full for losses, it recognises that individuals may require assistance from time to time to get them over very adverse situations and acknowledges their need to be treated on a humanitarian basis, particularly where they are under insured and in poor financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, brought the problem of the serious hardship caused in parts of Ireland due to the exceptional flooding to the attention of the EU by means of a submission.  This included a folder of press cuttings and photographs from national and local newspapers and video footage from RTE which gave a clear indication of the extent of the disaster and the resulting hardship.  Incidentally, this contained specific references to the flooding and other damage in the Wexford and south Tipperary areas.  This was followed up by a personal visit by the Minister and officials of the Office of Public Works to Brussels where they met Mr. David Williamson, Secretary General of the EU Commission on Monday, 22 January.  I am pleased to say that Mr. Williamson responded to the Minister's request and indicated he would propose to the Commission that aid be provided to Ireland and Portugal, which also suffered severe flooding.  I understand that this proposal was put to and approved by the Commission today. A request will now be made to the EU Council and Parliament to provide the necessary funding, which was not previously provided in the 1996 EU budget. This will involve a transfer of funds from other allocations and it is a matter on which the Parliament must decide. This process, I am advised, is likely to take between 40 and 60 days.</P>
    <P>Consideration will be given to further <Col N="1204" /> humanitarian assistance from the Exchequer in the light of any provision provided from the European Union. However, it must be emphasised that any assistance from the Exchequer will necessarily be limited and the cost will have to be met from existing budget provisions.  It is customary when the EU provides humanitarian assistance in such circumstances that the funds are channelled through the national Red Cross Society of the member state, in this case the Irish Red Cross Society. The Irish Red Cross Society, which has considerable professional experience in dealing compassionately, impartially and effectively with the disbursement of such humanitarian funds, fully supports the Government's application to the EU Commission for humanitarian assistance and stands ready to administer any funds which might be made available from EU or Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, as it may be some time yet before any funds might come on stream, the Irish Red Cross Society, with whom we have been in contact, advises that householders and others who have suffered damage as a result of flooding and intend to submit applications for humanitarian assistance, should ensure that they have sufficient evidence, photographic or otherwise, and adequate records of damages, cost estimates, etc., for examination by the society.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the strong and united support of all Oireachtas Members, particularly from Tipperary South and Wexford, as well as the assistance of our MEPs in Brussels in furthering our case for humanitarian aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this issue.  Louth County Hospital has been the subject of much political abuse over many decades. I say that with some trepidation as I do not wish to imply that Deputy McGahon was party to it but since we were in Government it has been used as a political football.  I do not raise this matter as a political issue and do not believe a local hospital should be the subject of political advantage.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister is well aware that over the last while there has been a surreptitious attempt by certain interests to denigrate Louth County Hospital and a number of other hospitals of similar status.  There have been media reports on this and other hospitals.  Last September there was a report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> about which I wrote to the Minister.  It more or less stated that Louth County Hospital and a number of other hospitals were targeted for closure.  The hospital has put up with such reports for a number of years.  The Minister wrote to me on 2 November and reported that he had no proposal to downgrade or close any hospital, including Louth County Hospital.  He stated he had approved a £1 million capital development programme to facilitate improvements on which I compliment him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is going on and why do these reports continue to circulate?  I can only surmise that some vested interests want to close the hospitals.  I ask the Minister to get to the bottom of these media reports.  I have no doubt he will state he has no plans to close any of these hospitals.  Perhaps at some time in the future he will be able to say why these <Col N="1206" /> reports are made as they affect staff morale and the patients.</P>
    <P>People in the area with an interest in retaining the hospital came together and formed a committee with the aim of collecting £250,000 towards equipment for the hospital.  The health board, very kindly and properly, stated would match the contribution pound for pound.  In a relatively short time the committee collected in the region of £330,000 and I compliment the health board on matching that amount.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister find out why these reports are circulated and nail them once and for all?  He should stand up to vested interests and those who say there is something wrong with the hospitals. There is room for improvement in every hospital.  The Minister should look at what Louth County Hospital has to offer to Louth and Dundalk.  It has a catchment population of 50,000.  Previous Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Ministers have confirmed that the hospital will not close, I ask the Minister to do the same tonight and get to the bottom of these reports.  He should contact those who circulate the reports and ask them on what grounds they make these unfounded allegations.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Ahern for the manner in which he has raised this issue.  It is clear he does not believe the report that Louth County Hospital will close but is right to seek clarification on the matter in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a number of queries from Deputies arising from a newspaper article written before Christmas by a journalist, John Moore, who stated that hospitals around the country would close.  There is no basis for that report. It came out of the blue and I do not know why it was written.  Various quotations were attributed to me and while they were accurate they were taken from speeches and replies to parliamentary questions which I made in November and December but were <Col N="1207" /> presented in such a way as to suggest I had spoken to the journalist.  I do not know why people write such things.  The only kind remark I can make is that it might be motivated by a desire to qualify for the tax free status given to some artists.  I understand one does not get it for writing fact but fiction.  That is the only explanation I have for it.</P>
    <P>As regards the basis for the reports, the one made in September emanated from a submission by the Irish Hospital Consultants to the Buckley Commission. Deputies will recall that the Gleeson Commission reviewed our pay and conditions and those of higher public servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Buckley Commission replaced the Gleeson Commission.  In its submission the IHCA stated, according to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Friday 15 September, that the hospitals had not been properly funded over the years and in some cases the work rotas in place in areas such as surgery, obstetrics and anaesthetics were not as safe as they should be.  This submission was made in support of a pay claim.  That is what generated the publicity.</P>
      <P>While I am Minister for Health I will not close or downgrade any hospital.  I am making investments in many of the hospitals mentioned on the list and want to integrate them fully with the delivery of services in their areas.  I hope that at the end of my period of office they will be sufficiently integrated that none of my successors will close them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about a number of hospitals which I will list, otherwise we will have to deal with this matter on the Adjournment night after night and give assurances about hospitals around the country.  They include Louth County Hospital, Dundalk; Our Lady's Hospital, Navan; St. Joseph's Hospital, Nenagh; Mallow General Hospital; St. <Col N="1208" /> Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire; Naas General Hospital; St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel; Hume Street Hospital; Monaghan General Hospital; Portlaoise General Hospital; Ennis General Hospital; Roscommon General Hospital; St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown; Bantry General Hospital; Cashel General Hospital and The Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin.  I made heavy investments in the case of at least one-third of those hospitals, and probably half of them.  A 20 year aggravation in the Ceann Comhairle's town of Clonmel has been resolved and rather than close the hospital there a package costing £12.5 million is planned for Clonmel and Cashel.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas a know-all who seems to write at will stated that these hospitals would be closed.  I am aware of local concerns in that regard, but there was no truth in that report.  As far back as 1993 the North-Eastern Health Board adopted a report, A New Direction For Acute Hospital Services, which effectively ruled out the closure of any of the board's four acute hospitals.  It called for new arrangements to ensure that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda became an integral part of the region's network.  The report's clear recommendation was that the hospitals in the area would no longer act as individual units but would become component parts of the regional service.  To achieve this the board established two hospital groupings, the Cavan-Monaghan group and the Louth-Meath group, of which Louth County Hospital forms part.  Within that group there is a unique partnership between the voluntary and public hospital sectors which work together to provide a comprehensive service for the 200,000 people of Louth and Meath.</P>
    <P>As evidence of my commitment to the board's strategy for the development of acute hospital services within its region, substantial funding has been made <Col N="1209" /> available in the past two years for the two hospital groups.  Development funding provided in 1995 for the Louth-Meath group was aimed specifically at developments in anaesthetics, paediatrics, neonatology and geriatric services. During that year I approved six consultant posts for these specialties and understand they will be in place shortly. I approved a £1 million capital development grant for Louth County Hospital which I announced during a visit to the hospital in August 1995.  That sum is aimed at providing the necessary infrastructural support for the new consultant posts.  That substantial capital investment will facilitate the hospital to continue to play a pivotal role within the region and is further evidence of my commitment to that aim.</P>
    <P>The report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> before Christmas was fiction.  There was no basis for it either in the Department of Health or at health board level.  I have received much correspondence from Deputies asking me to meet hospital action committees although we have enough real issues about which to be concerned.  To have to be concerned about the creative writing of a journalist is very unfortunate.  The hospitals involved are valued by the people but such an article in a newspaper constitutes a threat to them.  I give a categoric assurance that there is no basis for the report and there will be no downgrading or closures of any of the hospitals mentioned or any other hospital.</P>

      <P>I will take note of your comments.  I thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  It is very important to put on the record that I do not criticise any agency appointed in the divorce campaign.  There are, however, serious questions to be answered about the awarding of a public contract and the allocation of public moneys.  I hope the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will give satisfactory answers to the questions I put to him tonight.</P>
      <P>On 30 May and 4 July last year the Minister informed the Dáil that he had not appointed an advertising agency for the divorce campaign.  In reply to questions put to him on 4 July he said &ldquo;details would be announced shortly when the process of selection is completed&rdquo;. On 30 July a spokesperson for the Minister denied a <i>Sunday Business Post</i> report that the agency QMP had been awarded the contract.  Mr. Joe Carroll of <i>The Irish Times</i> on 31 July reported that a spokesperson admitted that QMP were in the running for the contract which was worth about £400,000 and that Deputy Taylor could be expected to make a decision on his return from holidays the next day.</P>
      <P>On 2 August 1995 Government sources informed <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Cabinet sub-committee on divorce was not expected to meet during August and a decision on whether QMP or McConnell's advertising agency should secure the contract would not be made until the Ministers next met.  It is evident from a letter, recently published in the press, from Mr. Conor Quinn of QMP to Mr. Fergus Finlay, that the QMP agency had been told that it had secured the advertising contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A letter to the Government adviser stated that an agency had secured the advertising contract for the divorce campaign on behalf of the Government on or before 4 May 1995. Why was that appointment continuously denied by the Minister and Government sources?  That question must be answered. When did the all-party Cabinet sub-committee agree to give the contract to the QMP agency?  When were Fine Gael and Democratic Left made aware of the appointment?  Why was it not until 13 September 1995 that an official Government announcement was made?  How was the decision communicated to the agency?  Why did the Minister's party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, renege on his promise of last week to issue a statement on the matter? Why was an unelected official sent out to bat on this issue rather than a member of Government who should have accepted responsibility and answered the legitimate questions raised? Where is Government accountability in that?  Why did the Minister deny to me and my party leader that polls had been conducted during the course of the campaign when it subsequently emerged that such polls were conducted?  If the Minister knew the advertising contract had been awarded by 4 May 1995 why did he subsequently mislead the Dáil?  If he did not know the agency had been awarded the contract, why did he not <Col N="1212" /> know?  Perhaps the Minister will address those questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I gave a comprehensive and detailed reply to written questions on the subject matter of the motion before the House.  It is a condition precedent to the making of Government contracts that prior approval is given for them by the Government Contracts Committee.  The date of that committee's approval of the award of the Government's advertising contract in relation to the divorce referendum was 11 September 1995.  The public announcement and the announcement to QMP about the appointment was made on publication of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill two days later on 13 September 1995.</P>
      <P>To enable me to evaluate submissions from six advertising agencies which had been invited by the Government Information Service to tender for the contract in December 1993, I appointed a special committee to make recommendations to me on the matter.  The committee comprised the following: John Foley, GIS; Kate O'Toole, GIS; Fergus Finlay, then Programme Manager, Department of Foreign Affairs; Paul Mulhern, then Programme Manager, Department of Equality and Law Reform and Tom Lynch, Principal Officer, Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures in relation to the award of the QMP contract involved the establishment of that special committee; the making by the committee of recommendations; the submission, under my approval, of that recommendation to the Government Contracts Committee; the approval of the contracts committee; and sanction by the Department of Finance for the expenditure involved in the contract.  The Government Contracts Committee is a standing committee of <Col N="1213" /> civil servants from Departments concerned on an ongoing basis with Government contracts.</P>
    <P>The letter of 16 May 1995 from Conor Quinn to Fergus Finlay was private and confidential.  It first came to public notice in proceedings before the High Court on 11 January 1996 concerning the challenge to the outcome of the divorce referendum.  The letter forms part of a huge number of documents before the court as part of the discovery process in the case.  It was supplied to my Department by QMP as part of the High Court order for discovery of documents and supplied by my Department to the court.  I was not, and other members of the Government were not, aware of any such letter until it was read out in court.</P>
    <P>The letter suggested that the identities of the owners of QMP be buried in a press release.  I wish to make clear that I or any other member of Government would not agree with any such suggestion. The public record shows that suggestion was not followed.</P>
    <P>It was always my intention to state publicly the identity of those who got the divorce referendum advertising contract. Newspapers prominently reported on 14 September 1995 my announcement that the contract was awarded to QMP &mdash; and also that Conor Quinn was a brother of the Minister for Finance. The formal contract detailing heads of expenditure, as approved by the Department of Finance, was made with QMP on 20 October 1995.</P>
    <P>All six companies which had been invited by the GIS to tender for the divorce referendum contract made submissions in reply to the invitation.  On 4 May 1994 I was informed by the committee that the process of selection had been completed and the committee had agreed to recommend one agency.  That agency was QMP.  The decision of the committee was unanimous.  However, a very long period ensued between May 1994 and July 1995 during which there was a challenge in the High Court and <Col N="1214" /> the Supreme Court to the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The possibility of holding the referendum began to grow stronger by mid-1995 and I briefed members of a Cabinet sub-committee on divorce on the advertising aspects.  It was in that context that two companies, QMP and McConnells, were asked to make presentations in June 1995.  My colleagues in the Cabinet sub-committee were satisfied with the recommendations of the special committee. The Minister for Finance was not present at those presentations or any discussions about them.</P>
    <P>In his letter of 16 May 1995 to Fergus Finlay, Conor Quinn appears to assume his company had the contract.  There was no basis for that assumption because the contract had yet to be awarded under the contract procedures in operation in my Department and the Government Information Service. When QMP made its further presentation to the Cabinet sub-committee in June 1995, it did so in the knowledge that it had not been awarded any contract, and no one had entered into any commitment to it.  On the other hand, in the course of discussions with the special committee Conor Quinn would have clearly understood that his company was perceived by the committee to have made the strongest presentation. He was aware of the sensitivity about any such appointment, given that he was a brother of the Minister for Finance. Considerable interest in the referendum was current in the media about that time, among members of the public, interest groups and political parties.  My understanding is that Fergus Finlay, anticipating possible criticism of any appointment of QMP, discussed the matter with Conor Quinn on 2 May 1995 so that the issue could be addressed fairly in his company's interest and the public interest.  Fergus Finlay's discussions with Conor Quinn were based on Mr. Finlay's assumption, <Col N="1215" /> made in good faith, that QMP was likely to be awarded the contract in due course and his concern lest the known family connection be subject to misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>I did not misinform the Dáil on 30 May and 4 July 1995 about the position in relation to the advertising contract. The information I gave was consistent with the facts because since the Government Contracts Committee had yet to approve the award of the advertising contract it was the clear position that no company had been engaged as of those dates.  That approval of the Government <Col N="1216" /> Contracts Committee which was given on 11 September 1995 would have become known by my Cabinet sub-committee colleagues by the time of the public announcement of the appointment on 13 September 1995.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the circumstances surrounding the appointment of QMP, I am satisfied the tendering process leading to its appointment was properly conducted, and those involved in recommending the appointment acted entirely honestly and properly throughout.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 January 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments relating to trade missions made by Mackies chief executive, at the recent IMI conference in Belfast.  He quoted, as an example of complementarity, the Irish engineering sector where, in the North, the expertise tends to be in the heavy engineering segment whereas, in the South, it is mainly in light engineering. I agree with the broad thrust of what he said i.e. that there can be benefits for Northern and Southern companies where missions are organised on a joint basis.</P>
      <P>While the organisation of such missions is, in the South, the day to day responsibility of An Bord Tráchtála, I know that ABT is very mindful of the benefits of the joint approach, as are its counterparts in the North, the Industrial Development Board.  Indeed, their longstanding co-operation is driven by the pragmatic belief that there are many occasions when companies from all over the island can make more market impact more cost effectively through cooperative action.  This co-operation is guided by some basic principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is that initiatives are undertaken only where there are sound business or commercial reasons for doing so, based on clear industry support for each initiative.  A second principle is to avoid activities which could have the effect of displacing existing Irish suppliers or contractors from the North or the South, but to promote activities that might help to achieve incremental sales in overseas markets.  Finally, care is <Col N="1047" /> taken not to duplicate initiatives undertaken or planned by other groups such as CBI/IBEC and the Chambers of Commerce.  Within these principles it has been possible for companies from Northern Ireland (including Mackies) to join trade missions from the Republic of Ireland and for companies from the Republic to participate in missions organised by the IDB.</P>
    <P>I am confident that ABT, with the co-operation of many representative bodies, will continue to build on the positive working relationships which they have established with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, to guarantee increased trade and better economic climate throughout the whole island, North and South.</P>

      <P>The Bord Fáilte strategy in Japan is to encourage Japanese tour operators to feature Ireland in their programmes either as part of a Britain and Ireland tour or as an Ireland only tour.  Awareness in the market also includes participation at travel trade seminars, trade advertising, media seminars, media visits to Ireland and direct consumer advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall the results to date have been very impressive with Japanese visitors to Ireland increasing from 18,000 in 1993 to an estimated 28,000 in 1995, representing an increase of 56 per cent. Japanese tourists are becoming increasingly open to exploring new destinations <Col N="1049" /> and while our current share of the Japanese market is small, I have no doubt that there is great potential for further significant growth.</P>

      <P>The good working relationships already established between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have their most practical marketing manifestation in the 1996 Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative.</P>
      <P>This year's initiative involves some £6.5 million expenditure on advertising campaigns in our four major markets, the US, Britain, France and Germany, promoting the island of Ireland as a holiday destination.  Both tourist boards will be involved in managing and overseeing the implementation of the campaign.  The NITB are also represented on a steering committee recently established to oversee work on the development of a brand image for Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>All island promotional stands have been taken at a number of major trade and consumer shows around the world. Both Baroness Denton and I will be speaking at a joint tourism promotion in London on 15 February next.</P>
      <P>The Joint INTERREG Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland, 1994-99, and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland, 1995-99, will also provide additional new opportunities for marketing areas eligible for assistance under each programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> As these various activities suggest, the peace has enabled North-South co-operation in the area of tourism to develop at a significant pace and as new areas of common interest are identified, I will ensure that there will be no lack of willingness on our part to participate in further joint marketing activities.</P>

      <P>The ambitious growth targets set by the Government for the tourism sector are strategic and take into account the value of our environment to tourism and the consequent need to protect it.  The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 acknowledges that a balance must be struck between tourism development and preservation of the environment.  Capital projects recommended for assistance under this programme are required to comply with all environmental regulatory requirements as a condition for grant approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme also aims to secure a good geographical and, in particular, seasonal spread of tourism.  Some 18 designated heritage towns are scheduled for European Regional Development Fund support under the present programme. The objective is to encourage investment which will facilitate enhancement of the physical environment while assisting the preservation of the historical, architectural and mercantile heritage of the towns in a manner of interest to both the domestic and foreign visitor.  Meanwhile, support for <Col N="1051" /> overseas marketing under the programme is weighted towards projects that aim to extend the season.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment is represented on the National Monitoring Committee, responsible for ensuring the smooth implementation of the programme, while my own Department is also represented on the Green Network of Government Departments, chaired by the Department of the Environment, set up specifically to deal with environmental issues of a cross-sectoral nature.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister for the Environment is now responsible for the annual Tidy Towns Competition, which over the years has played a vital role in enhancing our towns and villages while, at the same time, helping to promote tourism in the locality.  I understand that my colleague is at present reviewing the competition and has invited submissions from Tidy Towns committees throughout the country to assist in this process. This review should enhance the role that the Tidy Towns committees can play in environmental protection.</P>

      <P>The peace process has already given a significant impetus to the Irish tourism performance.  While the final figures for 1995 are not yet available for the CSO, Bord Fáilte has estimated that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors increased by some 16 per cent to over £1.3 billion with visitor numbers in the region of 4.2 million. The tourism industry should continue to benefit from the peace dividend in 1996 with the recent visit of President Clinton <Col N="1052" /> providing very positive worldwide publicity for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The industry-led Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative (OTMI) will be continued on an all-island basis in 1996 with the active involvement of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  Bord Fáilte will also continue to work closely with the tourism industry in 1996 on the development of the new tourism brand which will have fundamental implications for the positioning and image of Ireland overseas.  In addition, the Border regions, which suffered particularly from the effects of violence in Northern Ireland, will continue to receive special attention under the Tourism Measure of the EU-funded Joint Interreg Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland 1994-1999 and the Tourism Programme of the International Fund for Ireland.  Tourism-related projects will also be eligible for assistance under a number of measures in the EU-supported Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 1995-1999.</P>
      <P>The latest figures available from the CSO are for July 1995 and show that, since the ceasefire, trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic has increased significantly.  The total value of trade for that period was £1,227 million compared to £1,090 million for the same period in 1993-1994.  This represents a 12.5 per cent increase.</P>
      <P>I expect that the volume of trade will continue to increase significantly this year.  An Bord Tráchtála estimate that 75 new companies entered the Northern Ireland Market in 1995 and that Northern Ireland is now the fifth biggest market for indigenous exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the statutory responsibility of An Bord Tráchtála to initiate specific actions in co-operation with exporters to identify new market opportunities. However, I am aware that, to capitalise on the peace process, ABT have developed many exciting new initiatives, designed to assist companies throughout the island to take advantage of the new opportunities which are emerging on <Col N="1053" /> both sides of the Border since the cessation of violence.  These initiatives include workshops, conferences and numerous publications aimed at encouraging companies which have neglected the market in the past to explore and develop its potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>Over the lifetime of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, the Government aims to contribute to improving the quality of service in the Irish tourism product by the provision of high quality training programmes across all sectors of the tourism industry. CERT has primary responsibility for programme delivery and will work in close co-operation with the Department of Education in pursuit of higher education and training standards for the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that a total of £110 million will be invested in tourism training in the six year period to 1999, of which the European Social Fund will contribute £82 million.  CERT expects to train over 72,000 people &mdash; almost double the number trained under the last Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On-the-job&rdquo; training is catered for under the continuing training measure. The aim of programmes under this measure is to improve the skills levels of those already employed in tourism. <Col N="1054" /> Over the lifetime of the operational programme, it is planned to train over 36,000 tourism industry personnel on a wide variety of programmes such as: flexible short-term programmes including in-company training and business and technical advisory projects; customised training programmes for management teams; training of trainer programmes, to provide for in-house training by senior industry staff.</P>
    <P>Also included is a new scheme to promote systematic training within companies, through assistance towards the cost of employee training in key areas not currently covered by CERT or the Department of Education.  This Industry Training Support Scheme which is managed by CERT, provides grant assistance of up to 50 per cent of direct costs for skills training.  In 1995, 78 programmes were approved for funding under this scheme and funding is available for the training of over 1,000 individuals in 1996.</P>
    <P>In a separate but related development CERT has formed a recruitment committee in conjunction with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurant Association of Ireland.  The objective is to encourage operators to increase promotion of careers in the hospitality industry and market them as a viable option for school-leavers.  In 1995 the committee launched a pilot promotional scheme aimed at second level students in the mid-west.  The scheme was well received by schools and industry alike, and it is planned to extend this promotional scheme nationwide during 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office publishes figures for visits abroad by Irish residents but does not produce comparable figures for domestic trips. However, limited surveys by Bord Fáilte indicate that in recent years expenditure on holiday trips abroad has grown at a faster rate than domestic holiday trips. The reasons underlying this trend are many and varied and range from the general disposition of people worldwide to travel more, which of course benefits us in terms of incoming tourists, to factors such as the weather in recent summers, excluding 1995, and increased capacity on cross-channel air and sea routes which has resulted in reduced fares.</P>
      <P>Domestic tourism, however, remains a very important part of the overal sector and Bord Fáilte estimates that it contributed £680 million to the economy in 1994.</P>
      <P>The report of the Marketing Sub-Committee of the Tourism Council was presented to the Council, which I chaired, on 28 September 1995.  The report outlined the importance in economic terms of domestic tourism, the increased level of competition especially in the short break sector and the market opportunities which are emerging.  It suggested that a new and reorganised approach to support growth in the domestic market was opportune and put forward a number of suggestions for new marketing initiatives.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department is at present considering the suggestions and proposals made in the report and he will take action as appropriate, in particular as regards greater co-ordination and more effective use of the existing efforts in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> I should stress, however, that it is envisaged that the industry will continue to carry primary responsibility for the marketing of holidays on the domestic market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main priorities of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, which will involve investment of approximately £652 million in Irish tourism, is the concentration of a significant proportion of tourism growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods, with the specific target that by 1999, 75 per cent of visitors will arrive outside the peak July-August months.</P>
      <P>As well as encouraging investment in the development of tourist products suitable for year round business such as, for example, tourist angling, the operational programme envisages that marketing will be a key instrument in securing the required shift of traffic away from the peak period.</P>
      <P>The marketing sub-committee of the operational programme envisages a total spend on marketing activities of £125 million over the six years of the programme and priority within the marketing sub-programme is given to supporting marketing programmes aimed at off-peak and shoulder periods.</P>
      <P>The promotion of holidays in Ireland in the off-peak is also an integral part of the overseas tourism marketing initiative, a consumer advertising campaign involving expenditure in excess of £12 million in 1995 and 1996, aimed at our four main markets, the US, Britain, Germany and France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the winter tourism has benefited from the substantial investment which has taken place to date under the operational programme <Col N="1057" /> and the overseas tourism marketing initiative, as well as from the allocation of £1.3 million in Exchequer moneys towards special spring and autumn seasonality marketing campaigns in 1994.</P>
    <P>The concentration of tourist traffic in the peak July-August period has fallen from 34 per cent in the mid-80s to 29 per cent in 1994.  I look forward to further progress in the coming years in line with the targets for seasonality set out in the operational programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>One of the major changes arising from the Arthur D. Little consultancy review of Bord Fáilte was the decision to subcontract to a commercial third party, certain of the board's inspection and associated functions in relation to the registration and grading of tourist accommodation and the certification of restaurants under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an open publicly advertised tendering procedure conducted in accordance with EU rules, Tourism <Col N="1059" /> Quality Services Ltd, was selected to undertake the functions being subcontracted. A contract for a period of five years has now been signed between Bord Fáilte and Tourism Quality Services (Ireland) Ltd., an Irish subsidiary which has been established to carry out the work.  The company, which is based in Dublin, has recruited locally.</P>
    <P>Tourism Quality Services (Ireland) Ltd. will undertake inspections and related functions in relation to the registration and grading-classification of hotels, guesthouses, caravan and camping sites, holiday cottages and holiday apartments (group schemes above eight units only), and the registration of holiday hostels, youth hostels and holiday camps.  In addition, the company will issue certificates to restaurants applying for liquor licences under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, Bord Fáilte will continue to retain ownership of the registration and grading standards, which means it will continue to set the criteria for registration and grading and to prescribe the various fees involved by regulation made, with the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939-1995.  Bord Fáilte will also continue to retain responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the appeals mechanism provided for under the Acts, when applications for registration and renewal of registration are refused and in the case of cancellation of registration.  They will be involved too in the final stages of the apeals mechanism for grading of accommodation. Bord Fáilte will also monitor the performance of the contractor.  All other aspects of the inspection process will, in future, be undertaken by the third party.</P>
    <P>I am acutely conscious of the importance of maintaining high quality standards for tourist accommodation.  Providing a product of the highest quality is a fundamental objective of Government policy for the development of the tourism sector.  I assure the House that there <Col N="1060" /> is no reason to believe that the changes which have now taken place will adversely affect standards.  The key roles being retained by Bord Fáilte in the registration, grading and certification process will be critical in ensuring that it maintains tight control on the standards and procedures to be used while being relieved of the more routine physical inspection procedures.</P>

      <P>The marketing priorities for Irish tourism, as set out in the Operational Programme for Tourism are: to improve seasonality; to expand sea and air access routes; to develop new markets; to develop product and niche markets; and to attract more high yield business.</P>
      <P>The renewed mandate for Bord Fáilte, in line with the Arthur D. Little consultancy review, has been confirmed as international marketing and the organisation will be refocusing its resources on this key task while divesting itself of other non-core functions. The new structure reflects a concentration on three core priorities of selling and promoting Ireland overseas, helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop its marketing and product development capabilities and providing information for enhanced decision making by marketeers, investors and managers in the industry as well as Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new mission statement has been agreed for Bord Fáilte and a new organisational structure is being finalised.  An international marketing director with a proven track record in private industry now heads up the international marketing division and a new general manager for Europe has been appointed.  Bord Fáilte is currently recruiting a small <Col N="1061" /> number of marketing executives and graduates to work in the development of overseas markets.</P>
    <P>The overseas tourism marketing initiative represents the most significant component of consumer advertising of Irish tourism and will in 1996, for the second successive year, undertake marketing campaigns in Britain, France, Germany and the United States.  The experience of the 1995 campaign will be used to further improve the process, which involves public and private sector partnerships, in 1996.</P>
    <P>For the longer term, the work which is currently ongoing in Bord Fáilte on the development of the destination brand for Irish tourism, will help to position Ireland as a unique high quality destination.  I am satisfied that the marketing strategies currently being implemented have contributed to the most successful period ever for Irish tourism but marketing strategies must continually evolve in response to market demands.  They must seek to achieve the maximum synergy between all potential partners who have an interest in marketing Ireland as a destination.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, publicly-funded programmes to promote national products above those of other EU countries are contrary to the Treaty of the European Union. Instead, we must concentrate on maximising the selling opportunities for Irish industry in the domestic market. When these are created, the products stand or fall on the normal market criteria such as price and quality.  Towards this end, ABT is involved in a variety of initiatives including <i>Meet the Buyer</i> events, the <i>Look to Our Own</i> campaign and the <i>Market Opportunities in Ireland</i> series of trade publications.</P>

      <P>The quality and timeliness of the external trade statistics are high priorities for the Central Statistics Office, whose objective is to ensure that the results are as accurate and as timely as possible.  As expected, the timeliness of trade statistics deteriorated in all EU member states in 1993.  When the Single Market was completed in January 1993, Customs declarations were no longer required for the movements of goods within the EU.  Since these declarations were the source of the intra-EU trade statistics, a new system was needed to collect the data.  This new survey system called Intrastat, was introduced in all EU countries in January 1993.  It involves the monthly collection of statistical returns from about 8,000 of the largest traders.  The Intrastat survey is conducted by the Revenue Commissioners, while estimation, data analysis and publication is the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office.  Trade with Non-EU countries continues to be based on Customs documents.</P>
      <P>Before 1993, trade statistics were far more timely than most other economic statistics because traders had to complete Customs documentation in order to ensure the speedy movement of goods.  The Intrastat data collection system has lost this advantage, and is subject to the non-response and timeliness difficulties that are common to all direct statistical inquiries.</P>
      <P>Steady progress has, however, been made in improving timeliness over the past two years.  The most recent total trade release, for July 1995, was published in December with a timelag of 20 weeks.  The corresponding timelag for July 1994 was 28 weeks, and for July 1993 was 32 weeks.  There will be further improvements during 1996, and it is planned to reduce the timelag to 17 weeks by the end of 1996.  The ability to make further improvements beyond this point will be dependent on traders sending in their returns more quickly.  Statistics on our trade with non-EU countries are now published 10 weeks after the end of the reference period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the quality of the trade <Col N="1065" /> data, the CSO are happy that the overall quality is good.  In 1994, after one full year's operation of the new system, the CSO conducted a comprehensive analysis on the quality of the results.  This showed that the quality at the overall level was not affected by the introduction of Intrastat.  The quality of the detailed statistics was, however, affected because of the need to estimate figures for the many small traders who are below the survey threshold, and for the larger traders who have not responded to the survey.  Every effort is being made by the Revenue Commissioners to improve the response rate.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Bhutanese National Assembly met in the capital, Thimphu, from 10 August to 2 September 1995.  The proceedings and the resolutions of this session were published in a supplement in the Bhutanese national newspaper, Kuensel, on 16 September 1995, which reported that the Royal Advisory Councillors and people's representatives had made <Col N="1066" /> repeated interventions to emphasise that those who had left Bhutan must never be allowed to return; and alleging that those, who had departed, had gone despite every effort having been made by the Government of Bhutan and that it was only after reaching Nepal that they claimed to have been forcibly evicted.  Further, I understand that at present there are nearly 89,000 refugees or asylum seekers from Bhutan registered in eight camps in south-east Nepal.  Ireland has supported international efforts through the European Union and the United Nations to improve the situation in the camps and has also provided some direct assistance. I understand that a representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recently made on-the-spot visits to Nepal and Bhutan in relation to the refugee problem.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, bilateral negotiations between Bhutan and Nepal regarding these refugees have been in progress and a mechanism has been agreed whereby a joint verification mission will identify certain categories of the refugees in the camps with a view to their eventual repatriation.  These negotiations to resolve the refugee problem are continuing.  The Government hopes that these negotiations will make possible the early return of refugees to their hopes.  With our partners in the European Union, we will continue to monitor these negotiations closely.</P>

      <P>The information on the number and gender of job-sharers competing and the numbers successful in interdepartmental promotion competitions, as requested by the Deputy, is unavailable.  The Civil Service Commissioners do not require applicants for interdepartmental competitions to indicate if they are job-sharing and, therefore, is not in a position to indicate either the participation rates or the success rates of job-sharers in such competitions.</P>
      <P>The job-sharing scheme has been in operation since 1984 and there are currently over 1,900 civil servants job-sharing. Job-sharing staff are eligible for promotion on the same basis as full-time staff, subject to meeting the appropriate eligibility criteria.  Offers of promotion are usually made on a full-time basis.  If the officer wishes to resume job-sharing, she or he must apply for job-sharing in the new grade and find a suitable partner in the normal way.  Officers may, however, be promoted without going back to full-time working if such an arrangement is acceptable to management, a partner is available in the new grade and subject to whatever training arrangements may apply.</P>

At these locations patients are assured of having staff with the <Col N="1069" /> necessary skills and experience available, as well as the appropriate equipment. Equally the staff at the centres are guaranteed a sufficient throughput of patients to maintain their levels of skill and expertise.  The organisation and distribution of these centres is kept under constant review by my Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>

This includes £6 million in revenue funding of which £3 million is being provided to meet the 1996 cost of additional services which were put in place in 1995 which included over 240 residential-respite places.  The remaining £3 million in revenue funding provided in 1996 will facilitate the provision of an additional 66 residential-respite places and 265 day care places. In addition, £4 million in capital funding is being provided of which £2 million will be used to support general service developments and £2 million to develop and improve the quality of training facilities under the ERDF assisted programme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £44.58 million invested in the services in the period 1990 to 1995 has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.  I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting residential care.  However, I am aware that more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of those awaiting services. The Government is committed under both the health strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the service as resources become available.  It is also my intention, on completion of the validation process in respect of the national mental handicap database later this year, to initiate a review of need.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The charter of rights for hospital patients was issued by my Department in 1992 to all acute hospitals.  Its provisions with regard to complaints procedures applied to voluntary and health board hospitals. However the charter clearly stipulates that these procedures do not prejudice patients' existing statutory rights, including the right to complain to the Ombudsman.  At present the Ombudsman's remit extends only to health board hospitals and I regret if this has created any confusion for patients.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that the remit of the Ombudsman is currently under review by Government. The question of extending his remit to other agencies, including voluntary hospitals, is being considered in the context of that review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no formal report published on the Higashi School in Boston.  However, my adviser on mental handicap services recently visited the Higashi School in Boston as part of an examination of the content and likely benefit of a number of alternative programmes abroad for the treatment of autism.  It has not been possible to establish clear-cut evidence which would support the view that significant and continuing benefit can be derived <Col N="1073" /> from these programmes.  My Department's general view is that investment should continue to be made in the development of services here in Ireland with consideration being given to incorporating innovative elements of those services where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services <i>Needs and Abilities</i> recommended that no child should be placed in residential accommodation away from home solely on the basis of the need to avail of special education. In line with this policy, services are being developed at local and regional level with a view to enabling more families to keep children at home who would previously have come into residential care.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the cost to the State per year of keeping a child with special needs in residential care varies considerably depending on the needs of individual children.  The cost will be dependent on many factors including the level of disability, whether the child is in five day or seven day care, the type of care setting required, that is, a group home in the community or a more secure setting on a residential campus.  While costs could range between £15,000 and £30,000 per annum depending on the individual needs of the client, an average cost would be in the region of £19,000 per annum.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the advice, if any, she would give to the parents of children who have been expelled or excluded from second-level schools and who have great difficulty finding alternative school places for their children.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem of children who are not attending school because they have been expelled or excluded from second-level schools and whose parents have great difficulty in finding alternative school places for them.  The managerial authorities of second-level schools are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school.  Accordingly, the most effective method of countering indiscipline is for each individual school to draw up its own code of behaviour.  In drawing up the code, school authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 and 1991, my Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; together with &ldquo;A Suggested <Col N="1082" /> Code of Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; to all schools.</P>
    <P>Within these guidelines individual boards are given the discretion to work out specific details.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspension only as a last resort and I am satisfied that schools also see it in that way.</P>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically this can arise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made.  In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through its inspectorate to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school or alternatively, placement in another school.  In more difficult situations, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.  Programmes such as youth encounter projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education facilities on a phased basis at all second-level schools where such facilities are not already available.  The principal factor which determines progress in this area is the amount of capital funding available in any given financial year.  Given the limited resources available, the priority for the foreseeable future as far as the second-level capital programme is concerned will continue <Col N="1083" /> to be the provision of essential classroom accommodation.  However, it was found possible to make provision for the architectural planning of ten PE halls in 1995.  The further progress of these projects is now being considered by my Department in the context of the 1996 capital allocation.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the further Education Authority is one important part of a number of organisational innovations to support vocational education and training outside the third level sector, and adult and continuing education, put forward in the White Paper on education.  These include, principally, the establishment of a national certification authority, the designation of a special role for the education boards in these areas and the establishment of the Further Education Authority.</P>
      <P>I have already established TEASTAS, the Irish national certification authority, on a non-statutory basis.  Work is well advanced within my Department on the preparation of the legislative framework for the establishment of education boards.  These are two important pillars of the approach to the organisational arrangements for the development of vocational education and training and adult and continuing education set out in the White Paper. There will be no undue delay in proceeding with the establishment of the Further Education Authority, as work advances in these two areas.</P>

      <P>The student in question is following a post-leaving certificate course of one year's duration leading to a level two award in community and health services-child care from the National Council for Vocational Awards.</P>
      <P>In 1995 I approved a pilot scheme which established a new system for allocating places in regional technical college colleges for holders of NCVA qualifications.  Under the terms of this scheme a quota of places are reserved on selected courses in participating colleges for candidates who are placed in an order of merit on the basis of their NCVA award results.  This means that award holders may be awarded a third level place either on the basis of their NCVA or Leaving Certificate results.</P>
      <P>The participating colleges and courses in 1995 for the purpose of the NCVA child care level two award were the child care courses in Athlone and Sligo Regional Technical Colleges.  These colleges and courses will continue in the scheme in 1996, but the range of courses and participating colleges is currently being extended, and will be available very shortly.</P>
      <P>This pilot scheme is an important development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training, and TEASTAS, the recently established Irish National Certification Authority, will take account of this experience when developing a national qualifications framework.</P>

      <P>The deployment of the force to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities. They have informed me that local Garda management carried out a detailed analysis of crime trends in the Sligo district at the end of 1992.  It was evident from this analysis that most of the crime in the district was being committed in the Sligo urban area.  It was also clear that many public order problems were being encountered on the streets of Sligo on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights when there was an influx of as many as 2,000 young people into the town to attend discos.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities decided, based on this analysis of the crime situation, to redeploy members from substations within the district to perform duty in Sligo town on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  This action has proved to be very successful as the crime figures for the Sligo subdistrict have falled from 676 in 1993 to 607 in 1994 and provisional figures for 1995 indicate that the number of crimes committed in the Sligo subdistrict will be less than 500. This represents a decrease of approximately 26 per cent in a three year period, which is a significant achievement by any standard.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the policing arrangements of the Sligo district will continue to be monitored with a view to deploying all available resources to the best possible advantage in the light of changing needs and circumstances in the district as a whole.  The divisional officer at Sligo is satisfied there is no diminution in the Garda service being provided to the subdistricts outside the Sligo subdistrict as a result of members from these subdistricts performing duty as required in Sligo town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that there were five incidents relating to attacks on the elderly in the Sligo <Col N="1089" /> district in 1995 and two of these have been detected.  The divisional officer is most concerned with the prevention of such attacks &mdash; as we all are &mdash; and I have been informed that strategies are in place to prevent such attacks in north and south Sligo.  There is a limit to the amount of operational detail which I can supply to the Deputy by way of reply to a parliamentary question but I can say that the strategies are all designed to ensure effective rural policing in these areas.</P>
    <P>I am fuly aware of the concern among the public living in rural areas regarding the number of attacks on the elderly.  I have addressed the House on this issue when dealing with Private Notice Questions earlier today.  It was out of concern in relation to this issue that the community alert scheme was first established in 1985.  There are now almost 800 schemes operating throughout the country covering over 155,464 homes. This scheme was originally started as a programme to counteract attacks on the elderly and to encourage a sense of neighbourliness in the community.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that this scheme, with its strong emphasis on the welfare of the elderly, has proved very successful in reducing attacks on the elderly in rural areas.  I recently launched a new video and literature funded by the PMPA and these will help to ensure that our senior citizens, and indeed those providing help to them, have accurate and up-to-date advice.</P>
    <P>I also met representatives of Muintir na Tíre, who promote the community alert scheme, three times in the last year.  At my request, the Garda authorities carried out an evaluation of the scheme and its effect on crime in 15 selected areas.  Based on research carried out on the crime levels for the three year period before and after the community alert scheme was established the following results were recorded; 17 per cent decrease in attacks on the elderly, 25 per cent decrease in burglaries and 21 per cent decrease in other crimes.</P>
    <P>These results convinced me that <Col N="1090" /> further support should be given to community alert schemes and, in this regard, I informed Muintir an Tíre at a meeting which I had with them earlier this month that I would make £50,000 available to them to provide them with the resources to significantly expand the number of community alert schemes in operation.  Late last year I approved funding to meet the cost of issuing a community alert newsletter on a quarterly basis.</P>
    <P>Last year, the senior citizens' advice leaflet was reissued by the community relations section of the Garda.  It contains detailed information on cash security, care of property, callers to the door and house security.  Garda comunity relations and crime prevention officers regularly offer advice to the public on the many methods and products available which can be utilised to make prospective criminal targets less vulnerable.  Through the compilation of security surveys on houses, apartments, factories, shops and offices, the Garda authorities try to ensure that the best possible practice in crime prevention techniques is adopted.  The Garda authorities have informed me that all the policing programmes within the community relations field are under continual review and modified and updated as necessary to meet the changing need or our society.</P>

      <P>The temporary release system has been operated under statute since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.  I am aware that, due to a shortage of prison <Col N="1091" /> accommodation, some offenders do serve a smaller proportion of their sentence than would otherwise be the case. This has been the case for several years. While great care is taken in selecting individuals for release, I am not aware of any system which can guarantee, with absolute certainty, that no individual released will commit offences during the period of release.  A small minority of offenders &mdash; and that is what it is &mdash; will reoffend irrespective of whether they are released early or serve every day of their sentence.</P>
      <P>We need to increase our prisons' capacity.  There is no dispute about this and I will be bringing proposals to the Government in this regard in the very near future.</P>

      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the delay in launching the high speed ferry service between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead by Stena Line has had a negative impact on the number of visitors to Ireland in 1995.  Preliminary estimates by Bord Fáilte for the performance of the tourism sector in 1995 indicate that Britain has generated record tourism earnings of half a billion pounds in the Irish economy.  This represents an increase of 11 per cent on the 1994 revenue figure.  British visitor numbers in 1995 are estimated to have increased by 12 per cent to 2.3 million.</P>

      <P>Under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty, each member state is required to establish the facilities necessary to carry out continuous monitoring of the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil and to ensure compliance with the basic standards.</P>
      <P>The monitoring arrangements for radiation levels in the vicinity of nuclear energy plants is a matter for the national authorities in each EU member state.  National authorities require each operator to undertake radiation monitoring in the vicinity of nuclear installations. The form and extent of monitoring varies from installation to installation depending on the type of installation and its location.  However, there are many common features in the monitoring programmes.  In general, the programmes include: the measurement of radiation dose rates in the area adjacent to the plant and the regular sampling and analysis of air, seawaters, sediments, ground and drinking waters, marine biota, soils, grasses, vegetables and milk, fish and meat.</P>
      <P>Each operator is required to report to its national authority on the results of its monitoring programme.</P>

The Department does not in any event fund repair works at local authority piers, and repair and maintenance of Doonloughane Pier is, therefore, a matter for Galway County Council.</P>
