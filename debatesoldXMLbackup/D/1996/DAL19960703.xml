      <P>There are five matters to put to the House.  Is the late sitting to midnight satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 5 and 13 in respect of health matters satisfactory and agreed? Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 8, the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 6, An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill from the Seanad, agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' Business this evening to conclude at 8.30 p.m. agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>Now that the Second Stage of the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill has been passed, will the Taoiseach give some indication of the timetable for the Committee Stage?  It is important that the Government give its backing through the Select Committee on Security and Legislation if we are to have the Bill back in the Chamber on 25 July.  I understood from my contact with the Minister for Justice during the weekend that the Bill would pass Second Stage this week and would proceed to the Select Committee on Security and Legislation and that the Bill, in its amended form, would be returned to this House on 25 July for the remaining Stages.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Justice could only refer to everything that was bad about the Bill, saying it was unworkable and perhaps unconstitutional. The Taoiseach has been constructive and agreed to Second Stage of this Bill being taken in Government time, so I will not start arguing about it.</P>
      <P>Last year the Fianna Fáil Party introduced the Misuse of Drugs Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The excellent Misuse of Drugs Bill left this Chamber and was buried in a committee.</P>
      <P>In a spirit of co-operation we have agreed to many matters this morning but there is no point in agreeing to burying a Bill in a committee.  I was in the Chamber for most of the debate except for one hour and ten minutes.  The Minister for Justice seemed to miss one point.  She continually referred to the commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>She continually said that the provisions of the Bill were already in legislation.  There is legislation that deals with the situation when charges have been served or there is intent to serve charges, but our Bill deals with the situation when no charges have been served but the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners or a Garda chief superintendent is that the assets are illicit.</P>

      <P>The Minister either does not understand or seeks to misrepresent the situation.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that we are still working to complete the Fianna Fáil Bill in amended form by 25 July 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I announced that the Dáil would be recalled on 25 July to consider measures affecting crime, I wanted measures that not only were pointed in the right direction but would actually work in practice, would be the basis for successful prosecution or administrative action and would comform with constitutional requirements. That overriding requirement remains. <Col N="5" /> There are, as the Minister for Justice outlined &mdash; and this is no criticism of the Opposition &mdash; major flaws in the Bill which was produced at comparatively short notice.  It was understandable that there should be such deficiencies.  It is the Government's intention to remedy those deficiencies.  We are working towards a programme of having the matter debated in the House again on 25 July.  This will involve an intensive schedule of work in the relevant committee in the meantime.  Arrangements will be made to that end with the committee. The overriding consideration has to be that whatever proposals we pass, regardless of their original author, they must be satisfactorily workable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach but we will have more than adequate time between now and 25 July to resolve that issue.  If one works from the basis of what is constructive rather than destructive, it would be a great help to the House.  We will work on that basis.  Will the Taoiseach arrange for the Whips to meet today to work out a timetable?  Is it proposed to take any other business on 25 July.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday when the Taoiseach looked to the Opposition for assistance he promised he would listen carefully to what it said.  He referred to the need for workable legislation.  In Opposition he championed the cause of Dáil reform and said he wanted to make the House relevant but he will not do so by calling a press conference at 8 p.m. to announce Government proposals. When the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, then Minister for Health, published the Kilkenny incest inquiry report in the Shelbourne Hotel on 18 May 1993 the Taoiseach rightly expressed his concern that the House was being ignored.  What happened here last night was a disgrace and leads me to the conclusion that the Government is more interested in PR.</P>

If the Tánaiste was sitting in this seat, I would love to hear what he would have to say.  In the forthcoming referendum will a single issue be put to the people or will other issues be put to them?  Has a precise date been agreed and when can we expect the proposed legislation?</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, all members of the Government were involved yesterday from early morning until 3.30 p.m. in meetings with the European Commission.  As a result the Cabinet meeting which normally takes place on a Tuesday morning was deferred until 5 p.m.  At that meeting we considered the major crime package subsequently announced.  There was no other time to announce it other than immediately after the meeting, if it was to be announced at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the arguments he advanced against the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996, were advanced against the bail Bills which Fianna Fáil introduced last year and which are now being adopted by the Government?  In that context is it the Government's intention to do with the organised crime Bill what it did disgracefully with the Misuse of Drugs Bill?  It took a poorly watered down version of Part I and presented it as the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's language is intemperate.  The position is that the Deputy and others have been looking for an approach where all views are taken into account.  If their views are to be taken into account on a matter such as this, they must be willing to listen to other concerns.  The use of language such as &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo; suggests that there may be more than a little opportunism in the Deputy's approach.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's acceptance of the argument that the right to silence in drug trafficking cases should be curtailed.

We will report on our further consideration of the matter as decisions are taken between now and 25 July and subsequently.  It would not be appropriate, however, to comment on any particular potential additional measure until a decision has been taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we have had a surplus of Government opportunism on this matter is the Taoiseach willing to present to the Opposition the opinion of the Attorney General or any other outside advice he has taken in relation to the organised crime Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will present its legal view on the Bill in question to the committee when it considers the matter.  The legal arguments the Government will advance will stand on their merits and will be seen to be valid by the Deputies participating in the debate.  It will be open to Deputies to <Col N="10" /> argue otherwise.  We hope that in the debate a reasonable understanding will be reached across all parties on what is legally workable and unworkable.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Government is not to make the point the Deputy has been making of a partisan kind but to reach agreement on legislation which will work.  Beneath some of the rather predictable remarks which have been made from the Opposition benches there is a genuine wish that we should as a group of political representatives act together in an agreed way to deal with crime.  That is the approach the Government is taking.  While we will put forward our legal reservations we will also be willing to listen to counter arguments from the Opposition on the legal issues in question.</P>

The criminal law is live and given that new precedents, judgments and problems arise all the time it is necessary to have a mechanism at least annually to deal with any difficulties which arise.  The first annual criminal law revision Bill will be presented to the House on 25 July in the form of the Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Obviously, we will seek to include as many reforms as possible in it.  We will have available to us a mechanism for the ongoing review of the criminal law to deal with any problems which arise &mdash; new precedents are set every day in the courts &mdash; and which cause difficulties, or opportunities as the case may be, for those involved in law enforcement.</P>

      <P>On the question of the Attorney General's advices, it was agreed last week that it is important to address the constitutionality of legislation so that we have an effective response to the impact of organised crime.  Will the Taoiseach further consider that request so that we do not have to wait until Committee Stage to hear the Attorney General's advices?  Given that the Bill has been initiated by this side of the House &mdash; I acknowledged that it is unprecedented for Opposition legislation to be taken in Government time &mdash; it would greatly assist us if the Attorney General's advices were communicated to our spokesperson in writing in advance of Committee Stage. Obviously the priority is to ensure that the constitutionality issue is dealt with adequately.</P>

      <P>Last week the Deputy referred to the possibility of referring the Bill to the Supreme Court.  As he was told on that occasion that is the sole prerogative of the Head of State. Obviously, she will take account of the discussions in the House but it is entirely a matter for her.  I appreciate that the Deputy is putting forward this suggestion in a constructive way.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> Any Deputy who has been in Government will know the Attorney General's advice is not made available to anybody other than the Government.  This is a well established practice in terms of the relationship between the Government and the Attorney General who is the adviser to the Government on legal matters.  The question of making the Opposition parties as fully aware as possible of the concerns about the Bill is a different issue and we will be as constructive and open as we can on it.  As I have already indicated to Deputy O'Donoghue, I will ensure that the Government's legal views are communicated in the Select Committee in a very full and open way and that the Government will listen to any legally based counter arguments which may be advanced by others in the committee. At the end of the day, it is important that we work constructively to have a Bill which works.  In that regard the Government will be as constructive and co-operative as possible with all Deputies in the House.  I hope the matter can be dealt with in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill to amend section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, and to amend the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.  Section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, allows the Minister for Health by order to amend the charter of a hospital subject to the order in draft form being approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas following consultation with the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The principal reason for bringing forward this Bill is to allow me as Minister for Health to meet the wishes of the three voluntary hospitals who are combining to form the new voluntary hospital at Tallaght.  These transferring voluntary hospitals are the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital, and the National Children's Hospital.  I readily agreed to a request from the board of the Adelaide Hospital to amend the charter of the Adelaide Hospital 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been requested to amend this charter because the three hospitals have <Col N="17" /> agreed that the legal basis for the governance of the new hospital at Tallaght will be in the form of an amended charter of the Adelaide Hospital.  The hospitals submitted a draft of an agreed text to form the basis of the order amending the Adelaide Charter. However, in consulation with the Office of the Attorney General my Department has been advised that, in order to meet the wishes of the hospitals, certain amendments of a technical legal nature require to be made to both the Health Act, 1970, and to the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>The Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, created the legislative vehicle for seven voluntary hospitals in Dublin to form themselves into a group or federation.  Provision was also made in the Act for eventual amalgamation of the seven hospitals, if they so desired.  In practice only the federation provisions came into force.  The seven hospitals included the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital who are now coming together to form the new hospital at Tallaght. The executive vehicle created for the federation under the Act was the Central Council of the Federation Dublin Voluntary Hospital.  It is now necessary to provide, as is proposed in the Bill, that the provisions of the 1961 Act will not impinge in any way on the functioning of the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>In 1993, a number of issues relating to the new hospital at Tallaght were agreed by the boards of the three hospitals and approved by the Government. These included agreement on the board structure and other issues.  That agreement represented the culmination of a very large amount of difficult work by the three base hospitals and it is to their credit that in the end a resolution was reached.  That agreement is the basis on which the legal framework is now being proposed so as to finalise these matters.</P>
    <P>The detailed legal framework now before the House has also been agreed by the boards of the three hospitals who are integrating and combining to form <Col N="18" /> the new hospital at Tallaght.  At the outset the problems seemed insurmountable but with an enormous amount of hard work, goodwill and co-operation from all sides we have reached the stage which we are at today.  We often hear of many different aspects of the health services but in my opinion, far too infrequently we hear about, and acknowledge, the enormous contribution which is made to our health services on a purely voluntary basis by a large number of people.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a time to place on record my appreciation of the invaluable contribution, made on a voluntary basis, by the members of the boards of the three hospitals which are moving to Tallaght.  In particular, I would like to acknowledge the work of the chairpersons of these boards, Mrs. Rosemary French, Mr. Gerry Brady, Mr. Salters Sterling, chairpersons of the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital boards respectively.  It is under their leadership that final agreement has been reached on the detailed legislative basis now before the House.</P>
    <P>The skills and commitment which these people and, their colleagues in many hospitals and organisations, bring to the health services, while always appreciated, are not often enough acknowledged.  Since becoming Minister for Health, I have come to appreciate that an essential feature of our health services is the voluntary nature of many of our services and the contributions being made.</P>
    <P>The process of bringing the hospitals together has received a strong impetus from the fact that building of the hospitals premises in Tallaght is progressing at a pace which means it is on schedule for completion.  I express my appreciation to all those involved in this complex project but, in particular, I would like to thank the board responsible for the planning and building of this facility under the chairmanship of Professor Richard Conroy.</P>
    <P>This Bill, and the motion approving the draft order, received unanimous <Col N="19" /> approval from Seanad Éireann on Wednesday 26 June 1996.  In the course of the debate in the Seanad, it was acknowledged that, while the three hospitals were coming from diverse backgrounds, the emphasis should now be on what the hospitals have in common. They each have a long tradition of service to the people of Dublin and, indeed, to patients from throughout the country.  They have a strong commitment to serve in the best possible way, those people who need hospital services. I have no doubt that this commitment to excellence and service will be continued at Tallaght together with the staff moving from St. Loman's Hospital who will be providing the acute psychiatric services at the new hospital.  The hospitals will share a joint future in Tallaght where together they will, no doubt, create a further centre of excellence.</P>
    <P>The point was made in the Seanad by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, and others that Tallaght Hospital will not simply be an isolated hospital but will reach out into the community by close co-operation with the GP services and the continuing care services in its catchment area so as to provide a seamless service to the people of the region.</P>
    <P>I am very glad as Minister for Health to bring these proposals to the House. The proposals reflect good news, compromise, co-operation and the commitment of the Government to put in place at the earliest date a range of major acute hospital services to serve the people of Tallaght and the surrounding area.  This is a unique occasion where this House is being asked to facilitate the joining together of three hospitals with a proud history of providing health services to the people of Dublin and, indeed, to many people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are quite straightforward.  Section 2 enhances the powers of the Minister for Health under section 76 of the Health Act, 1970.  Section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, empowers the Minister for Health <Col N="20" /> by order to amend the charter of a hospital subject to the order in draft form being approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas following consultation with the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland. Section 2 of the Bill expands the Minister's powers under section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, as the present section does not allow for facilitating the legal arrangements now requested by the three hospitals.  That is, it does not provide for the establishment of a new body corporate and the assignment of a title to it.  Section 2 (1) (a) provides for this.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) provides for the application of a charter which is being amended to the new body corporate established under section 2 (1) (a).  This allows for the charter of the Adelaide Hospital, 1921, as amended, to be applied to the new body corporate.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (a) provides for the transfer to the new body corporate of the functions, property, rights, liabilities and members of staff of the transferring agencies.  This provision will allow for the integration of the three base hospitals, of the Tallaght Hospital Board established to construct the hospital, and of the Central Council of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (b) allows for the conferral of such powers on the original body &mdash; in this case the Adelaide Hospital &mdash; as in the opinion of the Minister are necessary to enable it wind up its affairs or otherwise deal with any property, rights or liabilities of it.  This is to ensure that on the disapplication of the charter to the original Adelaide Hospital that hospital will still have powers to take care of its residual affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) (a) allows the Minister on the application of the new body corporate &mdash; in this case the new Tallaght Hospital &mdash; established by an order under section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, to amend that order.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (4) facilitates the circumstances of this particular case by <Col N="21" /> allowing for the simultaneous movement of this Bill and the draft order establishing the new hospital through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, in particular the provisions of section 14 of that Act, the new hospital will be able to exercise all functions which are exercised by the Central Council of Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals in respect of the three base hospitals.  This provision is required to ensure for the avoidance of doubt that the new hospital will be able to exercise those functions.</P>
    <P>The three hospitals joining together to provide a major acute voluntary hospital at Tallaght have agreed that the governance of the hospital will be based on the original charter of the Adelaide Hospital, as amended by the draft order. The order provides for the necessary amendments to the charter to meet the wishes of the three base hospitals and to provide for a situation where none of the three hospitals will have a predominant status relative to the other two.</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputies will be aware of the agreement of the three hospitals and of the urgency to provide the necessary legislative measures to give effect to that agreement.  I have acceded to the request of the board of the Adelaide Hospital to introduce an order providing for an amendment to the Adelaide charter.  I do so at this time to facilitate the putting in place of a unified management structure for the three transferring hospitals well in advance of the move to the new premises at Tallaght. This is of great importance as it ensures the integration of services and the smooth transfer of the hospitals to the new premises at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I facilitated the appointment of a board designate which has been functioning now for six months with the goodwill of the hospitals concerned but without the necessary statutory powers.  The energy, capacity and commitment of the members of this board has been amply demonstrated <Col N="22" /> over the past six months.  It is important to provide the necessary legal basis required for the board of the new hospital and to ensure that the board is established as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the draft order explains the amendments contained in the order. The order received unanimous support in the Seanad last week and I have no doubt this House will welcome it provisions in like manner.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to refer to each section of the draft order but it is important to bring to attention some of the provisions of the order which would not be considered usual in establishing the necessary governance arrangements for a major acute hospital.  These provisions have been included in the draft order to reflect the agreement which has been reached between the hospitals. These include section 4 which establishes a body corporate which will be known as the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital.  Section 4 applies the charter to this body corporate and provides for the original Adelaide Hospital to have such powers as are necessary to enable it to wind up or otherwise deal with its affairs. Section 5 is the principal section of the draft order and contains all the amendments to and deletions from the charter of the Adelaide Hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that most of these amendments are substituting new clauses for the clauses in the original charter.  These amendments are necessary to reflect the terms of the heads of agreement entered into by the three hospitals.</P>
    <P>The new clause 5(c) of the charter as outlined on page 7 of the draft Order allows the hospital &ldquo;to promote and secure the availability, as a matter between the patient and his or her doctor, of such medical and surgical procedures as may lawfully be provided within the State&rdquo; without prejudice to the rights of conscience of staff.  The new clause 5 (j) provides that the fundamental principle of the Adelaide <Col N="23" /> Hospital as an essentially religious and Protestant institution will be maintained, while guaranteeing rights of conscience and providing that the hospital will have a multi-denominational and pluralist character.</P>
    <P>The terms of the draft order provide for the composition of the board of the hospital as set out in the new clause 12 of the charter.  This new clause provides that there shall be a board of the hospital which will have 23 members. Fifteen members of the board shall be appointed by the three base hospitals as follows: six from the Adelaide Hospital Society, six from the Meath Hospital and three from the National Children's Hospital.  Eight members of the board shall be appointed by the Minister for Health, six of whom shall be appointed from among the persons nominated by the president of the hospital and two other members, one of whom shall be nominated by the Eastern Health Board and one of whom shall be nominated by the board of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Also of note is the new clause 24 as provided for under section 5(s) on page 30 of the draft order.  This establishes a college of nursing at the new hospital which provides that for student nurse entry purposes the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospital will have separate constituent schools of nursing. Each of the schools of nursing will be autonomous for student nurse intake purposes and may take up to 40 entrants in the case of the Adelaide, up to 60 in the case of the Meath and up to 21 in the case of the National Children's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The draft order also contains provision for industrial relations matters surrounding the transfer of services and staff to Tallaght to be addressed through a Protocol which has been agreed by the Department of Health and the management and unions representing staff of the transferring agencies comprehended by the draft order. This is to ensure that best industrial relations and personnel practices will be adhered to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> In preparing the draft order, I and officials from my Department were very conscious that the hospitals transferring to Tallaght are three very different institutions, each having its own background and ethos.  While it is important that we should focus on the common positive attributes of each of the hospitals as I mentioned earlier, it is also important that each of the three hospitals is enabled to enter into an arrangement where they feel that their interests and their honourable traditions are respected and acknowledged.  I am happy that the draft order before us meets this difficult criterion for the integration of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>While this legislation is essentially of a technical legal nature, it is most important.  It is a necessary statutory measure required to contribute to the reorganisation and extension of the public hospital services.  The immediate effect of the Bill will allow for the proper establishment of a much needed acute hospital at Tallaght.  I commend the Bill to the House and I ask the Dáil to approve the motion in respect of the draft order which has been laid before the House.</P>

    <P>The order and legislation before us have had a long and controversial history. I welcome the resolution of the difficulties. Good will has applied on all sides.  I pay tribute in particular to Mr. Sterling, Mr. Brady and Mrs. French who, as chairpersons of the respective hospitals, played an enormous role in <Col N="25" /> bringing together the hospital administration and ironing out staff difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am glad the concerns have been resolved and I hope the charter and Protocols that have been put in place will live up to expectations.</P>
    <P>In some ways this is a sad occasion. Many unique institutions are coming to an end in their current format and are moving on to a new level.  Those institutions have long and colourful histories. The Meath Hospital's history dates back to the end of the 17th century.  The Liberties was hit by poverty following the collapse of the wool trade.  Surgeons from the charitable surgery of Spring Gardens in Dame Street took up the plight of the poor local people and decided to establish a hospital in the Upper Coombe to treat the ill.  The first hospital, I understand, was in the library of the home of the Earl of Meath.</P>
    <P>The hospital moved from house to house until 1770 when the foundation stone for a new purpose built hospital was laid by Lord Brabazon in the Coombe.  Completed in 1773, it continued as a hospital for 50 years until it was no longer adequate to cope with the numbers of patients.  A new site was chosen for the Meath off Heytesbury Street.  That land had originally been leased by Dean Swift and was known as the Dean's Vineyard.  After some financial difficulty, the building of the hospital commenced in 1815 and was completed in 1822.</P>
    <P>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the Meath Hospital has had a distinguished role in medical innovation.  It has played an enormous role in the life of the city.  The writers Brendan Behan and James Clarence Mangan died there, while Oliver St. John Gogarty was a surgeon there.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Adelaide Hospital has a great and proud history.  It was founded by Dr. Albert Walsh when he was just 26 years old.  Its first premises was at Bride Street and it continued there until 1846.  In 1858, it reopened at Peter's Street and developed a convalescent home there.  The Adelaide has been a <Col N="26" /> general teaching hospital for many years and in the forefront of medical advances.  Its charter dates from 1920 and appears to have been one of the last royal charters granted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The National Children's Hospital was founded as a hospital for sick children in 1821 by Sir Henry Marsh.  It is considered to have been the first teaching hospital in Ireland and Britain.  It moved to a number of different premises, settling finally at Harcourt Street in 1887. The two remaining constituent groups in this new hospital are St. Loman's psychiatric hospital and the Central Council of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals which was established under a 1961 Act and which, I understand, manages common contracts and pensions for the hospitals.  As evident from the long histories and all the people involved, there is more to all of this than just bricks and mortar.  Many different institutions, each with its own background and ethos, are coming together under the one roof.  However, what is common to all the institutions is, as the Minister said, their strong and overriding commitment to the treatment of patients.  That spirit will, I hope, continue strongly in the new hospital.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that, in some ways, this is a sad occasion and it is particularly so for Dublin's inner city.  The last three hospitals are being lost to the south inner city.  It will mark the closing of a chapter for many Dublin families whose grandparents, parents and children had been treated there.  If the hospital walls of the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's hospital could speak, I am sure they would relate rich historical tales.  I ask the Minister for Health to ensure that people from the inner city who have a long tradition in regard to these hospitals will still be able to avail of treatment in their local areas.  I hope a special effort will be made to accommodate these people at the Mater, in Crumlin Children's Hospital and St. James's.</P>
    <P>One of the unique elements of this plan agreed with all hospitals is that there will be a unified management <Col N="27" /> structure in place well in advance of the move to Tallaght.  I will study carefully how this operates as it is certainly a radical departure.  Normally, management is unified only after mergers which sometimes lead to teething problems.</P>
    <P>There were many concerns before this rationalisation was finally agreed. The primary ones related to retaining ethos.  I am glad these have been ironed out and I note that paragraph 5 (c) of the new order guarantees the availability of all medical and surgical procedures which may lawfully be provided without prejudice to the rights of conscience of staff.  This issue was one of great concern to staff interests and I hope the new industrial relations Protocols and other procedures will realise all our hopes.</P>
    <P>Many persons, including the Minister, have highlighted the pluralism and multi-denominational aspects at play in this joint venture.  I welcome those aspects and I hope the manner in which anxieties were dealt with will become a blueprint for tackling other issues in this society.  My one caution is that there should be no triumphalism on the part of any group, denomination or sector.  It is not a time for triumphalism on anyone's part.  The one suggestion I would make is that when the new hospital is formed, there should be a designated response unit to ensure that any Protocol difficulties are quickly ironed out and do not become a battle between groups that could tear the hospital apart.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Trinity College Medical School will have a major role at the new Tallaght Hospital and that it will be a teaching hospital.  Campus facilities will be developed at the hospital and I hope this has significant benefits for the Tallaght region.  The proposal to establish links between general practitioners in the area with the new Tallaght Hospital is very welcome.  This was again mentioned by the Minister when he addressed the House this morning.  If one looks back on the past five years and sees the very serious difficulties in <Col N="28" /> almost every accident and emergency department of major hospitals &mdash; some of it resulting from lack of consultation and co-operation very often between general practitioners and accident and emergency departments &mdash; it is clear we can avoid such difficulties in future by putting in place the kind of response that has been put in place in St. James's, for example, relating to general practitioners. It is a response which has ironed out some of the difficulties at many national hospitals with the exception of one in my own area.  I am glad there are proposals at this early stage to establish those vital links with the general practitioners which I hope will help to avoid the accident and emergency problems we have had in other hospitals.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I raised with the Minister the fact that hospitals have a key role to play in communities.  They are a vital facility after all but they need to be more consumer focused or customer oriented and they should give patients a role in their own treatment.  It would be good for hospitals if consumer representatives sat on hospital boards as well as on health boards.  Perhaps the Minister has plans in this area, and if so maybe he could outline them and give us details when he responds.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that &ldquo;building of the hospital premises in Tallaght is progressing at a pace which means it is on schedule for completion&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister could detail the timetable that he now envisages for the completion, equipping and commissioning of the hospital itself.</P>
    <P>I would like to be associated with the Minister's kind words for the members of the interim board under the able stewardship of Professor Richard Conroy. The board has done a lot of work to bring this complex project to fruition.</P>
    <P>Rumour has it that plans for the hospital have been somewhat scaled down.  Tallaght is a huge area and this hospital will serve an even wider hinterland. Beaumont Hospital has a ratio of one bed for every 300 in the population <Col N="29" /> hinterland, but it would appear that Tallaght will have one bed for every 600 of the local population.  We have all heard concerns about limited out-patient space and local transport infrastructure difficulties.</P>
    <P>Tallaght has been neglected in the past.  It has many health problems as shown in a recent Jobstowns survey which indicated high levels of ill health and disability in the area.  Tallaght should not be short-changed now with this new hospital.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the transport infrastructure for the hospital works.  Transport facilities for the hospital need to be integrated with particular regard to the proposed light rail system which is to serve Tallaght.</P>
    <P>As an enabling measure, I welcome this legislation.  A generosity of spirit has applied in the lead-up to it which should be reciprocated here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I enthusiastically support the Bill.  As the Minister said, it is a technical enabling Bill to provide the statutory basis for the establishment of a governing body for the new Tallaght Hospital.  We have had a protracted debate on the establishment of a single board and a range of sensitive issues have finally been addressed relating to the particular needs of the three constituent hospitals; the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospital.  Following the enactment of this legislation we will have a single board and a designated interim board has been in place since last January.</P>
      <P>Great credit is due to the boards of the three hospitals for the great maturity and common sense they have shown in their approach to this matter. I also compliment the Minister and his officials because two years ago I wondered if there would ever be unanimous agreement in this and the other House on the amalgamation of the three hospitals, so fraught with difficulties at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to the history of the three hospitals. <Col N="30" /> Although I had not consdered that matter when reading the Bill and listening to the Minister's speech, it is worth noting that in the development of Dublin there are three new towns, Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.  Great planning mistakes have been made and the city centre is now doughnut-like, empty in the middle, with schools and hospitals closing down and enormous space capacity.  Many demands are made for transport and so on as a result of people moving to the suburbs.</P>
    <P>Although I represent two of the towns I refer to, huge planning mistakes were made in these cases, not only in planning but in terms of incentives for first time buyers.  It is more attractive to buy a new house, for which a grant is payable to first time buyers, than to buy a second-hand house in the city, in which case stamp duty is payable and there is no grant.  That is a matter about which I am very concerned.  Although efforts have been made in recent times to attract people back to the city&mdash; it is becoming somewhat yuppified &mdash; it is a pity the services have gone.  However, we cannot criticise the fact that services are being removed when the people have already gone.</P>
    <P>In the inner city, three hospitals in the one constituency, Dublin South-East, will be closed.  I do not know if Deputies in that area have expressed concern in that regard, but Deputy McDowell mentioned to me last night that three hospitals in his constituency will be closed.  It should be noted that this is happening because of planning decisions which have resulted in the displacement of people over many years. While I cannot recall the exact figures, the population of the inner city has halved in 50 years, and that is a serious matter for many reasons other than the problems with population and facilities in terms of infrastructure in the suburbs. A capital city should be a living city with as many people as possible living close to the centre, as is the case in Galway. That city is a great example of people living close to the inner city.</P>
    <P>This Bill smoothes the way for the <Col N="31" /> integration of the services which are essential for the transition to the new Tallaght hospital.  The level of agreement augurs well for the future.  I hope lessons have been learnt from the teething problems that occurred at Beaumont hospital, some of which still exist. Those problems have been damaging to the hospital.  To a large extent they resulted from the bringing together of different traditions and institutions, with all the vested interests involved.  Foremost in our minds must be patient care. We must ensure that the most appropriate level of health care is provided. Nobody's vested interest must be allowed stand in the way of that.</P>
    <P>I hope the negotiations are over and that we will be able to meet the health needs of the people in west Dublin and the surrounding counties.  This is a hospital not only for Tallaght &mdash; it is important that the public realise that &mdash; but for the region.  As a Deputy in the area, I envisage that in future years I will receive representations about patients from Wicklow, Kildare and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The governing body of the hospital must ensure that the best standards of health care in terms of in-patients and out-patients are provided.  All medical procedures that are legal in the State will be provided in the hospital, as in every publicly funded hospital.  The services that are generally not provided, although there is only a small number of them, are those affecting women &mdash; for example, tubal ligation is not as widely available as I would wish.  I understand that some hospitals will not agree to sterilisation unless a letter of consent is signed by the husband, which is totally inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Great attention has been paid, in the context of the amalgamation of the three hospitals, to the special ethos of the Adelaide Hospital.  It is right that that ethos is protected and promoted. The Catholic ethos is dominant throughout the public health service.  In a republic we must ensure the rights of miniorities are protected.  The Adelaide <Col N="32" /> Hospital is the only remaining Protestant hospital in the county and I am glad the Minister has sought to establish a single board by amending the charter of that hospital.</P>
    <P>We must protect fully the special relationship that exists between patients and doctors.  There should be no intervention whatever from any moral big brother.  Although many of the sensitive issues that arose in our health service ten or 15 years ago no longer exist, problems remain with certain procedures. I am delighted the staff in Tallaght hospital will be free to exercise freedom of conscience.  That is extremely important, just as in this House it is important that Deputies be able to exercise freedom of conscience in moral issues.  I am aware that moral issues may extend beyond those relating to religion, but particularly in issues of religion or conscience, where people have genuine moral difficulties, the party Whip system is inappropriate.  I forecast that within a decade it will no longer exist, as is the case in almost every other democracy, certainly in Europe.</P>
    <P>The fact that staff can opt out of performing any procedure with which they do not agree should be a reassurance to those who have made representations to me and expressed concern about the matter.  Sometimes these concerns are exaggerated and people anticipate they may have to do things that are wrong, but I do not envisage that will be the case in Tallaght.  Nonetheless, it is important that it is clear to the staff from the outset that there will be no question of having to perform procedures with which they have moral difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is sad that, while we live in a republic, there is much misunderstanding about the Protestant ethos.  To a large extent that misunderstanding is based on lack of education and awareness and perhaps failure to communicate with different groups in society.  I anticipate that when the hospital is established and the different sets of staff begin to work together they will realise <Col N="33" /> they have much more in common than they realised and practically nothing divides them.  Many of the medical and consultant staff are common to the Adelaide and the Meath hospitals and when other staff down the line begin to work together they will equally realise they are not very different.</P>
    <P>On the nursing college, I am pleased the autonomy of the three separate nursing schools will be protected.  I welcome the Minister's statement that the Meath Hospital will take in up to 60 students, the Adelaide 40 students and the National Children's Hospital 21 students.  The only way the ethos of the Adelaide will be protected in the new hospital is by ensuring it has a sizeable number of student nurses and the hospital is pleased that it will take on 40 out of a total of 121 students.</P>
    <P>Tallaght hospital is on schedule and will be opened in August 1997.  This project is the largest ever public project undertaken in the State.  Given that it will be a state of the art hospital, one of the best in the world &mdash; I am aware of the demands on public spending and always shout when the Government overruns on budgets &mdash; an MRI scan is essential, particularly if there is to be a neurology division, a specialty which, I understand, will exist.  That service is essential if the hospital is to be of a high quality and top grade in terms of design and facilities.  I am not asking for a large number of specialities to be allocated to the hospital.  I recognise that if public money is to be used efficiently, specialities must be organised in the most efficient way possible.  There may be some areas where we should not provide any service and where we should fund patients to go abroad for treatment. That may be more cost efficient. If we are to have a neurology department, we should have an MRI scan.</P>
    <P>The construction and opening of the Tallaght Hospital is the final piece in the infrastructural jigsaw in the Tallaght area.  In the space of a decade a large community of 70,000 people with virtually no services has grown into a city with services second to none.  The <Col N="34" /> people in the Tallaght region have been given a great boost by seeing the hospital proceeding so rapidly and knowing it will be opened on schedule.</P>
    <P>On the question of staffing, I acknowledge a Protocol has been agreed by the Department, the managmement and the unions in relation to the transfer of staff to the Tallaght Hospital but great effort should be made to ensure that non-medical staff are recruited locally.  If facilities such as this exist in a community, and if there is not some local input where jobs are concerned &mdash; Tallaght is an area of very high unemployment &mdash; the hospital will not be as respected and as well received as it might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>Canteen, security, cleaning and other non-medical staff, will have to be newly recruited because there is insufficient staff in the existing hospitals and many of them live locally and may not want to move to Tallaght.  Whoever is responsible for recruitment should ensure that as many of the new staff as possible are recruited from the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>A young Tallaght man, Bob Byrne, died tragically five weeks ago from a terminal illness.  In 1991 he was a candidate in the local elections campaigning for the Tallaght Hospital.  He was to the forefront of the campaign in Tallaght. Many people in Tallaght would like to see some part of the hospital, perhaps a ward, dedicated to his name.  I ask the Minister and the board to examine that possibility because many community leaders in Tallaght have raised this matter with me and with other Deputies in the area.  Such a dedication would be a fitting tribute to a wonderful man who died so tragically.  When I visited him just before he died he spoke about Tallaght Hospital and how pleased he was that it would be opened next year.</P>
    <P>There is much local interest in who will man the shops in the hospital.  I do not want to go into that now, other than to say the units should be put to public tender and there should be a fair competitive procedure.  Any facilities that have to be provided in a hospital of this size should have as much support from <Col N="35" /> the local community as possible.  If people believe arrangements are being made behind closed doors and they have not had an opportunity to tender for some of these services, that is not appropriate as far as public projects are concerned and it is unwise from the point of view of the hospital, its reputation and its future.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the manner in which he has been able to smooth out the various difficulties and the speed with which he has done that.  It augurs well for the management of the new hospital that agreement has been reached on the manner in which the hospital will be governed and the amendment of the charter of the Adelaide Hospital.  The fine traditions upheld in all three hospitals in the city centre will be upheld in Tallaght because of the commitment, maturity and common sense shown at this early stage.</P>
    <P>I speak for all the representatives in the constituency who have campaigned for this hospital for as long as they have been Members of this House; many of us wondered if we would ever see it. There was a time when we did not believe Tallaght Hospital would be built.  Many sod turning ceremonies took place; every time we had an election a sod turning ceremony would be held.  I am pleased this Minister has not engaged in ceremonies of that kind and I pay tribute to him for the contribution he made to ensuring the hospital is established quickly and efficiently and with agreement from the three constituent hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Harney refer to the huge demographic changes which have taken place on the western side of our city.  We will now have three cities, each with a population approaching 100,000 people, within the next ten years.  They are Tallaght, Lucan-Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. Deputy Harney has the privilege of representing one of those areas and part of another.  I have the privilege <Col N="36" /> of representing Blanchardstown and the Lucan half of the second city.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has resolved the difficulties and I congratulate him on that.  I wish the new hospital well but I would like to put in a plea for Blanchardstown before I address the measure.  As the Minister is well aware there is a hospital in Blanchardstown, an old sanatorium, which requires considerable physical modernisation.  There is currently a proposal before Fingal County Council to dispose of some lands within the ownership of the hospital.  There is a view that it is unfortunate that a development not envisaged in the county development plan must take place to finance improvements in the physical structure of the hospital.  I do not want to stray any further on that subject other than to make a plea to the Minister to commit the necessary funds to secure improvements at that hospital.</P>
      <P>Enormous demographic changes have taken place in the western side of the city and whether we talk about public transport, the provision of town centre facilities, hospital facilities or regional colleges, the infrastructural jigsaw to which Deputy Harney referred is of great importance in that part of the city.  While we have population decline in many parts of the country, this is a region which has a massive population increase.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill because it will give legal effect to the proposed charter for the new hospital at Tallaght.  The Bill provides a sound foundation for the future of medicine in western Dublin, in Dublin generally and in Ireland.  Each of the three hospitals that have combined into this one hospital has been part of the great history of Dublin medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Meath Hospital, whose origins are in the 1750s, the National Children's Hospital, founded in 1821 and the Adelaide Hospital, created in 1839, contributed to what is known as the golden age of Dublin medicine and formed the Dublin school of medicine. <Col N="37" /> That was done in partnership with Trinity College, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons and with other hospitals of equal age in this city. Throughout the 19th century Ireland, particularly Dublin, led the world in advances of all kinds in the practice of medicine.  The teaching and research in medicine conducted in Dublin acquired an international reputation and received international acclaim.</P>
    <P>The charter I support today makes provision for an institutional arrangement between this new hospital and Trinity College.  There will be a representative of the college on the board of the hospital.  Much work has already been done to give form and substance to the relationship between the college and the hospital.  A clinical sciences building is planned in association with the education building at the hospital. That building will provide research and teaching accommodation for the medical and dental staff and their students as well as the staff and students in dietetics and nutrition, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social work and speech therapy.  There will be academic departments of clinical medicine and surgery, paediatrics, psychiatry, community health and general practice.</P>
    <P>As well as general professorships in these areas, there will be named Chairs beginning with the Henry Marsh Chair of child and adolescent psychiatry to be followed by the Denis Burkilt Chair and the Robert Graves Chair.  These chairs honour medical men of great clinical distinction in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of these developments have been undertaken by Trinity College and the hospital in association with the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The college has already begun work in Tallaght.  The professor of general practice is already attached to a practice in the area.  His department has given substantial support to the community health group of the Jobstown integrated development project which the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, recently acknowledged when he launched its report.  This activity is indicative of the <Col N="38" /> way in which community health must be a central focus of the provision of health care in the west Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I dwelt at some length on this aspect of the charter and the role of Trinity College in the new hospital because it is of great importance that the people of Tallaght should get the best.  They have waited long enough for this facility and a teaching hospital is one way of ensuring that the best is provided.  I hope we are laying the foundation this morning for a revival of Dublin medicine and that it will achieve even greater world renown in the next century than it did in the last.  It is important to establish a complementary partnership of health care between this new hospital and St. James's Hospital which is also part of the planning of Trinity College as far as its contribution to this project is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  I also thank them for their strong support and welcome for the statutory provisions we are putting in place to underpin the board designate of Tallaght hospital and allow it to operate on a firm legal foundation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn raised a number of points.  She asked for assurances that treatment will be available for people in the areas where the existing hospitals are located.  I assure her there will be no deficiency in the service to local people.  There has been great movement of people, as she, Deputy Harney and Deputy Lenihan mentioned. One would not plan the services now in such a way that there are three hospitals in the constituency of Dublin South East.  People still need services and there are good hospitals not too far away.  We are conscious that any diminution in the level of services to local people must be avoided and we will take every measure to ensure there is no deficiency in the service provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn asked for a designated response unit to avoid the growth of conflict in the hospital.  I <Col N="39" /> would be happy to put unified management structures in place prior to the move to Tallaght.  The committed support of my Department will ensure that we do not have a repeat of the situation which occurred previously, particularly in the transfer to Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>The board, which will be on a statutory basis and which is already informally in place, will not only have the task of organising the move to Tallaght and subsequently managing the hospital in Tallaght, it will be the unified board for the three existing hospitals in the meantime.  It will have the authority to make the necessary arrangements and will fulfil two functions.  It will replace the three separate boards of the existing hospitals and it will run the three hospitals.  What impressed me most when I visited Oxford for the first time was the university buildings scattered throughout the town.  This is similar in that it will be one hospital with three different locations from the time the board is appointed and then the movement will be organised in one location. I accept the Deputy's point.  We will monitor the situation to ensure that the seeds of conflict are not sown before the movement to Tallaght because when difficulties get into the a system, they take a long time to iron out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn also asked for a consumer representative on the board.  It is a voluntary hospital with a model in what we are authorising for the appointment of the board.  I have an appointment function, but I am appointing on the basis of nominations made to me by the president of the hospital.  I hope the constituent nominating bodies listen to the views expressed here because the consumer, whoever that might be, should be represented on the board.  Either one of the hospitals or the president of the hospital, all of whom have either appointment or nominating functions, should listen to the good advice given here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney said there should be GP representation on the board &mdash; advice which could also be taken on <Col N="40" /> board.  If we want a hospital in Tallaght which seeks to give a similar service in terms of primary and secondary care, then a suitable representative of the local cohort of GPs would be an appropriate person.  I do not have the power to appoint a GP or a consumer to the board, but I am happy with the people who have been nominated so far.  They are members of different professions, including many medical people, and they will form part of the designated board.  There will be other opportunities in future to make changes and the advice given here could be taken into account at that stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the argument which flares now and again about whether the services will be adequate, particularly in terms of bed provision, it is wrong to make comparisons with Beaumont Hospital.  If I recall correctly, Beaumont Hospital was put in place quickly in response to the needs of north Dublin. At that time, Mr. Charles Haughey decided that rather than incurring further delay by planning the new hospital, he would use the design of the Wilton in Cork and with some modifications it was put in place.  The Wilton must have been planned in the late 1950s or 1960s.  At that time and until recently, if one was trying to measure the workload of a hospital, one would probably do so in terms of the number of beds.  However, that is not the way any more.  There is now a massive movement towards day care and the proper way to measure hospitals is on an inpatient and day clinic basis.  In that context there is a difference in the comparative figures of beds <i>per capita</i> to the catchment area.</P>
    <P>Some 513 beds are being provided as follows: standard ward, 54 single private rooms, 279; children's units, 17 private 12 day beds, 67; intensive care, ten; coronary care, ten; age related 30; day care adults 61.  This gives a sub total of 457. There will be 56 beds in the psychiatric unit, which brings the total to 513.  The total bed provisions was derived from the 1992 review of the Tallaght hospital project carried out by the Dublin <Col N="41" /> Hospital Advisory Group which included in its composition clinicians from a number of Dublin hospitals.  The report of the advisory group formed the basis of the Government's decision in 1992 to proceed with the construction of the hospital.  The Department's position has consistently been that the total of 513 beds is fixed and that the transferring hospitals agreed to this when they accepted the planning brief as part of the May 1993 agreement to transfer to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>We are estimating it will cost £123 million, which is a huge investment.  It will be funded by the European Union to the value of £31.6 million &mdash; 25 per cent &mdash; and by the taxpayers, who will provide 75 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not have that information to hand.  While some amounts are in contention, we are not involved in any major overruns and the extras represent normal inflation during the planning and construction stages.  Certain matters have been notified to the board, which is handling them before it proceeds with further consultations with the Department.  I am not sure how that will work out, but I am happy that things are in fairly good order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Studies have been conducted between the Department of Health, the Tallaght hospital board and the Eastern Health Board. They have collected in a number of analyses designed to examine the bed designation.  The results of the analyses are not being made public. However, overall indications from the latest studies suggest that adequate beds are provided to meet the needs of the hospital's catchment area.  It has also been agreed that speciality bed designation will be a matter for the board designate and its successor body.  The assignment of beds by speciality will need to take account of rapidly evolving patterns of practice in acute hospital <Col N="42" /> medicine, including the continued development of day surgery.</P>
    <P>Regarding the timetable for completion of the building of the hospital, I am advised that part of it has been completed and handed over to the commissioning board.  The building of the hospital is on target, but I am not sure of the scheduling date.  I am advised that the best strategy is to designate one day for moving.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We will have a big day out on the opening of the new hospital as it has been such a long time in gestation.</P>
      <P>The specialty breakdown within the new hospital, including radiology, will be one of the first issues that will need to be addressed by the board of the hospital having regard to the overall provision of services in Dublin and throughout the country.  I am sure the new board will bear in mind Deputy Harney's comments about the recruitment of staff from the Tallaght area. While initially staff recruited to new factories come from a widespread area, as time passes the staff become localised. During the past ten to 15 years Limerick Regional Hospital has tended to draw staff from the western end of the city. Assurances have been given to the staff of the existing hospitals as to their security of tenure.  Initially the medical and nursing staff will transfer and I would not see many changes in those areas, but I do not know whether all or some of the support staff will move and if they will want to stay permanently in the hospital because of the dislocation factor of which we are very much aware. We hope the industrial relations Protocol will provide the necessary support to facilitate a smooth changeover.  There will not be any major recruitment in the locality initially because of commitments to the staff of the existing hospitals, but over a period of time I envisage there will be significant employment in the new hospital.</P>
      <P>I noted Deputy Harney's comments on the late Mr. Bob Byrne and I thank her for bringing the matter to my attention. People who voluntarily give up their time to initiate projects, get them under way and fight the battles when frequently many people were not too interested, should be given recognition, especially in the circumstances of the early death of Mr. Byrne.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this important Bill is twofold.  First, it contains the Government's legislative response to the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland.  Second, it provides for certain amendments of the current law on the recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the individual provisions of the Bill, it might be helpful to the House if I outline the background to the Bill.  The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case was in favour of the father of a child born outside marriage who was adopted against his wishes.  The relationship between him and the child's mother lasted for two years, during one of which they cohabited.  The pregnancy was planned and they were also planning to marry.  However, early in the pregnancy the relationship broke down. Shortly after the birth, the child was placed for adoption by an adoption <Col N="46" /> agency at the request of the mother but without the knowledge of the father.  As soon as he discovered this, he sought to block the adoption by applying for guardianship and custody of the child. His applications, which went as far as the Supreme Court, were ultimately rejected and the child's legal adoption was finalised in 1990.</P>
    <P>Mr. Keegan then brought an application before the European Court of Human Rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  On 26 May, 1994, the European Court delivered its judgment.  The court found in favour of Mr. Keegan on two grounds. It held that his relationship with the mother of the child had the hallmark of family life for the purposes of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The fact that Irish adoption law permitted the secret placement of the child for adoption without his knowledge or consent amounted to an interference with his right to respect for family life under Article 8.  The court also upheld, as a violation of Article 6 (1) of the Convention, Mr. Keegan's complaint that he had no right to challenge the adoption placement and had no standing in the adoption procedure.  The judgment did not affect the validity of the adoption order made in respect of the child, nor did Mr. Keegan wish it to.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Article 53 of the convention, the State is obliged to make the necessary changes to our domestic adoption laws in order to bring them into line with the convention.  These changes are provided for in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this stage that a number of important developments, aimed at giving greater recognition to the position of the father of a non-marital child, has taken place in Irish adoption practice since the Keegan case was determined by the courts here in 1990. These developments are designed to ensure that adoption agencies endeavour to consult fathers and ascertain their attitude before children are placed with adopting parents.  While these changes occurred too late to benefit Mr. Keegan, <Col N="47" /> they are acknowledged by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment. These measures form the basis of the Government's legislative response to the judgment.</P>
    <P>Central to the Government's approach is the introduction of a new statutory procedure for consulting fathers of a non-marital child, before the child is placed for adoption by an adoption agency, so as to afford him an opportunity of exercising his right to apply for guardianship and-or custody of the child, if he so wishes.  Where a father raises no objections, the placement may proceed without further reference to him.  However, if he is opposed to the adoption, the placement must be deferred for a short period to enable him to institute proceedings for guardianship and-or custody of the child.  If the father's application for guardianship is granted by the court, then the adoption cannot proceed without his consent.  If he is awarded custody of the child, then that will effectively be the end of the matter as the child will no longer be available for adoption.</P>
    <P>The advantage of this approach is that, since the child would not have been placed with adopting parents, the question of the child developing bonds with a new family would not arise.  This was a crucial factor in Mr. Keegan's case which ultimately militated against him.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for certain exemptions from the requirement to consult the father.  It also provides for the prohibition of the direct placement by the mother of a child for adoption with non-relatives. I will address these two matters in some detail when dealing with the relevant provisions.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that the introduction of a consultation procedure will give rise to some delays in the placement of children for adoption. However, this is unavoidable in order to facilitate the exercise by a father of his right to apply to court for legal rights in relation to the child which, if successful, would entitle him to veto the adoption. In this context, I must stress that the <Col N="48" /> absence of such a provision in Irish adoption law is at the heart of the judgment of the European Court in the Keegan case.</P>
    <P>At the same time, however, it is important to keep the sense of proportion in relation to the involvement of fathers of non-marital children in the adoption process.  It is not envisaged that the introduction of the new statutory consultation procedure provided for in the Bill will result in any significant increase in the number of fathers wanting to take on legal rights and responsibilities.  Experience since 1990 indicates that in the majority of cases, the father shows little or no interest in the child and does not seek to be involved in the adoption process.  This is borne out by the statistics of the Adoption Board for 1994.  Of the 199 adoption orders made during 1994 for children placed by adoption agencies, in 34 cases only was there contact between the agency and the father.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for certain amendments of the Adoption Act, 1991, which contains the current law on the recognition of foreign adoptions.  The main purpose of these amendments is to facilitate the recognition here of adoptions effected in countries, such as the People's Republic of China, whose adoption laws permit the termination or revocation of adoptions in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that earlier this year Deputy Woods introduced a Private Members Bill proposing to recognise Chinese adoptions effected in favour of Irish residents.  While the Government was sympathetic to the overall objective of that Bill, it found itself in the position of having to oppose it because the proposals contained in it were fundamentally defective.  If implemented, they would have created anomalies in our statutory recognition system and would have resulted in the inequitable treatment of different categories of adopters and of adoptions effected in different countries.  At the time, I gave an undertaking on behalf of the Government that specific legislative <Col N="49" /> proposals would be brought forward to address the difficulties that have emerged in the operation of the 1991 Act.  The carefully framed amendments of that Act are contained in sections 10 to 15 of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that an appeal to the Supreme Court by the Adoption Board against a decision of the High Court to recognise Chinese adoptions is pending.  I understand that this appeal is due to be heard tomorrow. However, irrespective of the outcome, the Government considers it desirable that the position generally should be clarified in legislation as the adoption laws of a number of countries, other than the People's Republic of China, permit the termination of adoptions in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being availed of to make certain other worthwhile changes to the 1991 Act.  The most significant of these is the extension of the deadlines for the recognition of adoptions effected abroad in favour of Irish residents who had not completed the pre-adoption assessment procedures introduced by the 1991 Act.  A small number of cases have come to light in which the adopters were unable to finalise the adoption process in the foreign country concerned until after the deadlines.  The Government considers that it is in the interests of the children concerned that their legal status here be regularised.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 contains definitions of key terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of new and substitute definitions in section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1952, which is the principal Adoption Act.  The revised definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo; includes a member of the extended family of the father of a child.</P>
    <P>Section 3 empowers the Adoption Board, with the consent of the Minister for Health, to make rules governing the new procedures for consulting the fathers of children being proposed for adoption.  Section 4 inserts a new Part <Col N="50" /> IA &mdash; sections 7A to 7F &mdash; in the Adoption Act, 1952, setting out various requirements to be followed by adoption agencies before placing children for adoption.</P>
    <P>Section 7A provides that &ldquo;father&rdquo; for the purposes of the new Part IA includes a person who believes himself to be the father.  This is to ensure that a father whose paternity has not been formally established will not be excluded from being consulted.</P>
    <P>Section 7B imposes a restriction on the placing by an adoption agency of a child under the age of four weeks for adoption.  This new restriction is necessary in order to ensure that a child will not be placed with adopting parents by an adoption agency before the father has had an opportunity, following the birth of the child, to notify the Adoption Board of his wish to be consulted. However, it should be noted that a child may be placed for adoption within four weeks of birth where the father has been consulted and raises no objections, or where the agency has been exempted by the Adoption Board from the requirement to consult him.  At present a child may be placed for adoption immediately after birth, although the mother may not give her consent to the making of an adoption order until the child is as least six weeks old.  As most children are not placed by agencies with prospective adoptive parents within the first six weeks of birth, this restriction will have little or no impact on present adoption practice.</P>
    <P>Section 7C enables a registered adoption society, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister for Health, to arrange for appropriate care for a child pending his or her placement for adoption.  This will give registered adoption societies specific statutory authority to make interim arrangements for the care of children.  The health boards are already covered by the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 7D contains a new statutory procedure to enable the father of a child to notify the Adoption Board of his wish to be consulted in relation to (a) a <Col N="51" /> proposal by an adoption agency to place the child for adoption, or (b) an application by the mother or a relative of the child for an adoption order relating to the child.  Such a notice may be given before the birth of the child.</P>
    <P>Section 7E requires an adoption agency proposing to place a child for adoption to endeavour to ascertain the identity of the father, including requesting the Adoption Board to provide it with a copy of any notice received from the father.  Where the identity of the father is known to the agency, it must take such steps as are reasonably practicable to consult him about the proposed placement.  Where a father indicates he has no objection, the agency may proceed to place the child with adopting parents.  If a father objects to the proposed placement, the agency must notify him and the mother that it is deferring the placement for a period of not less than 21 days for the purpose of affording him an opportunity to make an application to court for guardianship and-or custody of the child.  If notice of such an application is not received within the deferral period, the agency may then place the child for adoption.</P>
    <P>However, if at any time before the child is placed for adoption the agency receives notice of an application to court by the father, the agency will be precluded from continuing with the placement until the court proceedings have been concluded.  Provision is made for the expedition of any such proceedings in the best interests of the child concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 7F provides for exemptions from the requirement on an adoption agency to consult the father in the following circumstances: (a) where the agency is unable, after taking such steps as are reasonably practicable, to consult a father whose identity is known to it; (b) where the nature of the relationship between the father and the mother or the circumstances of the conception of the child are such that it would be inappropriate to contact the father, for <Col N="52" /> example in the case of rape; (c) where the identity of the father is unknown to the agency and the mother refuses to reveal his identity; (d) where the mother makes a statutory declaration stating that she is unable to identify the father and the agency has no other practical way of ascertaining his identity.</P>
    <P>The approval of the Adoption Board must be obtained to the placing of the child for adoption in the case of (a), (b) or (c).</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, it would be impracticable to impose an absolute requirement that the father be consulted in every single instance.  Cases will inevitably arise where it would be inappropriate to consult a father about a proposed adoption placement.  Where, for example, a child is conceived as a result of a casual relationship during a holiday romance and the father is not even aware of the birth of the child, it would be unreasonable to require an adoption agency to contact the father since such a relationship could not be deemed to have the hallmark of a family life within the meaning of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Similar considerations apply in the case of rape or incest.</P>
    <P>Most difficulty will arise where the mother refuses to reveal the identity of the father.  I have considered whether the placement of a child for adoption should be prohibited in such circumstances. However, I have concluded it would not be in the best interests of the child to deny him or her the possibility of becoming a member of an adoptive family where the mother does not intend to bring up the child herself, and it is clearly her wish that the child be placed for adoption.  I am conscious of the effect a requirement to name the father could have on mothers.  In an extreme case, a woman might opt for an abortion rather than allow the father to have any involvement in the post-birth situation.  The Bill accordingly provides that where a mother refuses to name the father, the adoption agency must counsel her to attempt to obtain her co-operation. A mother cannot be compelled to <Col N="53" /> name the father and this is as far as the law can go in the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends the present categories of persons entitled to be heard by the Adoption Board on an application for an adoption order to include, among others, the child and the father or a person who believes himself to be the father.  Conferring a statutory right on the father to be heard on an adoption application addresses the finding of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case that he had no standing in the adoption procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out new consultation procedures to be followed by the Adoption Board where an applicant for an adoption order is the mother or a relative of the child and no adoption agency has been involved in the case.  The board must take such steps as are resonably practicable to consult the father in relation to the application.  It may arrange for a health board to assist it in carrying out its functions under this section.  The board is exempted from the requirement to consult the father in the same circumstances as are provided for in section 7F.</P>
    <P>Section 7 prohibits a parent from placing a child for adoption with a person who is not a relative of the child.  It also prohibits a person from receiving a child who is not a relative of that person for the purpose of adoption otherwise than from an adoption agency.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these measures is to ensure that private adoption placements cannot be used as a means of circumventing the new procedure for consulting the father in cases where the mother does not want him to have any say in the matter.</P>
    <P>However, there are other compelling reasons for prohibiting the direct placement by the mother of her child for adoption with non-relatives.  The Adoption Board, in successive annual reports, expressed grave concern about such placements because they lack proper safeguards for both the child and the mother.  In the case of replacement arranged by an adoption agency, the prospective adopting parents will have <Col N="54" /> undergone a detailed assessment of their general suitability.  This pre-placement assessment provides an essential safeguard for the welfare of the child, a safeguard which is absent in private adoption arrangements.  Indeed, it is not unknown for the adopting parents in such cases to have previously been turned down by an adoption agency. The involvement of an adoption agency also provides an important protection for the mother.  She is assured of receiving non-directive counselling about the wisdom of adoption in her particular circumstances so that if she decides to have the child adopted, her decision is an informed one.  In a private adoption, there is no guarantee that the mother receives objective counselling as to the appropriateness of adoption.  In fact, experience has shown that the mother's position is often compromised.</P>
    <P>A further disturbing feature of private adoption arrangements is the possible involvement of third parties, which is of course illegal.  In a number of cases investigated by the Adoption Board, it emerged that the mother did not know the adopting parents prior to the pregnancy and that they were put in contact with one another by a third party.</P>
    <P>If a child is available for adoption, there is a duty on the State to ensure the best possible placement for the child with a couple who have been properly assessed and who are considered by those with professional skills in such matters to be most likely to meet the child's needs.  I am reinforced in my view by a letter I have received from Treoir, the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children, which lends its unequivocal support to the prohibition on private adoptions provided for in section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that it shall be an offence for a person knowingly to make or furnish any false or misleading statement or information to the Adoption Board or an adoption agency.  Section 9 deals with offences generally and provides, among other matters, for the <Col N="55" /> prosecution of offences up to 12 months after they were committed.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for certain modifications to the definition of &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; contained in section 1 of the Adoption Act, 1991.  This is intended to facilitate the recognition under Irish law of adoptions effected in countries, including the People's Republic of China, whose laws permit the termination of adoptions in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the existing definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; requires an adoption effected abroad to have essentially the same legal effect as an Irish adoption order in relation to the termination and creation of parental rights and duties.  This condition has given rise to most difficulty, particularly in relation to the recognition of adoptions granted abroad which are broadly similar to an Irish adoption in their legal effect, apart from the fact that they may be terminated in particular circumstances prescribed by the internal law of the country concerned.  In order to provide for the recognition of such an adoption, the words &ldquo;for so long as it is in force&rdquo; have been incorporated into the substitute condition, &ldquo;essentially&rdquo; has been modified to &ldquo;substantially&rdquo;, and &ldquo;parental rights and duties&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;guardianship&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the existing definition of a &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; provides that the law of the place where the adoption was effected required the relevant adoption authority, before effecting the adoption, to give due consideration to the interests and welfare of the child.  While Chinese adoption law does not specifically contain such a requirement, it is founded on the principle that &ldquo;adoption shall be in the interests of the upbringing and growth of adopted minors&rdquo;.  Accordingly, the substitute paragraph (d) is designed to facilitate the recognition of adoptions effected in the People's Republic of China and in other countries whose adoption laws have as their fundamental <Col N="56" /> purpose the promotion of the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a technical amendment of section 2 of the 1991 Act. Section 12 extends the grounds for the recognition of a foreign adoption effected in a place other than that in which the adopters were domiciled or resident on the date of the adoption.  At present, such an adoption will only qualify for recognition here if it is recognised in the country where the adopters were living at the time of the adoption. The new provision is designed to deal with cases where persons who, while living in an Islamic country or a country whose laws do not provide for the recognition of adoptions, adopt a child in some other country.  I am aware that a number of Irish citizens have found themselves in this situation and the new provision will be of particular benefit to them.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends by 12 months the deadlines set out in the 1991 Act for the recognition of adoptions effected abroad in favour of Irish residents who had not completed the pre-adoption assessment procedures introduced by that Act.  As I have already mentioned, a number of Irish residents were unable to finalise the adoption process in Romania and in certain other countries before the deadlines.  The purpose of the extension is to ensure that their adoptions will qualify for recognition.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for technical amendments to section 6 of the 1991 Act.  Section 15 amends section 7 of the 1991 Act, which empowers the High Court to give directions in relation to entries in the register of foreign adoptions maintained by the Adoption Board.  The amendments are designed to deal with situations where a foreign adoption which has been recognised here is subsequently terminated under the law of the place where it was effected.  A person seeking to have recognition withdrawn must apply to the High Court for an order directing the board to cancel the entry in the register.  The court shall not give such a direction unless satisfied that it would <Col N="57" /> be in the best interests of the adopted person to do so.  Where the court gives such a direction, it may make such orders as appear to it to be necessary, including orders relating to the guardianship, custody, maintenance and citizenship of that person.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that sections 2 to 9 shall come into operation 90 days after the enactment of the Bill.  This is to give the Adoption Board time to make the necessary rules governing the new procedures for consulting the fathers of non-marital children and to give the adoption agencies an opportunity to put in place arrangements for the operation of those procedures.  Section 17 contains standard provisions regarding short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a major development in our adoption legislation.  The provisions for improving the position of the fathers of non-marital children in the adoption process are a reasonable response to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case.  The Government is satisfied that the provisions address the specific issues raised in the judgment and that they will bring our domestic adoption laws into line with the European Convention on Human Rights. While it cannot be guaranteed that a child will never again be placed for adoption without the knowledge of a father who has established family ties similar to those established by Mr. Keegan, the enactment of the new provisions will minimise as far as possible the likelihood of this happening in the future.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Adoption Act, 1991, are designed to introduce greater flexibility into our statutory system for the recognition of foreign adoptions. I am confident that they will be warmly welcomed by people who wish to adopt in countries whose laws provide for the termination of adoptions.  I know that there will be an equally positive response from those adoptive parents whose adoptions will qualify for <Col N="58" /> recognition once the legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>This is the first of a number of Bills that I propose to bring before the House to reform and update the law in relation to adoption.  The establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for post-adoption contact between birth parents and adopted persons and access to birth records is a priority of the Government.  The need for such a framework is fully recognised and I am currently engaged in wide-ranging consultations with the various interest groups.</P>
    <P>It is my firm intention that the necessary enabling legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible after the Supreme Court determines a case stated to it by the Circuit Court which will have a direct bearing on the nature and scope of the framework that will be put in place.  In the meantime, I am proceeding with arrangements for the establishment, on an administrative basis, of an adoption contact register to assist adoptees and birth parents who wish to be put in touch with one another.</P>
    <P>I also intend to bring forward legislation to provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption.  The primary objectives of this convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction, sale of or trafficking in children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.  The convention was signed on behalf of the Government on 19 June in order to demonstrate our support of the instrument and its objectives and to signal our intention of ratifying it in due course.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House represents a significant step forward in the evolution of our adoption laws.  The progressive measures contained in it address satisfactorily two major issues. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, I am angry at the delay in reaching this point. This is the second adoption Bill to come before Dáil Éireann this year.  That is why it is called the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996.  It follows the Fianna Fáil Bill on adoption which I presented in Private Members' time on 12 and 13 March last.  The Government voted against that Bill, saying it would bring forward its own Bill in due course.  The effect of that decision by the rainbow coalition was to put back to the end of the year the time when Chinese babies and babies from other countries could have their adoptions recognised and registered in Ireland.  If the Government had accepted the Fianna Fáil Bill on Second Stage, adopting parents would have been able by now to bring their children home to Ireland.  Any proposed amendments to our Bill could have been dealt with in committee.</P>
      <P>There was all-party agreement on the principle of our Bill.  The Minister agreed with the principle of it and carried it forward into this Bill.  While I am happy, of course, that the Government's Bill is before the House I am annoyed and angry at the callous delay that has occurred and at the disregard shown by the Minister for the plight of these unfortunate children and the unnecessary hardship suffered by the adopting couples.  This is not the kind of response that people want from Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling revelations about the plight of millions of children, mostly girls, abandoned in orphanages and other institutions in the Peoples' Republic of China touched the deepest emotions of the Irish people &mdash; perhaps more than any other humanitarian disaster in recent years.  That the treatment of these children is a humanitarian disaster on a grand scale cannot be denied. Each year some 1.7 million children are abandoned and of these some suffer prolonged and agonising deaths in a socalled &ldquo;Dying Rooms&rdquo;.  As a people with a tradition of active concern for the suffering of all humanity we must respond in any practical way within our power and make a contribution to <Col N="60" /> relieving the appalling plight of these children.  It would be easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer size of the problem and on that account do nothing on the basis that the little we can do would not have an appreciable impact on the problem.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was determined to seek out practical measures that would help even a small number of the children affected.  Humanitarian aid and technical support are necessary for long-term solutions.  Several voluntary groups have collected medical and other essential supplies to send to orphanages in China. The response to their appeals has been quite extraordinary.  Again, this indicates that the plain people of Ireland want action, support it and are prepared to take action themselves.  The work of these voluntary groups deserve our full support.  In the meantime we can facilitate the generous response of many Irish couples who could adopt some of these children.  Our Bill did this and this Bill will belatedly achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>The law on foreign adoptions as set out in the Adoption Act, 1991, would not permit adoptions effected in the Peoples' Republic of China to come within the definition of foreign adoptions in section 1 or to be registered in the register of foreign adoptions set up by section 6.  Because Chinese adoptions are not recognised here, the Chinese authorities will not allow Irish couples to adopt.  We had several discussions with the Chinese authorities and they were very anxious to facilitate the adoptions and be helpful in any way possible. This restriction in our adoption law prevents Irish couples from adopting Chinese orphans.</P>
    <P>We introduced a Bill to amend the Adoption Act, 1991, to enable Irish couples who were suitable and eligible under normal adoption criteria in Ireland to effect adoptions of Chinese children which would be recognised under our law.  A large number of couples have been assessed and are anxious to proceed with the adoptions as quickly as possible.  They can immediately offer loving homes to children who <Col N="61" /> are living in appalling conditions.  I was angry and upset at the delay because of these circumstances.  I know this House can respond to urgent matters &mdash; Members on all sides were anxious to respond at the time &mdash; but memories fade very fast for many people, not for all.</P>
    <P>People are still collecting medical and other necessary aid for the orphanages in China.  It was not just an overnight phenomenon.  They genuinely want to help and assist the children.  That is why this House must be capable of responding to urgent needs identified by the plain people of Ireland.  The House must be capable of responding urgently not only to the needs of big business, as we have done in the past when amendments were adopted very quickly to suit big business, but we have always regarded the individual as important. That is why I am annoyed and angry that we could not have adopted this measure at the beginning of March.  At that time I told the Minister that whether he chose our Bill or produced his own he should do so then.</P>
    <P>I predicted we would come up against the summer recess and would be affected by the delay that goes with that so that the House would fail to respond urgently.  That is how politicans and this House get a bad name.  People cannot understand the reason for delays in regard to issues which seem to be reasonably straightforward.  If the technical advice was brought together and the problem urgently tackled the objective could be achieved more quickly.</P>
    <P>The Government measures represent a restrictive formula.  Sections 10 to 15 of this Bill seek to address the problems of recognising foreign adoptions effected by Irish couples who have been deemed to be suitable by the Adoption Board.  The approach adopted is to change the definition of foreign adoption as contained in section 1 of the Adoption Act, 1991.  The change proposed is to substitute a paragraph which permits the recognition of a foreign adoption where the duration of that adoption may not be permanent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> The Minister of State has made it clear that the amendment is designed to cater for the recognition of Chinese adoptions.  As such, we welcome it.  The formula used in the Bill, however, is restrictive and does not appear to be capable of catering for the various grounds on which other foreign adoptions are denied recognition, notwithstanding the fact that the adopting couples have been approved by the Adoption Board in advance as suitable adoptive parents and the adoptions have been effected in accordance with the laws of the country of the adopted child.</P>
    <P>Under the present arrangements adoptions effected in over 20 countries have been denied recognition because they fail to meet the criteria set down in the 1991 Act.  Deputies will be surprised to learn that, while ordinary adoptions effected in Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia have been recognised, amazingly the list of countries where adoptions are not recognised includes three EU member states, Belgium, France and Luxembourg. The remaining, countries include Paraguay, Peru, Boliva, Venezuela, Mexico, Liberia, Guatemala, China, Japan, the Lebanon, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Poland and Russia.</P>
    <P>We need to adopt a more flexible approach.  Like other Deputies, I have received a letter from a Dr. Peter Murray on behalf of the Parents of Adopted Parguayan Children which states:</P>
    <P>The Government's Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996 has now been published and is due to have its Second Stage taken on 3 July.  Section 10 of this Bill proposes to deal with the foreign adoption recognition problem by amending the definition of a foreign adoption contained in Section 1 of the 1991 Act.  However, it is not clear that such an amendment will provide the comprehensive and fully inclusive solution to the recognition problem that was promised on the Government's behalf last March.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> Our particular concern is with Paraguay and our anxiety has been heightened by a letter written to us on Mr. Currie's behalf on 26 April.  This stated that &ldquo;the question of whether such [Ordinary Paraguayan] adoptions could be brought within the scope of the proposed extended recognition system raises complex issues which are currently being examined, and legal advice is being sought in the matter&rdquo;.  We wrote to Mr. Currie seeking clarification of this statement but none has so far been forthcoming.  After the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, was published we again wrote to Mr. Currie as follows:</P>
    <P>We note the publication of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996.  We are anxious to establish precisely how &ldquo;Ordinary&rdquo; Paraguayan adoption decrees will be regarded if the changes to the existing system of recognition for foreign adoption decrees contained in the Bill are enacted.  As early as possible a clarification of this matter would be greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>Again, we have not to date received a substantive reply... In the Second Stage Debate we urge Deputies to ensure that the legal limbo surrounding foreign adoption is abolished outright and not merely reduced in size.  Given the particular ambivalence surrounding the case of Paraguay, which we have described above, we urge you to demand that Mr. Currie provides the clarification of where &ldquo;Ordinary&rdquo; Paraguayan adoption decress will stand as regards recognition if this Bill becomes law, which we have so far sought in vain. The question to be answered is: &ldquo;Is the Minister completely satisfied, on the basis of the legal advice he has sought and received, that in Payaguay an &ldquo;Ordinary&rdquo; Paraguayan adoption has substantially the same legal effect as regards guardianship of the child as <Col N="64" /> adoption effected by an Irish adoption order does?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They want a clear answer to this question. Presumably, the adoptive parents of children adopted in the countries mentioned find themselves in a similar situation and are also seeking clarification. If the Minister of State is not in a position to resolve these issues now, would it not be better to take a different approach?  We do not want to place bureaucratic, legal, technocratic or other obstacles in the way, rather we want to be helpful.  We want to ensure the Minister of State will have the flexibility he needs in solving any problems so that we do not have to come back to deal with a further Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that the formula used in the Bill is too rigid and restrictive and will fail to permit the recognition of adoptions effected abroad by approved Irish couples.  I have cited some instances.</P>
    <P>In our Bill, which was voted down by the Government, we proposed to give the Minister of State the power to designate the countries whose adoptions we would recognise even though they fail to meet the strict criteria for recognition set down in the 1991 Act.  In other words, we are prepared to give him the power by regulation to deal with these variations.  He may in time decide to tidy up any outstanding matters.  I did this many times. The question is whether one should put people or paperwork first.  I have always believed that one should put people first and tidy up any outstanding matters later. We want to give the Minister that power. Minister are given power under various Acts by way of regulations which are subsequently laid before the House.  If people are worried about the regulations stricter limitations can be imposed and the Minister can subsequently amend the legislation.</P>
    <P>In our Bill we proposed to give the Minister the power to designate those countries whose adoptions we recognise even though they failed to meet the strict criteria for recognition in the 1991 <Col N="65" /> Act.  This flexible method could have readily been adapted to meet the needs to recognise adoptions effected abroad in future by Irish couples.  While we welcome the Bill and will support its Second Reading, I record our dissatisfaction at the inadequacy of its core provision. I will table Committee Stage amendments which will give the Bill the kind of flexible approach contained in the Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil last March.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state whether and how adoptions from these countries, apart from China, will be affected by the Bill?  The Minister confirmed that adoptions from China will be fully covered by the Bill, but what will be the position of adoptions from Paraguay?  The Government is adopting a callous approach to the urgent and very sensitive needs of those people affected by the problem of non-recognition.  We must not forget that if recognition is not available an adoption by an approved Irish couple cannot proceed.  This is a harrowing experience for the couple but, more importantly, it deprives a child of a good home.  It is astonishing that the Government has allowed unnecessary delay to create an avoidable hardship for these people.  This was the inevitable result of the refusal by the Government to support, at least in principle, the Fianna Fáil Bill introduced last March and to amend it in Committee. This supposed open and transparent Government set up 22 committees so that we could discusss legislation in detail.</P>

      <P>The purpose of a Second Stage debate is to approve the principle of a Bill.  When everyone in the House agrees the principle of a Bill the Minister is hiding when he pushes back to the end of the year action which could have been taken earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where adoptions go ahead in the absence of recognition the adopted child has no legal status here.  Indeed, the status of the child is no better than that of any illegal alien.  This is an intolerable situation in a caring and democratic society.  This is why it is so important that the formula used to get over this problem of non-recognition is sufficiently adaptable to cater in the future for all properly effected foreign <Col N="67" /> adoptions by Irish couples who have been approved by the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>On the question of giving the father of a non-marital child a say in the first stage of adoption, sections 1 to 9 deal with the consequences of the Keegan case in which the State was held by the European Court of Human Rights to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to have in its adoption law a provision which gave the father of a non-marital child the right to be consulted before his child was placed for adoption by the mother. Members on this side of the House are mindful of the extremely sensitive and anguished nature of the choices facing a mother who is contemplating giving up her child for adoption, but the choice is equally painful for fathers in this situation.</P>
    <P>The Keegan case highlights this terrible human drama.  We appreciate how difficult it is to establish procedures which give the father a meaningful chance of having an input to the future of his child and which at the same time enables an adoption to take place when it is the unequivocal wish of the mother and in the best interests of the child. Under the Status of Children Act, 1987, a father, although not an automatic guardian of the child from birth, can apply to the court to be appointed as a guardian.  As a guardian, the father would be entitled to be heard by the Adoption Board in an application to it for an adoption order.  The problem which led to the Keegan case is that the first stage in the adoption, namely the formal placement, normally takes place during the first few weeks of the child's life before the father has a chance to apply to the court to be appointed as a guardian.  In most cases by the time the formal application is made to the Adoption Board the child has been in the care of the adopters for some considerable time and as a result has bonded with the adopting parents.  In such cases applications by the adopters to the High Court under the 1974 Act to have the adoption order made, even though the <Col N="68" /> birth mother refuses her consent to the making of the order, have usually decided in favour of the making of the adoption order on the grounds that at that stage in the child's life it would not be in his or her interest to be separated from the adopters.  We are satisfied that the Bill will give the father a say before the initial placement.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains elaborate provisions to deal with the variety of situations which can be predicted to exist in the difficult circumstances where either an established relationship is breaking down or where the father cannot be found, deliberately avoids contact or cannot be identified.  We will examine the Bill in detail between now and Committee Stage to ensure that adequate safeguards are included to properly protect the interests of all the highly vulnerable people caught in these human dramas.  We will support the Second Reading of the Bill and will, in the traditinal fashion, debate the provisions in detail on Committee Stage.  My only regret is that the Minister was not big enough to do the same at the beginning of the year when the crisis occurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but, like Deputy Woods, I am disappointed the Minister did not accept the Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil earlier in the year.  Regardless of how flawed a Minister thinks an Opposition Bill is, if it is necessary then it should be accepted and amended in committee.  This is something to which Governments should be more open.  I am pleased in relation to the crime issue that principle has been accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which has a twofold purpose as stated in the Explanatory Memorandum, one of which was to deal with the findings of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case.  We have not had the happiest relationship with the European Court of Human Rights in regard to its findings. It took us a long time to implement the judgments relating to the Norris case and the Well Woman Centre case. Unmarried fathers waited for more than <Col N="69" /> two years for this Bill following the European Court of Human Rights judgment.  I welcome that judgment and that Mr. Keegan had the tenacity to pursue his case through the European Courts.</P>
    <P>In these days of equality we should be aware that fathers have rights and responsibilities and we should do all we can to foster and encourage their involvement in the upbringing of their children.  Children have parents, not just mothers.  For years we have been familiar with the term &ldquo;unmarried mother,&rdquo; now referred to as &ldquo;lone parent&rdquo;.  The truth is that in the vast majority of cases lone parents are what had formerly been known as unmarried mothers. Unfortunately, responsibility for raising children still tends to rest on the woman involved.  We did not hear about unmarried fathers.  We have come a long way since 1966.  When I was doing some research in preparation for this debate I was interested to read the Nicolaou case when Mr. Justice Brian Walsh noted that:</P>
    <P>When it is considered that an illegitimate child may have been begotten by an act of rape, by a callous seduction or by an act of casual commerce; as well as by association of a man with a woman in making a common home without marriage, except in the latter instances, it is rare for the natural father to take any interest in his offspring.</P>
    <P>It was very rare for the natural father to take any interest at all.  Those of us who are parents know that it is difficult to bring up children even with two parents. How much more difficult and stressful it is to bring them up with only one parent where the stress level could be multiplied by four rather than by two.  We are all aware of the increasing pressures on families in our complex society.  That is all the more true in the case of lone parents.</P>
    <P>Under the Status of Children Act, 1987, unmarried fathers can apply for custody, access or guardianship of children. In 1993, 523 adoption orders were <Col N="70" /> made and only in 11 instances had fathers contacted the adoption board to either oppose or give consent to the adoption of the child.  Of the 199 adoption orders made during 1994 for children placed by adoption agencies, in only 34 cases was there contact between the agency and the father.  There are two interesting points here: the reduction in the number of adoption orders made, which is a cause of concern, has much to do with the fact that there is more emphasis on foreign adoptions, and also that a small percentage of fathers have shown concern about what happens to their children.  Since April 1992 the adoption board had issued a form called The Notification to Natural Father, requiring the natural father, if known, to be notified if he is not already aware of the adoption of his child and offered a hearing.  To facilitate natural fathers all adoption agencies have been issued with letters and forms for correspondence and so on.  Fathers must have a role in regard to their children. In some instances a father may influence whether an adoption is proceeded with.  There are questions as to whether the father would be involved in the future or whether he would be guardian of the child.  I hope the measures being put in place will ensure that natural fathers assume more responsibility which is their right.</P>
    <P>On child care facilities, we should be concerned that the onus is not placed only on the mother and that the rights and responsibilities of fathers are acknowledged also.</P>
    <P>The other part of the business before the House relates to foreign adoptions. We are disappointed the Bill introduced by Deputy Woods in March was not acceptable to the Government.  It was a humanitarian response to the scenes brought to our attention in the television programmes showing harrowing pictures which were cited by Deputy Woods and which alleged the ill-treatment of children in Chinese orphanages. Even if it is somewhat belated we welcome this Bill in so far as it achieves the objectives outlined then.  There were <Col N="71" /> other aspects of Deputy Woods Bill which were particularly interesting and relevant to foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>It is natural that couples here, particularly infertile couples, would have reacted to the harrowing scenes depicting the position of the girl child in that society by expressing a wish to adopt them.  While one could say we reacted to those scenes Irish couples had gone through the adoptive process in China before those allegations were made and those programmes were shown.  During the previous debate on the adoption Bill in March I referred to a couple who had been in contact with me.  They had been waiting some three years to adopt their baby from China and their papers were in Beijing.  They had been told by the adoption board that everything was in order but their hopes were dashed when the Chinese authorities were subsequently informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs that the adoption could not be recognised as valid under Irish law.  Naturally the Chinese authorities would not allow children to be brought into a jurisdiction where they could not receive the full protection of the law.  This was heart breaking for that couple who had gone through all the proper procedures, had been deemed suitable adoptive parents and had been accepted by the Chinese authorities as adoptive parents.  The couple met the child and held it in their arms only to have it taken away again.</P>
    <P>We should be reluctant to be too critical of another country's record on the treatment of children in light of recent revelations about abuses here.  We cannot condone abuse anywhere but we should be secure in the knowledge that our values and standards as a society are beyond reproach.</P>
    <P>We must also deal with the difficulties surrounding cross cultural adoptions. While not discouraging Irish couples from adopting children abroad and bringing them up in a caring environment, we must deal with the emotional needs and behavioural problems that are intrinsic to cross cultural <Col N="72" /> adoptions.  We must take account of the caution expressed by the Adult Adoptees Association who stated that cross cultural adoptions are fraught with difficulties for the adopted persons.  The closed adoption system here adds to the difficulties of foreign children and their original families who may want to reestablish contact in the future.  Such children also face linguistic and cultural difficulties which are obvious when they return to their countries of origin.</P>
    <P>Specialised training is required to integrate such institutionalised children into family life here.  Due to a lack of resources for statutory support systems, some Romanian children were returned to their orphanages when difficulties became insurmountable for their Irish adoptive families.  Of course Irish couples should have the freedom to adopt children from other countries, provided they go through the due process, but we must set up post-adoption facilities for families and children to cope with the strains imposed by cross cultural adoptions.</P>
    <P>Members have already referred to the incompatible States which have allowed Irish families adopt children through their courts, but in most cases their status is not recognised here.  The parents of adopted Paraguayan children want to know if the Minister is satisfied, on the basis of the legal advice he promised to seek, that an ordinary Paraguayan adoption has the same legal effect in terms of a child's guardianship as an adoption affected by an Irish adoption order.  Similar difficulties are encountered by parents adopting children from many other countries.  This matter can be discussed further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that, having gone through the arduous and long assessment procedures involved in obtaining the Adoption Board declaration and the entry visa from the Department of Justice, the children could be regarded as second class citizens here and in the European Union.  It is unfair that people are allowed go through such lengthy procedures when the status of the <Col N="73" /> adopted children may not be recognised here.  Putative adoptive parents should be treated as fairly as possible and support services put in place to help parents deal with the difficulties they encounter when adopting children abroad.  It would be wrong to talk about adoption without referring to the need for after care services for parents and children.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about contact registers, the possibility of children contacting their birth mothers and <i>vice versa.</i>  We are told of children who were secretly brought to the US for adoption.  I know a woman who did not receive a birth certificate and when applying for a pension had to go through court records to prove she was a person.  I am sure there are many similar cases.  I want the Minister to adhere to his commitment to establish a contact register as soon as possible.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, promised to set up such a register. When will that take place?  The Minister stated that this is the first of a number of Bills he proposes to bring before the House to reform and update the law in relation to adoption and that contact between birth parents and adopted persons and access to birth records is a priority of the Government.  What does he mean by &ldquo;priority&rdquo;?  We are all aware of the heartbreak and uncertainty some adopted people have experienced. I have a close friend who was adopted.</P>
    <P>Many adopted children believe they were abandoned by their mothers, but nothing could be further from the truth. We know the climate of secrecy and shame that surrounded unmarried mothers in our society some years ago. Children were literally taken from their natural mothers.  Many women, some as young as 16, had to give up their children for adoption.  Many of those children subsequently believed they were abandoned and this caused great psychological damage to the mothers and children concerned.  We have only recently come to terms with the human suffering of those people.  I hope a contact register is set up sooner rather than later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The proposal for territorial employment pacts forms part of the proposals made by President Santer for a European employment pact.  These proposals were considered by the tripartite conference held under the Italian Presidency in Rome, and later by the European Council meeting in Florence.</P>
      <P>The social partners meeting in Rome endorsed the broad strategy contained in President Santer's proposals.  In particular, they welcomed the approach which seeks to combine sound macroeconomic policy, the orientation of EU policies to maximise growth and employment and the adaptation of the labour market.  The discussions in Rome endorsed the importance of social dialogue at both national and EU levels. The Government welcomes the social partners' endorsement of President Santer's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusions of this tripartite conference were taken into account by the European Council meeting in Florence when it considered President Santer's proposals.  In that context, the European <Col N="75" /> Council invited member states to select regions or cities which would provide the basis for pilot projects on territorial and local employment pacts.  This is a recognition of the importance of local effort for economic development and job creation.  This approach is already reflected in Ireland in the emphasis we have placed upon local development strategies.  The area based partnerships, established on a pilot basis under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> are themselves based on a local employment pact between employers, trade unions, State agencies and the local communities.</P>
    <P>I envisage that all of the Irish partnership areas will participate in some way in this new Europe-wide arrangement. There are 11 partnership companies in Dublin and I envisage that it would be useful to have an overall employment pact for Dublin which would reflect the work and ideas of all of the partnership companies.  I will be progressing this proposal in association with the Minister of State at my Department with special responsibility for local development, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have read the conclusions and data correctly, the Florence summit did not progress the work of President Santer in any important way. President Santer and his officials have been criticised in the European press recently for putting forward the proposals in that form on the basis that they had not sorted out the issue in advance. A major part of the trans-European network was rejected almost in its totality. Does the Taoiseach see any possible way of getting that back on the rails during the Irish Presidency?  Chancellor Kohl has said he does not visualise a major employment initiative within the Community and that it is a matter for individual member states.  Is that the road we now have to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach essentially taking the area based approach, which was constructed as part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> some <Col N="76" /> years ago, as Ireland's contribution for the European Union territorial and area based strategy?  Is there really nothing more to it?  Is that a correct assessment of the situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that Ireland pioneered the idea of area based employment pacts.  We were doing this under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> before the European Union decided it should be done on a wider basis in Europe.  The area based partnerships we have established represent the model which we expect many other European countries will follow in their response to the Santer proposals.</P>
      <P>As far as the wider question posed by the Deputy about the Santer pact is concerned, it would not be correct to say that the Florence summit did not respond positively to the pact.  On the contrary, the Santer pact, which involves governments of the member states and the social partners in agreeing a programme of action on employment, will proceed.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty in financing the trans-European networks which are large infrastructural projects such as the TGV Est, for example, the new train line from Paris to the German border. There is a problem given the pressure on a number of member states' budgets and the requirements of the Maastricht criteria, which are quite exacting for some member states that are already over the limit, in putting aside the money.  However, there is no lack of commitment to the concept of these trans-European networks and, while there may be some delay in financing them, I am confident that they will go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having discussed in some detail with President Santer what he has in mind for the pact, my view is that it will be similar to the approach taken in Lord Cockfield's White Paper on the internal market.  In other words, you take a range of initiatives &mdash; some of which are at a fairly advanced stage while others are at an early stage of preparation &mdash;<Col N="77" /> and present them together in a concerted programme as a unit.</P>
    <P>Given the decision making process of the European Union, which is inherently slow and tentative, the concept of bringing a range of pro-employment measures together in one package, as President Santer is doing, is a good one.  There will be much more progress on a whole range of issues &mdash; the number of issues contained in the Santer package proposals are very extensive &mdash; such as pro-employment measures, at European level as a result of situating them in a broad employment pact rather than attempting to approach their advancement on a case by case, Council by Council, proposal by proposal basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Taoiseach.  Like our party leader, I was extremely upset to note that the pact put forward by President Santer had not been agreed.  I do not know whether that was a combined decision, but it seems that Finance Ministers had a great say in whether it should go ahead.  It remains to be seen whether bringing the measures together in one composite package, as suggested by the Taoiseach, will lead to their speedy implementation.  President Santer referred, in Europe and during his recent visit to Dublin, to a target figure to halve unemployment numbers by the year 2000.  Does the Taoiseach intend to bring to the table specific unemployment targets for this period, as I have requested for a number of months?  Surely it would be a headline to set a specific target, particularly for long-term unemployment, whereby at the end of our six months Presidency the numbers would be reduced.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always a risk in setting specific targets unless one is satisfied that measures are in place and economic conditions exist to achieve them.  There may be a tendency to involve oneself in headline grabbing by setting targets without having the means <Col N="78" /> to back them up.  It is particularly important that there is a concerted programme of measures to promote employment across the whole range of European Union and national member Government activities.  It is important not only to move, for example, on training but to move simultaneously on sound currency policies which reduce interest rates, thereby making investment more profitable, and on the completion of the internal market which makes trade more easy and, therefore, makes the sale of the products of additional employment easier.</P>
      <P>A concerted approach is needed across the whole range of economic instruments rather than the simple seting of headline targets.  Any targets set should grow out of the measures adopted rather than the reverse.  There is a risk involved in the approach suggested by the Deputy.  I would much prefer, during the Irish Presidency, to concentrate on getting the individual elements of the Santer pact agreed than on setting elaborate targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the President did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach confirmed that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> of some years ago is being adopted throughout Europe.  We are doing nothing new other than following the area-based strategy of those programmes. Some improvements can be made to our programmes, but structurally they are a very good idea.  I support the Taoiseach's suggestion of a co-ordinated role for the 11 programmes within the Dublin area.  Given that President Delors put forward a package of employment initiatives at the Edinburgh summit in 1993, employment proposals were put forward in Essen in 1994 and President Santer is now bringing forward proposals, are we not simply rerunning the same issues?  It seems that issues such as training, disadvantaged areas, structural unemployment and developing ongoing programmes under the Structural Fund round are being <Col N="79" /> rejigged.  During the last Irish Presidency motions about the structural problems of the long-term unemployed were successfully passed.  Has Europe dealt with any of those issues?  Even if we succeed in putting forward an initiative, does it mean anything in a European context?  Is it not the case that, as Chancellor Kohl, stated, everybody paddles their own canoe?  While limited resources may be allocated to some scheme at the end of the year, we are simply dealing with words and with each Presidency the structural unemployment problem of the EU is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very unjust to the German Chancellor to suggest that his approach on European matters generally is one of inviting people to paddle their own canoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the Deputy's point, but lest the memorable phrase he chose to use is linked with Chancellor Kohl, in the interests of accuracy it is important to point out that no European leader is more committed to the idea of pooling sovereignty within Europe than the German Chancellor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certain merit in what Deputy Ahern said in that, given the slowness of the European decision-making procedure, there is a tendency to repeatedly bring forward ideas, which failed to be fully implemented in the past, until they are eventually implemented.  After each economic cycle the residual level of long-term unemployment has risen and that is of deep concern to all member states of the European Union.  We recognise that whereas, for example, the United States can get its unemployment level down to about half that here, admittedly at a high social cost &mdash; some of the jobs in the United States are at incomes lower than social welfare payments in Europe &mdash; we in Europe find after each cycle that our residual level of unemployment is higher than it was <Col N="80" /> at the beginning of the cycle.  That is a matter of serious concern and demonstrates a structural problem in our economy.</P>
    <P>Governments and the European Union can deal with some of those problems &mdash; for example, the internal market, the taxation of employment and whether it pays to take a job, the issue of training and whether it is a State responsibility &mdash; but there is also a responsibility on social partners to build flexibility into the way work is remunerated so that it is more attractive for employers to take on an extra employee, to employ a human being rather than use a mechanical method. That requires an overall change in the way our society as well as our economy works in Europe.  In that context the report that will be presented to the European Council in Dublin in December on the employment issue is exceptionally important.  I hope it will represent a more frank and detailed analysis of the underlying reasons for the increasing level of structural unemployment in Europe than has existed previously.  I hope that by facing these problems honestly together we will be better able to deal with them, but I do not think this issue is susceptible to superficial treatment.  It is a profound malfunction of our economies in Europe.  We in Ireland have seen comparatively good performance in so far as unemployment here has fallen in recent years by approximately 50,000, whereas in most other European countries over the same period unemployment has risen.  Even taking account of the fact that we have fared comparatively better than other European countries, our level of long-term unemployment is, historically, unacceptably high.  A structural approach is essential, therefore, and I hope that by promoting the idea of social partnership at European level we can, through social partnership at national level, build flexibility into the system that will make it more attractive, whether by virtue of taxation, the wage <Col N="81" /> setting mechanism or market opportunities, for people to either make or take a job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that we have dwelt unduly long on these two questions, as Members can observe.  I call Deputy Bertie Ahern for a final brief question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well in whatever report he prepares.  A similar proposal to that outlined by the Taoiseach was put forward under the Commissioner for Social Affairs at the end of the Edinburgh Summit in 1993 and the Essen Summit in 1994.  I am sure a proposal will be put forward following the summit to be held here at the end of 1996.  The preparation of those proposals involved a detailed examination of the best systems and structures in each country.  To clarify what I said about Chancellor Kohl, he stated that in regard to employment issues people should paddle their own canoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Local taxes, PRSI, the tax wedge and the poverty trap are issues for domestic politics.  The Chancellor is correct in that; we can deal with those issues.  Rather than looking at capital projects for highways across Europe, for which President Santer failed to obtain approval, it would be better to put our efforts into the Taoiseach's solution to the problem.  This problem concerns people who are not affected by market forces but experiencing long-term unemployment.  I urge the Government not to follow a broad brush approach that involves the building of motorways, tunnels, etc. but to expand area partnership schemes and concentrate on areas of high levels &mdash; up to 80 per cent in some cases &mdash; of poverty and unemployment.  We must do something for people in those areas rather than examine structural employment at all levels across Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a <Col N="82" /> tendency to debate this matter which is not appropriate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important also that we should look at the European Union Treaty and the priority it gives to employment.  We have, for example, a very powerful monetary committee which has powers to deal with monetary affairs at European level.  There is no equivalent employment committee provided for in the Treaty and while I would be the last person to suggest setting up a committee at European level would solve problems on its own, there is a need to ensure that at European level there is an inbuilt structural bias in favour of employment generation in both the policy making and the policy implementation of the Union.  There is no doubt the primary responsibility remains at national level but action can be taken to improve the context for employment creation at European level. One only has to have regard to the fact that Europe's levels of unemployment in different member states tend to increase and decrease together to recognise that there is interdependence in Europe in terms of employment policy. We must ensure that interdependence works in a positive and not in a negative way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I set out the position on this matter in <Col N="83" /> considerable detail in this House on 25 June.  That remains the position.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to be fully committed to the peace process. We are keeping open the lines of communication with Sinn Féin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past three weeks we have had the murder of Detective Garda McCabe, the bombing of a shopping centre in Manchester, the explosives find at Clonaslee and, last weekend, the attack on the British base at Osnabruck. Will the Taoiseach agree that the last thing on the minds of those in the IRA is a ceasefire?  Will he accept that a cessation of violence by the IRA is very unlikely?  Will he join with me in calling on those people in Sinn Féin who have influence with the IRA to use that influence to bring about a ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is self-evident that violence achieves absolutely nothing. Anybody who wishes to bring about any form of unity between people must recognise that violence is contrary to the achievement of unity.  That understanding is open to everybody.  The organisation in question can draw its own conclusions on that matter.  An opportunity for talks is currently available.  Sinn Féin can take part in those talks if the IRA calls a ceasefire.  The negotiating process is open and available.  There is no question that action of any kind can be justified on the basis that a vehicle for advancing negotiation is not available.  It is available and it is a matter for the people concerned to make a decision. As far as the Government's approach is concerned <i>vis-à-vis</i> Sinn Féin, our door is open but, if I may mix the metaphor, the ball is in its court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not answer the <Col N="84" /> question deliberately because I do not think there is any point in my entering into speculation of the kind the Deputy is inviting me to enter into.  It is a matter for the organisation itself to realise that violence is futile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for everyone to observe for themselves the direction in which the republican movement is going.  We have seen some appalling atrocities in recent times which were difficult to reconcile with a peace process.  I have explained at great length the reason I believe Sinn Féin stated on 20 May that it was willing to accept the Mitchell principles, one of which involves a complete renunciation of violence.  If that statement was true, there must be some basis for believing that some people at least are willing to renounce violence but the weight those people carry remains to be seen.  In this instance the judgment should be based on results rather than speculation of any kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that every new attack by the IRA makes it more difficult for people to deal with them, not just from the point of view of talks but also in regard to establishing relationships between Sinn Féin and others?  Even if another ceasefire is announced the saying &ldquo;once bitten, twice shy&rdquo; will apply not only to Sinn Féin but to other political parties. Will the Taoiseach agree that the best <Col N="85" /> way to move the democratic process forward is for the IRA to renew the ceasefire that was working successfully?  Does the Taoiseach consider that further assurances can be offered to improve what is clearly a bleak situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points the Deputy made and careful note should be taken of them.  The republican movement should reflect carefully on what Deputy Bertie Ahern has just said. As far as the matter of further action is concerned, I have not as yet heard any specific request of any kind from the republican movement.  It indicated at the last meeting it had with Government officials that it regarded the basis for the talks, which started on 10 June, as broadly satisfactory.  I have no reason to believe it has altered its view nor have I heard any further request on this matter.  Lines of communication remain open.  The conditions have long existed where, by any standard, there should be a complete cessation of violence.  The talks which were sought have started.</P>

      <P>We all condemn the atrocities which have been carried out and I refute the right of anybody to say they are doing this in the name of the Irish people.  As regards the slow progress of the talks process, perhaps the Taoiseach would comment on Mr. Séamus Mallon's criticism of the lack of action, direction and drive of the two Governments to try to break the logjam in the talks process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard the comments to which the Deputy referred so I will not say anything about them in detail.  The two Governments agreed the ground rules for these talks.  They established the talks, they sought the services of Senator Mitchell and his two colleagues to act as chair for the talks and they are participating in them.  It is important to recognise that the other participants in the talks are meeting one another and the two Governments for <Col N="86" /> the first time in a political context.  It is reasonable, therefore, that they should have time to establish a mutual understanding which would enable them to proceed.  The talks process is slow but the problem the talks are designed to remedy is of great depth, complexity and length of duration.  One should not expect that all such problems in these talks will be solved quickly.  The nature of a political exercise means one must be patient.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind that the Canary Wharf explosion killed two innocent people, the Manchester bombing could have killed hundreds of people but for the effective action of the police, and the Osnabruck explosion was designed to kill as many people as possible and only for the grace of God in the form of malfunctions it did not, would the Taoiseach not agree that the terms &ldquo;inane&rdquo; used by the Tánaiste and &ldquo;futile&rdquo; used by the Taoiseach are rather mild terms to use about a campaign of murder which is being orchestrated from this country, as we saw today with the discovery that the vehicle used at Osnabruck originated in this State?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that the time has come to make it clear to those who are perpetrating this violence that they are setting back their cause and to demonstrate to them that every atrocity they commit will put the clock back?  Is that not what politicians should do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy recollects, but recently in this House I described the IRA campaign as anti-national and anti-Irish and said that it represented the antithesis of all we stand for.  It is not necessary for me to repeat those words every time there is an IRA atrocity because if I do the words will begin to lose their meaning and force.  The Deputy can be assured that those remain my sentiments as far as IRA violence is concerned.  I do not believe it is useful to repeat those words with further emphasis all the time.  The Government's view and the view of the <Col N="87" /> people about this campaign are well known.  This campaign is futile and inane but it is also, as I have said, anti-Irish, anti-national and unrepresentative of all that we hold dear as democrats in this House.</P>
      <P>This is the fourth oldest democracy in Europe.  The Dáil has functioned as a democratic assembly for an uninterrupted period longer than any other state institution in Europe, with only three exceptions.  There can be no doubt about the resoluteness of all those who occupy positions of influence in the institutions of this State to deal with violence of any kind designed for political purposes.  In so far as there is a hope that those in that movement can persuade those who have used violence to stop doing so, it is reasonable to give those people who are working to have violence stopped the space and time to do so, however bleak the prospect may appear.</P>

      <P>I was a member of the Government in 1991-92 which was continually disrupted by the involvement of senior figures in the talks process, but the then Taoiseach's view was that the best and strongest team had to be involved in those talks.  The Taoiseach recently outlined the Ministers who would participate in the talks on behalf of the Government.  The Taoiseach has continually told the House about the success of getting the all party talks started.  However, he did not mention the substitute panels.  Is the Taoiseach not concerned that the Government is represented by Ministers and Ministers of State who are inexperienced, have no track record on the North and who never uttered a word about Northern affairs during their time in this House? Would it not be advisable, regardless of other pressures, for the Government to appoint appropriate people to represent the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The representation of the Irish Government is at the highest level.  Northern policy is a collective <Col N="88" /> matter within the Government.  All members of the Government can and should be expected to do the Government's work in this important matter. There is also an expert official team backing up all the Ministers in Belfast. They are there full time.  While it is true that the demands of this House, which meets at the same time as the talks are being held in Stormont, and the demands of the European Presidency, which is taking place simultaneously, create a problem for Ministers who cannot be in three places at the one time, we have made good arrangements to ensure that the Government is effectively represented at these talks at political and official level and will continue to be so.</P>
      <P>I made the point in response to an earlier question from a Fianna Fáil Deputy that at this juncture in the talks one must recognise that it is not the two Governments who are the main players because they have been negotiating for a considerable time, they understand one another's respective positions and they have an agreed position in the form of the ground rules for the talks.</P>
      <P>The task at this juncture is to establish some form of <i>modus vivendi</i> or understanding between the other parties in the talks, many of whom have never worked before with one another in a co-operative political enterprise of any kind.  Given the deep seated mutual disagreements and, to some degree, mutual suspicions between the parties there, it is not surprising that some time is necessary for them to come to understand how best to work with one another and with the two Governments.</P>

      <P>We are now in the fourth week of multi-party talks and initially there were great calls for a short timeframe to conclude them.  Will the Taoiseach accept that what is visible from those talks is very disillusioning and disappointing?  Could the Governments not do more to inject a momentum into the process to ensure we move beyond procedural and preliminary matters to substantial issues?  Will the <Col N="89" /> Taoiseach agree that the manner in which the former Senator George Mitchell is being treated by constitutional politicians leaves a great deal to be desired?  We are all fortunate that he is still with us in the process, but there will come a time when the Governments will have to use their influence over the constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland to force the pace of change on these preliminary matters.</P>

      <P>It is unrealistic to expect that in a week or two they would be able to overcome centuries of disagreement in terms of their respective historical positions.  It is evident from the talks in Belfast that there is a will on the part of the participants to stay together, to argue and to disagree until they eventually reach agreement.  While I naturally share some degree of impatience about the matter, it is important to make the point that the Governments have been working together for months on the procedures and ground rules and the parties to the talks were involved only indirectly in those discussions.  Since 10 June they are becoming directly involved for the first time in some of these matters.  As any people would wish, it is natural that they would want to put their stamp and input on the method of work being undertaken. That is only human because people want to have some sense of ownership of the process and they are in the course of doing that.  While I can understand that from time to time some of the participants will naturally want to express their impatience, it is also <Col N="90" /> important to recognise the complexity and depth of the issue.  It is a long time since there have been all-party talks of any kind in regard to Northern Ireland. There were talks on a more limited basis in 1991 to 1992 which did not achieve their objective.  Now we have talks with a much wider range of parties which, unfortunately, are taking place against a background of continuing violence. That must be borne in mind with the fact that we got them all together on 10 June and that they are still working together, unfortunately, against a background of continued street demonstrations and other issues which cause division and provocation in Northern Ireland.  If one has a sense of proportion, one would not use a term like &ldquo;disillusioning&rdquo; about the normal disagreements that are part of politics. There is evidence of disagreement in this House every morning.  Even this morning there was disagreement between the Deputy and myself about certain matters; that is part of politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Chair's natural frustration, but this will be the last opportunity we will have to question the Taoiseach on the talks for some months before the summer recess. I fully appreciate that making progress requires co-operation among the parties to the talks, but surely it is essential &mdash; I disagree with the Taoiseach in this regard &mdash; that the main players remain the Governments and they must continue to drive the process forward, they cannot step back from it.  Surely the wrong message is being sent out by the Irish Government, if less than a front-line team is being sent to represent the Government's point of view at this crucial time when we should be moving the <Col N="91" /> process from the detail into substantial talks.  We are not having substantial talks and is it not essential that, having agreed the ground rules document and the position of the former Senator George Mitchell, the Governments should stand over what they agreed and push forward the agenda rather than stand back and let disagreement on detail rule the day for the past month? As we approach the summer recess, I urge the Taoiseach to ensure the Government drives the process forward, assumes its role as one of the main players and does not to take a hands-off approach which seems to be very evident at the moment.  The Deputy Leader of the SDLP, Mr. Séamus Mallon, who is close to the process and was involved in the talks in 1992, is frustrated by that approach and expressed a view on television the night before last of the need for the Governments to play a role.  I urge the Taoiseach to play that role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government has a front-line team representing it and the Irish people at the talks every day they take place.  It is a highly professional team made up of a mix of Ministers and officials.  The Deputy might reflect upon this point, it is important to recognise that if agreement is reached at the end of these talks a referendum must be held in the North and the South where a majority would endorse the proposals. I do not believe it is possible for the two Governments alone to achieve the degree of consensus necessary, particularly in Northern Ireland, for an affirmative vote in such a referendum. If we are to get the affirmative vote in such a referendum that we need to endorse a settlement, it is essential that the political parties representing the people in Northern Ireland, in addition to the two Governments, are fully engaged in the process and are fully supportive of the outcome whether in regard to internal arrangements in Northern Ireland, relationships between <Col N="92" /> the North and the South or relationships between the two islands.  It is essential for the success of the exercise that the political parties in Northern Ireland, who can recommend to their neighbours that they should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for a package, are fully involved in and have a full sense of ownership of the entire process from the beginning.  The political parties, who have been presented with a very firm proposal by the two Governments, are in a process of taking ownership of it.  That is important if we are to get an affirmative recommendation for the outcome of the talks that we need for a settlement to take effect.  Will the Deputy reflect on that and bear it in mind?  While I fully understand his sense of urgency, that we should move matters forward, if this political exercise is to work, it is important that we bring all the required people with us.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept it is hard for people to feel an ownership in the process if they are beaten down on matters like seating arrangements?  He took me to task for using the word &ldquo;disillusioning&rdquo; but, as Deputy Raphael Burke said, Mr. Séamus Mallon, MP, said very clearly on Monday evening how frustrated he felt and called on the two Governments to adopt a hands-on approach and become involved in resolving the difficulties. Would the Taoiseach accept that the parties causing the problems are not those new to the talks process but those who were involved in the talks process in 1992 who are causing the difficulties on this occasion?</P>

Regardless of what occurs in the summer months, will the Taoiseach make every effort to ensure that momentum is not lost?  Will the Taoiseach confirm the Government will take whatever action is necessary to highlight the fact that the talks will not be allowed to be disrupted by a few people with legalistic minds who do not participate in the talks but who believe they can argue about everything?  Does he agree that if those people were outside the talks they would be sufficiently free and speedy in saying who was causing problems?  Does he agree the Government should not be reluctant to highlight what they are doing?</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat myself continuously.  In the previous talks held in 1991-92 there were five or six parties only involved whereas now there are ten.  Obviously, it is more difficult to get a greater number of people to agree but, sometimes when one does get them to agree, the agreement is more durable.  While I am not in a position to vindicate every stance taken by every participant in the talks in the past month &mdash; and it should be remembered that it is only a month since the talks began &mdash; we should be reluctant to involve ourselves in the sort of instant comment of the kind in which Deputy Harney engaged when she described the talks as &ldquo;disillusioning&rdquo;. These talks represent the views of some people who have radically disagreed in the past attempting to come together <Col N="94" /> and be reconciled.  Far from being &ldquo;disillusioning&rdquo;, that they are all together is far more inspiring than disillusioning. That they have not yet agreed is only to be expected.  We should be much more optimistic and supportive of the efforts of the political parties there, and the respective Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the longstanding views, certainly of one section of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland is that no one party should have a veto.  Obviously, when one says that, one cannot stipulate that everybody must agree before reaching a settlement.  We want the widest possible agreement, if possible, one to which all of the parties can subscribe, including the one party unfortunately not now participating because of the continuing IRA campaign.  I accept that it is important, from the point of view of the Nationalist community that there be North/South institutions which represent and institutionalise the Nationalist identity of the Nationalist community, so that, as inhabitants of Northern Ireland, they feel part of an Irish entity.  Equally, it is important that those who have a British identity in Northern Ireland have visible institutional expression of that loyalty.  It is a question of finding an institutional mechanism which can be agreed which represents both of those requirements, which is what we are working toward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people of Northern Ireland in a referendum will have to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; as will the people of this State.  That is the ultimate outcome we seek.  Given that the people in the two jurisdictions must say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it is important that the representatives of both communities, in Northern Ireland in particular, as far as that jurisdiction is concerned, have full ownership of the process and are fully involved in it.  In that context, what we are seeing is a gradual, painful and difficult process whereby the representatives in Northern Ireland, working together, sharing their disagreements, arguing together, through this common work, are acquiring a sense of ownership of the process. Once they have that sense of ownership of the process it will be easier to deal with the practical details of the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one will find that a great part of the emotional energy and disagreement centres on procedural matters.  Why is that the case?  It is because, before one can reach agreement on matters of substance, there has to be a sense of shared ownership of the <Col N="97" /> process whereby one will reach that agreement.  What is happening at the moment is a gradual and painful process of building up a sense of shared ownership. Certainly the Governments will exercise the responsibility to take the appropriate leadership in the talks at the appropriate time.  However, at the end of the day, it is the parties in Northern Ireland as well as the Governments who must recommend the ultimate package and ensure that it is approved in a referendum.  Against that background I do not think we should be displaying the sort of impatience that I detect in some but not all of the contributions.</P>

    <P>The question of married quarters generally has been examined by a working group in the Department and proposals in regard to future policy are under consideration at present in consultation <Col N="101" /> with the military authorities.

      <P>Following examination of the question of married quarters in the Defence Forces by a married quarters board convened by the Quartermaster General, a report was prepared in 1993 proposing certain policy changes.  This report was reviewed by a departmental working group which produced a draft policy document.  The military authorities have furnished their observations on this draft policy document and these are currently under consideration with a view to finalising the Department's future policy in the area.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider it satisfactory that a report which was submitted to his Department by the military committee on married quarters on 26 November 1993 is still the subject of examination within his Department? No conclusions have been reached by the Department, no decisions have been made and no steps have been taken to implement any of the recommendations in that report in a period of more than two-and-a-half years.</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept it is not satisfactory that his Department is dilatory in fulfilling its duties and that he, as Minister, has a responsibility to the men who are serving in the Defence Forces to ensure some action is taken on foot of the recommendations which they carefully and conscientiously put together and forwarded to the Department more than two-and-a-half years ago.  Alternatively he should offer some explanation as to why no action has been taken.</P>

      <P>The comment by the Deputy is grossly unfair.  As a former Minister for Defence he knows the procedure and the way we deal with the military authorities.

It has been discussed with the military authorities.</P>
      <P>This is a complex issue, particularly in the Curragh where a number of houses are based in the camp and occupied by serving members of the Defence Forces who are obliged to leave them when they leave the Defence Forces.  There are difficulties and to suggest that I do not know anything about this report is grossly unfair.  I am assured by the Department that they will be in a position shortly to make recommendations to me for consideration.  These, in turn, will be discussed with the representative associations.  The Deputy should know, from his time as Minister for Defence, that the issue of married quarters, particularly inside a camp, is complex.</P>

It is a difficult and complex problem.  I assure the House that before I agree to any recommendations I will give them full consideration. Before any recommendations are implemented discussions will take place with the representative associations.  This is the right and proper way to proceed.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme for the Permanent Defence Force was launched on 22 April 1996 and the closing date for applications was 7 June last.  A total of 1,119 personnel made application under the terms of the scheme.  A number of offers of early retirement have already been made and offers will continue to be made over the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to their existing superannuation entitlements of pension and gratuity after 12 years service in the case of officers and 21 years service in the case of enlisted personnel, the VER package provides a once-off, tax-free lump sum payment of four weeks pay for each year of potential service up to <Col N="106" /> the age of 60, subject to a cap of 18 months pay.  Personnel who have gratuity entitlements only will receive tax-free lump sums of five weeks pay for each year of actual service subject to a cap of 24 months pay.</P>
    <P>Some £13 million net was provided in this year's budget to fund the first phase of the scheme.  This is the estimated cost to provide for the release of approximately 450 personnel.  It would not be possible to fund the release of the total number in the first year.  The purpose of the scheme is to allow for the release of up to 2,300 PDF personnel.  It is expected that this target will be achieved over a three year period.</P>
    <P>Aside from the budgetary considerations neither would it be desirable or practical from an organisational point of view to allow the release of the total number in the first year.  The aim is to move to an organisation with a total strength of 11,500.  There must be a gradual transition to the new organisation. This will be achieved through a carefully planned combination of early retirement, under the scheme, and recruitment.</P>
    <P>A board was established to evaluate all applications for VER.  The board is considering these by reference to carefully laid down criteria.  The categories to which the scheme applied were as follows: personnel aged 50 and over by 31 December 1996; medical category C personnel; Naval personnel who suffer from chronic sea sickness; and members of the 46th to 53rd cadet classes and 3rd potential officers course.</P>
    <P>This scheme is completely voluntary. Eligible personnel are free to apply for it at their own discretion.  Similarly there is no onus on the Defence Forces to offer early retirement to anyone whose retirement is not in the best interests of the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear at the outset that I am not suggesting that the Minister should make all these voluntary early retirement offers in the first year.  The voluntary early retirement scheme is in a shambles.  I suggest <Col N="107" /> to the Minister &mdash; I want to take budgetary considerations into account &mdash; that it is possible to avoid having significant numbers of disgrunted officers and enlisted personnel who are eligible for the scheme.  He is devising criteria under which they can be prevented from retiring at present.  He should consider seriously a method by which more can enter the voluntary early retirement scheme with whatever phased payments can be worked out with the Department of Finance.  That is not an unreasonable request, and it will favour the Minister in having the benefits and gains available to the forces in future years.  Will the Minister consider ways and means, which I know are at his disposal, to grant where possible some of the requests for early retirement within a much shorter time than the designated time span?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect Deputy Smith there is some misunderstanding. It was clear from the first day that the voluntary early retirement scheme would be phased in over a four year period. Everyone knew that.  I do not accept that the scheme is a shambles. The reality is that more people applied than was anticipated by anybody.  As I said 1,119 persons applied and there is a great deal of work involved in getting agreement with the associations, categorising people who are entitled in the first year to apply and making the offers.  That is proceeding in an organised fashion.</P>
      <P>Any voluntary scheme which is phased in over a three year period will have initial teething problems but we must remember that others will be entitled to apply next year, given the categories I have outlined to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like a message to go from this House that the voluntary early retirement scheme is a shambles.  It is not.  My Department regularly meets the representative associations to get agreement as to the numbers who should be entitled to go from the category of NCO <Col N="108" /> privates and the numbers from the category of officers.  We have come to an arrangement where we have allocated numbers proportionately, which is the wise thing to do.  After that you must decide within the four categories I have outlined the numbers in each category to be dealt with this year.  There is no easy solution, particularly in the first year.  I am quite satisfied that over a three year period we will be able to satisfy within the number of 2,300 all those who wish to take up the offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated he will be able to accommodate only 450 applications in the first year but up to 1,100 persons have applied and the total allocation over a three year period is 2,300.  No one anticipated that the numbers who applied at this stage would be so high and this has changed the agenda, causing disgruntlement.  The criteria and inconsistencies will cause further disgruntlement. The Minister should look at ways and means of sharpening the focus so that greater numbers may retire, avoiding the disgruntlement and disillusionment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the structures within the Department we will be having ongoing discussions with the representative associations and where it is possible to oblige people particularly those who have the offer of employment outside, we will be delighted to try to come to an arrangement with them. When dealing with the voluntary scheme one will not be able to satisfy everybody but if proposals and suggestions come to the representative associations as to how to deal with this in a better way, I would be delighted to listen to them.  I share the Deputy's concern but we do not want to make people disgruntled but where there are budgetary constraints we can deal only with x numbers of people in the first year, in the second and third greater numbers will be facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> If the Deputy or representative associations have suggestions as to how that could be improved, I will be pleased to listen to them.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House.  There has bee need for some time to address the consequences of the judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case to deal with the problems which have arisen with regard to some foreign adoptions.  I will direct my initial remarks to the foreign adoption issue.</P>
      <P>It came as no surprise to me that the provisions of the 1991 Adoption Act excluded the possibility of the Adoption Board recognising some adoptions effected by Irish people outside the State.  When published by me in its original form no such difficulty would have arisen.  It was Deputy O'Hanlon who insisted as Minister for Health, in return for the Government accepting its enactment, that certain amendments be made.  I warned this would mean some adoptions would not be recognised.  On the other hand, if I had not accepted those amendments, the effect would have been that the Government would have defeated the Bill and it would not have been enacted.  I am proud to say the Adoption Act, 1991 has resulted in the region of 650 adoptions effected by Irish people outside the State being recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in this Bill to change the aspect of the 1991 Act which has given rise to so much difficulty and which should result in the possibility of recognition being <Col N="293" /> extended to adoption orders made in a variety of countries.  There is, however, a degree of uncertainty outside the House as to the exact effect it will have.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board made available a list of the countries whose adoptions give rise to difficulties with regard to recognition.  It is clear, as no doubt the Minister of State is aware, that in some countries there are two types of adoption process in operation pursuant to the legal system.  The difficulty that arises is that under current law we will recognise one and not the other.</P>
    <P>To get over this difficulty it would be helpful if the Minister of State would refer to the list of countries formulated by the Adoption Board and advise the House, whether based on the advise available to him, he is satisfied that those countries' adoptions can be recognised. In so far as there are countries whose adoptions still fall outside the net he should put this on the record.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult and complex area. The general public is entitled to know not just in general terms that we are amending our laws to facilitate the recognition of foreign adoptions from some countries such as China but to have a clear list of those countries whose adoptions will be recognised in the future.  That should not cause a difficulty for the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Anyone in this House who has shown any interest in the adoption issue during the years has been in receipt of correspondence from a small group of parents who have adopted through the ordinary form of adoption in Paraguay. They want to know where they will stand if this Bill is enacted.  There are a number of other similar forms of adoption included on the list made available by the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>There are one or two issues on which the Minister of State might enlighten the House.  There has been a difficulty in putting in place the workings of an agreement between the Irish and Romanian authorities to facilitate the continuing possibility of Irish people adopting children in Romania.  From my knowledge, over two years ago there <Col N="294" /> was a draft agreement in place which was about to be put into operation but I have been told that there are teething problems here.  Will the Minister of State tell us whether it is working, what communications are taking place between the Department or the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Adoption Board and the relevant Romanian authorities and whether to date any adoptions have been completed in Romania by Irish persons living in the State under the terms of any such agreement?</P>
    <P>The catalyst for this legislation was the desire of a number of Irish people to adopt in China.  From the discussions I and others have had with the Chinese Ambassador and other Chinese representatives it is clear the Chinese authorities have no difficulty or objection to properly assessed individuals or couples from Ireland adopting children in ophanages in China who have no real possibility of every returning to a family life with their natural parents.  The main concern is that, if Chinese adoptions are to be made in favour of Irish couples, they should be recognised in the State.</P>
    <P>It is intended to enter into a formal agreement with the Chinese authorities to be operated under the auspices of the Adoption Board to facilitate couples in Ireland who have been assessed as suitable to adopt outside the State effecting an adoption in China?  What timescale does the Minister of State envisage for the enactment of this Bill?  How soon will it be possible for arrangements to be operational between this State and China?</P>
    <P>I am aware of a number of couples who have the possibility of adopting in China if only the legal difficulties at this end were resolved.  They have dealt with this matter by being assessed in Ireland as suitable and have dealt directly with the authorities in China having obtained in China the legal help they require. Will that option still be open to people or will there be a formalised arrangement in place between this State and the Chinese authorities?  Is it intended to put formalised arrangements in place <Col N="295" /> between this State and any other state to facilitate Irish couples adopting abroad?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill will change the cut-off date in the 1991 Act with regard to adoptions effected by Irish people outside the State who at the time of adoption were resident in Ireland and did not go through the new assessment procedures when the Act became operational.  I can well remember telling Deputy O'Hanlon and the officials of the Department of Health that the cut-off date they insisted be included in the Act was far too short and that a number of couples involved in completing foreign adoptions would not have those adoptions recognised.  At that time I formed the view that once their plight and the numbers became known it was inevitable that retrospective recognition would be extended to those adoptions in a future adoption Bill.  That is being done under this Bill and I welcome it, but this difficulty should not have arisen in the first place. It was created either by bureaucracy or by a lack of insight in 1981 into the timescale for the completion of foreign adoptions.  There was an unnecessary harshness about the way the then Government dealt with that aspect of the issue.  However, I was very grateful to that Government for ultimately accepting my Bill and for not engaging in what too frequently over the years has been the knee-jerk reaction of automatically rejecting an Opposition Bill. This Bill tidies up some of the difficulties which arose from the amendments the previous Government insisted be made to the 1991 Act.  These difficulties should not have arisen in the first place and I thank the Minister for addressing them in this measure.</P>
    <P>The second issue with which the Bill is principally concerned is the Keegan case.  There is no doubt that the consequences of this case need to be dealt with by way of legislation.  My concern in addressing the issue of the natural father's rights &mdash; an issue which must be addressed &mdash; is that in some instances <Col N="296" /> children may be retained unnecessarily either in fosterage or a residential institution for un unduly lengthy period of time when they would be better off, during the early weeks or months of their lives, being placed with adopters in circumstances where adoption is inevitable. On Committee Stage we can tease out in detail some of the technicalities of the Bill as they relate to the position of natural fathers.  I am strongly of the view that the rights of natural fathers and the rights of children to have a relationship with their natural father must also be protected.  We need to ensure that we do not erect a barrier which could give rise to difficulties in the adoption process.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter which I hope the Minister will consider between now and Committee Stage.  Section 7E (3) sets out how the Adoption Board can deal with adoptions in circumstances where a natural father, having been notified, advises that he does not wish to prevent the adoption taking place and what should be done in cases where the natural father clearly wishes to prevent the adoption and brings court proceedings.  Will the Minister clarify what will happen if the identifiable natural father who is notified neither says he agrees to an adoption proceeding nor is opposed to it and simply does nothing?  Should there not be a cut off date by which such natural fathers cannot impede the process?  What is the position of a natural father who is notified and does nothing and a decision is then made to place a child?  If the natural father takes a different view six or seven months later before the adoption order is made, will he be able to stop the adoption?  The natural father will be in a different position from the natural mother in that he will not be a guardian and will not have the same constitutional rights as her, based on the court's current view of our Constitution. Even though the natural father has done nothing for an extended period of time he could at the very last moment veto the completion of an adoption by the Adoption Board.  I hope we will have an <Col N="297" /> opportunity to tease out these matters in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>My overriding view of the adoption process is that it must operate in the best interests of the children concerned. This is an essential prerequisite.  While respecting the rights of parents and of adopters, we must ensure that we do not act in a way which is clearly contrary to the best interests of the children affected by the laws we are enacting.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provision which will prevent any further direct placements by a natural mother with third parties for the purposes of having a child adopted other than with third parties who are relatives of the natural mother.  Up to now a natural parent could place a child with a person they knew, whether it was a relative or another third party who was not a relative. Concern has been expressed that this provision has been the subject of abuse to some extent in that in some circumstances people who have not been assessed for adoption or who have been assessed as unsuitable can, through personal contact with the natural mother, have a child placed with them in circumstances where such placement should perhaps not take place.</P>
    <P>I understand these concerns but I am also concerned about the effect of the proposed blanket prohibition.  I wish to deal with the most immediate oddity which arises from this provision.  We have seen from the most recent reports of the Adoption Board that the adoption process is becoming dominated by adoption orders made in favour of natural mothers in conjunction with their husbands, that is in favour of the mother who has a child outside marriage, who subsequently marries someone who is not the father of her child and who adopts her child with her husband in order to give him the same parental rights.  In 1994 43 per cent of all adoptions &mdash; that is 184 adoptions out of a total of 424 &mdash; were effected by birth mothers with their husbands.  Will the Minister look at the provision dealing with direct placements?  Are we proposing to criminalise natural mothers <Col N="298" /> who jointly apply with their husbands to the Adoption Board for an adoption order?  Is it being suggested that the natural mother has made some direct placement with her husband in such cases?  This is a very serious issue.  Will the criminal law become involved in such cases?  Will the ludicrous position arise where a health board or an adoption society will have to separately assess the husband to determine whether he is suitable?</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board has recommended that there should be different procedures to deal with this type of inter-family adoption.  If possible, the Minister should provide for such procedures in the Bill.  We certainly should not criminalise husbands in circumstances where adoptions are applied for jointly by them with the natural mother.  In these circumstances the husbands will not be a relative of the child.  Perhaps they are regarded as a relative of the mother and that solves the problem.  Will the Minister clarify this point?</P>
    <P>The Adoption Act, 1988, has been the subject of correspondence between me and the Minister's office.  This Act allows for the adoption of children who have effectively been abandoned by their parents.  The adoption applications are processed before the Adoption Board and the High Court has to make what can be euphemistically described as a freeing order which states that a child is free to be adopted by the people with whom he or she has been placed. In determining whether to make such an order the High Court is required, where appropriate, to have regard to the wishes of the child.  For more than 100 years our custody and guardianship laws have provided that the courts may have regard to the child's wishes in cases where there is a dispute about the future upbringing of the child.  For decades it has been the practice of judges, where appropriate, to interview children separately on occasion in chambers.</P>
    <P>Appalling procedures are being adopted by a number of health boards whereby a child of four, five, six, seven <Col N="299" /> or eight years who is the subject of a High Court application is brought to court and kept hanging around.  A legal view has developed that it is necessary for the chid to be in the courts to witness the proceedings or, at the very least, to be outside the door of the court.  This is a terrifying experience for a number of young children who have been adopted under the 1988 Act and has given rise to serious concerns about their future security.</P>
    <P>The legal advice the Minister of State is getting that this is required under the Act is wrong and I say that in the strongest possible terms and I ask him to convey that to the health boards.  The suggestion that because the Supreme Court made a decision about the constitutionality of the 1988 Act means there is an obligation to bring these children to court is a complete and utter nonsense and is not an issue that was ever pronounced upon by that court.</P>
    <P>No child, particularly a young child, should be unnecessarily subjected to our court system where custody or adoption cases need to be resolved.  This is a serious issue and needs to be addressed. If the Minister cannot address it by legislation, the Attorney General's office or the Adoption Board should ask the High Court by way of case stated to direct whether it is necessary that such children should be automatically brought into court in all such proceedings or whether lawyers acting in cases of this nature should ask a judge if he wishes to interview such a child. Where the judge feels the need to see the child appropriate arrangements can be made that do not involve children hanging around the courts for one, two or three days while a High Court hearing is taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate.  We regret the Government voted down Deputy Woods's humanitarian and well researched Bill introduced earlier in the year on the grounds that it would be <Col N="300" /> dealing with the Keegan case and the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights together.  Having read the Bill and listened to the Minister's contribution I am of the opinion that the Keegan case which concerned a particular aspect of adoption should have been the subject of separate legislation.  To include it with another matter was a mistake.  I would have preferred two things: that the Keegan case would have been dealt with separately in legislation, and, as the Government did not see fit to accept Deputy Woods's Bill, that the Minister would introduce an all embracing adoption Bill providing for adoptions from many of the countries not referred to in Irish law.  What we have got is another minimalist Bill dealing with adoption.  I accept that we must proceed carefully.  The child's interests must be at the core of any legislation, directives or measures adopted.  By and large successive Governments have proceeded along those lines.</P>
      <P>The Bill is restrictive in regard to adoptions from certain countries and the arrangements.  Many parents are concerned that we put in place proper procedures for their adopted children. When a couple decide to adopt, whether or not they have a family, there is usually great emotion in that grouping.  I am sure this is a matter of concern to civil servants and the Adoption Board.  In a reasonably straightforward Irish adoption the adopting couple know the age, restrictions and the procedures they must go through.  The number of children available for adoption in Ireland is decreasing each year.  In a general sense that is good.  In many instances the natural mother, and sometimes the natural parents, decide to keep the child and rear it.  Thankfully, over the years, the stigma of having a child outside the married state has disappeared and there is a greater chance of a child being accepted lovingly within a single relationship. The Minister of State appears to be more concerned about business that will arise later than listening to me.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister of State is that wonderful.  I have a particular reason for speaking on this Bill.  In a legislative Chamber Members' contributions are based on their experiences relating to the subject under discussion.  It is not easy for Members to contribute on such subjects. I would have thought that anybody speaking on a subject such as adoption warranted a hearing.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Romanian adoptions which were referred to by Deputy Shatter.  I was told in reply to a parliamentary question some time ago that the agreements would be signed and that all the necessary procedures between the health boards and the Department of Justice were in place. However, I discovered recently when speaking with a couple who had approached me about this some two years ago, that procedures are not in order and that they are still awaiting the final agreement.  It is difficult to understand this given that this couple, and others, were told more than two years ago that matters had been sorted out. When replying perhaps the Minister will give me his views on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister of State said he would introduce later statutory arrangements for a voluntary contact register of parents and adopted children &mdash; I am pleased to note the use of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;. I do not know how the Minister or his Department will express that in law, in a ministerial order or whatever.  There was huge interest, curiosity and heart searching surrounding the opening up of adoption files dating back to the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, the subsequent follow <Col N="302" /> through in the US of various adoptions and the opening up of correspondence.</P>
    <P>I have heard some sad stories about adopted children and their birth mothers when they were reunited.  The outcome is not always what is expected. Happy-ever-after endings are rare in such circumstances.  A mother who gave up her child for adoption many years ago will have an idealised picture of the child in her mind and <i>vice versa.</i> However, circumstances will have changed, new bonds will have been forged and there may be upset and disappointment when the adopted child meets its natural mother.  In some cases there can be a warm exchange between the people concerned and the adopted person may be eased into the family relationship, but it can be a time of personal trauma.  Hopes and expectations are often dashed.</P>
    <P>I support setting up a contact register. Irrespective of the role adoptive parents play in the life of a child, the bonds of birth are strong and the wishes of adopted persons must be taken into account.  The setting up in statutory form of such a register will be a difficult task.  During the 12 weeks I spent as Minister of State at the Department of Health I met a deputation led by an assistant secretary in the Department regarding this matter and my concerns have not lessened in the intervening period.  The Minister stated he would proceed reasonably <i>festina lente</i> so that proper safeguards are built into the legislation.  This is a complex area on which to legislate because we are talking about the raw emotions of birth mother, adoptive mothers and fathers, but the natural father may not be involved.  We must tread with great care and circumspection in this area.</P>
    <P>There has been too much bureaucratic delay in adopting parents from Romania and elsewhere.  It is believed the Eastern Health Board unnecessarily delays adopting procedures.  I also note the Minister intends to provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-Operation of Inter-country Adoption, <Col N="303" /> the primary objective of which is to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or sale of, or trafficking in, children and to establish a system of co-operation among countries who signed the convention.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if the Keegan case were dealt with separately.  I have called for this on the Order of Business on several occasions.  The Minister stated that children are usually six weeks old when they are placed for adoption, but that is not always the case.  He is allowing a period of four weeks for the father to mark his interest in the decision making process.  The father and mother are joint begetters of the child and, irrespective of whether the mother decides voluntarily or involuntarily not to enter into a partnership with the father of the child, the father's concerns must be taken into account.  Relationships that may have appeared promising may not work out.  Irrespective of the circumstances of the relationship, the father should be included in consultations on the adoption process.  The human emotions of this process are not always subject to reason, law or directive, but they involve powerful impulses which must be treated with care and compassion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I am pleased there is broad support from all sides of the House for the Bill and its objectives.</P>
      <P>As I explained at the outset, the Bill addresses two major issues that have emerged since we last legislated for change in this vital area of our social services, namely, the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in the Keegan case and certain difficulties that have arisen in the operation of the Adoption Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important new procedures provided for in the Bill for consulting the fathers of non-marital children proposed for adoption are a necessary legislative response to the European Court <Col N="304" /> judgment.  They will bring our domestic adoption laws into line with the European Convention on Human Rights.  I reiterate they reflect the important developments in Irish adoption practice since the Keegan case was determined by our courts in 1990.</P>
    <P>Human nature being what it is, nobody could give a cast iron guarantee that a child would never again be placed for adoption without the knowledge of a father who had established family ties similar to those established by Mr. Keegan. However, I remain convinced that the enactment of the new provisions will minimise the likelihood of this happening in the future.  In this context, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of the new statutory right that a father will have to formally notify the Adoption Board of his wish to be consulted regarding a proposal to have the child adopted.  This will help to relieve the burden on adoption agencies and the Adoption Board to ascertain the identity of fathers, particularly in cases where the mother is unable or unwilling to disclose his identity.</P>
    <P>I have already acknowledged that the introduction of a consultation process will give rise to delays in the placement of children for adoption.  While this is unavoidable in the circumstances, it is in the interests of the child, the parents and the prospective adoptive parents that any question or doubt arising about the availability of the child for adoption should be resolved conclusively before the child is placed for adoption.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what Deputies, especially Deputy Shatter, said about the prohibition on private placements provided for in section 7 of the Bill.  In response &mdash; indeed, Deputy Shatter made this point &mdash; adoption is first and foremost a service for the benefit of children.  The child is the most important person in the process.  This fundamental principle is embodied in our adoption laws which require that the welfare of the child is regarded as the first consideration.</P>
    <P>Surely it is right and proper that a child available for adoption should be <Col N="305" /> placed with a family whose suitability and capacity to meet his or her long-term needs has been thoroughly assessed beforehand by persons with professional skills and expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>As I already indicated, such assessments provide an important safeguard for the welfare of the child, a safeguard which is singularly lacking in private adoption arrangements.  I stress that the case of a mother who adopts her own child jointly with her husband is not regarded as a private adoption.  I emphasise that, however, because it is fundamental that the interests and welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration.  On occasions this is forgotten by couples in their zeal to adopt a child.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify that not only Chinese adoptions will qualify for recognition as a result of the amendments provided for in the Bill.  Countries such as Peru and Guatemala operate systems of legal adoption which are compatible with our own system, apart from the fact that adoptions effected in those countries may be terminated in particular circumstances.  My understanding of the position is that Peruvian and Guatemalian adoptions will also be entitled to recognition when the Bill is enacted.  Responsibility for examining the adoption laws of the various countries and for making such determinations rests with the Adoption Board. In the light of the Bill it will be necessary for the board to again look at the laws of those countries which it had previously considered were not compatible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to adoptions effected in Paraguay by Irish residents and sought clarification as to whether they will qualify for recognition here in the light of the modifications to the current definition of &ldquo;foreign adoption&rdquo; provided for in the Bill.  I fully appreciate the anxiety of the adoptive parents concerned to have their adoptions recognised under Irish law.  I have sought legal advice as to whether these and similar adoptions effected in other countries can be recognised here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> Paraguayan law provides for two forms of adoption known as &ldquo;plenary adoption&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinary adoption&rdquo;. Plenary adoptions have a similar legal effect to an Irish adoption and, already qualify for recognition under the 1991 Act.  However, ordinary adoptions do not because they do not sever the legal relationship between the child and the birth parents.  The rights and duties derived from the blood relationship are not superseded by an ordinary adoption and the child maintains certain legalities to his or her natural family.  I am advised that ordinary or simple adoption decrees amount to little more than a custody order.</P>
    <P>In view of this, the revised definition of a foreign adoption will obviously not facilitate the recognition of ordinary or simple adoptions.  I have been advised it is not possible to provide for the recognition of such adoptions because to do so would be to accord them a legal status beyond that which they have in the countries in which they were granted and, in particular, beyond that which the birth parents would have understood when giving their consent.</P>
    <P>There are, however, two possible options.  It is open to Irish residents who have been granted a simple adoption decree to make an application to the Adoption Board for an Irish adoption order in respect of the child.  This option is available in any case where an adoption effected abroad does not qualify for recognition.</P>
    <P>I also understand that a number of countries that operate dual systems of adoption provide in their laws for the conversion of simple adoptions into full adoptions.  I suggest that this possibility might be explored by the parents concerned since it might provide the best solution to the difficulties they currently encounter.</P>
    <P>I am currently engaged in consultations with the Attorney General regarding the feasibility of providing for the retrospective recognition of simple adoptions which are converted into full adoptions in the countries in which were granted.  If this proves possible, I will <Col N="307" /> bring forward an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods proposed that the Minister for Health should be empowered to designate countries whose adoptions would be recognised here. However, that would not resolve the difficulties precluding the recognition of simple adoptions.  If such a power were to be vested in the Minister, it would have to be exercised within the parameters of the legal definition of a foreign adoption.</P>
    <P>In any event, the Adoption Board, when considering an application to have an adoption effected abroad entered in the register of foreign adoptions, has to examine the adoption laws of the foreign country concerned.  Where the board satisfies itself that those laws are compatible for recognition purposes, this facilitates further applications for the recognition of adoptions effected in that country.  Thus the board is already discharging a designated function and I do not see how the assignment of a similar function to the Minister for Health would serve any useful purpose.  It would lead to an unnecessary duplication of functions and resources.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputy Keogh that prospective adopters should be made aware before they travel abroad that certain adoptions do not qualify for recognition here.  The position is that the Adoption Board and the adoption agencies caution couples against adopting in countries whose adoptions are not compatible with ours. A list of such countries has been prepared by the board and has been widely circulated, including, apparently, to most Deputies in the House.</P>

      <P>A list of such countries has been prepared by the board and widely circulated.  Support groups for adopting parents, such as the Irish Foreign Adoption Group, also play an important role in advising couples.</P>
      <P>There was a reference by Deputies Shatter and O'Rourke to the difficulties in the operation of the Romanian adoption agreements, which was approved by this House in June 1994.  It has emerged that a number of adoptions have been effected in favour of Irish residents in Romania outside the terms of the agreement.  This has been taken up with the relevant authorities in Romania through normal diplomatic channels. My Department will be meeting the Adoption Board shortly on the matter and it may be necessary to send a delegation to Romania to sort out the difficulties in co-operation with the adoption authorities there.  I am pleased to confirm that contact has been made with the Chinese adoption authorities with a view to agreeing procedures to facilitate the adoption of Chinese children by Irish residents.  My Department expects to meet representatives of the Chinese Embassy next week to progress the matter further.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to powerful emotions in terms of adoptions, particularly in regard to the voluntary contact register.  For once, I am in complete agreement with her. She cautioned <i>festina lente</i> and I could not agree more.  I have used that phrase on a number of occasions in regard to this matter, particularly in circumstances where powerful emotions compel people towards quick solutions, which are not always best.  I have announced that I will introduce a voluntary contact register, with the emphasis on &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;.  In order that certain weighty legal and constitutional matters should not hold up the establishment of such a register I am proceeding on an administrative basis to ensure it is set up as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some serious problems with <Col N="309" /> this matter, none more serious than the position where one right clashes with another.  The problem here relates to the conflicting rights of the adopted child and the natural parents.  On the one hand, the adopted child is anxious to know his or her parents, particularly the birth mother.  There is a natural urge in all of us to know who we are and learn of our background.  Practical problems arise in terms of medical records in that people are anxious to know as much as possible about the medical record of their parents.  On the other hand, the position of the birth mother must be considered, particularly a mother who, in circumstances of trauma a number of years ago, gave up or was forced to give up her child and did so with the strictest assurances of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Birth mothers who contact me are concerned, even on the telephone, about the privacy of the discussion and cover their tracks so that their identity is not revealed.  Some of those mothers, who are tearful on occasions, have told me that they do not want their child to turn up on the doorstep because the husband and the child's half brothers and sisters are not aware of the position and that if the child did turn up, they would commit suicide, or words to that effect.  That is a matter which someone in my position must take very seriously. That is one example of conflicting rights presenting serious considerations.  Perhaps in these circumstances the story of the judgment of Solomon is not inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I am very sensitive to the matters raised by Deputy O'Rourke, more sensitive than Deputy Woods gave me credit for in his introductory remarks.  I regret the personal nature of some of those remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is simple and straighforward. Its sole purpose is to increase the membership of An Bord Bia and each of its two subsidiary boards by one and to provide for the filling of these additional places by consumer representatives. Deputies from both sides of the House have, at various times, sought consumer representation on An Bord Bia.  This reflects not only the overall importance of the food industry to the Irish economy but also the particular importance of the consumer dimension in relation to food production, food safety and marketing.</P>
      <P>The problems currently being experienced in the beef sector have brought home to us, as never before, just how consumer perceptions and concerns can impact on our food industry.  Bord Bia, more than any organisation, is fully aware of the need to take account of the consumer dimension.  It meets customers as part of its day to day work and knows at first hand that the consumer is king &mdash; it is they who exercise the choice between purchasing food products or leaving them on the shelf. With such huge influence on markets worldwide their views and concerns must be heard.</P>
      <P>As a promotional and market development agency An Bord Bia does not have any statutory functions in relation to food safety, nor is it intended that it should.  Food safety is a regulatory function which should be exercised by the regulatory authorities.  However, in order for the board to discharge its duties effectively, it must be very conscious of and concerned about consumer requirements and fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation under which it was established &mdash; An Bord Bia Act, 1994 &mdash; requires that the members of the board and its two subsidiary boards must be persons with knowledge and <Col N="312" /> experience of consumer requirements. This is as it should be and I am happy that these requirements have been complied with fully.  Anyone who doubts this has only to look at the membership lists for the board and its subsidiaries. These include the chairmen and top executives of some of our most prominent food companies whose success is due in no small measure to the attention which they give to the needs and requirements of their consumer customers.</P>
    <P>They realise, like the other members of the three boards, including a senior executive of one of our leading retail chains, that food companies who want to be successful must concentrate less on marketing food from a production or sectoral viewpoint and think much more in the way consumers do.  In this respect they must have regard to innovation, convenience, diet, health, nutrition and, above all, to producing products which are safe to eat and drink.</P>
    <P>This influence can be seen clearly in the board's five year development strategy published last year, which emphasises the need to build stronger and better links between the industry and the marketplace.  It will achieve this through developing a deep understanding of its clients, competitors and customers and applying that knowledge to the benefit of the food industry; providing information, contacts, market support and financial assistance to companies to assist in finding profitable, reliable and sustainable routes to market; promoting and marketing Irish products at trade level with an uncompromising commitment to product, process and service quality; and providing a continuous flow of high quality market information and intelligence.</P>
    <P>This focus on the marketing and promotion of Irish food and drink products is guided by the objective of developing an industry which is innovative, consumer oriented and responsive to the rapidly changing consumer market environment; an industry expanding its market outlook, broadening its product <Col N="313" /> range and adding value.  The board recognises that such an industry can be successful only by focusing on satisfying consumer needs and by ensuring that Irish food, wherever it is sold, is synonymous with quality.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the board to the BSE scare is a clear example of that strategy in operation.  In conjunction with my Department the board has worked tirelessly, at home and abroad, to allay the fears and concerns of consumers, with some considerable success.  That work will continue relentlessly until this problem has been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Bill is not, therefore, to rectify any deficiencies in the board's structures and operating procedures but to reinforce the strong consumer dimension it already has and which is evident from its day to day activities.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has been in existence for just over 18 months and during that time it has delivered an impressive list of achievements.  Following a period of intensive research and a comprehensive consultation process, involving all sectors of the industry including consumers, the board published its five year market development strategy last May to which I already referred.  This strategy sets out in detail how the board will carry out its statutory remit to promote, develop and assist the marketing of Irish food.  In particular it set out in detail the specific measures it will take to fulfil the task assigned to it under the National Development Strategy for the Food Industry of implementing the marketing and promotion measure of the Structural Fund sub-programme for the industry.  The implementation of that strategy is now well under way.</P>
    <P>Last December the board completed its first full year of operations.  During that period the board co-ordinated industry participation at 15 international trade fairs; held discussions with over 100 retailers across the EU; made 112 presentations to potential customers in Ireland and throughout Europe; co-ordinated some 30 inward buyer visits of potential international <Col N="314" /> customers; conducted 300 in-store promotions in Europe; and provided assistance to 66 Irish companies in overseas markets.</P>
    <P>The board also developed an electronic database of Irish suppliers by which overseas buyers can access information on Irish food and drink manufacturers in any of its overseas offices. It also undertook 30 research projects ranging from basic market profiles to the identification of opportunities for Irish food and drink in specific markets.</P>
    <P>During the year two programmes of targeted financial support at company level were developed to enhance the marketing capability of individual firms. The marketing improvement assistance programme provides assistance at the rate of 50 per cent of the approved cost of marketing improvement activities up to a maximum of £200,000 in any one year.  A total of 202 projects amounting to £4.3 million were approved.  The strategic market development programme provides assistance of up to £750,000 per project based on the submission of a three year market development strategy. The implementation of this programme has just commenced.</P>
    <P>The report records the overall export performance of the sector in 1995 as monitored by the board, in association with the ESRI, against the targets set in the market development strategy.  The overall growth in exports achieved by the industry in 1995 over the 1994 level was 11 per cent.  Growth was particularly marked in the prepared consumer foods sector although the dairy and fish sectors also performed well above average.</P>
    <P>In terms of fulfilling its primary objective of promoting Irish food and drink products, An Bord Bia's most notable achievement must be its organisation of the Horizons food and drink exhibition and conference at the RDS three weeks ago.  The exhibition was the largest ever single display of Irish food and drink and attracted 600 buyers from 30 different countries.  In a nutshell, Horizons was about showing the world the ability of Irish food producers to manufacture <Col N="315" /> and market food and drink products of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>In organising a major-conference alongside the exhibition, the board hit on a winning formula.  The conference was addressed by some of the most respected business leaders in the world and was attended by senior food company executives from all our principal overseas and home markets.  The centrepiece of the international food fair was the high quality Irish food hall which was very impressive.  I am convinced that Horizons will provide many spinoff opportunities for the Irish food industry.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia predicts that overall global demand for food products will show strong growth for some time to come with the strongest growth in Asia and certain Latin American countries.  We must &mdash; and will &mdash; improve our penetration of these developing markets. The highly competitive EU will, however, remain the major outlet for Ireland's food exports and to succeed there our industry must remain competitive while at the same time meeting the highest standards for the products supplied.</P>
    <P>Food markets world-wide are becoming extremely competitive.  To compete effectively we must do better than our competitors in every area &mdash; on the farm, in the processing plant and in the market place.  In particular, we must ensure that our customers get the quality and standard of food they demand and that the image of Ireland as a producer of clean green food is matched by reality.</P>
    <P>The indigenous food sector has grown in three decades from a modest level to a stage where Irish companies are challenging for a place among the big European and world players.  Food is Ireland's single most important industry. It is based almost entirely on indigenous raw materials and currently has a gross output of approximately £9 billion, over half of which is exported.</P>
    <P>In the period to 1999 the food industry sub-programme will see investment <Col N="316" /> of £640 million by the industry, supported by the EU and the Government. This will result in an increase in output of 25 per cent to £12 billion and an increase in exports from £4.3 billion to £7 billion.  The creation of 6,600 additional jobs will be a significant feature of the programme and will maintain the leading position of the food sector in employment terms accounting as it does for 200,000 people on farms and in processing and related activities.  This is the tangible proof of our confidence in and commitment to this most important of sectors of economic activity and our conviction that it has a bright future.</P>
    <P>We are determined that our biggest industry will realise its full potential and in so doing make a major contribution to national wealth and employment.</P>
    <P>We are confident that our production systems will satisfy the most stringent standards of production set anywhere in the world.  The main challenge is to produce products which the customer is prepared to purchase and to market and promote them intensively.  An Bord Bia has a major role in this but in the first instance Irish food manufacturers must be prepared to provide an unrivalled customer service.  In particular, they must be prepared to respond to the reasonable expectations of consumers who want to know more about every stage of the food chain, from farm gate to kitchen table.  Full traceability of the raw materials used to manufacture food is being sought and will be provided.  I am convinced that developing quality assurance programmes, as An Bord Bia is doing, which are both transparent and comprehensive is the single most effective way of satisfying consumer worries about food.  Clearly food safety has significant marketing implications because if our industry can successfully reassure consumers about the quality and safety of the food it produces it will have overcome the first marketing hurdle.</P>
    <P>We are now well on the way towards a co-ordinated approach to marketing in Ireland, an approach which embraces the industry at a national level.  We need <Col N="317" /> to focus more clearly on those markets which, taking a long-term strategic view, offer the best prospects of sustainable gains.  Our co-ordinated approach must be capable of offering tailored marketing services to individual companies to assist them in selecting the most appropriate routes to market.  An Bord Bia's presence in all priority markets is a major help to food companies and their customers, as these companies seek to eatablish long-term defensible market positions.  The presence of consumer representatives on the board and subsidiary boards through the passing of this Bill will serve to enhance these prospects.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short and uncomplicated. Section 1 is a short definition section. Sections 2, 3 and 4 provide that the membership of the board and each of its subsidiary boards shall be increased by one; that one member of each board shall be appointed on the nomination of organisations whom the Minister considers to be representative of consumers and for certain minor consequential changes resulting from these amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a saver provision inserted on the advice of the Attorney General's Office to safeguard the position of persons who have already been appointed to the board and subsidiary boards. Section 6 provides for the short title and collective citation and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a pathetic response to the marketing challenge which faces the food and cattle industries since the unprecedented attack on the trade and the loss of consumer confidence as a result of the BSE scare. People are more aware of this problem as a result of the announcement on 20 March in the House of Commons.  The Department and the Minister should reassess its impact in terms of the marketing challenge.  The consumers have voted with their feet and mouths on this occasion.  We have gone beyond relying on our green image, our reasonably <Col N="318" /> environmentally friendly farming methods and our grassland based agriculture. Thousands and millions of consumers in the subsidised EU markets and in the more volatile, but equally important, third country markets outside Europe have shown their interest in eating Irish beef is less than it was before 20 March.  We are not dealing with this cyclical problem.  From now on, there may be a shift in the eating habits of many people as a result of their perception of the safety of red meat and beef products.</P>
      <P>The Bill is perfunctory in that it allows for a consumer representative to be part of An Bord Bia.  To suggest this should be a response to the challenge which faces us, given our dependence on this industry, would be absurd.  That nothing else has been introduced in the interim seems to suggest the Department and the Minister are running scared.  There is no evidence to suggest that a co-ordinated political response is imminent.  No country in the European Union is more dependent on this business that Ireland.  One would have expected that political will would have been demonstrated in a more assertive, coherent and effective way than it has up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an inadequate and belated response to the crisis in the food industry by a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who set out to systematically ignore consumers since he came to office.  From his first day, the Minister wedded himself to an exclusive producer agenda.  The legitimate interests of consumers and processors were ignored.  The Minister's agenda was a political one based on the calculation that votes could be recovered for Fine Gael among farmers.  Processors were numerically insignificant while consumers were too dispirited and disorganised to count.  The Minister's road to Damascus conversion at the food fair two weeks ago is welcome, if it is genuine, but it is belated.  I compliment everyone associated with the Horizons food fair which was an extraordinary event and professionally executed. <Col N="319" /> Great credit is due to all the people involved, including the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to introduce legislation now to allow representatives of consumer groups to be on the board of An Bord Bia.  This underlines the futility of the policy to date.  The only move made by the Minister in relation to An Bord Bia since he came to office was to strengthen farmer representation on the board by appointing the presidents of the IFA and ICMSA.  The Minister felt so strongly about the necessity to do this that he introduced amending legislation. He was not prepared, however, to recognise the representatives of consumers, let alone treat them on an equal footing.  The background to the introduction of this Bill is a series of sorely missed opportunities.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a desperate measure in desperate circumstances.  Putting a token consumer on the board of An Bord Bia will not affect consumer confidence or the lack of it in the beef trade. The ineffectiveness of this step is underlined by its isolation.  Since the House of Commons announcement on 20 March, there has been no concerted political response to the BSE crisis from this Government.  Fianna Fáil has worked to keep the political spotlight on the crisis. There have been three debates on the issue in the Dáil, two of which were during Fianna Fáil Private Members' Time while the third and most recent debate was held at the request of Fianna Fáil. The importance of this issue to the economy can be seen from the fact that no other issue, except Northern Ireland and the crime crisis, has received such sustained attention from my party in recent times.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has, from the start of the BSE crisis, advocated a concerted political campaign by Ministers to support the beef industry.  There is a good story to tell about Irish beef to our customers at home and abroad.  The tragedy for our beef industry is that this positive message has not been communicated. Ironically, and in spite of the commanding position held by farmers in the <Col N="320" /> board rooms of the agri-business sector, farmers have been the first and worst affected victims of this crisis.  Consumers at home and abroad were not persuaded by assurances from bodies from which they were excluded.  Loss of confidence in our crucial Middle East markets was exacerbated by the failure of any Minister to make a personal pitch for Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The position of our beef industry was further undermined by the lack of a system of total traceability.  Because we still lack such a system, our competitors have been able to undermine our position in the marketplace.  Fianna Fáil has repeatedly called for such a system.  Following the special debate on the beef industry during which I proposed such a system, the Minister was quoted in the newspapers as saying that the system might be in place in two years' time.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, has been 19 months in office and his response, though welcome, is extremely belated. It is unacceptable that it will take two years for such a priority issue to be dealt with and it does not indicate even a general awareness of the type of problems we are facing in the marketplace by the absence of such a system.</P>
    <P>The ludicrousness of the current position is well illustrated by operation matador on the Border, put in place as an emergency measure in an attempt to ringfence the southern herd from their cousins in the Six Counties.  The Garda estimate the cost of the operation is £400,000 per week which works out at more than £20 million a year.  In response to questions I tabled, the Minister. Deputy Yates, conceded the annual cost was £16 million.  I am sure the Garda would be delighted to hear about the £4 million savings in its operation. At a Dáil committee reviewing his Department's Estimate some weeks ago the Minister estimated that the cost of putting in place a computer system to allow for the traceability of all animals which would be compatible with the existing system in Northern Ireland would be between £10 million and £14 million.  When the Minister announced <Col N="321" /> his proposal to install a system of traceability he had whittled down the cost to a firm £12 million.  Where are the missing millions going?  Is that £12 million coming out of the existing budget?  Will extra money be provided by the Government or will farmers eventually have to pick up the cost in some form? One would have expected that despite its political composition there would be sufficient coherence and co-operation in the Government to ensure that the additional £12 million, which is not in the Minister's Estimate, would be made available to him immediately so that the necessary system of traceability, which is demanded by everybody in the industry and which should operate for a longer period than the two years mentioned, could be put in place.</P>
    <P>It is an indictment of the Minister that 19 months after he came into office and four months after the most serious crisis that can hit us in the medium to long-term, that of BSE, a system of traceability of stock is not in place.  The plan he announced yesterday might be in place within two years.  In that context operation matador is a gross waste of Garda time.  It is an emergency measure and we should be in the process of replacing it with a system of traceability. If the Minister is serious about restoring consumer confidence, a comprehensive system for the traceability of all stock must be put in place sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Gardaí should be put back on the beat to deal with the drug dealers and apprehend the murderers.  We cannot afford to have them standing behind ditches on the Border waiting for Daisy and her pals to come South.  The present operation is a shameful waste of resources.  The extent to which the foot dragging by the Minister on this issue has resulted in the waste of scarce Garda resources is underlined by the Government's crime package announced yesterday.  How many gardaí could be freed from regular duty if the Minister had a system of traceability in place?  It is three months since the announcement of the crisis in the House <Col N="322" /> of Commons and it is time to move from the stop gap theatrical measures that this Bill and Operation Matador represent.</P>
    <P>From the beginning Fianna Fáil has put forward a cogent political programme to deal with the BSE crisis.  The Bill is supposed to address the issue of consumer confidence in a more substantive way than the cosmetics of this debate in approving the appointment of an extra person to the board.  Fianna Fáil wants an independent agency to be set up that has a duty to guarantee the integrity of the food chain at all points. It is feasible that the veterinary inspection functions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, environmental health officers and some or all of the functions of the National Drugs Advisory Board might be included in such a body.  It is lamentable that far from proposing the fundamental reforms that are necessary, the Minister has confined himself to the window dressing allowed for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There must be a sustained campaign by Ministers in our main markets. Members of the Government will not have a problem for the next six months as they spend their time boosting their egos in the European capitals during our Presidency of the EU.  During the past three months not one Minister has sufficient time to speak to those customers who are crucial to the maintenance of our national interest and purchase 67 per cent of our total output of dairy and beef products.  There has not been a sustained campaign.  The refusal by Government Ministers to make a personal pitch for Irish beef in third countries has allowed the bottom to fall out of Irish beef sales without a hand being lifted.</P>
    <P>To date a Government Minister has not visited Libya, Egypt or Saudi Arabia, our most important third country markets after Russia, but I understand the Minister may be going to Libya next week.  If he goes, who will he meet, what are his prospects of success and his demands?  Following our failure to secure those markets earlier in the year, <Col N="323" /> have the Australians blotted us out of them and, if so, for how long?</P>
    <P>As an important delegation arrives from Iran the Government has confined itself to announcing in today's papers that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, will in due course visit the Islamic Republic.  I welcome his proposed visit and have encouraged him to make it. The record will show that during Question Time some weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach, given the Tánaiste was not prepared to visit Iran, if a Minister of State could meet Mr. Vealyati's junior Minister since I understood such an approach would be welcomed by the Iranian authorities.  I am glad the Taoiseach is in a position to move on that and has asked the Tánaiste to arrange for the Minister of State to visit that country.  I spoke to him two weeks ago and I am delighted he is prepared to make that trip.  When the Fianna Fáil delegation travelled to that country we were told to go home because there were minor technical problems, that the case would be reopened and that our meeting was superfluous.  That was not the case as extra contracts were obtained by us at that time.  However, the Iranian delegation is only now coming here.  The Minister of State's visit will be welcomed and it should involve not only beef issues but a broader agenda of which the Department of Foreign Affairs is aware.  I hope the visit will be a success, as I believe it will, in terms of ensuring that the type of rapport and relationship we have had with the Iranian authorities in regard to our export of processed beef will come to fruition as a result of such a diplomatic initiative which recognises international relationships as a two-way process.  We cannot go to people when we are in trouble and expect matters to be sorted out without any reference to the agenda which they legitimately wish us to pursue during our Presidency of the European Union.  I wish the Minister of State well and I am pleased he is making such a visit resulting from a suggestion from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> The continued failure of the Tánaiste to use his office on behalf of the beef industry is a scandal.  The extent of the apathy by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs can be judged from the fact that the Irish Ambassador to Libya, based in Rome, has not visited Libya since Deputy Spring took over at Iveagh House.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot deliver, it is clear that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot be bothered.</P>
    <P>To date Ireland, the most severely affected of all EU member states, has failed to have its urgent concerns addressed at EU level.  Three months after the House of Commons announcement the Minister has failed to build support for our position.  The £70 million on offer is totally unsatisfactory and no more than a short-term respite; the package ignores losses incurred prior to 20 March last, the top-up on the slaughter premium covers the period from 20 March to 9 June only and allows for an average payout of £55 per head.  This means that farmers are looking at an absolute best scenario of 50 per cent compensation for losses incurred to date before we even reach the peak killing season in the autumn.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency the Irish Presidency must secure an increase in the farm budget next year since neither the Florence Summit nor the follow-up meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers held in Luxembourg dealt with the crucial issue of consumer confidence and, to date, no funds have been set aside for this purpose.  The total absence to date of any action at EU level on these issues underlines the inadequacy of what the Minister proposes in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In so far as there has been any resolution of the BSE crisis, it was enunciated at the Florence Summit and the follow-up meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg. The Taoiseach on reporting to the House on the Florence Summit said that the lead-in to the Council had been overshadowed by the BSE crisis and the <Col N="325" /> related British policy of non-co-operation on EU business.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the Florence Summit was overshadowed became apparent at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Minister in Luxembourg. Despite the fact that the BSE crisis had been raging since 20 March last, to date Ireland has failed utterly to have the underlying problems facing its beef industry addressed, although the beef industry is our single largest enterprise and our economy is the most beef-dependent within the EU.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's statement to the Dáil last week that compensation is not a long-term response to the BSE crisis and that the long-term solution lies in restoring consumer confidence and in regaining markets.  From the point of view of Irish agriculture, the Florence Summit must be seen as a very serious disappointment.  There was no attempt at Florence, or at the follow-up meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg, to address the crucial issues of consumer confidence and world markets.</P>
    <P>It must surely count as a colossal political failure on the part of the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that in the interval between 20 March and last Friday week, they were totally unable to have Ireland's vital concerns addressed at EU level.  Finally, when something was done, it proved to be too little too late. On the basis of the criteria enunciated by the Taoiseach last week, with which I agree, the most important issues confronting Ireland resulting from the BSE crisis were not addressed at the Florence Summit or at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>A long-term, stable solution to the BSE crisis must involve restoring consumer confidence.  There was no move at the Florence Summit to establish a marketing fund.  To date Irish exports to the EU remain down by 45 per cent.  If, at the end of the day, beef is not being eaten, the crisis will continue if not worsen.  For Ireland this issue is of a <Col N="326" /> scale and urgency simply unparalleled in other EU member states.  Our beef industry is 80 per cent dependent on exports.  If markets do not improve considerably before next autumn, when the bulk of Irish beef comes on the market, the industry could be dislocated irrevocably.</P>
    <P>Unlike the British stance at the Florence Summit, when its specific, unique position was outlined, defended, argued for and on which eventually compromise was reached, I do not detect the same distinctive stance being adopted by the Irish Government in respect of our BSE-free herd which has been placed at greater risk resulting from what happened in Britain.  Why are we told that the marketing problem is that we are perceived as part of the overall United Kingdom market?</P>
    <P>The British Government has obtained a solution, acceptable to its Parliament, based on its total culpability for the problem in the first place &mdash; not a bad negotiating feat &mdash; in addition to having obtained almost full compensation in respect of British diseased animals.  We do not have the disease, we have healthy animals but cannot maintain prices.  Neither at Florence nor Luxembourg was there any indication from or recognition by the Commission or our EU colleagues that, although everybody is in a bad position, we are in a different position from any other EU member state on this issue.  We must export eight out of every ten cattle we produce.  No other country in the EU has that marketing requirement, they require residual percentages only of their national herds for markets outside their country, never mind outside the EU itself; because they have sufficiently large domestic consumer markets to meet the demand, the balance between their supply and demand is much better.</P>
    <P>We are 900 per cent self-sufficient in beef, we are dependent on this industry, far greater in macro-economic terms than any other country within the European Union, yet in none of the texts emanating from the Florence Summit or the Council of Agriculture Ministers in <Col N="327" /> Luxembourg, was there any recognition of those basic facts as they affect our economy.  Neither has there been any indication of a recognition that we may not be over the worst of our problems, that despite the fact that the BSE scare is no longer front page news, the fact that consumer trends are levelling out, with a major reduction in red meat consumption, particularly within Europe, we will experience a worse problem in the autumn.  Because of our unique cattle marketing system, the grassland-based nature of our agriculture &mdash; a unique feature compared with other European agricultural systems &mdash; we will have a glut of beef coming off grass in the autumn.  At that stage our slaughtering season should be in full swing. Indeed there is already every indication that the financial institutions will not allow meat processors to purchase beef to be processed if they cannot convince them they have markets for that beef before purchasing it in the marts or brought directly to the factories.</P>
    <P>A squeeze has already begun on the Irish beef sector, affecting not only farmers who are now meeting their bank managers with a much greater degree of trepidation than would have been the case in February last when they were already incurring losses, particularly in the case of winter fatteners who will have to gain the confidence of the banking system to tide them over into the next winter fattening season.  Processors, in a much stronger financial position than ordinary producers on the land, are being told by their bankers and financial institutions that the volatility of the market is such they will not receive financial backing for the purchase of that volume of cattle in the autumn in the absence of tying down contracts now so that those financial institutions can be assured that, at least in some cases, cheques will be forthcoming to meet those commitments.</P>
    <P>There is no recognition of that fact in the corridors of power in Europe and, even if there is, members of our <Col N="328" /> Government, from the top down, appear incapable of having inserted in the relevant texts, in terms of decisons and agreements reached at Summit or Council of Ministers level, terminology indicating that we are capable of communicating that basic fact and getting agreement on the need to address our issues in the unique manner in which those who caused the problem had theirs addressed.</P>
    <P>It seems we are communitarian, with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, continually telling us there are difficulties, that he is doing the best he can and that he is isolated in terms of support.  He is not getting anywhere and is hoping against hope that something will turn up, that there will be a bonanza on the Russian market, that someone, somewhere, will take 100,000 or 200,000 tonnes of beef before confidence goes through the floor.  It is the <i>ad hoc</i> approach in the Minister's office and in Government circles that worries me, the hoping against hope that something will turn up.  That is not the way to run our most important indigenous industry at a time when we have growth rates of 7 per cent or 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>While markets within the EU are linked to consumer preference, markets outside the EU are out of reach to Irish exports because of the inadequate level of export refunds.  We have seen the dismantling of and total disorganisation in the licensing system under the new arrangements, and the biggest sufferer is Ireland, a country which depends on third country markets.</P>
    <P>Just as the vital issue of consumer confidence was ignored in Florence, so also was the matter of export refunds. Consumer confidence must necessarily be underpinned by education, marketing and, above all, total traceability. Only total traceability can underpin the integrity of the national herd in the long-term.  The crisis facing Irish cattle farmers in the autumn remains unaddressed. Unfortunately, a crisis of the proportions of that in 1974 could be looming.  The potential damage to the <Col N="329" /> cattle sector has been significantly widened by the decisions of the beef management committee last Friday.  What is clearly needed is an intervention mechanism along pre-1992 lines.  Instead, the present inadequate intervention system has been even less friendly towards Ireland.  Last week's decision is only the latest in a series of political failures on the part of the Minister in relation to the Beef Management Committee. Time is ticking by relentlessly.  If radical action is not taken in the very near future, this autumn could be the Waterloo of the Irish cattle trade as we know it.  No one wants that.  Dislocation could be so severe as to be permanent.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will vote for this Bill because it believes that Irish agri-business must be consumer driven.  The total consumer representative this Bill allows for is better than nothing, but only just. Let there be no doubt that three-and-a-half months after the BSE announcement in the House of Commons, this Bill is a pathetic response to a crisis.  It is a step the Minister strongly resisted in fairer weather.  What the BSE crisis requires is a concerted political response from the Government as a whole which will gain recognition at EU level.  Sadly, there is still no sign of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be here for our third annual Bord Bia day. An Bord Bia is 18 months in existence, and we have already had the Bord Bia Act, 1994, the Bord Bia Act, 1995, and we are about to have the Bord Bia Act, 1996.  I have rarely, in the 28 or 29 years I have been here, seen a Bill introduced into this House about less than this.  Last year we had a Bill which increased the membership of the board of An Bord Bia.  This year we have another Bill which increases it still further.  The amusing aspect is that the very thing this Bill seeks to do was sought by my party in 1994 on the original Bill and the Government at the time said it could not be done.  I note from the Official Report, 5 July 1994, Volume 140, column 2056 that Senator Dardis moved an amendment to provide for exactly what <Col N="330" /> is in this Bill, to have a consumer representative of the board of An Bord Bia, and he did not get any support from any party or, indeed, even from an individual Senator.  Even Senator Fergal Quinn said he would not support it. Now, all of a sudden, everybody feels the consumer is king.</P>
      <P>We have time enough to introduce a Bill for something as trivial as putting 15 people on the board of An Bord Bia instead of 14.  However, we have no time in this House for a Bill on any one of a large number of very important topics on which the Opposition sought legislation in the past 12 months, particularly matters relating to life and death, to subversion and to serious organised crime.  There is no time for that, but there is time for this triviality.  It shows an extraordinary set of priorities that we are now discussing our third Bord Bia Bill during its 18 months of existence and for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>My experience of boards is that they are most effective when they have six or seven members.  Boards that consist of a large number of people there as representatives of or nominees of vested interests or sectoral interests are usually a disaster because the members tend only to argue the case of their own sector or their own vested interest.  What is needed is a smaller number of people who are prepared and able to take a broader view.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government probably think they are solving problems by having so many people on a board.  If increasing the number on this board every year would solve problems in this industry, why not be logical and have 30 people on the board?  If 15 are better than the original ten or 11, why would 25 not be better again with more interests represented?  Increasing membership of the board like this shows false thinking and an anxiety to be seen to please particular interest sectors rather than to do anything effective.  It is very sad that should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of a board like this in promoting food should be dominated by the consumer approach but it is not. <Col N="331" /> Here, in the third annual instalment of An Bord Bia legislation, we have a sop thrown to the consumer interest because it is politically correct or fashionable at the moment to do that, directly arising out of the BSE crisis which has had such a disastrous effect on Irish beef in particular which is our largest single food product apart only from milk.  We have this Bill now because it is seen to be politically correct, and the Government hopes some of the heat will be taken off it.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity to listen to the Minister of State.  I even read his speech again after he had delivered it in case I had missed anything the first time.  One would think there was not a problem in the Irish food industry.  One would think we were going from good to better to best.  What is the reality, as opposed to the fictional scenario painted by this speech?</P>
    <P>The reality is that in Germany, the biggest market in the European Union for almost all food products, consumption of beef is at 50 per cent of what it was three and a half months ago.  It has not budged from that 50 per cent over the last three months and it does not look as if it will.  That is a disaster for this country.  Instead of facing up to that the Minister of State comes in and reads out this stuff.  This is the way these speeches are put together and this is the sort of stuff that is delivered, but the failure to look at reality does no service to anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an appalling problem. I would have thought that a Minister introducing a Bill relating to a board dealing with Irish food and its promotion would devote the majority of his speech to a discussion of that problem and an explanation of how serious it is for this country.</P>
      <P>What is wrong is more than just the recent problem of BSE.  It is more fundamental than that.  The recently established An Bord Bia is yet another State body of a promotional kind.  It overlaps significantly with ABT and fragments our resources and export drive in a way that is regrettable.  An Bord Bia comes under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and as a result labours under a difficulty.</P>
      <P>Grandiose things are said about marketing. The Minister said this evening, &ldquo;We need to focus more clearly on those markets which, taking a long-term strategic view, offer the best prospects of sustainable gains.&rdquo;  That is a grand statement of principle, but in practice it will never happen.  If a new, wider and more generous system of intervention was introduced tomorrow morning, intervention would be the solution to our problems and markets which take a long-term strategic view would be forgotten. That has not happened today or yesterday.  This has been the outlook here for quite some time.</P>
      <P>I have had the embarrassing experience of going to food fairs abroad on behalf of this country and being met by buyers from foreign supermarkets and other outlets who told me that they signed contracts with Irish producers who let them down because they could get a penny a pound more somewhere else.  When one took that up with the Irish supplier, his attitude was frequently that he was only in it for the money and what he could get out of it and he asked why he should not take as much as he could get at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of taking a long-term strategic view offering the best prospects of sustainable gains.  It is all <Col N="333" /> short-term and it is not really consumer related, in spite of what is said.  It is price related.  Short-term price related objectives govern our attitude to selling our food and until we get away from that and become genuinely concerned about the consumer, as any large and successful company would be, Ireland Inc. will not be successful as a seller of food at premium prices.  We can always sell it as commodity, but we will not sell it at premium prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the food sector has moved from a very modest level to a stage where &ldquo;Irish companies are challenging for a place among the big European and world players&rdquo;.  That statement is true in respect of three, four or five companies.  They are not very big and further amalgamations will be needed for them to be effective. However, what the Minister of State did not say is that they are challenging for a place among the big European and world players because they are processing abroad.</P>
    <P>I could name four larger co-ops, now plcs, which have invested large sums of money in expansion over the past three or four years and virtually every penny of it has been spent abroad.  Hundreds of millions of pounds are spent by each of them each year on acquiring more and more processing facilities abroad.  I am glad they are doing it but they are not processing Irish food or Irish raw materials.  They are processing other people's raw materials while our own raw materials are frequently sold either as commodities or in a way which does not give the optimum return to this country.  This is because some shortsighted views have been taken as far as food policy is concerned, where the producer was absolutely dominant, or in regard to taxation and other aspects of production and processing.  This is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Minister of State's speech on which I would like to comment but one is hesitant to do so because one interferes with the image we have tended to build for ourselves. This image does not bear great <Col N="334" /> affinity with reality.  The Minister of State told us that &ldquo;our production systems will satisfy the most stringent standards of production set anywhere in the world&rdquo;, that we must provide an unrivalled customer service and that we must &ldquo;respond to the very reasonable expectations of consumers who want to know more about every stage of the food chain, from farm gate to kitchen table&rdquo;.  All that is correct, but the reality is different.</P>
    <P>Within recent months it was discovered in a factory here that there were growth promoters in cattle which had been slaughtered.  A request from the Department to trace the origin of the cattle elicited the reply that their supplier was a gentleman called Elvis Presley.  The factory was not able to help the Department at all other than to say it was Elvis Presley.  Very little meat of this kind which has come to light in factories has been traced to the original producer.  We have an extraordinary situation where it is almost impossible to trace an animal's full history.  Consumers will be switched off increasingly if we are unable to do that.</P>
    <P>Recently I was abroad browsing in shops where the proud boast on the counters was that the beast was born and reared on a particular farm, was fed on grass all its life and was slaughtered immediately on leaving the farm.  That may seem rather a tall order in the Irish context but it is something to which we will have to learn to adjust.  I do not think we can do that now.  I hope we will be able to do so in a year or two but we will have to change our approach if we are to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of certainty about food and its safety, it is very disturbing to think that it was possible in the not too distant past to purchase official blank Irish veterinary health certificates. That matter is before a criminal court so I will not say any more about it.  It is a chilling thought that it could happen.</P>
    <P>It is entirely commendable that there should be a consumer representative on <Col N="335" /> the board of An Bord Bia.  The person to be appointed shall be the nomination of such organisations, in the plural, as the Minister considers to be representative of consumers.  It is one thing to appoint somebody who is the nominee of an organisation but how do you appoint someone who is the nominee of organisations, unless they all agree on the same person.  If they do not what happens?  It seems a rather small point but it is very obvious and I do not think it should be expressed in this way.  I can see this giving rise to many difficulties.</P>
    <P>A board consisting of 15 people, as set out in section 2 (a), is too big and will not work.  It would be more effective if it were much smaller.  One effect of such large boards is that they tend to cancel themselves out.  The views of board members tend to be ignored and the executive gets on with the job, which may be one way of doing business.  It seems extraordinary that this is the third Bill in less than two years in respect of an organisation that has been in existence only 18 months.  It is doing the best it can in difficult circumstances but, certainly, its problems will not be sorted out by simply having a larger board representative of more groups.  One consumer representative on a board of 15 will not make a great deal of difference. The representation should be based on consumer requirements and views.  We will continue to have serious difficulties otherwise.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we should consider amendments to try to reduce the size of the board, ensuring that it is of a much more manageable size and broadening its representation so that it is not from a particular narrow sector.  I would very much like to see all members of the board not trying to plough his own furrow or for a vested interest but trying to make a success of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very short because it seeks to make minor changes but it is symptomatic of the wrong approach.  What is particularly disappointing is that this is the third instalment in a little over two years and changes will continue.  We <Col N="336" /> must hope that somebody will take a more enlightened view in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  What I have heard so far in the contributions is a criticism of the Bill for what it never set out to do.  This is not a debate about BSE or about the panoply of measures put in place by the Government to combat the effects of BSE in so far as it is in its power as a Government to do that. This Bill simply and solely provides for consumer representation on the board of An Bord Bia.  It does not seek to conceal its purpose which is manifestly and transparently to provide for the first time for consumer representation on the board.  Everybody has either reluctantly or begrudgingly admitted that this is necessary and desirable and, perhaps, overdue.  The criticism of the Bill as a measure has to be within the parameters of the fact that that is its sole objective. The Bill does not seek to address a range of issues that Deputies Cowen and O'Malley raised.</P>
      <P>The Bill stands alone as a measure to expand the range of expertise at board level to enable the sector to be developed comprehensively.  Serious questions can be raised as to why this was not done before now.  One would have thought when listening to Deputy Cowen that his side of the House had been straining at the leash for a long time to provide representatives of consumers on this board.  The fact is that the Bill in 1994 was introduced by the Government of which Deputy Cowen was a member and Deputy O'Malley was wrong to go back to the Seanad debate where his colleague, Senator Dardis, advocated the case for consumers on this board.  I advocated in this House the case for consumers and I have consistently sought to do so.  The Government of which Deputy Cowen was a member was impervious to any argument for consumer representation on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no point in following Deputy <Col N="337" /> O'Malley down memory lane in tracing how we have reached this stage.  The Deputy could have started with the argument that An Bord Tráchtála should fulfil this function.  There was a belief that a Government which had sufficient votes in the House should have set up a food board.  That is the way the argument has progressed but regrettably and surprisingly it provided for neither farmer nor consumer representation, although I would have thought both were central to what we were trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen took the view that producer interests should dominate and now criticises my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, for holding a similar point of view.  I do not believe that is accurate or in accord with the fact.  Also it ascribes to the Minister the views he and his colleagues held when in Government. When it comes to the food industry the consumer is a relatively recent discovery on the Fianna Fáil benches and represents a Pauline conversion for Deputy Cowen in particular.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister of State said and the format of the Bill he introduced. Perhaps it is regrettable the Government was left with no choice but to introduce amending legislation if it wished to provide for consumer representation immediately but that was a particular commitment I made to the Consumers Association of Ireland at the time of the BSE crisis.  The association made the entirely reasonable case that, unless confidence was restored and maintained among consumers, no matter how high the quality, how good the value or how hygienic the product, the argument would come to nil.  It maintained the association should be represented on the board.  For this to happen, the Government was left with no alternative but to bring forward amending legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to remind the House of my decision last March to set up an expert advisory group on beef <Col N="338" /> products comprising consumer, scientific, Government and trade representatives under the chairmanship of Mr. William Fagan, the Director of Consumer Affairs, to advise consumers, Government and the trade arising from the EU export ban on products derived from cattle slaughtered in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Cowen one would think this crisis was somehow associated with the Government.  It was foisted on us by the manner in which the issue was handled in the House of Commons by the UK Government.  It was exaggerated 1,000 times by the incompetence with which it was handled there.  The Government had to deal with its implications, as had the Governments of the other member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Not anyone disputes that the speedy and professional job done by the expert advisory group was a critical factor in restoring consumer confidence and tackling the confusion surrounding the safety of beef products and beef related derivatives.  I undertook in my discussions with the Consumers Association of Ireland to advocate its case within Government for representation on the board of An Bord Bia.  I am pleased that, in pursuing that commitment, so far as the Minister was concerned, I knocked on an open door. Unfortunately, there are prescribed terms of office for members of the board.  If the Government was to fulfil the undertaking I made to the Consumers Association of Ireland, it could only do so by introducing amending legislation.</P>
    <P>That is the response to Deputy O'Malley, who said the Bill is a minor one.  It may be narrow in its focus but it is not minor in its implications.  I am surprised he sought to dredge up a Seanad quotation to show his uniqueness within the political establishment as the only advocate of consumer representation which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> It is a salutary comment on the traditional attitude of successive Governments to the question of consumer representation that to keep my promise to the Consumers Association of Ireland it has proved necessary to introduce amending legislation.  The failure to make provision for consumer representation on the board when established is a comment on the perceived role of consumers. They have traditionally been perceived to be of no importance, and it was automatic and axiomatic, since we have a good product that the question of consumer participation at the boardroom table did not arise.  I am glad producers are no longer making that argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. They now recognise that if the consumer does not have confidence in the product, it does not matter how valuable it is.  We are dealing with a more alert and informed citizenry who will vote with their feet and pay sceptical attention to Ministers, scientists and others who tell them what is good for them and what is safe to eat.  They will draw their own conclusions.</P>
      <P>Given the centrality of the issue in our economy it is especially important that we practice what we preach and provide a position as of right, for consumers. Unfortunately what we do here will not have an impact on our export markets.  Domestic consumption accounts for only a small percentage of total production.  Nonetheless, in terms of the domestic scene, this decision is of critical importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BSE crisis pointed to the centrality of consumer confidence and perception to marketplace success.  This point has been well made by the Minister of State.  The consumer is all powerful. Industralists might wish it otherwise. I do not, I am a firm believer in consumer rights and power.  That is the reason I raised with the Minister the <Col N="340" /> issue of consumer representation on the board of An Bord Bia.  The Minister agreed with the case made and acted quickly to ensure that the membership of An Bord Bia and its two subsidiary boards could be increased with immediate effect so as to provide for consumer representation.</P>
    <P>I recommend this good measure to the House.  It provides a legal basis for something very important, that is a place at the boardroom table of An Bord Bia, as of right, for consumer representatives. Other companies and agencies might also consider such representation. As Minister of State with responsibility for the Companies Office, I recently established a user council, CROLink, for that agency of State.  As Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, and taking up from where Deputy O'Rourke left off&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>I piloted through the House the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which gave the Director of Consumer Affairs responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the credit industry. The Act also greatly enhanced consumer rights in this area and resulted in the allocation of increased resources to the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Users and consumers must have a real voice in terms of the operation of State agencies and the Government is generally committed to this philosophy. There is also a message in this for the private commercial sector.  The use of consumer panels by some of the major retailers is well established and this gives consumers a voice, an avenue and <Col N="341" /> a way of influencing management decisions and actions.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis has dramatically shown the central importance of confidence and perception in the operation of the market.  As regards my responsibility for consumer policy and the safeguarding of consumer rights, the action taken by me during the scare in March and subsequently was not only desirable but critically necessary to allay the concerns being heightened to an irresponsible degree in some sections of the media about the safety of Irish beef and beef products.  I am glad a framework for the removal of the export ban was agreed at the recent Florence summit. Without question we have the highest quality beef in Europe, but unless the consumer accepts this message such lofty claims can fall on deaf ears.  The work of the expert group in terms of advising consumers, providing help lines etc. did much to allay the fears and confusion which existed at that time.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that such an uncontroversial measure should provoke such criticism from the two main Opposition spokespersons.  This debate is not about BSE or the circumstances confronting the industry.  It is an extremely serious matter when the consumption levels of beef in, say, Germany are half those which previously obtained.  This poses very serious problems for our economy and the producers and workers in the industry.  No doubt we will properly seek to arrange compensation for producers in so far as that is possible, but there will be little enough compensation for workers in the meat processing factories which are likely to lose jobs if progress cannot continue to be made in combating the impact of a peculiarly British crisis.  What happened in Britain and the decision by the Tory Government in terms of deregulation, going back to the origins of this crisis, was criminal.  It is horrific that this crisis should have occurred and that the rest of Europe is paying the price, while the British media works and strives mightily day and night to create the perception that somehow this was inflicted on them <Col N="342" /> by the rest of Europe and they had nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>I am at a total loss to understand Deputy Cowen's criticisms.  The measures put in place by the Government to combat the effects of what happened in Britain have been extensive and persistent.  I do not think any previous Minister for Agriculture worked such long and hard hours to combat a crisis not of his making.  The range of visits made by the Minister, Deputy Yates, and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, in an attempt to keep markets open and keep our product on the shelves is unprecedented.  I do not know what point Deputy Cowen was trying to make.  The entire diplomatic service has been mobilised in the efforts to make a distinctive and separate argument for Ireland in the face of this crisis and in terms of seeking to restore confidence among foreign consumers who buy our product.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen made some strident criticisms of what he referred to as operation matador in terms of Border security. He knows as well as any other Member that those steps were necessary in response to the European-wide ban on the export of beef products.  The system of traceability being developed by the Minister will be the fundamental mechanism which in the longterm will provide consumers with the assurances they deserve.  That is a fundamentally important point.  If we had behaved any differently in terms of the Border implications we would be open to criticisms in the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a narrow and specific focus and provides for a long overdue reform so that consumers can have a say at the boardroom table.  I am very pleased they will have such a say following the enactment of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is all coming out now &mdash; the Minister of State does not like him.</P>
      <P>I listened to most of the debate on the monitor in my office.  I welcome this simple and interesting Bill.  I wonder about the efficacy of that person, who I hope will be a woman, on the board no matter how efficient that person may be.  According to the latest survey, women are still the main purchasers of and deciders on what food goes into homes.  Ideally that person should be a woman.  The board will be made up of 14 people &mdash; one against the rest.  Be that as it may, it is a step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, Deputy Joe Walsh, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, set up An Bord Bia when the composition of the board was specified. When Deputy Yates became Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, he immediately introduced an amendment &mdash; at that time the blame for not recognising the lacuna of consumers was very strong &mdash; allowing for the presidents of two farming organisations to be added to the board.  It is necessary to say this because the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, continuously heaped the blame on the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government who did not provide for a consumer representative on the board. That may well have been our error initially and, if so, I admit it.  When an amendment was introduced there was an opportunity for the Minister to add the consumer representative but he did not.  He rushed in to add the heads of the two farming organisations who are the people of the highest calibre and <Col N="344" /> efficient and prolific at putting forward the views of their organisations.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the unseemly rush by the Minister for Agriculture to add the two main producer lobby presidents to the board of An Bord Bia was that it was instant approval for his credentials with the farming organisations.  It is to Deputy Walsh's credit, who was derided for not adding the presidents of those two farming organisations to the board, that he resisted such pressure.  I recall the publicity surrounding it but he stuck to his guns.  If he did not add the consumers, neither did he add the main producer heads.  It is often necessary in Dáil debates to put that on the record. Oppositions and Governments in their turn tend to have a blanket view and pick out issues they wish to highlight as the Minister did and as I am doing.  The opportunity arose for the Minister and he included the heads of the farming organisations on the board.</P>
    <P>After the BSE crisis there were renewed demands by the Consumers' Association to have its voice heard at the table.  Its voices &mdash; rather than one voice &mdash; should be heard.  No matter how efficient that person may be it will be very difficult for that person against the combined weight of the producers.  I had meetings with all the farmers' representatives, who are in a difficult position given that our exports to EU countries are down 40 per cent to 45 per cent over the crisis period.  They put forward their points of view about the need for subsidies and prompt payment of grants and subsidies but they cannot see the clear connection that the person at the end of the chain is the one who buys, prepares and eats the product and that the beginning of the chain is the producer. They fail to understand that if they do not produce a product which people want to buy, they will be out of business and exports will be reduced still further.  As difficult and horrendous as the BSE crisis was it had the effect of compelling producers to realise that they can make products forever but if they do not produce goods which the people want to purchase, they will not <Col N="345" /> be successful.  That message will have to be repeated.</P>
    <P>Consumer interests should be represented by a section which would take from Government Departments all matters relating to consumers.  This is the practice in the Consumer Council in Brussels, of which I was a member for three years while I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing and labour affairs, and which the Minister now chairs.  That group takes on to itself all matters of responsibility relating to consumers: health, agriculture, food, transport, trade, trade safety and myriad issues which fall to be reflected from Europe, but sometimes domestically, on how we view consumers and their needs.  No Government Department wants to do it and no Government wants to do it because each Government Department would have to cede some responsibility and power if they do so.  Eventually, we will have to do so.</P>
    <P>I am interested in how the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; has suddenly become fashionable. It is a word that trips off all our lips now.  Words such as citizens, consumers, and consensus &mdash; all the C words &mdash; have a warm ring to them.  One feels good by saying that consumers should have power and feels even better when you say more power to the consumer and the citizens of Europe.  We proclaim this is speeches but we do nothing about it and we do not translate it into meaningful measures whereby the citizens will actually get their consumer rights in a consensual way &mdash; to put all the Cs together in one sentence. As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte said, this is a narrow measure and only the beginning of a road.  Will one person on a board of 14 be so powerful as to alter overnight the mindset of producers and other people on the board of An Bord Bia?  Will the board see that the road to the consumers' heart is to listen to what the consumer is saying?</P>
    <P>Cupidity is a powerful force and I hope it will work towards achieving the needs of consumers.  Cupidity led producers over the years to build up food <Col N="346" /> mountains and wine lakes and to produce food for which there is no ready market.  I am aware of the difficulties farmers are experiencing.  These can only be short-term measures.  At the end of the day in this global economy if you do not produce the goods and provide the services that other people want to purchase in a non-protectionist way, you should not be in the business.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill was introduced but it is not one about which to make a song and dance.  It will not move mountains or cause the sun to shine for another hour in the day or suddenly make every consumer in the land better informed.  To hype it up as the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, did is ridiculous. I wish we would have a more meaningful way of approaching the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;.  It was desperation that brought one person to the board of An Bord Bia.  In 1994 the Minister, Deputy Yates, had an opportunity to add the two heads of the farming organisations but he refused to add a consumer representative.  That was much worse than the blame heaped on the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government who did not bow to the strident demands of the main farming unions who wanted their representatives on the board.  I would like the Minister to have disenfranchised some members of the board, but I realise they have a stated term of office.  The board will become too unwieldy if we continue to appoint more members to it and I doubt if the 14 members will reach any worthwhile conclusions. When the board is reconstituted it should comprise fewer members, while consumers with a knowledge of the food industry should be represented on it.  The farming lobbies and all those involved in the food industry should realise that if the consumer is not satisfied he or she will merely abandon the product.  Consumers no longer rely on one product.  The women who shop in my local supermarket read the labels on products to check if they meet the necessary safeguards and these are not people with PhDs doing their yuppie shopping at the weekend.  They are <Col N="347" /> ordinary folk doing their weekly shopping, but they still take time to ask questions about the products they wish to purchase.  Today's consumer is informed and demanding.  He who pays should be given the necessary information.</P>
    <P>If I were giving the Minister an examination rating on the Bill, I would give him a D plus to a C.  He must continue to build on his proposals and incorporate all the strands into a section that would have a pivotal role in Irish political life.</P>

      <P>I welcomed the establishment of An Bord Bia.  It was a step in the right direction for the export of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>This country depends more on agriculture than any other in Europe.  Farming is a way of life but unfortunately the Government has given it very little support since the BSE crisis, the most serious crisis to hit this country for a long time.  When we had our last crisis in the beef industry the then leader of the Opposition, Charlie Haughey, was not afraid to go to Libya to secure a market for our beef.  Why are the Ministers not doing more to secure new markets? The Government should send Ministers to Iran and Asia to promote confidence in Irish meat.  Why is it left to the Opposition to do this?</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has called for a debate on the BSE crisis on a number of occasions to allay the fears of people about the decline in the beef industry.  That is the Government's job, not ours.  The Minister of State and his colleagues should travel all over the world to promote our green image and beautiful meat.  Is the Minister of State aware of the number of butcher shops that have closed since the BSE crisis?  It is a shame that more is not being done about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently had occasion to cross the Border from Garrison in Country Fermanagh to Kinlough in County Leitrim.  It is regrettable that once again the Border must be manned by a garda on a 24-hour basis.  What does the Minister propose to do to boost cattle prices when <Col N="348" /> beef prices fall during November and December?  Farmers who purchased cattle in the past 12 months and wish to sell them now will lose more than £100 per head.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  It was interesting to see him come in to support the Minister and our beef industry. He caused a great deal of damage to that industry when he was in Opposition and the Tánaiste did likewise.  They now talk of confidence in the beef industry. It is great to see those men in Government trying to build confidence in that industry.  When they were in Opposition they had nothing but criticism to level at it, their only aim being to get at a former Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Our spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, travelled abroad to promote Irish beef. We should encourage other countries, especially those in Eastern Europe, to buy our beef.  If we do not, the slump in the cattle trade will worsen.  Our land is excellent for organic farming.  We can promote organic farming and we should be the leaders in it.  Anyone who travels to another part of Europe and then comes back to our green isle with its lush green grass knows that we should have no problem in selling our beef. When the European Commissioners were here on Monday I was delighted to see that Irish beef was on their menu. That was a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success and I hope the new people appointed to An Bord Bia will be consumers.  Hopefully, they will not be active supporters of his party.  The Minister should forget about that and appoint people who are interested in the beef industry.</P>

      <P>I agree that the board is too big and cumbersome. Boards of that nature do not work.  The Minister should have started afresh.  I welcome the inclusion of consumers on the board because they must have a say in the products that end up on their dinner tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greed brought this problem to our country.  We had one of the most disease <Col N="349" /> free herds in the world.  I am not afraid to say that feed imported by a reputable importer had animal substances mixed in it and this was used by some other feed compounders in the southern area. That was the first difficulty that arose. The second difficulty was that derogations were not kept in place and we imported animals which brought further difficulties and misery to our herds.</P>
    <P>We did not have to drop our derogation and we should have fought hard to keep it in place.  We had a white meat status &mdash; linked to countries like New Zealand, Australia, North America, Japan and Denmark &mdash; which was the envy of many of our European counterparts. Our beef was the country's gold and we should have protected that high class product.</P>
    <P>Last week I visited a supermarket in Dublin and heard an announcement over the loudspeaker system that Aberdeen Angus beef was in stock.  That is the product we had and we cherished it very much.  We had many good breeds of cattle.</P>

      <P>Last year I raised a matter in the House and to the credit of the Minister, Deputy Yates, he assisted me.  There was a threat to import wild boar into the country which would have brought further misery to our pig herd.  I fought that issue single handed and was amazed at the huge turnout of 800 people for a public meeting in my constituency. It was the biggest meeting in Mitchelstown since the Land League days.  There was an awareness among farmers and consumers that we had to <Col N="350" /> stop those importations and we succeeded.</P>
      <P>We are not safe yet, however.  Modern ferries coming into Rosslare make it easy to drive across undetected with livestock, particularly if the ferry comes in early and there is not much wind.

      <P>People can drive on and off those ferries, yet vets are not in place.  I am well aware of that because I have researched the matter.  It is vitally important that our national herd is well protected because of the problems that have arisen.  Any laxity can only be blamed on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry which is charged with that responsibility.</P>
      <P>Many rules and voluntary codes of practice are in place governing importations but they are not good enough and must be strengthened.  Although we are in a free market.  I am convinced the European Union will recognise our problem and will see that our beef industry derives from very pure breeds of animal.  It should be protected since it is subject to many weaknesses because of importation.</P>
      <P>We are well aware of the arrival of many new diseases.  I do not want to cause distress or to be critical because of the damage that could cause, but in the last few weeks we have seen statements in the newspapers about these diseases.  Importations are not in our interest and must be curtailed by embargoes. We must protect our national herd either by statute or by co-operation with the European Union.  I cannot repeat often enough that our national herd is vitally important for the well being of farmers and for our economic survival generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years Ministers for Agriculture, of all Governments, have not <Col N="351" /> been cautious and careful enough.  A limited number of people who import stock have questions to answer because they brought the problems here and destroyed the whole commercial operation.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has a bright future and I always believed that we should combine all our commercial and agricultural promotions.  An Bord Tráchtála has done an excellent job both commercially and industrially.  We also have An Bord Bainne which is some kind of a marketing organisation.  There should be more involvement in the promotions area rather than marketing because we are living in an age of huge business where multiples and consumers want to deal with the processors rather than going through marketing agencies.</P>
    <P>Thousands of tonnes of imported fresh food are on our supermarket shelves but I fail to understand why we do not have fresh dairy product exports. Much work remains to be done in that area.  We have to examine some type of brand image for our beef and other products.  We should work towards brands using the Irish language.  I was surprised to receive a letter recently from Mr. Pádraig Ó Cuanacháin, on behalf of an organisation called GaelTaca, denouncing English language titles for State bodies.  Our State bodies should carry Irish titles.  In his letter Mr. Ó Cuanacháin posed the following question for the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;Why was the name An Bord Bainne changed to The Irish Dairy Board, and is he aware of the danger to the Irish agricultural industry by our failure to proclaim an identity separate to that of England?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We need a separate identity.  Manufacturers and processors often receive cheques from foreign countries addressed to County Cork, England. Many people believe that we are still part of the English world even though we are an independent sovereign State. <Col N="352" /> For that reason we should use Irish language branding.  The fact that our processors are selling to UK and other foreign multiples does not mean they cannot use such branding.</P>
    <P>A growing number of farmers recognise that marketing farm commodities will never be the same again after the BSE scare and they are taking action. Firm quality assurance for consumers is necessary for beef, lamb, pork and other agricultural products.  Buyers want high quality meat products and they also want to know the origin, feeding, welfare and management of the animals concerned.  This industry is grass based and a high level of concentrate feeding is used in pig and beef production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions during the past 18 months I have asserted that the Government has no criminal justice policy.  Today I am in a position not alone to assert but to prove that is so.  After 18 months of prevarication, indecision and ideological paralysis, the Government has abandoned the pretence of having a policy and is thrashing around looking for proposals <Col N="354" /> to implement.  Measures that were previously deemed unacceptable are now Government policy.  I welcome those Government U-turns and the fact that it has belatedly moved to implement a series of Fianna Fáil policies, but I condemn utterly the months of concerted Government effort which went into repeatedly blocking necessary legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil.  I condemn the lack of vision and foresight which repeatedly brought Government Deputies into the lobbies to vote down the measures they now deem necessary.</P>
      <P>Who in this Government of accountability will accept responsibility for blocking legislation which it now accepts needs to be enacted in law? Who is accountable?  Where does the buck stop?  Who in the Government is responsible for the non-development and non-implementation of criminal justice policy?</P>
      <P>Last year I published and introduced the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution (No. 1) Bill, which was designed to give judges power to refuse bail to a person if they were satisfied there was a probability that the person would commit a category of offence which is also an indictable offence.  The Government voted down the Bill and denied the people the right to vote on that issue.  Every day since that Bill was defeated, the courts have been compelled to release on bail heroin addicts whose addiction costs them upwards of £200 per day.  Those addictions can be fed only through theft, violence and robbery.  The Government took a conscious decision to vote down the Fianna Fáil Bill, but who will take responsibility for the carnage which those addicts have since caused on our streets?  Will the politicians, who last Friday night accepted for the first time the need for a constitutional amendment, accept responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I find particularly shabby about the Government's decision to hold a bail referendum is its pretence that the issue has just arisen.  It is an issue which it opposed resolutely.  When it was finally brought, kicking and screaming <Col N="355" /> by a tide of public outrage, to the realisation that a referendum was necessary, it had not even taken the preliminary preparatory step of drafting the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment. The Taoiseach, fumbling for clarity, was reduced to announcing that the referendum would seek to deny bail where there was a danger of reoffending. That inarticulate and woolly expression of the carefully drafted Fianna Fáil proposal demonstrates the lack of consideration by the Government of the proposal.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach now asserts as Government policy the proposal he voted against in this House.  He is flanked by the Minister for Justice who denigrated the proposal and said it could not be done.  She was right: it could not be done because neither she nor the other members of the Government had the political will to do it.  They are now compelled to accept that what they said could not be done can be done.  There will be a referendum which the Government prevented last year.</P>
    <P>In 1995 I introduced on behalf of my party the Criminal Justice (Bail) Bill which was designed to introduce a number of sensible measures within the confines of existing constitutional parameters. Among other measures, it sought to make provision for the forfeiture of bail moneys where an offence is committed on bail.  The Minister for Justice, reciting her customary mantra, declared it could not be done and that there were constitutional difficulties. Where have we heard that recently? Today that proposal is Government policy. Who will accept responsibility for this reversal of policy?  Who will accept responsibility for incorrectly stating this could not be done?  The Government has pursued a policy of studied inactivity in regard to crime.  Belatedly it has come to the realisation that legislative action is needed, but it continues to send out inherently contradictory messages.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach recently speak publicly of the need for tougher <Col N="356" /> sentences in drug distribution cases. Within hours of this policy assertion, the Minister for Justice opposed a Fianna Fáil amendment to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, which would have had the effect of imposing a minimum sentence of ten years' imprisonment for any person found in possession of controlled drugs with a minimum street value of £10,000.  Who are they trying to fool?  I am not fooled, nor is the public.  Issuing statements calling for tough sentences achieves nothing.  Voting such measures into law is helpful, but the Government resolutely refuses to do so.  There is no point in the Taoiseach calling for heavy sentences if the Minister for Justice opposes those measures when they are proposed in the Oireachtas.  This is symptomatic of the disarray which exists at Government level.  There is no policy, only confusion.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months I introduced nine separate criminal justice Private Members' Bills.  The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill was accepted by the Minister and the principal sections of the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995, were adopted from our Bill on the same topic, but every other measure was voted down.  It is ironic to hear of a revolt by Labour backbenchers against the Government's inactivity on the issue of crime.  Do they not realise that they, by their votes, prevented those measures from becoming law?  Do they think their constituents do not realise they voted against holding a referendum on bail, that their leadership probably prevented it, that they voted against toughening bail laws, imposing a minimum ten year sentence on drug dealers found in possession of drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more and provisions which would provide trials within 90 days for serious criminal offences?  That is their record and it is also the sorry record of Democratic Left.  That is what the electorate will be asked to judge them on.</P>
    <P>Less than two weeks ago I asked the Minister for Justice whether she intended to establish a special task force <Col N="357" /> to combat drug trafficking.  The Minister, Deputy Currie, informed me that it was not intended to establish such an agency.  Why then, less than a fortnight later, is this measure the cornerstone of Government policy?  Who will be made accountable for the failure to establish a task force which is now accepted by the Government as necessary?  Those questions need to be answered.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a Government that not only failed to introduce necessary legislation and take necessary initiatives but that voted down legislation which is now acknowledged to be necessary, a Government that refused to take initiatives which are now acknowledged to be vital.  The Government has acknowledged that its crime programme has been deficient, that in the past it has taken incorrect decisions on crime policy, but what concerns me most is that it appears set to repeat the policy of aloof indifference which brought about its inadequate response in the first place.</P>
    <P>Despite having power to do so, the Government has refused to appoint the extra judges which the Oireachtas authorised it to pass in the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  The appointment of extra judges is the only way to bring an end to the unacceptable delays in our courts, and only the Government can appoint those judges, but to date, with a few notable exceptions, it has refused to do so.  At a time when delays in the Central Criminal Court often exceed two years, the Government refuses to arrange sittings of the court throughout the legal vacation.  A fortnight in late September is an inadequate response to a crime crisis.</P>
    <P>If the Government wants to know the direction in which it must travel it should examine the Private Members' Bills published by Fianna Fáil, enact the various measures it voted down since taking office and restore public confidence in its ability to adequately tackle the crime problem, but it should start by announcing who is accountable for its past failures.  Should the Minister for Justice take all the blame or should it rightly be shared between her and the <Col N="358" /> Leaders of the Labour Party and Democratic Left?  The public knows the answer to that question and there is no need for me to add anything.</P>

      <P>The sentiments contained in the motion have already been referred to and have garnered positive suggestions in many respects.  In accepting some of the suggestions in the motion I wish to express my sincere sympathy to the families of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin whose deaths crystallised the outrageous behaviour of organised criminal gangs.</P>
      <P>The problems of crime have been with us for many years without the required response forthcoming from Government.  Deputy O'Donoghue's contribution this evening was interesting in that regard.  One would think that crime began only after Fianna Fáil left office.</P>
      <P>The proposers of the motion call for reform of the bail laws but they do not indicate the number of prison spaces and other resources required to implement that measure.  In addition, they do not outline the measures required to control the abuse of temporary releases.  In a policy statement on the problems of temporary release Fianna Fáil stated that something must be done irrespective of the impact any action will have in the short-term or the resources that will be required over a period to implement these measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that in the eight years Fianna Fáil was in office, from 1987 to 1994, not one additional prison space was provided.  One would think there was no crime in Ireland at that time.  A statistic that comes to mind is that in 1991 there was a massive 7.7 per cent increase in crime but we did not get <Col N="359" /> any response from the then Government.</P>
    <P>The manner in which Fianna Fáil has sought to pillory the Minister for Justice in recent times for the problems in our criminal justice system is nothing short of disgraceful.  One would think this Minister was personally responsible for the deaths of people such as Detective Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin.</P>
    <P>The same approach was not taken by the Opposition in 1994 when Imelda Riney and her son and Fr. Joe Walsh were murdered.  It would have been easy politically for the Opposition to blame the then Minister for Justice for those tragic events.  It would be equally easy for the Opposition to blame the Minister for Justice for the murder of Philomena Gillane.  There is a fundamental difference of decency between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael spokes-persons on these issues in that our public utterances are tempered with a degree of fairness and humility.</P>
    <P>Party political point scoring on the crime issue at a time when an outraged public demands all-party support for tough anti-crime measures is counterproductive. Partisan politics are out of step with the will of the people at this time of great tragedy in our community.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to say that the gentleman who appeared on the front page of last Sunday's <i>Sunday Independent,</i> who is alleged to be the main suspect in the murder of Veronica Guerin, might have been a beneficiary of a tax amnesty introduced by the Leader of Fianna Fáil when he was Minister for Finance.  It would be easy for me to say also that the tax amnesty may have contributed to the wealth he has created over the years in that he had to pay only 15 per cent tax on his ill-gotten gains.</P>
    <P>Previous Governments did not adequately face up to the crime problem, particularly organised crime. Fifteen months ago the Minister for Justice outlined what she believed was the required response to deal effectively with the level of criminal activity in our <Col N="360" /> society.  I regret the Government did not see fit at that time to implement the long overdue package but I welcome the anti-crime measures now being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is dealing with the problem of crime by reforming the courts, the Garda Síochána, the prison service and the law in a structured and coherent way.  It represents a meaningful response to the need to protect our citizens and will ensure that the people who perpetrate these appalling crimes do not benefit from the revolving door syndrome in our prisons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed measures which include strengthening the bail laws, eclipsing the right to silence for drug traffickers, the provision of 525 new prison spaces in addition to the 278 already announced this year, an additional 600 gardaí on the beat as well as the establishment of a special unit to deal effectively with the assets of criminals.</P>

      <P>I wish to make some points in the short time available to me. The Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, in a context not dissimilar to that we are debating tonight, once stated that somebody somewhere has got to do something. That is the difference between Government and Opposition Members.  It is easy for the Opposition to say that somebody somewhere must do something. The Minister for Justice is doing something about this problem and has been engaged in that exercise for the past 17 months.  The record is clear in that regard.</P>
      <P>For the remaining time in this debate we should concentrate on the positive proposals contained in the package announced by the Minister last night. That package was not cobbled together in recent days.  It shows clear vision in regard to reform of the criminal justice system after many decades of inactivity.</P>
      <P>On the right to silence, there is no doubt that law abiding citizens of this State, approximately 99.9 per cent of the population, have nothing to fear from changes in the right to silence, particularly as we now have video taping facilities in our main Garda stations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the statutory availability of legal advice to any suspect.  The courts should be able to draw inferences from silence in cases where a serious crime has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The culture of our society must change towards assisting the Garda Síochána in resolving the crime problem. Every citizen of the State has a social responsibility to tell the police <Col N="362" /> about any suspicious activity of a criminal nature.  Unfortunately, that moral responsibility does not have the force of law but it should be taken seriously by every citizen.</P>
    <P>There are no more than 40 drug barons or crime lords in the country.  I wonder how many of them have been subjected to Revenue audits in recent times because on a weekly basis in my clinics small business owners and farmers complain about the crack squad from the Revenue Commissioners demanding large amounts of tax refunds from them even where minor omissions occurred.  Serious consideration should be given to paying a bounty to people for information which successfully leads to the resolution of a criminal case or the freezing or seizure of assets of crime.  The Revenue Commissioners must consider this more seriously than they have in the past.  I see no reason this concept cannot be taken on board and expanded.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said the words of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil ring hollow when one looks at the record of those parties in Government. We have had four successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice over a period of almost ten years and not one prison place was provided in this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When we came into Government, we had to tackle the problem relating to prison spaces.  The Minister's announcement last night shows we are committed to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It costs £88,000 per year per prisoner <Col N="363" /> in Portlaoise prison.  Will we follow the American example of building more prisons without looking at the fundamentals of our penal code?  The Minister has set up various commissions and studies and published reports which attract nothing but disdain from the Opposition benches because they are more concerned with the easy headlines, such as that from Deputy Harney &mdash;&ldquo;somebody somewhere should do something&rdquo;. The Minister for Justice is doing something and this Government will continue it for the duration of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I extend my sincere sympathy to the families of Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  No words will help to console them and it will take a long time for the wounds to heal.</P>
      <P>Last week's events sent shock waves through our community.  There has not been such an outpouring of anger or sympathy since the famous Enniskillen bombing in which Gordon Wilson's daughter died.  The murders of Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Jerry McCabe represent an attack on our society and its democratic ideals. Journalists are no different from anyone else but they represent what is best in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's response has been rapid and reasonable and it has listened to the legitimate concerns of the Opposition. However, in the past few days there has been an outpouring of anger against all politicians.  This is understandable and we all share some blame for the crime problem.  Last night during this debate I had a verbal row with Deputy Harney.  I regret it, but I do not accept that full responsibility for this crisis lies with the Labour Party and I resent her saying so.  The Labour Party has not held the justice portfolio and those who criticise us should bear that in mind.  I would fully support the party if it sought the justice portfolio in a future Government because it would <Col N="364" /> apply the same dynamism it has brought to health, education, foreign affairs and finance, a ministry it was said we would never have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted in the past few months the plethora of Criminal Justice Bills from the two Opposition parties.  This is difficult to understand given that Fianna Fáil held the justice portfolio for seven consecutive years up to 1994.  Nobody can tell anyone in this House crime started to escalate after 1994.</P>
      <P>The package announced by the Minister for Justice yesterday evening will cost a considerable sum.  When tax reductions in the next budget are not as great as some would like, I hope the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil remember how trenchantly they called for this reform and the building of prisons. I fear they will forget it will cost an extra £50 million.  I will support the provision of whatever funding is required to do what is necessary because irrespective of what part of Ireland we live in, we all, face the same difficulties.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Progressive Democrats attempted to ring-fence themselves and the people they represent from the problems of society.  In their world the problems of others should not interfere with their right to lower tax rates.  Public spending is anathema to them except when it comes to building new prisons, which insulate them from another world about which they know little and care less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I entered this House I worked as a trade union official.  In industry there are certain rules and regulations which govern the workplace.  Employers have an obligation to ensure their employees' safety.  If a worker on a building site refuses to wear a hard hat, it is the employer's responsibility to make him do so.  What happened last week raises serious questions about the dangers many journalists face in the <Col N="365" /> course of their work.  It is ironic that Veronica was murdered in the week she was due to talk about her experience as a journalist working under threat. Media practitioners and newspaper owners must now chart a course which exposes wrong doing and crime in our society without putting journalists at risk.  Newspapers and media organisations have a duty to protect their staff whether they want it or not.  We must not allow another journalist or reporter to be murdered.</P>
    <P>I welcome last night's constructive debate and the efforts to introduce legislation but we do not want legislation which does no more than give people a perception that we are doing something when we are not.  I welcome the Government's decision to apply the terms of the strategic management initiative to the Garda.  Public confidence in the Garda is at an all time low. Some weeks ago Commissioner Culligan suggested the underlying consensus which underpinned Garda operations in the 1960s and 1970s had changed.  He also suggested we should examine the conditions under which the Garda operate and what we as a society want from it.  I support Commissioner Culligan's sentiments.  The current malaise in the Garda Síochána will not be rectified until there is a root and branch analysis of its work practices and conditions.  The net losers are the members of the Garda Síochána.  They suffer most when public support for the force is conditional and unenthusiastic.  However, they will benefit most from a public debate about what we expect from them and what they require from us.</P>
    <P>The threat we face now is one of the gravest this State has ever faced.  The measures we have put in place only represent the beginning of a battle against organised crime.  We have had political rancour in this House in the past few days which is understandable when people are frustrated.  Despite the impression given by elements in the media that all we do is fight and debate, debate is the life and blood of our democratic system.  We have now <Col N="366" /> embarked on a difficult road with many obstacles which we can only overcome if we face them together as a people and a Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Flanagan, Fitzgerald and Hogan for sharing their time with me.</P>
      <P>As well as the crime problem we should remind ourselves of the great shock to our political system which resulted in the establishment of this Government.  We should not forget how it came about, the type of bungling, lack of information and the ineptitude of the system that brought about the downfall of a Government.  Neither should we forget the problems with which the Government had to deal when it came to office.  It had to deal with a major crisis in health, a legacy from the previous Government, a crisis in social welfare that was not dealt with during the previous ten years and not so much a crime problem as a drugs problem, bequeathed to us as a result of the previous Government's refusal to deal with it either because it did not consider it sufficiently serious or had other matters on its agenda.  We should never forget that.</P>
      <P>In the past few months there have been not only political but media attacks on the Minister for Justice which appear to be based on the idea that a woman is not capable of doing the job. Half the criticism appears to be made on the basis that she is a woman.  Such criticism stems from outdated notions that women should stick to the soft, fluffy areas of society, but women are capable in all areas.  I have heard not only those I am close to but those with whom I would probably not otherwise agree to a great extent say that the Minister is probably the only Cabinet member who has held her head on all occasions, something for which she should be complimented.  As women we should support her in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would disagree with the broad thrust of the motion.  Many of the measures suggested are contained in the Government's anti-crime package. <Col N="367" /> However, I have grave reservations about specific suggestions in the motion. Many people have similar reservations about some of the measures being preached to us and some of us are afraid to put our heads above the parapet for fear that it might be regarded as disrespectful of those who have given their lives for this country.  That is not what this debate is about.  It is about balance.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that by expanding the concept of mandatory minimum sentences we would remove an essential element of judicial discretion and would fundamentally alter the relationship between the Legislature and the Judiciary.  The independence of the Judiciary is fundamental to a democratic society and any attempt to dilute its independence diminishes all our freedoms. We should keep that in mind.  We are not talking about restricting the freedoms of only one group but restricting the freedoms of all our people.  Democracy and law are fundamental to freedom.</P>
    <P>In drawing up a considered response to the crime problem &mdash; what we have in the motion is not a considered response &mdash; we should be aware of the experiences in other jurisdictions and the experience of mandatory sentencing in the UK which has been nothing less than disastrous.  Rather than adopting the gung-ho mandatory approach, I urge the establishment of a national bureau of sentencing data charged with compiling and disseminating relevant information and with organising an ongoing programme of judicial education in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Progressive Democrats find this so funny, but I suppose they would since they are in Opposition.  Much of the debate in recent weeks has concentrated on catching and convicting criminals.  I would welcome an increased focus on <Col N="368" /> what should be done following conviction, an area on which we have not focused.  We should focus on expanding and developing community service options for less serious crimes, a matter I raised here on three occasions.  Democratic Left has long argued for the establishment of a prisons board and a parole board which are essential.  We should not talk about people being allowed out on early release when there is no structure in place to provide for that.</P>
      <P>The antiquated legislation governing our prison service needs to be replaced by a modern statutory framework which is fully accountable.  We should not forget that when people go to prison they still retain their rights.  Such legislation would incorporate prison rules and a code of conduct for prison staff.  It should also place the sentence review group on a statutory footing.  In addition, legally enforceable prison conditions should be established.  We have all heard of the horror stories of prisoners and I am not going to talk about them as it might be too sensitive an issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's commitment to provide extra prison spaces.  In particular, I welcome its commitment to build a separate remand facility.  This should have been built a long time ago. It is required not only on account of events in recent weeks but of those in the past few years when unsupervised first time young offenders on remand committed suicide.  I cannot understand why people when questioned before being charged have full access to legal opinion and a doctor, but once charged and still innocent they are deprived of those rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to increasing the supervision of prisoners on early release and I am sure everyone welcomes that.  It is unacceptable that, according to some reports, at any one time more than 1,000 prisoners are at large.  The package proposed by the Government will address that issue.  I hope the Government will quickly move to establish a parole board to ensure that early discharges are implemented <Col N="369" /> in a structured fashion.  Some people should be released early rather than according to the <i>ad hoc</i> system that applies at present.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine alternative non-custodial sentencing options for crimes such as civil debt and non-payment of fines.  We all agree that prison spaces are scarce and that people should not be sent to prison when they do not have the financial resources to meet their obligations.  Perhaps they should not have incurred financial obligations, but that is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>At a time of public insecurity there is understandable concern that the odds in our criminal justice system are stacked in favour of criminals and against society.  There is an onus on us as legislators to ensure that in redressing the balance we do not go too far in the opposite direction.  If in seeking to counter crime, we sacrifice hard won individual freedoms, the criminals will have won.  We do not legislate for the moment, we legislate for future generations who will have to live with the results of our deliberations long after today's headlines have been forgotten.  I am not arguing for a blind maintenance of the <i>status quo;</i> on the contrary I am one of the people who believes that we must have constant debate and change because that is how our society evolves. I am arguing for reflection and against the type of short-term approach that has dominated the airwaves in recent days and has been more than adequately promoted by people who should know better.</P>
    <P>The test of legislation is not popularity but effectiveness.  I am concerned that the abolition of the right to silence, albeit only in drug trafficking cases &mdash; I do not know how much that can be ringfenced &mdash; when combined with a seven day detention period could lead to real and alleged abuses.  I endorse the calls by Deputy Shatter for video taping of police interviews.  I hope the Government will move as soon as possible to extend the current pilot programme which has been introduced in a small number of stations.  It has been <Col N="370" /> operating as a pilot programme for a number of years and it should be examined and introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the seriousness of the present level of crime within our society, this debate is long overdue although to date general attention has focused on legal changes and the provision of resources which, while crucial, <Col N="371" /> do not represent the overall answer to the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the general public and public representatives acknowledge that legislation passed or resources provided will always be somewhat inadequate. The Government cannot be compared with, say, television characters in the A-Team.  While it can do a certain amount and should do more, the most important need is to provide leadership, to take a complete overview of these problems and identify solutions to them. In addition to Government, there should be such onus on communities nationwide, many of which have accepted they have a critical part to play, not merely in alerting the Garda to where there are problems of a criminal nature but in ascertaining how the system works, in so far as it works at all. They must become aware of the appropriate action to take, knowing who to contact, how to alert the Garda and how generally to play a role in their local neighbourhood watch and community alert programmes, many of which are not properly implemented especially in areas lacking such community leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the north Fingal area, with which the Minister is familiar, there has been an effective response by communities which have acted in a united and effective way.  They have observed a distinct change in the levels of crime, recognising that people can no longer get away with drugs-related crime.  That being said, the Government must respond effectively and urgently, but not in panic, to our overall crime problem. It is most important that our bail laws be amended.  Some provisions in this area overlap to the extent that one is often led to wonder whether the various arms of the law operate in isolation from each other.  One of the latest proposals is to restrict the availability of bail.  There is also a proposal that the bailee be made responsible for the conduct of the person granted bail.  That should lead to considerable diminution in the incidence of bail.  However, I <Col N="372" /> would anticipate many people being very reluctant to be held responsible for the conduct of somebody who has already shown himself or herself to be quite irresponsible.  As Deputy Lynch said, there is need for a thorough, systematic check and balance procedure to tighten up existing structures.  What are described as openness, transparency and accountability in Government circles need to be applied in legal circles.</P>
    <P>The proposal that the Garda video tape interviews with persons detained is also commendable.  I am not sure that such procedure should be dependent on voluntary acceptance.  I would be guided by appropriate legal advice in that regard.  We do not want to bring the overall legal system into disrepute by, for example, a recurrence of what happened in the Birmingham Six trial.</P>
    <P>While this Bill places emphasis on the freezing of assets, which is important, it should also be borne in mind that there may be need for constitutional change acknowledging that, at times, private property should not be deemed to be so sacrosanct, that the seizure of assets should not be permitted.  Of course, other matters affect us all, such as bad economic planning, pollution, acid rain and so on, all interrelated, but which can relate to crime as much as anything else.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment for petty crime needs to be reviewed, with a view to replacing it by way of community service.  That would represent at least one step towards dealing with the crisis <i>vis-à-vis</i> prison spaces which must be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>Much of our present crime has its origins in long-term problems such as the breakdown of community spirit which the Government must take into account when implementing its package of proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of contributing briefly to this debate.  I am also glad that the Government has more or less indicated its acceptance of the motion tabled by <Col N="373" /> Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, perhaps realising at long last that something needs to be done to tackle crime generally.  In particular we have witnessed the reawakening of Democratic Left and the Labour Party which appear to have suddenly realised there is an enormous problem needing to be addressed.</P>
      <P>When speaking last evening I mentioned the threat the IRA posed, and continues to pose, to this State.  I have also begun to wonder whether there is the same realisation of the threat posed to our society by the criminal underworld. While knowing that many members of the Garda Síochána are constantly aware of IRA activities, I question whether they are equally conscious of the threat posed to our citizens by criminal gangs in this city and country generally.</P>
      <P>I was informed of a community meeting held in Dublin recently at which the drugs problem was discussed, when there was a discreet Special Branch presence outside the building endeavouring to ascertain whether there was any IRA presence.  I understand that some participants were followed home. I wonder whether all criminals nationwide are watched as closely.  We must encourage rather than discourage such surveillance.  We must all endeavour to co-operate in resolving the difficulties with which we are confronted because the Garda, journalists and-or communities alone will not resolve them.  I do not advocate vigilante groups, having witnessed some of their actions in the not too distant past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a woman from Fettercairn in Tallaght, an area with which I am familiar, speak on radio this morning.  She said the community there had more or less got rid of drugs through appropriate surveillance, that whenever any drug activities were witnessed, somebody immediately rang the Garda.  Unfortunately, that action has led to those drug addicts &mdash; pushers being moved from that area to another.  If all communities <Col N="374" /> nationwide co-operate we shall eventually eliminate this scourge from our society.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the Minister's press release yesterday and noted all of the measures included in her proposed package which I hope will meet with greater success than the July 1995 one which appeared to be reduced merely to rhetoric, we heard no more about it.  It is easy to talk or write about such problems but we must insist on action to counteract them and I hope that will be forthcoming on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal to establish a special unit of the Garda to be comprised of members of the Garda Síochána, Revenue and officials of the Department of Social Welfare is also welcome but why is Customs and Excise not involved?  It obviously has a major role in that drugs come into this country mainly by sea.  The Minister need only look at the minutes of the various subcommittee meetings on drugs to see that we have been calling for this for some time.  I am glad the Minister is responding to our call.  As a result we might eventually be able to touch the untouchables.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend my sincere sympathy to the families of the late Detective Jerry McCabe and journalist Veronica Guerin.  These murders were outrageous and have shocked ordinary decent people throughout this country.  In the case of Veronica Guerin, more could have been done to protect her by Independent Newspapers and the Garda Síochána.  She was the subject of many previous threats.  She had important work to do and the dangers involved should have been evident to all concerned.  In addition, I appeal to the media to leave the families of these victims alone to grieve in private.  I hope the media in general will adopt a responsible attitude in this regard.  I and many others throughout the country were incensed at the way well known criminals have been using the newspapers, radio phone-ins etc. over the past few days to discredit the character <Col N="375" /> of Veronica Guerin in particular and to discredit her work.  Their propaganda should not be facilitated in this way.</P>
      <P>I fully support the motion under discussion. I have consistently campaigned for many of these measures since my election to the Dáil in 1992.  Many of these proposals have been dealt with in Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bills.  I thank God that all three Government parties have finally realised the threat the current wave of organised crime represents to the very fabric of our society.  We on this side of the House watched in disbelief the voting down of our proposals in relation to bail, the right to silence, drug trafficking, more prison places, etc.  I could never understand why Deputy Spring and the Labour Party, and Deputy De Rossa and Democratic Left, consistently vetoed every worthwhile tough measure brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  These two Deputies owe it to the public to explain their past actions and why they have done a U-turn on these issues in the past few days. Surely they must have realised the depth of anger in our communities in relation to crime.  Little was done up to now to combat organised crime because the three parties in Government were immobilised by ideological differences. It is no wonder the general public are so cynical about politicians.  It took the murder of Veronica Guerin and the response of an outraged public to shake this Government out of its complacency and indifference.  Suddenly, millions of pounds could be found to introduce a wide range of measures which should have been introduced before now and which the general public consistently demanded; laws could be changed; a referendum could now be held; and decisions were made overnight.  The past few days have been a learning experience for me on how this Government operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant measure to come forward in the past few days, after all the debate, is the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) <Col N="376" /> Bill, 1996.  This Bill should hit the godfathers of organised crime directly in a way that nothing else will.  I commend Deputy O'Donoghue for his efforts, his quick thinking and his imaginative response and suggest that everybody in the House, and the public, are indebted to him for bringing this Bill forward.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal in the Government's package of measures in relation to the review of efficiency and cost effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, but it does not go far enough.  The retiring Garda Commissioner asked a number of relevant questions in his speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on 5 June this year.  Mr. Culligan reiterated his calls for a higher standard of debate about the role of police in society and society's own attitudes and response to crime.  Government is not giving a clear lead to the Garda as to what is expected of them.  Mr. Culligan is right when he says there have been profound economic and social changes in society over the last few decades.  There has been a breakdown in communities and in the sense of community responsibility.  Mr. Culligan stated:</P>
    <P>We in the Garda Síochána can only remain the guardians of community accepted ideas of right and wrong with undisputed authority to enforce agreed standards of behaviour where there is a clear consciousness of right and wrong and a willing acceptance by the community of the constraints which that consciousness places on each of its members...  We must find again the concept of wrongdoing as something for which we have a personal responsibility in all areas of community life.</P>
    <P>I was bitterly disappointed with the address of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, to the Dáil last night.  In her lecture to the Progressive Democrats Party she more or less said that crime is just a symptom of unemployment and deprivation, that criminals are the real victims. Unemployment and poverty are serious social issues that need to be <Col N="377" /> tackled, but no excuses can be made for the murder of Veronica Guerin.  I suggest that type of thinking on the part of the Minister of State is unhelpful. Unfortunately, the Garda Síochána are caught in the middle of this ideological debate.  How can they function effectively and get the full co-operation of the public if society's representatives are saying crime is inevitable and not necessarily wrong?  The Government must give a clear message to the Garda as to their role.  I welcome the proposals for an in-depth analysis of the Garda Síochána but it should have a wider scope.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the criticisms of some of the measures by civil libertarians.  We need to get the balance right, but innocent people, the vast majority, have nothing to fear from the proposals the Dáil will pass this month.</P>

      <P>I want to share my time with Deputy Quill.  In the past few days there has been an effort, on the part of the Fine Gael backbenchers in particular, to suggest that this is a personalised attack on the Minister for Justice. It is not, nobody has suggested that she personally is in any way to blame for these crimes.  However, this Government collectively operates through the Department of Justice, and she is the Minister in charge of that Department. I am sure that she, as a decent and sensitive person, can understand that she bears political responsibility for that Department and that she speaks for this Government on the issues of crime, law and order.  I would like her to accept from me that there is nothing personal in what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of bail, the Minister has tried to pretend there was no division in the Government where there manifestly was.  She battled in this House &mdash; I remember Deputy O'Donoghue quoting statements by the Tánaiste in <i>The Kerryman</i> which proved there was &mdash; and became quite excited telling us that Deputy O'Donoghue was trying to create division where there was none. <Col N="378" /> We now know that there was such division and that explains the paralysis of the Government on that issue over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very quick to shoot down as constitutionally suspect the legislative measures relating to bail which were put forward by this party. Suddenly that constitutional cloud has lifted from them and they are now part of Government policy.  It makes one cynical that the people who write speeches and advise the Minister can bat down propositions because they come from the Opposition benches and suddenly, when two horrific events take place, all those doubts disappear like the early morning dew.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon yesterday and Deputy Brian Fitzgerald this evening suggested that in some sense the management of Independent Newspapers was to blame for the fate of Veronica Guerin because it did not take sufficient care.  That is outrageous.  She was a courageous journalist who operated with great liberty.  The management of those newspapers on many occasions expressed doubts to her about the wisdom of the course she was taking and expressed concerns for her safety.  The Garda, who were criticised here for not offering her sufficient support, offered support but she declined as she could not continue her work in the context of Garda support.</P>
    <P>To say that her employers or the Garda were in some respect to blame for her fate is outrageous, irresponsible and an abuse of the privilege of this House.  The assertion is totally lacking in substance.  It is ridiculous for Deputy Fitzgerald to say there is an analogy between the duty of an employer to ensure that employees wear a hard hat on a building site and the duty of Independent Newspapers to secure the safety of their employee.  It is equally absurd for Deputy McGahon to suggest they should have taken her off the work in which she was involved and put her on to other work.</P>
    <P>I am glad this motion is accepted by the Government.  I do not want to hear <Col N="379" /> in two months time that the Government really did not go along with two or three of the items on the agenda.  I want to see action on this motion when the package comes before this House on 25 July.</P>
    <P>To talk about the prison service is relevant. We have twice as many prison officers as New Zealand and half as many people in custody.  Our prison service costs a great deal, as the Minister is well aware.  The average earnings of prison officers exceed the average earnings of Members of this House.  The cost of the prison service has increased by 50 per cent in the past five years even though prison space has increased negligibly during the same period.</P>
    <P>In that context we must ask whether it is right that we are told now there will be a new remand prison at Wheatfield sometime in the early years of the next century.  The appropriate thing is to allow private enterprises to tender to build a new facility of a substantial size and to rent that accommodation on a sale and lease back basis.  I am deeply suspicious that we will go down the road we went with Wheatfield prison which cost many millions of pounds over and above what was projected and took multiples in time over the original estimate. This country needs prison accommodation now.</P>
    <P>It is not some fanciful notion that there is a crisis in prison accommodation. My colleagues in this party and other Opposition speakers have raised the issue in the past number of years. The Minister may say justifiably that the crisis was not of the making of this Government.  However, the culture of her Department is seriously at the heart of this problem because it has not set out to deal with the real problem in prison accommodation and it did not address the problem of temporary release or the revolving door syndrome.</P>
    <P>All of us who practise law know that people who are sentenced serve only a small fraction of their sentences.  None of us knows the extent of the problem. Every time one asks the Department of <Col N="380" /> Justice for clear statistics on this matter, one is told it is impossible to assess because of manpower considerations. Every time somebody is let out on temporary release it should be possible to fill out a docket indicating the length of sentence and how much had been served.  It should not be beyond the powers of the Department of Justice to tot that up and give it to Deputies when asked about it.  The fact is that it is too shocking to reveal.  Some of the instances are quite outrageous.  Two people in a town near Dublin ganged together to engage in burglaries.  They burgled houses, businesses and so on and also committed offences while on bail.  Eventually, when the Garda finally brought them before the Circuit Criminal Court on indictment they were given four year sentences.  The prosecuting garda in charge of that case was contacted four weeks after the day on which they were committed to prison and asked if he had any objection to their temporary release.  That is the extent of the problem.  That is a case about which I have certain knowledge. The mind boggles as to the real percentage of sentences served by people in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>We need more prison accommodation and have needed it for some time.  We cannot wait until the early years of the next century.  In a different professional context I was told recently I should take up office accommodation on a green field site in the inner city of Dublin, which has not yet been touched by a contractor.  I was told that if I put my money down now I will be in an office on that site in October 1997.  It is not acceptable that the Department of Justice should produce a prison some time in the early years of the next century.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that the prison should be built on the same basis as was Wheatfield prison.  It is not acceptable that the Office of Public Works should have anything to do with this prison.  If we are serious about dealing with this issue, it is essential to get a turnkey project and ask a private sector contractor, <Col N="381" /> such as Seán Quinn, Roadstone or somebody else, to build it now because the people of Ireland need prison accommodation now.</P>

      <P>I welcome the package of crime measures adopted by this Government and acknowledge they have been prompted on the one hand by an intelligent Opposition and propelled on the other by truly tragic events.  I hope there will be a successful outcome to the element of the package which deals with the drug barons and drug pushers.  However, that is only one element of the drug-problem.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence in the package to date of any effort to deal with the supply of drugs or of any effort to come to terms with or to do anything for the thousands of young people who are the main and first victims of drugs.  These young people stand to do irreversible damage to their life prospects, employment prospects and their health if they become caught up in a life of crime.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that any of this has been taken into account in the Government's promised package of measures, despite the fact that four years ago a select all-party committee of this House, of which I was chairman, presented the Government of the day with a thoroughly researched and comprehensive report on juvenile crime, its causes and cures.  It was to be the basis of a long awaited juvenile justice Bill, but as yet there is no evidence of that Bill being put in place.  I ask the Minister to have it in place on 25 July as part of her package if the Government is to have any credibility.</P>

      <P>I welcome the more serious and less <Col N="382" /> emotive tone of this evening's debate. Perhaps the reason is the seriousness of the issue and a recognition that nobody is without blame for the way in which the criminal justice system has been allowed to reach almost bursting point. The necessary incremental changes were not made.  On taking office I was determined that easy and all as it might have been to tinker at the edges for which I would have got immediate kudos I would take the job seriously and endeavour to try to put in place structural changes in the way business is done.  It is a slow, painful, frustrating process, not something that can happen overnight.  As one Deputy said last night cancer seldom develops overnight, nor did all the problems that beset the criminal justice system develop overnight, for example, the blame that attaches to local authorities for ignoring the courthouses and the fact that the courts were becoming more and more over burdened with work.  Perhaps the professionals working in the courts system were allowing cases to drag on and we all are aware of the syndrome of settlements on the steps of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an attempt made to reproduce as it were a pretend system where the lawyers and clients may think they were on the steps of the court to try to speed them up to finish.  This has been developing in our system.  I am satisfied that when my term of office comes to an end and we go before the people it will be recognised that serious changes were made such as the new fraud bureau, the National Drugs Unit the new unit to be set up in a matter of weeks targeted at organised crime and to deal with the assets of criminals.  Everybody has talked about it and everybody must take some of the blame for it not having been set up before now, not only the politicians but the agencies themselves which resisted that kind of change.  I am very pleased with the welcome for the Government decision that there will be a review of Garda management and the Garda Síochána.  Like every other institution the Garda Síochána is open to scrutiny by the media, Members and the <Col N="383" /> general public.  They, no more than anybody else, cannot be free from criticism on the way in which they detect crime, catch criminals and deliver the service to the public.  I am not surprised by Mr. John Ferry's comments &mdash; everything is always a little too late for John Ferry. He has another job to do in that perhaps he might take the opportunity to resolve the ongoing dispute in the Garda Síochána. As I said when I was dealing with the GRA Bill, it is time that dispute was ended and it is in their own hands to do so.  They need to do that as a matter of urgency to make sure the work they are doing is not in any way taken from by the fact that they cannot work together.</P>
    <P>Many issues were raised tonight, such as video taping, the revenue laws, a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I am glad that Members raised important matters.  In the minute she had, Deputy Quill made probably one of the most relevant comments on the issue of dealing with young people, dealing with the education and health facets of the problem as well as the breakdown in communities as Deputy Sargent raised.  Let us not forget that these are all facets of the debate so that when we have a response they are considered, carefully put together and worked on in a way that will see a change so that these evil drug traffickers and other criminals will recognise the resolve of this Government and Parliament.</P>

      <P>I understand why the Minister finds it a frustrating process to be in Government with the Labour Party and Democratic Left which more than anyone else have delayed progress in this area in the past year.  It is very <Col N="384" /> disappointing that it took a tragic murder in the city to bring the Government to its senses and agree with Fianna Fáil policy on this matter.  Last night we had the spectacle of a Government agreeing a Fianna Fáil Bill which was moved and sent to Committee.  This fine Bill had been rejected by the Government a while ago.</P>
      <P>There is an element of a public relations exercise to the package announced by the Government.  For example, the appointment of two High Court judges was presented as part of an anti-crime package.  It is indecorous and demeaning to the appointees to present their appointment as part of an anti-crime package.  The particular lady and gentleman who were appointed to those positions were appointed by the President on the advice of the Government on the basis of their qualifications to be High Court judges and not on some presumed attachment to an anti-crime crusade.</P>
      <P>A crucial decision required from this Government on criminal measures is the appointment of more Circuit Court judges because the Circuit Court is the workhorse of the system.  I would lke to see the Government going ahead with the appointment of Circuit Court judges.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister is <Col N="385" /> already looking at those issues and attending to them.  On the question of bail, the key decision is the establishment of a remand prison.  We are all very disappointed that it will take some time to do so.  I agree with Deputy Michael McDowell when he said this matter should be put out to tender. There is one practical matter I would like to ask the Minister about in that connection, the provision of a central locking facility in prison.  The major defect of Wheatfield is the absence of a central locking facility.  I hope the Minister in her negotiations with the prison officers and in engaging a contractor to build this establishment will ensure that this facility is available.  There is a great deal more I would like to say but I will give way to my colleague, Deputy Woods.</P>

      <P>I welcome this excellent package and I am very happy that the Government has rowed in behind it.  I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on putting it together.  It covers the key elements that need to be addressed, bail, the right to silence, criminal procedures and the national emergency.  If we have a package in place backed up by the provisions in Deputy O'Donoghue's Misuse of Drugs Bill, followed by the Minister's recent Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, with the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill agreed by the Government last night, put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue and followed up by effective action, it will work.  The Minister knows what I am talking about. If all these are not brought together and put into action it will not work.  We can make all the laws, proposals and suggestions we want but unless there is Executive action they will not work.  The Government must follow through on the terms of the motion.  Rather than go into recess on Friday next, 5 July, the House should sit next week to put the various proposals together and into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures in these packages have been proposed repeatedly.  I proposed <Col N="386" /> them on 5 February last year and again in January of this year.  While we welcome the comprehensive package announced by the Minister we want to see results.  As she is aware, the officials dealing with the drug barons have fears. When Minister for Social Welfare.  I highlighted the difficulties and the Garda Síochána provided protection but as soon as it was removed an officer of the Department was shot.</P>

      <P>I have many other ideas and suggestions. I agree strongly that there should be a special action force comprising members of the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Social Welfare in particular to tackle the crime lords and the drug barons.  Unless such a force receives all the support it needs we will not get results.  I am aware that the Minister sought to ensure liaison but it has not been effective and needs to be tightened.  We will support her in her efforts to bring this about.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in the implementation of the package announced by the Government and congratulate Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell on tabling this comprehensive motion and the work they have done in the recent past in highlighting many of these issues.  There is a need for action to put the crime lords away.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the motion which was agreed with the Government parties on Monday as part of their response to the legitimate public outrage, anger and despair at the murders of Veronica Guerin in Dublin and of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe by the IRA in Adare.  The murder of Veronica Guerin delivered the most recent political message to the Government and the Members of the House.  She was <Col N="387" /> murdered because of what she wrote, what she knew and might expose about people who claimed to be untouchable.</P>
      <P>Having agreed to the terms of the motion the Government, in a great PR exercise, spectacularly arranged a press conference at the time the motion was to be debated in the House.  This was offensive to the Dáil, the elected assembly of the people.  This is an indication that the Government is on the run.</P>
      <P>The range of measures proposed are almost casually being nodded through. This makes me highly suspicious because last February they were cast aside with contempt and declared by the Government to be fundamentally unsound, glaringly unconstitutional, daft and nothing less than a fraud.  It has now done a U-turn on all of them in the glare of the white heat of the public's rage.  I welcome this as it is in the public interest that it should do so.  All these measures need urgent attention.  I question, however, the Government's sincerity in accepting them.</P>
      <P>The Government has a new found interest in being constructive with the Opposition parties.  It is blindingly obvious that this is not the politics of the last atrocity but of the last blunder.  The Government's initial reaction to the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was to minimise the involvement of the persons responsible, the Provisional IRA.  Its initial response to the murder of Veronica Guerin was to suggest that we should think about the matter for a month and return for a debate on the report of a task force. When this was greeted with the derision it deserved the Government panicked and caved in and would have signed up to anything.</P>
      <P>In speaking on Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill last night the Minister gave the game away by making it clear that she saw more bad than good in it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is truly planning for future generations.  Illogically, the Government is accepting only a curtailment of the right to silence in respect of those who sing dumb throughout their trial.  There is no mention of any extension of this curtailment to other serious crimes such as murder. Last night the Government moved an amendment to restrict the right to silence in drug trafficking cases.  It voted down, however, a necessary amendment to ensure interviews with persons detained for up to seven days are taped. The Bill will be faulty if it is passed without that important safeguard.  The Minister has deemed that the regulations in force on the 48 hour detention. apply equally to seven day detention. This is foolish and unsafe.</P>
      <P>The Government's package announced last night was trumpeted as tough, new and immediate but as the hours tick by it is beginning to unravel. Words have lost all meaning.

    <P>The full extent of the scandal of temporary release will never be known.  A total of 4,000 orders for full temporary release are made each year.

It is an unconditional and permanent release of which there is no public record and where the victims and their relatives are never contacted in advance.  This is a scandal waiting to explode.  Today the relatives of the victims of such a person handed a petition into the House.  This petition was signed by hundreds of people objecting to the <Col N="389" /> early release of this person without their prior knowledge or adequate consultation with the distraught relatives of the three murdered soldiers.</P>

      <P>Consumers are always right and it is important that they have confidence in the beef product. Red meat is very important in our diet because of its high protein level and it is essential that the quality is of the highest standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago under the Abattoirs Act we got rid of the small village butcher.  We wanted to improve the quality of meat and ensure higher standards of hygiene but in doing so we handed the business over to the large processors and got rid of the village butcher who sold good quality fresh meat with a good flavour.  If the flavour is not right, then the meat is not right.  I urge the Minister to look again at the Abbatoirs Act.  I am aware of what is proposed in EU directives but Spain and England did not implement the directive in this area in its totality.  A report in a UK newspaper stated that that country got a derogation from that directive.  The village butcher was very concerned about his consumers with <Col N="390" /> whom he had a more personal relationship than the large processor.  He was only interested in killing the best animals and selling the highest quality product.</P>
    <P>In addition to the changes which have taken place on the European front, many changes on the home scene in recent years have helped destroy the quality of our beef.  I sympathise with the Minister of State who is doing a good job.  He has been sent in on many occasions to save the day for the Government.  I am not praising him because I am friendly with him but because I admire him for the good job he is doing.  I do not know how long he will be in this position but I will not try to destroy him while he is there.</P>
    <P>Feed compounders in Europe must list the ingredients used by them either on the packaging or the invoice.  It is very important that the ingredients of the food given to ruminant animals are known and that there is greater contact between the consumer, processor and primary producer.  It is not unknown for consumer representatives to visit producers' premises.  For example, suppliers in the South regularly bring the representatives of a large Northern multiple to the farms where the animals come from so that they can see for themselves what kind of product they are selling to their customers.  We cannot ignore this trend which is the only way of restoring confidence in the product and increasing consumption to its original level.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to reduce the age profile so that animals are slaughtered when they are younger.  The days when 12-year-old or culled cows were slaughtered are long past and we are now entering an era when cattle of little more than two years will be slaughtered. This will ensure a better and higher quality product which is more consumer-oriented. The Department must work progressively in that direction.  In other countries the ingredients used in feed compounds are listed on the packaging or invoice and I do not understand the resistance by producers here <Col N="391" /> to doing this.  By listing the ingredients people know what was fed to the cattle which were slaughtered.  I ask the Minister to use his influence to ensure that this is done here.</P>
    <P>Farm examinations will become a reality as consumers become more interested in what is happening. Marks &amp; Spencer, one of the flagships of the UK retailing industry, buys its beef from a corps of suppliers and knows the farms from which it comes.  I understand that Tesco, Sainbury's and Safeways, the other three major multiples in the UK, operate on a similar basis.  It must be remembered that the UK, which has a market of 57-60 million people and is on our doorstep, is not self-sufficient in food.  We will be subject to similar scrutiny.  While the perception is that all Irish beef is grass fed, this is not altogether true.</P>
    <P>Because of seasonality and difficult winters we are dependent on other feedstuffs. Identification and the source of the feed is vitally important.  The only people who can provide such identification are the feed compounders.  We are entering a new scene.  If we are to gain consumer confidence as an export oriented country, exporting practically all we produce in the beef area, we will have to adhere to strict rules and disciplines and adopt an open approach to the business.  I have referred to the four largest multiples in the UK, one of which already has such disciplines while the other three are working towards putting them in place.  Many of our large Irish food processors are exporting to the UK and supplying those multiples. If we do not gain consumer confidence and if the Department does not give leadership Irish farming is doomed.</P>
    <P>I wish An Bord Bia every success.  It must be seen to be a consumer-oriented organisation.  All organisations involved in the promotion of food products will have to change their direction.  There will have to be greater emphasis on promotion rather than on marketing.  We have been advised that in the European context there will be larger groupings in <Col N="392" /> the food area.  Promotion rather than centralised marketing is the answer. There is a strong case for the ingredients of animal feedstuffs to be made known to the multiple which buys the product so that the consumer can be informed where it came from.  In that way we will gain consumer confidence and our food industry will become the envy of the world.  As an island country we have lost much in the past ten or 11 years because of our liberal approach. We failed to protect what we had but we have learnt our lesson.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has a major role to play in giving leadership and regaining our position.  We could be the food flagship of the western world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why within 12 months any Government should have to introduce a second An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill.  On 27 June 1995 we debated an amendment to the principal Act and within a year we are debating another small addition. Why was this proposed change not implemented last year when the 1995 Bill was introduced?</P>
      <P>The debate has been rightly used by a number of Deputies to outline the concerns and the crisis in the beef industry. It is worth recalling a statement issued by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on 20 January 1995 at the Green Week food fair in Berlin. He was referring to our food industry and the decline in demand for beef in Germany by 12 per cent in 1994.  He said:</P>
      <P>The problem in Germany is merely a temporary little setback because of the BSE scare...  Our controls and the quality of our food in Europe are such that the Germans will be well able to differentiate our beef from British beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent events have shown that consumers on the Continent and worldwide have not been able to differentiate between Irish and British beef.  This has <Col N="393" /> caused outrage to a number of beef producers. Since 20 March when the famous House of Commons statement was made it has been all downhill for a number of our beef producers and processors. Whether we like it or not, consumer perceptions will determine the market for Irish beef and world beef. We must be aware of their concerns and fears.</P>
    <P>I compliment An Bord Bia on what it has been trying to achieve.  In an efficient manner it has tried to counteract some of the fears and concerns of the consumer.  Because it is a market-led industry it is important that An Bord Bia, as the marketing agency for Irish food products, should be leading the way.  I compliment it on its recent HORIZONS food fair in the RDS which could compare favourably with any in the world.  It was its first food fair and I had the pleasure of being present with our spokesperson on agriculture.  I was surprised at the standards attained and the quality and presentation of Irish food.  International buyers were equally impressed by the standards of presentation.</P>
    <P>While BSE has created problems for the Irish food sector, a problem that should not be overlooked is the strength of the Irish punt in relation to sterling. While it has remained at between £1.02 and £1.03 against sterling it has created ongoing problems for a number of our food producers.  The weakness in sterling has caused problems for a number of companies.  This Government has not granted assistance where it is needed.  In an industry where Irish manufacturing costs are 5 per cent above their UK competitors it is difficult for companies to compete on export markets when the punt is trading at or above parity with sterling.  The exchange rate between the punt and sterling is a crucial factor in maintaining the competitiveness of the Irish agri-food business.  It affects exporters who are trading in the UK market and in other European and world markets as their competitive edge is compromised because the UK competitors are at a distinct advantage.  It <Col N="394" /> also has the double effect of making English agricultural products more competitive in the Irish market.  The present weak state of sterling is making it very difficult for Irish food exporters to maintain market share.  The effect is serious and is threatening employment in this important labour intensive sector.</P>
    <P>The Government must acknowledge the contribution of the food industry to the economy because of its output, value and low import content.  The only thing which is saving many companies trading in today's economic climate is the fact that interest rates are remaining low, otherwise we would have serious problems in our food manufacturing industry.  The food industry has a major role to play in our economy and this should not be lost sight of by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Food companies will have to think more as customers do rather than as producers.  In the past producers have thought of themselves as producers only.  They will now have to see what the customer wants and produce goods at a price and, more importantly, at a standard which the customer needs.  The professional approach of An Bord Bia in marketing Irish food products is to be complimented.</P>
    <P>The obvious solution to the problems associated with the fluctuations in the currency exchange rate is the creation of a single currency with all European countries involved.  However, recent evidence suggests that this goal is a long way off and is further complicated by the fact that Britain is becoming cooler by the day to the single currency idea. Indeed, it has negotiated an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; provision in relation to this proposal.  It is the only viable long-term solution to our problems and would give Irish businesses involved in the export market some stability so that they can plan on a medium to long-term basis.  Over 40 per cent of our exports go to the UK and any changes occurring in the exchange rate between the punt and sterling have an effect on trade with our near neighbours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> The problem is exacerbated when one considers that 75 per cent of our food exports go to the UK.  These amounted to more than £1.4 billion last year, not an insignificant amount.  We currently supply almost 11 per cent of Britain's annual food imports.  Our exporters should be complimented on the market share they have secured in the United Kingdom.  Apart from the UK, and to a lesser extent Germany, the European consumer associates Ireland with the production of first class alcoholic drinks, such as Guinness, beer and Jameson whiskey rather than a main producer in the food sector.  We should not be fooled by our green image, many continental consumers do not hold that image of us.</P>
    <P>Our food companies are relatively small compared to some of their international competitors.  If our food is to find its way to the shelves and tables of more world markets, producers will have to seriously consider options such as alliances, partnerships and the production of branded products for major multinational food companies.  A number of companies have taken that route in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Given the challenges that face our food industry following CAP reform and GATT and the need for our food producers to compete successfully on the world market, it is appropriate that we have set up a single agency to deal with the marketing of our food and drink products.  In its short time in existence, An Bord Bia has made a good start in this area.  In the past 12 months it has held discussions with more than 100 retailers across the European Union.  Most major supermarkets have been contacted by An Bord Bia and it has made more than 112 presentations to potential customers here and throughout Europe.  If we are to succeed, we must continue to encourage and cajole foreign multinationals, the big players in the retail food market, to locate here.  It is not good enough for us to know we have a quality product, we <Col N="396" /> must convince the big players in the world market, particularly in Europe.</P>
    <P>Much lip service has been paid to the horticulture industry, but its only success has been the production and marketing of mushrooms.  We have failed to properly market field vegetables, such as apples and soft fruits.  An Bord Bia should examine the improvements that can be made in the production and presentation of such vegetables.  With the co-operation of producers, processors and marketing companies, field vegetables can achieve the success of the mushroom sector.  Tomatoes and lettuce could be produced in abundance, with a market on our doorstep, but we have failed to take advantage of that opportunity. We must tackle the major structural problems that hinder the processing and marketing of our horticultural produce.  While the most important market for such products is the fresh market, there are great opportunities for onward processing.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, on his work in this area, but we are disappointed the Government failed to appoint a Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for the food industry.</P>
    <P>A number of Irish companies have spent approximately £1.2 billion on acquisitions in the past seven years.  As part of a large international group we have access to larger markets and international methods of doing business.  We could piggyback on the success of multinational and international companies.  If Irish companies are serious about competing in world markets, they have no option but to join forces with large multinational food giants.  We urgently need to improve our international and brand marketing.  If our food industry is to prosper and grow it must diversify from low margin commodity products, such as beef and dairying which are in surplus, and move into value added downstream processing.</P>
    <P>The Government stands indicted for not appointing a Minister with responsibility for the food industry.  Since 1987 a Minister of State has been responsible <Col N="397" /> for this important sector and, while it is universally accepted that the primary responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is to the farming sector, it is increasingly acknowledged that the food industry needs political clout at national and European levels.  The Minister cannot serve two masters.  I ask him to reconsider the possibility of appointing a Minister with responsibility for food.</P>
    <P>I was pleased the Minister stated that up to £640 million, supported by EU and Government funding, will be invested in the food industry in the period up to 1999.  This will result in an increase in output of 25 per cent to £12 billion and an increase in exports from £4.3 billion to £7 billion.  This displays a confidence in our food industry, despite the difficulties in An Bord Bia.  As a market led economy we must promote our food industry if we are to survive. We can compete successfully with the giants on the international stage, but to do so our food industry needs the support and encouragement of the Government and its agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I agree with Deputy Cowen that it is an inadequate and belated response to a crisis in the food industry by a Minister who set out to promote himself rather than agriculture.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, appears to have been wheeled in to deliver the bad news.  The Minister contributed to very few important debates in the House in recent times.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, for facing the music. The situation in agriculture is disastrous, particularly in the beef industry.  Is the Department, the Minister of State or the Minister aware of the levels of disgust and disappointment in the farming and food industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join my colleague, Deputy Nolan, our party's spokesman on food, in expressing my disappointment that there is not a Minister of State with special responsibility for food.  I know it <Col N="398" /> is the Minister of State's area when it suits, but when any announcements are made it is not in his area.  We see this every other day.</P>
    <P>From time to time I have been castigated by the Minister of State for attacking my constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates.  I do not attack him for the sake of it.  I tell him precisely what I hear in County Wexford which has a proud farming tradition.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an interest in agriculture having been born on a farm. Unfortunately, however, he is in Government with Democratic Left.  I am disappointed not to see any of that party's Members here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if they were here, they would certainly not support the Government's stance because they have always displayed an arrogant disregard for the farming community.  Whether it is through convenience or otherwise, they forget that many jobs depend on the farming community.  On every occasion we have had a debate on agriculture, Democratic Left opposed farming and the agriculture industry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is constrained in making proposals to the EU, although I do not know whether that will be affected under the Irish Presidency.  When the Minister is in Europe seeking compensation, price increases or extra quotas he is reminded that he is in Government with a party opposed to the Common Agricultural Policy.  That is not helpful when it comes to securing a reasonable deal for agriculture.  Democratic Left and Labour, which is not inclined to support the agricultural community either, should be told clearly that agriculture is not just about farming.  Some 40 per cent of the population is directly or indirectly involved in the agriculture industry, whether in farming or in food <Col N="399" /> and other associated industries.  Agriculture is our biggest industry and is likely to remain so for the forseeable future.  Any money that comes in through the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry or his successor must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, a farmer spends money building, buying materials &mdash; including fertiliser and feed &mdash; hiring contractors, buying machinery, haulage and other overheads.  It is a very big industry which deserves the support of the Government, not just one party in it.  I know the Minister is spancelled but he must shake that off in the interests of the agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is welcome, the Government has taken a casual approach to the issue.  Last November when export refunds were lowered it had a disastrous effect on the beef industry.  During Question Time last week, the Minister of State said we had been told export refunds would be reduced as time went on because of the GATT.  We were told by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on the same occasion that there would not be a fall in cattle prices as a consequence of lowering export refunds. That proved to be very inaccurate as well as being disastrous for farmers who bought in cattle on the basis that the Minister, Deputy Yates, would hardly mislead them.  I do not suggest he misled them intentionally but he totally misread the indication, as plain as the nose on his face, that this would happen.  He was badly advised and it caused a desperate situation which required corrective measures which were not taken.</P>
    <P>On 20 March 1996 the situation was considerably exacerbated by the announcement in the House of Commons concerning a possible link between BSE and CJD; something that has not yet been proved.  That caused a loss of confidence among European consumers and, consequently, caused beef prices to plummet still further.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was very slow to react to the <Col N="400" /> announcement in the House of Commons. It was evident there was a serious problem with BSE in Great Britain. Although there was a problem in this country, it was a very small one.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry waited to see which way the wind would blow before he made a decision but he should have been out and about dissociating our industry from Britain's.  Because of the Minister's dilly-dallying, and because he feared he might make a political mistake, Irish and British beef were regarded as one and the same throughout Europe.  The delay in reacting was the greatest mistake.</P>
    <P>I as a beef producer and many such producers take pride in our industry and in the quality of our beef.  Beef producers work morning, noon and night to keep BSE and every other disease away from their herds.  On this occasion, however, we were sadly let down by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry with whom the buck stops.  He should have shown leadership but no such leadership was demonstrated on that occasion.  One cannot afford to wait in such a situation.  If, like everybody involved in agriculture, the Minister had confidence in the industry, he would have succeeded.  The beef industry has lost the confidence of the consumer.  At times matters seemed to improve and then they disimproved; the graph rose and fell.  On many occasions since 20 March Fianna Fáil asked that a concerted effort be made to regain the confidence of the consumer in Irish beef, but today we got a token response.</P>
    <P>It is important that a representative of consumer groups is included on the board of An Bord Bia.  I hope that will go some way to correct the difficulties facing farmers, not only now but in the coming winter.  We need to restore confidence. Will the Minister say what precisely the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has done to restore confidence?  Is this his only response to that request?  Is he aware that confidence is so low that the consumption of beef has dropped substantially?  He does <Col N="401" /> not appear to be, if he was he would promote our beef.  The suggestion that he is in Russia is not good enough, PR exercises have very little effect.  Everybody, particularly farmers, are aware that the Minister's PR machine is the most important part of his portfolio, and that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that, even at this late stage, the Minister would try to regain the confidence of the European markets on the basis that we have a very strong case.  Every beef producer is proud of the quality of our meat and everything possible is done to dissociate ourselves from Britain in that regard.  However, during the debate in Europe in recent months Britain took the high ground. All the talk was about British beef, BSE in Britain and how it affected that country. Despite the fact that we did not cause the problem and that beef is more important to this country than to any other economy in the EU, we were unable to get the matter on the agenda. We had a strong case, yet since 20 March we had to stand back in the queue and let Britain hog the limelight. Our case was so strong and the quality of our meat so good that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should have ensured that the Irish problem was dealt with in the first instance. There will probably always be a relationship between the two countries, but if the Minister had a conviction about the quality of our meat, the matter would have been on the agenda earlier.</P>
    <P>However, that time has passed, we can do nothing about it now, but we can do something about the future.  The Minister probably has more interest in the agricultural scene than in self-promotion and I ask him, even at this stage, to encourage the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to save this sinking ship, because it can be saved.</P>
    <P>We are facing into a winter of discontent. In 1974 farmers who went to the marts to sell calves found in some instances when they returned to their cars there were calves in their trailers which other people did not want.  Not £1 <Col N="402" /> was paid for a calf at that time.  I predict that will happen again this winter unless a genuine effort is made to resolve the problem.  This proposal is a tiny but token start to that process.</P>
    <P>Our beef industry is very important not only to farmers but to the nation in terms of exports and wealth generation. If the farmer, who is no different from any other business person, is not paid a reasonable price for his product he will not produce it.  To break even, a beef finisher must make about £1.05 per pound, but with the price of cattle at 88p per pound, the farmer is losing hand over fist.  It is estimated that in some instances they are losing £200 per head, and the response by way of compensation is £50 per head.  I accept it is a short-term measure and that farmers cannot be bailed out with compensation, but the beef industry can be bailed out by promoting our beef.  Unless that is done we will not solve the problem.  If the consumer is not on our side we will not win.  There is little point producing a product that no one will buy and, therefore, it is vitally important that the consumer is on our side.</P>
    <P>I hope the person appointed to the board is a member of a consumer group, a person who knows the business, and not selected on the basis of political allegiance.  If, however, that is the case, I hope he or she is not a member of Democratic Left.  I ask the Minister to please appoint somebody with an interest and a belief in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed there have been very few speakers from the Government side.  That indicates a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and in what he has done, or failed to do for the beef industry in the past eight or nine months.  It is not too late.  The situation can be retrieved.  The winter can be better if the Minister concentrates on his job which is to support agriculture, not necessarily himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate and <Col N="403" /> the fact that consumers will be represented on the board the Minister is setting up.  I realise it is a cliché to say we should produce what consumers want, not what we think they want, but it is important they have representation on the board.  The Minister has not been supportive of consumers during his time in office.  He seems to have aligned himself with the producers.</P>
      <P>Small farmers in the west have suffered in recent times and their difficulties have not been addressed by the Minister.  During the period from 20 March to 21 June no attempt was made to deal with the major crisis in Irish agriculture, and the outcome of the meeting in Florence on 21 June was disappointing.</P>
      <P>Since I was elected to the Dáil 21 years ago, at the time of a major crisis concerning cattle, there have been food scares almost on a yearly basis.  Doubts have been raised over the years about meat, butter, antibiotics in milk, etc.  To be fair, an effort was made in the past to address the genuine concerns in regard to these issues but it is ironic that butchers feel compelled to put up signs in their shop windows indicating that their meat is hormone free and that people in the milk business have to say their milk does not contain antibiotics. Why should questions be raised about the quality of their food products?</P>
      <P>In many ways the large multinational companies have given the impression that some smaller producers are unable to produce food in a healthy environment. That is totally wrong.  I have always defended the smaller producers, including butchers, the people running small poultry farms, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representation are made to me on a monthly basis about markets being closed down in some of our towns.  In Galway city, for example, where there is a fine market every Saturday, concerns have been expressed that people are not allowed to sell brown bread or eggs.  I realise we tend to blame Europe because the many directives it issues can tie us up in knots, but we must examine <Col N="404" /> this problem in a realistic way and help people who are not associated with the large multinationals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen referred to the importance of traceability in rebuilding confidence in the industry, particularly the meat industry.  I hope we hear a great deal more from the Minister in that regard because the problem has been addressed successfully in other countries.  With all the technology available to us I fail to understand the reason we do not have a proper system of traceability.  If we continue the way we are going, and if we have a disaster similar to that in 1974-75 when calves were given away in Galway &mdash; I am sure that occurred in Kerry also because many of our farmers travelled to Kerry to buy calves &mdash; it will result in severe difficulties for small farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that farmers in the west urgently require a resumption of the light cattle trade.  I heard the Minister and the Minister of State refer to promotional trips to Sweden and Russia to assist the industry.  I accept that is important and that Europe has a major role to play in this regard because compensation is only a temporary measure, but we must get the markets in Egypt, Libya and Saudi Arabia reopened and continue to promote trade with the third countries.</P>
    <P>Our spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, and two of his colleagues made a successful trip to Iran.  They were pilloried to some extent by the Government which described the trip as a political stunt, but that is what happens in Opposition. If we try to promote something it is regarded as a stunt but in Government it is regarded as the business of the nation.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not been active in trying to reopen the markets in those third countries, although I know the Taoiseach made a number of telephone calls to the Heads of State.</P>
    <P>I do not lay all the blame at the door of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Why has the Minister for <Col N="405" /> Foreign Affairs not made any promotional trips?  I understand the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is heavily involved in the EU Presidency, will negotiate on behalf of the Government, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been derelict in his duties in that he has not used his office to obtain more trade, particularly for the live cattle industry.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the question of compensation.  We waited a long time for the decision made at the Florence Summit.  Compensation and nonco-operation by Great Britain were the main issues addressed at the summit.  I welcome the £70 million in compensation but given that the losses to Irish farmers have been conservatively estimated at £150 million, it represents only 50p in the pound, if not less.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are solely dependent on beef exports and exports to the European Union are down by 50 per cent. That issue must be addressed in addition to the question of promoting Irish beef in European supermarkets which is vitally important.  There are reports that Irish beef is not being promoted in countries like Britain and France and we must make every effort to ensure it is promoted in these countries. An Bord Bia should address that issue because it is vitally important that confidence is restored and to do that we must ensure there is no doubt about the high quality of Irish beef.  We have a very good product and we must continue to promote it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the needs of the consumer are being recognised in the Bill but I am concerned that the Minister and the Government are not doing enough to promote Irish beef and to safeguard the incomes of Irish farmers. We are heading for a serious drop in incomes in the autumn if action is not taken by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this Bill.  I hope the appointment of a consumer representative to An Bord Bia will restore consumer confidence.  I <Col N="406" /> find it difficult to judge if this Bill is meant to be a significant response to the problems which the recent BSE crisis caused in the beef industry.  It has few support measures, therefore it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is unlikely to have a significant impact on restoring confidence in the beef industry.</P>
      <P>It is important to take this opportunity to remind ourselves of the extent of the crisis which has beset Irish agriculture over the past eight to ten months.  While the BSE crisis was the most recent difficulty, there were others for the beef farming sector, including the removal of export credit refunds which had and continues to have a severe impact on farmers, in spite of the Minister's recent proposals.  In addition, the Irish sheep sector was badly wounded by the Government's mishandling of its case.  A large number of dairy farmers suffered a reduction in their incomes because of the super levy and the difficulties with milk quotas.  I raise these issues to place in context this relatively insignificant effort to address a small part of the problem in the beef industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that consumers will have a representative on An Bord Bia.  This is important because the consumer will decide what will be bought or sold.  Ireland has suffered more than any other country from the BSE crisis in the three and a half months since the announcement by the House of Commons. Ireland has made the least effective effort at Government level to redress the situation.  Irish farmers are concerned about the manner in which this matter has been handled by the Minister, who was initially painted as a potentially great Minister.  However, that view has changed in farming circles. Many producers, particularly of smaller store cattle and weanlings, fear the future.  They fear a glut in the market and a massive price reduction in the autumn when beef producers try to sell their animals.  This challenge must be addressed by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> While I welcome the appointment of a consumer representative to An Bord Bia, it will not have the positive impact the Minister hopes.  There is a fundamental difference between the role of An Bord Bia as a sales unit for Irish food products and the role of the consumer. While there is room for an overlap, the impact which one representative on a body of 13 or 14 will have is minimal.  There is a greater need for a stronger and more complete package which ensures traceability from the farmyard to the consumer.  Such a system should be put in place.  The Minister said it will cost approximately £12 million or £14 million.  This is a small amount of money in comparison to what is being spent on policing the Border at present.  I urge the Minister to establish a system of traceability.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister should examine the role of Teagasc and the need to ensure ongoing research.  I am worried that the research scientist on organic beef no longer works for Teagasc.  The Government does not have its priorities right when it moves in that direction.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is the only attempt to restore confidence in Irish beef, it will fail.  It will only have an impact if it is introduced with a number of other measures.  Irish agriculture is in crisis because internationally people are questioning the quality of Irish beef.  Irish beef is clear of BSE and the message needs to be driven home.  The consumer must be satisfied that Irish beef is the quality product we know it to be.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to make a short contribution on the Bill, which is welcome but which is a belated response to an industry that has been writhing from a severe fall in confidence over recent months, particularly since the fatal statement in the House of Commons.  If we want a <Col N="408" /> vibrant food industry, it is essential that we have the confidence and the commitment of both the producers and the consumers. A food industry in a vibrant agricultural sector is essential for an economy such as ours which is heavily dependent on agriculture.</P>
      <P>In my home county, where only 16 per cent of the population live in towns, it is obvious that the farming community is the biggest generator of wealth. County Cavan is dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 32.7 per cent of persons in employment compared with the national figure of 14.3 per cent. The proportion employed in that sector is on a par with the national level, whereas the 36.4 per cent employed in the services sector is well below the national average.  The food industry is the main subsector in manufacturing in my county and directly employs approximately 1,300 people.  Direct support for the industry should be targeted at new small scale and specially food projects.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funding and support to ensure that product diversification takes place.  New and existing food companies need to develop suitable added value food processing enterprises and quality innovative projects.  In my constituency there is a particular emphasis on dairying, mushroom, poultry and pig meat industries, but there is little emphasis on added value.  The necessary research and development is not being carried out in those sectors.  Research, whether in individual agribusiness or in the higher institutions of education, must provide better uses for the primary product through formulations to suit customer requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too much of our agricultural product is in commodity and not enough is in added value.  Research, adding value, customer requirements and the creation of customer needs must be interlinked if we are to derive maximum value from our agriculture industry.  There is an obvious need for the establishment of satellite units or small food research centres in areas in which there is special <Col N="409" /> emphasis on a particular agricultural commodity.  From his recent visit to the Cavan area the Minister will realise it is a prime location for such a unit with possible co-operation from our neighbours in the North.</P>
    <P>The desire of the United States Administration to help job creation in Border regions provides an obvious opportunity for us to strengthen our national food industry.  It has given us the opportunity to aim to exploit to our best advantage the large markets of the United States and the European Union. Satellite food research centres could provide advice on product development, marketing, labelling, testing and facilities which would meet stringent European regulations.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with Forfás and IDA Ireland to have an advance factory provided in Cavan geared specifically towards the food industry with an emphasis on development in a cross-Border context.  At a time when there is much talk about the need to regenerate the Border economy, it is opportune for such agencies to put the necessary funding and facilities in place.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the past few months the confidence of the agricultural community has been severely dented.  As Deputy Cowen mentioned, many producers fear the autumn when the markets we desire for our beef products may not exist.  Unless there is a buoyant trade by the autumn, there will be a major drop in the income of the farming community.  The concerted political campaign to restore and maintain our markets was not effected by the Government.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, senior members of the Government and junior Ministers should have travelled to foreign markets to ensure that customers in those markets knew Irish beef was not British beef and that our beef product was of the highest standard and nutritious value.  To our detriment there is not a sufficiently clear delineation between British and Irish products in those markets. Unfortunately, the necessary <Col N="410" /> efforts were not made by the Government to guard against a downturn in markets for Irish beef products.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that during the Irish Presidency of the EU every effort will be made to restore consumer confidence in our beef industry, 80 per cent of which is dependent on exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution in support of the Bill.  This is the third attempt to get matters right.  I welcome the thrust of the Bill, but I question if it goes far enough.  It appears to be a token to consumers rather than ensuring that they are the driving force behind our marketing effort.  It does not endorse Irish food, a major contributor to our economy.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the principal Bill was introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Walsh.  At that time there was considerable angst among the farming organisations because they were not represented on the board.  We were all guilty in failing to recognise the importance of the consumer in the food chain. We effectively slammed the door on consumers then and also on the second attempt when an amendment Bill was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Yates.  We have now recognised the role of the consumer, but is the appointment of one consumer representative to the board an adequate recognition of the very important role ultimately played by the consumer in endorsing or rejecting our food product, whether beef, fish, poultry or another product?  We need to pay far more attention to the voice of the consumer.  In the Upper House, Senator Fergal Quinn is a constant champion of the consumer and he has argued consistently for removing the responsibility for the food sector from the Department.  I am not sure that is the answer, but I question if this measure adequately recognises the ultimate role played by the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the debate focused on the BSE crisis and we have been dragged screaming to the altar to recognise that. <Col N="411" /> Regardless of all the marketing gurus one can employ, without consumer endorsement of our product marketing efforts are useless.  However, there is great need for a concerted and co-ordinated marketing drive by An Bord Bia and, in that sense, I congratulate it and the Department on organising the recent food fair held in the RDS to which there was a positive reaction and I hope it resulted in additional orders.</P>
    <P>Much unfair criticism has been levied at the Department, particularly at the Minister, in this debate because of alleged inactivity in securing new markets or regaining old ones for Irish beef. We cannot force people to eat beef if they do not want to eat it.  It will be a slow and painful process to regain the ground lost if that can ever be regained. There will also be a painful readjustment for those involved in the primary agriculture industry in beef production. Ongoing political, technical and diplomatic endeavours are being made by the Minister and veterinary section of his Department to rebuild confidence by making a clear distinction between Irish and British beef in the international markets.  We suffer a significant disadvantage because of our land border with the UK.  While we might have an exaggerated opinion of our status in the international world of politics and business, there is a tendency internationally to wrongly refer in a bland fashion to the British Isles as including Ireland.  It requires all the technical and marketing competence of An Bord Bia and the Department to highlight the distinction.</P>
    <P>The BSE problem is not one of the Government's making or one that can be resolved as we might be led to believe by the commentaries of some Members.  It will involve a painful readjustment in Irish agriculture and it is questionable if we can regain 100 per cent of our previous market.  There is not a quick fix in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be complimented for the compensation package he secured with his EU partners in the past week which will be available to those who will <Col N="412" /> have suffered most in the context of the recent drop in cattle prices.  I should like suggestions from farming organisations on how best that compensatory fund can be applied so that it is targeted at those who need it most in which endeavour no doubt the Minister and Government would be very willing to work in tandem with them.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and Government on introducing this Bill. However, I have a reservation that it represents a token rather than a serious recognition of the role of consumers within the food industry, on which the Minister might comment when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome reservedly the Minister's decision to incorporate a consumers' representative on the board of An Bord Bia which, as many others said, is probably too little too late.</P>
      <P>The Minister assumed office in a blaze of glory and, at the outset, was in the pockets of the farming organisations, particularly the IFA, evidenced by the fact that he recruited some of its members to his inner Cabinet, leading many farmers, particularly smaller ones, to the conclusion that the Minister was working to an IFA agenda.</P>
      <P>Consequent on the BSE crisis, it is only in the past month or two that the Minister recognised the role of the consumer, the fact that they are up in arms at the manner in which that crisis has been handled and that many of them no longer purchase beef products to the same extent.  The Minister decided to offer them a token gesture by placing a representative on the board of An Bord Bia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members have been very complimentary of An Bord Bia and its operations to date.  I am not so sure that agency has played the major role it should in relation to the overall BSE crisis and I am aware it lacks adequate staffing and resources.  Even at the height of the crisis, when it established a free telephone inquiry line, I and many other Members received complaints from consumers who had been unable <Col N="413" /> to establish contact with its personnel and who, when they lodged complaints afterwards, were informed of its inadequate staffing and resources.  Therefore, the Minister should seriously consider providing that agency with adequate resources for its overall operations as its role and importance to our economy is beyond question.  It is time the Minister came down from his high PR horse &mdash; adopting an attitude that, on the day, everything will be all right &mdash; and do something concrete for farmers, processors and consumers.  Most people are beginning to see that the Minister's actions amount to no more than a public relations whirlwind exercise nationwide of very little substance.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis has lowered the overall confidence of the farming community. Since I live adjacent to the County Wexford farmers' mart, on Monday and Tuesday mornings I listen to the genuine complaints of a substantial number of farmers very critical of the fact that they are losing substantial amounts of money, experiencing great difficulty in surviving and seeing very little light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>It also appears the Minister knows very little about how the banks operate when one listens to him say that the banks and Department will be sympathetic to the plight of farmers in this crisis. Already the banks are putting the squeeze on many beef farmers, telling them that if they were unable to meet their repayments over the past year, they will certainly not give them more money to purchase stock or material for 1997.  I predict farmers will really only experience the crisis first-hand in September and October next when they will have great difficulty in getting an adequate price for their product and-or financial support.  We all know how banks operate, when a farmer, businessman or anyone else is not making substantial profits, they do not want to know, adequately demonstrating that the Minister's constant theme that the banks will be sympathetic to the plight of farmers amounts to nothing more than a red herring.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> Having served in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, with responsibility for food, I know the amount of time, energy and resources invested in promoting our food industry on the European scene, all of which has been negatived by the Minister's inadequate response in recent months.  He has been unable to adequately guarantee Irish meat products of the highest quality, that no consumer across the European Union need have any worries about them.  Neither has he been able to press home the fact that Irish produce has no connection with its United Kingdom counterpart.  We are all aware of the attitude of other European Union member states to meat products from Britain.  With the exception of very few, our farmers have been producing top quality meat products, within a green environment, conforming to highest health and hygiene standards.  We should fully exploit the misfortunes of British farmers but, for reasons best known to the Minister and his Department, we have been unable to do so.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia should take a positive, tangible role in that respect at present. There is no point in the Minister saying two or three people are promoting Irish beef in the United Kingdom or throughout the European Union.  There is a need for many more people to sell our produce to European consumers, pointing out that it is of the highest quality, comforming to highest health standards. Until we get that message across we shall make no progress.  I do not know why the Minister appears so reluctant to visit Iran or any other far flung country to rekindle our sales there.  He appears to want a cast iron guarantee before hand that he will be successful.  Anybody engaging in any marketing strategy must be prepared for the hard sell, to slog it out and convince prospective buyers of the excellence of one's product. The Minister appears to want a telephone call from Iran, Iraq or Egypt asking him to visit them, saying that their markets are about to be reopened, when all the news will be good.  That amounts to a pathetic ministerial response.  The <Col N="415" /> Minister must make a genuine effort to sell our farmers' top quality produce.</P>
    <P>While for some 18 months after assuming office the Minister was popular with the IFA and rancher farmers, I assure him he is anything but popular with them now.  I know this having attended public meetings in Wexford and observing farming organisations march on this House.  They are disillusioned, disenchanted and annoyed with the Minister's recent action.  It is time he realised the importance of agriculture to our economy, to job creation, farmers' survival and our economy overall.  It is very important that the Minister recognises that and sets in train a set of objectives to restore confidence in the Irish meat industry at home and abroad.  The first challenge is for the Minister, the farm organisations and the processors to convince Irish people that we have a product of the highest standard and then to convince the wider European community so that jobs will be protected and we will have the financial resources to meet the changing situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that An Bord Bia will have a representative of the consumer. It is very much a token gesture at a late hour, but it is recognition at last by the Minister that the consumer is the number one person in Ireland and across the European Union.  It is time we spelt out that message loudly and clearly.  If An Bord Bia is hamstrung at the moment, it should be given the freedom to promote and sell our products. I see little action on the part of An Bord Bia, but perhaps I am being unfair and work is going on behind the scenes. Over recent months we have not been able to come to grips with the BSE crisis despite the fact that it was not of Ireland's making, that we are producing a top quality product and that the processors are adding value to that product. The Minister, the Department and the marketing agencies have failed in their efforts to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Chair for <Col N="416" /> giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this issue.  However, I am somewhat disillusioned and disappointed, having spent ten months in the Department and been aware of the promotion of the food industry with emphasis on the fact that our food is produced to the highest health standards in a green environment.  That was four years ago.  Everywhere we went in Europe, we were pushing an open door because buyers openly wanted Irish products.  Four years down the road we find ourselves at a standstill, unable to get ourselves out of the mess we are in because of lack of action by the Minister and his agents.  The value of the food industry which was so important to the economy and to the producers seems to have been eroded.  We seem to have lost our ability to sell on the wider European table.  That is a pity, and it is a problem the Minister must come to grips with, and soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that a Labour Party representative has come into the Chamber.  All too often the Minister, in this case the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, has to sit here on his own.  It is extraordinary that for a debate on our most important industry, in respect of which public confidence has been seriously undermined by what has been happening over recent months, there should be no support for the Minister from Members on the Government side of the House.  The presence in the House of the parties in Government might give people the solace of knowing that there was even minuscule political interest in the matter.  I do not see any Members of Democratic Left who, since they went into Government, have engaged in publicly destroying confidence in Irish processing to the extent that the consumer is seriously concerned about the quality of our beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of my colleagues have said that the Bill is too little, too late.  If it is too late, it certainly is too little.  The crisis that is rumbling towards catastrophe has been with us for some time.  There must <Col N="417" /> have been evidence before the development of the BSE crisis of consumer difficulty which needed to be addressed to protect the good name of farmers and the quality of Irish beef.  Naturally, it would not have been expected that the situation could be retrieved because of a certain attitudinal change towards beef consumption.  However, the developing crisis was crystallised by the BSE crisis and nothing has been done to avert disaster.</P>
    <P>The placing of an additional member on the board of An Bord Bia is a public relations exercise.  Why was this not done months ago?  Why was it not seen as a necessary, justifiable response to the most serious crisis we have had in the industry?  I cannot understand why the short Bill before the House could not have been introduced months ago. It is extraordinary that when the BSE crisis first broke the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was in Donegal campaigning in a by-election while the biggest industry in the country was going down the tubes.  It would have been a better contribution to the interests of the Donegal farmers, the sheep farmers and the beef farmers, had the Minister been out in the marketplaces of the world saying what should have been said, but he was engaged in a political exercise that, in the event, failed miserably.  More particularly he allowed the situation to roll on.</P>
    <P>There are people here who are very concerned tonight because, whatever might have been said in the past about the urban/rural divide, it must be recognised that a collapse of the beef industry would have serious implications for urban communities.  After months of not doing anything we find ourselves making a token gesture, a necessary public relations exercise that somebody has told the Minister he should engage in.</P>
    <P>The existing markets should have been the subject of an immediate response and a team should have been put in place.  Every available Minister and Minister of State with an economic, agricultural or enterprise portfolio <Col N="418" /> should have been on an aircraft to markets which could be protected or opened.  However, this did not happen and the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture, Deputy Cowen, had to assemble his colleagues, travel to markets, make a case and do the very job in which this Government should have been engaged.</P>
    <P>The people do not expect Fianna Fáil to govern the country while in Opposition. However, this is not the first time such a thing has happened and people can see clearly that the sooner Fianna Fáil is back in Government the better, before the whole State is damaged irretrievably by economic policies and responses such as that which the beef industry elicited.  The crisis is real and the consequences will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>Farmers are worried about the absence of any serious intervention system. They are concerned about their homes, children, personal finances and ability to continue in the light of their businesses being wiped out.  I am not the only one saying this; it has been said by representatives of the farming organisations, indvidual farmers and many others.  The only people who do not seem to know or care about what is happening, if one is to judge by their response, are the Minister for Agricuture, Food and Forestry and the Government.</P>
    <P>Is there some invisible shackle restraining the Government?  Is there some veto on how the Government and the Fine Gael Minister respond to the biggest industry in this country?  Does the Deputy De Rossa have some power or control which restrains the Minister from acting responsibly and capably? These questions must be answered and they can only be answered by a response which shows concern, compassion and realisation of the implications of the collapse of the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen had to lead a delegation. He did not have to be prompted because he recognised the urgency of the situation.  In his speech tonight he recognised the deficiencies <Col N="419" /> which are a direct result of a delayed response.  Irish beef is produced by the best farmers in Europe.  For many, farming is more than just an exercise in commerce; it is a way of life and a tradition. It is at all times and above all else a recognition of the desire to produce a good quality, grass-based product.</P>
    <P>Irish farmers would have expected that what they had been doing down the years and the special trust which had developed between them and consumers would have had the support of Government when the crisis occurred. The marketing of Irish beef did not receive the effective and sincere response which was necessary.</P>
    <P>The Irish beef industry has suffered much in the past few years because of the behaviour of certain individuals in this House who, while they could have pursued other methods to achieve an end, were not prepared to do that.  They were prepared to engage in a cynical political exercise that was bound to undermine the industry when other methods could have been invoked and other roads could have been taken.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister do to put a marketing team in place?  Did he tell his colleagues to get on aircraft because their place was in the market?  Did he tell them to bring with them the best marketing personnel, from both the public service and the private sector, who have the ability and capacity to put forward convincing arguments?  He did not and I regret that I have to say it.</P>
    <P>The response was to send hundreds of members of the Garda Síochána to the Border.  This response will cost millions of pounds and has left the streets of Dublin and the rest of the country denuded of a police force during the biggest crime crisis ever.  We have witnessed destruction and cowardly and horrendous loss of life.  It was Deputy O'Donoghue who this week caused the Government and the Minister for Justice to respond to the crime crisis which has affected not just the streets of Ireland but the homes and integrity of <Col N="420" /> our people.  The tracing which is desirable and necessary in the content of the BSE crisis could have been put in place. The use of gardaí can only be described as hamfisted, crude and outdated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is going to Libya, but only after his Australian counterpart has visited there and contracted for 50,000 cattle and 0.5 million sheep.  Our Minister comes out of the doldrums and awakens from his deep political slumber to head off to a country where the market share has been obtained by competitors from the southern hemisphere.</P>
    <P>The Government has not heard the last of this.  It will not be enough to window dress the crisis with a little Bill providing for the appointment of an additional person to An Bord Bia to represent consumer interests, as if that in itself is a meaningful response to the crisis.  By next October and November we will know the depth of the crisis.  The farmers in the west are fear stricken, they already have many difficulties but now they have the added difficulty of finding buyers for their livestock.  In the 1970s calves were allowed to run away because it was not worth while to bring them back at £1 a calf.  Potentially that situation may arise again.</P>
    <P>When the day of reckoning comes, what my colleagues and I have been saying tonight will be remembered, there will be a political response for which the Government will be to blame.</P>

Difficulties arose in this country as a result of the infamous statement in the House of Commons.  All European countries have faced the trauma of coming to grips with the problem of BSE.

      <P>The Iranians are one of our major customers for beef.  During a discussion with the Iranian Ambassador he told me that comments by certain Members of the House undermined the marketing of Irish beef in Iran and was one of the problems in the marketplace. This had nothing to do with the quality of the beef or BSE.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Senator O'Kennedy, had introduced regulations on the removal of meat and bone meal from feed for ruminants much earlier than other European countries and had secured an agreement with the Iranians for the purchase of Irish beef.  Members making irresponsible comments because they have a vested interest in nailing particular individuals in the beef industry do not realise that their contributions are published all over the world. No wonder the marketplace can be in trouble.  Anybody who does not know of the meetings of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs with the Iranians should check with him and the <Col N="422" /> IFA.  I am glad that view has communicated to the IFA, the ICMSA and other interested bodies.  In case Deputy Doherty, who is still absent, is not aware of the fact that the Labour Party has an interest, I suggest he read the record of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and other committee proceedings which have been trying to ensure that the beef industry is supported and not knocked by individuals with a vested interest.</P>
      <P>The expertise available to the Joint Committee on European Affairs proved that there is no link between BSE and CJD.  The committee members were given the scientific evidence that refuted the link between BSE and CJD.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Cowen on his visit to Iran in the middle of an election. It is useful to promote your country even during an election.  As Members know Ministers do not just pop into countries without clearing the decks and having made arrangements.  Nothing has happened to the market since Deputy Cowen returned from Iran but when the Iranians visit they will know that the agreement they signed with the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator O'Kennedy, will be honoured.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of specific consumer representatives will give added focus to the board which has it eyes firmly fixed on the consumer dimension of food production and marketing. These appointments will reinforce that important dimension and add weight to the message that the consumer is the most important element in the food chain and, in the final analysis, the ultimate determinant of success and failure. On the enactment of this legislation arrangements will be made to fill these <Col N="424" /> positions quickly.  The manner of their filling will be a reflection of the spirit in which the legislation was brought before the House.</P>
    <P>I have referred time and again in this House, and the Seanad, to the pivotal role of the food industry in the economy and the Government's plan to consolidate and expand that role.  In investing £283 million of Irish and European taxpayers money in this industry in the period up to and including 1999 the Government is showing its confidence in the ability of the food sector to meet the demanding output, export and employment targets set in the food development strategy.</P>
    <P>In particular it is placing on the shoulders of the board and management of An Bord Bia the considerable responsibility of achieving an increase in exports of food and drink products of some 60 per cent by the end of 1999.  The board has already shown itself capable of rising to the challenge.  Last year exports increased by 11 per cent and the Horizons exhibition which it organised has been hailed by exhibitors and customers alike as the international benchmark for others to emulate.  The additional skills which the board will have available following the passing of this Bill will help to further the growth and development of the food industry in the widest possible sense.</P>
    <P>The issue of food traceability has been mentioned.  I touched on it earlier. This is a crucially important issue.  There is an unrelenting demand by consumers for complete information on the food they eat right back to the farm of original production.  Farmers and food processors have a duty and an obligation to respond to these demands in a positive spirit.  If they do not, they will suffer large scale loss of market share.</P>
    <P>Developing quality assurance programmes which are transparent and comprehensive is the single most effective way of assuaging consumer worries about food. Nowhere is food traceability more important than in the beef sector.  Beef exporters are to be complimented on the <Col N="425" /> comprehensive quality assurance and traceability programmes they have introduced as an integral part of their marketing programmes.  However, in order to consolidate and cement this the Minister has embarked on an initiative which will ensure that the traceability of raw material is underpinned by the expertise and independence of Teagasc's research and advisory services and will also encapsulate the animal movement permit system which is being refined in the Department.</P>
    <P>Food safety and traceability are the main challenges facing the food industry. If we can successfully reassure customers and consumers about the quality, integrity and origin of the food we produce we will have overcome the first marketing hurdle.</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to some of the many points made during the course of the debate.  To respond to Deputy Cowen and a number of other Deputies, I never suggested that this Bill is the Government's response to the BSE crisis.  It stands alone as a measure to expand the range of expertise available at board level to enable the sector to be developed comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the ICMSA and the IFA are not on the board as of right, they have been appointed, like all other appointees, for fixed terms.  It is important that farmers are represented on the board.  It was a mistake to exclude them initially.  It is important that their organisations are represented as of right.</P>

      <P>With the addition of consumer representatives the board is more balanced.  Their presence reflects the importance of developing a fully integrated food sector as advocated in the Cullition report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those Deputies who said <Col N="426" /> that we have to develop a new system to ensure traceability in the industry. On the issue of Border security, a number of Deputies, including Deputies Cowen and Doherty, mentioned Operation Matador.  As they are aware, this was a necessary response to the EU-wide ban on the export of beef products. The Iranian delegation travelled to the Border today and left happy and confident that there is a high level of security, that it is properly policed and there is no movement of cattle across it.  I agree with those Deputies who said that there is a need to take special measures to ensure consumers can differentiate between Irish and British beef.  In order to do this we have to ensure that the Border is secured.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested that there was a lack of ministerial visits to markets.  I paid two successful visits to Sweden and Italy.  The Minister visited Spain, Italy and Russia and arrangements are being made for him to visit Libya.  Following the Taoiseach's intervention with the President of Egypt, Mr. Mubarak, that market was reopened.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowen mentioned the establishment of a single food safety agency. The existing arrangements for food safety are currently being examined by an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>On the points made by Deputy O'Malley, there has already been a number of debates in the House on the BSE crisis.  This Bill was not put <Col N="427" /> forward as a solution to it.  It is aimed at giving the board an added dimension in its marketing drive for all food and drink products, not just beef.  The Deputy referred to large Irish food companies which invest abroad.  They are doing this successfully and some of the profits are reinvested at home.  In the case of the Kerry Group this reinvestment has ensured that the price of milk has been retained at last year's level.  This investment abroad is positive to the extent that it strengthens the companies' operations at home.  Under the food sub-programme £640 million will be invested between now and 1999 while £357 million will be invested by the industry with the support of EU funds of £283 million.  I do not see anything wrong in these companies investing abroad provided they also invest at home.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the size of the board and the lack of consumer focus.  Contrary to what he said, the size of the board is not an inhibitory factor. The board is working well at present and is cohesive, while its marketing development strategy shows it has a clear emphasis on consumer needs and requirements.  Most of the people on the board are senior executives of companies which are driven by consumer demands and are, therefore, conscious of what the consumer needs and wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has tabled an amendment on the nomination of organisations. The Bill does not have to refer to several organisations as, according to the Attorney General's office, in law the plural includes the singular and <i>vice versa.</i>  The Minister can, if he so wishes, select members from one organisation to nominate the representative.  The Deputy also referred to the reliance on intervention.  The main thrust of the food sub-programme is towards sustainable commercial markets.  An Bord Bia's market development strategy is weighted heavily towards building strong links between consumers and suppliers.  I agree it is unfortunate that <Col N="428" /> we have to return to intervention at this stage but it is one of the solutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to consumer representation on the three boards.  The Bill will simply strengthen the board, all of whose members were appointed on the basis of their knowledge of the industry and of consumer requirements.  Deputy Nolan referred to the current situation.  As I am sure he fully understands, under EU regulations we cannot provide grant aid to the food industry because of it.  The way to deal with this issue is to build a more competitive industry, which is one of the main aims of the Structural Funds sub-programme. He also referred to the marketing of vegetables and soft fruit. This is a function of An Bord Glas which is trying to improve the marketability of these products through its quality assurance scheme which is working well.  He referred to the mushroom sector which has been a major success but it should be remembered that An Bord Glas is also doing a very good job in other areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said the BSE crisis was not part of the agenda of European Council meetings.  This matter has been on every agenda since last March and will be the top priority of the Minister during the Irish Presidency.  The Deputy referred to the media preoccupation with the British position.  Naturally this arose as a result of the banning of British exports by the EU.  On the other hand, Irish exports had, and continue to have, access to all markets within the EU.  The Minister, our embassies and An Bord Bia will continue to press the case for Irish beef in the EU and on world markets.</P>
    <P>The Deputy claimed that the commitment to agriculture was constrained by the presence of Labour and Democratic Left in Government.  Members of both parties made positive contributions to this debate.  The considerable increase in the budget for An Bord Bia from £16 million last year to £23 million this year was achieved with the agreement of both parties.  This emphasises the total Government commitment to An Bord <Col N="429" /> Bia and to the promotion and marketing of Irish food.  The Government also supported the rendering industry with a package when it was needed at the start of the BSE problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty said the Bill was too late.  When his party was in Government it failed to appoint a consumer representative to the board.  The Bill not only guarantees the appointment of three consumer representatives but does so in a way which ensures there will always be a specific place on the three boards for a consumer representative.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made a very balanced contribution.  I agree that An Bord Bia will have to be consumer oriented and that we must make greater efforts to promote our products.  The Deputy referred to traceability, which is very important.  I also agree that Ireland could become a flagship for the European food industry.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed and who made excellent contributions. The position was difficult enough before the beef crisis but there is no doubt the industry is facing a major challenge.  The Florence Agreement will help but it is only a temporary measure.  Certainly the 1996-97 budget must provide further aid and compensation for the beef industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister who comes from a county which depends to a great extent on the beef industry is conscious of the importance of obtaining further compensation for the sector.  Various figures have been mentioned ranging between £100 million and £200 million by the end of the year.  This is serious and could be the end of a number of beef farmers. This is a crisis and I am confident the Minister will ensure during his Presidency that this sector is kept at the top of the agenda and that any further compensation will be made available to the beef sector.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for both their positive and, at times, critical contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 12, to delete &ldquo;14&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;7&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to decrease in future the number of members of this board from the 15 proposed in the Bill to eight.  Eight is a perfectly adequate number, if anything it is somewhat on the large side.  As I said time and again on this Bill and on its two predecessors, these enormously big boards achieve very little.  An effective board is a much smaller board.  It is noteworthy that some of the biggest companies here and in other countries are run by overall boards which are very much smaller than anything envisaged here.  That is done with great success in boards which are trading companies with very large turnovers of perhaps billions of pounds each year.  In this debate Deputy O'Rourke agreed that the size of this board was excessive and unnecessary.  It was done presumably to placate various sectorial interests. Under the original Act of 1994 it was too big but it was increased further last year and it is proposed now to increase it still further.  That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the two amending Acts to the Principal Act, under which this board was set up, relate to the membership of the board and both make it bigger, as if these were major contributions to its success.  They are not, if anything they probably weaken it by making it unwieldy.  I am not suggesting any existing member should be removed, that is not necessary because <Col N="431" /> they are appointed, but when the membership of the board falls to a figure of eight it should be maintained at that number: a chairman and seven ordinary members.</P>
    <P>The very successful promotional boards, such as the IDA, have traditionally had six members and that is perfectly adequate.  I do not think anyone would suggest it was not successful.  An Bord Tráchtála has a chairman and six or seven members.  Its remit would be far larger and far wider than this board which deals only with food.  In effect An Bord Tráchtála deals with everything else and can do so with less than half the board membership of this board, even though this board is confined to one specific area only in its activity.  Clearly there is no need for the number of members provided for.  By seeking to reduce the number I am not suggesting there should be no consumer representative. There can be three or four consumer representatives among the eight members.  There is nothing to stop those being appointed.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that two years ago I put down an amendment to try to have specific consumer representation on the board but it was not accepted.  It was not only the Government of the day that refused it, every other party bar my own was opposed to it.  In those circumstances it had to be withdrawn as it had no prospect of success.  It is clear we were correct in putting down that amendment.  It should have been accepted at the time and consumer interests should have been recognised on the board from the start and not belatedly from now.</P>
    <P>Consumer interests are being represented now only because of the BSE crisis.  The Minister of State is wrong in saying this is portrayed as the Government's response to the BSE crisis.  It is not being portrayed as that but this is happening, among other things, because of the BSE crisis, and because of the unwillingness by the food sector, particularly at official level, to recognise the validity of the consumer interest. <Col N="432" /> Because the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry always recognised only the producer interests to the exclusion of everybody else we have many problems today.  It has now become clear that the consumer interest in particular must be recognised.  The officials on the board accept this and try to operate the board's activities as best they can to take account of it but the board itself is weighted very much in a different direction and one of its weaknesses is its sheer size.</P>
    <P>If the closest corresponding board, An Bord Tráchtála, which deals with exports which would exceed An Bord Bia level of exports by, perhaps, five, six or seven times in every field, other than food, can be successful with a board half this size, I do not see why this one cannot be successful.  The cohesion of the board would be greatly assisted by the acceptance of this amendment just as the board would have been assisted by the acceptance of the amendment we put down to the 1994 Bill which was refused and which is now being inserted by this Bill.</P>

      <P>As Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, already indicated and Deputy O'Rourke acknowledged, there are already 13 ordinary members on the board, all of whom have been appointed to specified terms of office. It is not possible, without good legally sustainable reasons, to terminate the period of office of any of the serving board.  What the Deputy is proposing effectively is that seven members of the board would have their appointments terminated.  Such an amendment would not serve any useful purpose.  It would merely deprive the board of a degree of expertise and experience which is essential for the execution of its remit.  The food industry is very extensive and limiting the board's membership in the manner proposed in the amendment would effectively disenfranchise some of its components.  The board is working <Col N="433" /> effectively and cohesively, size does not inhibit its effectiveness.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have made three attempts to enact this legislation and the question of board representation crops up repeatedly.  The Bill is a compromise.  Small boards work best. While I accept the principle of the Bill and the importance of our food industry to the economy, there is great merit in Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  A large board will lack commitment, members will attend board meetings for only ten or 15 minutes and will not operate in a businesslike manner.  In drafting the Bill, the Minister should have considered appointing a new board.  Existing boards have been abolished and new ones introduced under other legislation. <Col N="434" /> An Bord Bia must be more consumer than producer oriented.</P>
      <P>Is it a case of jobs for the boys based on loyalty?  The Government is not bad at giving jobs to the boys.  It must be loyal to the people who stand at the polling booths, who are very important to the democratic system.</P>

As the board handles a great deal of money, seven members is even too many.  Should the processors be represented on it or should the board be more independent?  Based on confidentiality and commitment, it should comprise fewer members.  I support Deputies O'Malley and Cowen in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's main argument is not against the substance of the amendment, he claims seven of the members would be disenfranchised. I made it clear that my amendment would apply to a board established at a future date.  When the board's term of office expires, its membership should be reduced to eight and not increased above that figure.  The existing members were validly appointed and this amendment does not suggest that they should lose office.  If the debate were not guillotined, a longer amendment could be drafted for Report Stage to clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said we cannot interfere with the existing system.  The Bill interferes with the existing numbers by increasing them.  If we can increase <Col N="435" /> numbers in legislation, we can also decrease them.  Deputy O'Keeffe supports a smaller, more cohesive and effective board, an argument which has not been countered.  To suggest that one cannot interfere with what already exists would mean the number could not be increased and that we would be stuck with it for all time.  That is not the case. It is perfectly evident that those who were validily appointed will remain on the board.  This amendment simply suggests that when the term of office of the present incumbents expires, the maximum number would be a chairman and seven members.  The amendment should be accepted on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I was not here for the full debate.  I have, however, received some details of the salient points made.  On marketing, which was mentioned on Second Stage, a significant breakthrough in the Libyan market is imminent in view of my forthcoming visit.  I had talks this morning with top Iranian veterinary officials and I believe these will prove to be productive. There is now real evidence that my Russian visit will result in the largest ever sales of beef there.</P>
      <P>To deal with the points at issue on Committee Stage, this board was appointed a few weeks before I became Minister.  Farmers felt they were unrepresented although there were farmers on the board.  The farm organisations felt snubbed and there were other levels of dissatisfaction also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for me to account for the appointments I have made.  I appointed Dr. Noel Crawley, the managing director of the Irish Dairy Board, Bord Bainne, because there was no single dairy presence on the board.  The two farm organisations were prepared to organise a boycott of the levies, amounting to about £4 million of Bord Bia's revenue, which is a significant sum.  Irrespective of whether one faces down that type of threat that level of disgruntlement had to be dealt with.  Mr. <Col N="436" /> Denis Lucey, whom I also appointed to the board, is the chief executive of Dairygold, the largest dairy co-operative.</P>
    <P>There was not a representative of the seafood industry on the board.  The export function of Bord Iascaigh Mhara should come under the auspices of Bord Bia since it cannot afford the international presence involved.  Because of the inherited history of the board and for good strategic reasons, its present composition, including a consumer representative, is appropriate.  The Government does not have a consumer representative in mind but it will not be a token appointment.  We want to make it complete in terms of the subsidiary boards as well as the main board.  Where there has been a change of Government this is the best and most balanced solution.</P>
    <P>It will be open to a future Minister to examine the total complement and decide what is appropriate.  Now, however, given the representation I have added in terms of dairy and other food expertise, as well as farm organisations, it is appropriate to add a consumer representative to provide an overall balance.  During the debate this was misrepresented as being in some way a response to the BSE crisis.  The response to that crisis is a day and night activity at home and abroad involving compensation, markets, export refunds and veterinary activity.  That response will be ongoing from me and other European agriculture ministers for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>The original position as set out is not unreasonable.  I note that on Second Stage, Deputy Cowen said he was not opposed to the Bill and that it was reasonable.  A consumer addition at this point should not be seen in isolation, but as completing the process.  As such, it is reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of accuracy it is important to point out that the BIM issue was unresolved on the passing of the An Bord Bia Bill, 1994.  The then Minister adverted to the fact that <Col N="437" /> there would be representation, so the Minister's suggestion that it was part of his overall strategic balance is not correct. It was his predecessor's idea that such a presence would be arranged once the transfer of functions involved in the reorganisation of that body had been completed.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister's optimism about his Libyan visit having finally received an invitation having gone through the proper channels.  I hope it is well founded, although the indications I have are not quite as optimistic.  However, I would not like to throw cold water on the Minister's efforts.  Earlier this year we lost contracts for 50,000 cattle and 500,000 sheep to the Australians.  I hoped there might be some change although the information I have from live exporters is not quite as optimistic as the Minister's.  We will wait and see.</P>
      <P>Similarly, with regard to the Russian market we will wait to see if the Minister's optimism is well founded.  We hope the Minister's visit to Libya will bear fruit.  I am glad he took up my suggestion to the Taoiseach that the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, might go to Iran to progress issues, not just relating to beef but also in relation to the joint commission agenda with which the Iranians are anxious to deal. I am delighted the Taoiseach has used his good offices to encourage the Tánaiste to allow his junior Minister to go, even if he will not go himself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that those who initiated the Bill have acted in a far more farcical fashion than us in trying to deal with the stupendous decision of adding one more member to this board. We welcome it as a belated recognition, but to suggest that it had nothing to do <Col N="439" /> with the BSE crisis is, as Deputy O'Malley said, both intellectually and politically dishonest given the demands of consumers.  Despite the fact that we are an agricultural country there are many first generation country people, now living in cities, who are not <i>au fait</i> with modern farming practices even though they grew up in the country.  We need consumer representations for that reason.</P>
      <P>To take the substance of the amendment, Deputy O'Malley's points are well made in some respects.  As a former Minister, however, I recall looking at some boards whose companies were in great difficulty.  If one examined the individual membership of those boards, as well as their performance in particular sectors, industries and professions, they were quite good but it did not stop the boards from making a mess of some major decisions that had to be taken.</P>
      <P>While I take the point that a smaller board might be more effective, the quality of management and the interface between management and non-executive boards is of much greater importance than the size of the board.  The Minister has succumbed to sectional interests and ensured that he would not face down the farming organisations.  It would be unprecedented for him to do so, and I would not expect him to do so given that the Farm Centre is practically running the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would do anything to keep onside with that centre. As I said on the last Bill dealing with this matter, in making appointments account should be taken of the strategic interests of An Bord Bia as a marketing organisation.  I accepted that Bill in principle on the basis that appointments would be made in that way.  I have no reason to believe that has not been done and it much too early for a critical assessment of the composition of the board.  I have been impressed by the executive management.  The record <Col N="440" /> of the board is good and it deserves our support.  Its attempt to deal with issues as they arise gives me no reason to lack confidence in it.</P>
      <P>This is a new board and it would not be advisable at this stage to decrease its membership, although that matter may be kept under review.  Were it an established board that had not carried out its mandate as effectively as it should, a proposal as radical as that suggested by Deputy O'Malley would be timely.  I understand Deputy O'Malley's point and agree it is important that the board be as effective as possible, but it is too early to pass critical judgment on it.  For that reason we will not support the amendment.  The matter should be kept under review not only by a future Fianna Fáil-led Administration but by this Administration in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I agree it is dangerous for us to legislate for a future Minister because circumstances in the food industry may change.  Why should we tie the hands of a future Minister?  This amendment is premature and unnecessary. Deputy Cowen has made a very reasoned contribution.  Who does Deputy O'Keeffe want to drop from the board?  Who does he believe lacks confidentiality or who leaves board meetings after 15 minutes?  Previously there was a lobby for proper representation, but perhaps the Deputy has information of which we are not aware.</P>

Since the rainbow coalition came to office there have been <Col N="441" /> many examples of appointments which have robbed the country and destroyed State organisations.  I am surprised the Deputy is questioning my proposal.  I served on a number of State boards before I came into this House.  The larger the board the more ineffective and inefficient it is &mdash; in some cases subboards and sub-committees are set up.  I object to the Deputy questioning me.</P>

      <P>The Deputy came in tonight to be the devil's advocate. Obviously this appointment is being made at the request of the Deputy's party.  The Government is nervous that if that party's demands are not met it will pull out of office, as it did before, plunging the country into a political crisis.  The Deputy should not be concerned about who I want dropped from the board but should say who he wants to have appointed to the board.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley will agree that the food industry is extensive and to drop members from the board at this stage would be to disenfranchise a number of vital sectors within the industry. If the amendment were enshrined in the legislation seven members would have to be dropped from the board.  For that reason I cannot accept it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cowen that since An Bord Bia is in the early stages of its operations it is too early to assess the board, but if in the future a Minister decides to change the composition of the board, whether because it is too large to be effective or because it is unwieldy, that can be done.  An Bord Bia deserves to be given a chance.  The signs are positive.  To date it has done a very good job in its promotions all over Europe and also in Third World markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The composition of the board cannot be changed by some future Minister; it can be changed only by this House.  Deputy Ferris said that <Col N="442" /> we should not tie the hands of the Minister, but that is precisely what we are doing.  The sentence I want to amend states that the board shall consist of a chairman and 14 ordinary members.  If that is passed a future Minister is compelled to appoint 15 people whether or not he believes that is appropriate.  The statements made in that regard are inaccurate. If a future Minister wants to change the composition of the board he will have to come back to the House and introduce a fourth An Bord Bia Bill.  The board has been in existence for only 18 months and this is the third such Bill dealing with it.  This seems to be a very sensitive topic.  It is a pity board membership is considered so important. Its duty is to do the job rather than hold board meetings attended by vast numbers of people.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 19, before &ldquo;nomination&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;agreed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggested to the Principal Act by paragraph (b) of section 2 is that the person shall be appointed on the nomination &mdash; singular &mdash; of such organisations &mdash; plural &mdash; as the Minister considers to be representative of consumers.  Obviously more than one organisation is envisaged as being representative of consumers and, therefore, presumably there will be more than one nomination.</P>
      <P>There is only one vacancy, however, so I am suggesting that these organisations &mdash; plural &mdash; should agree on a nomination and I propose that the word &ldquo;agree&rdquo; be inserted.  Otherwise, we will have two, three, four or five organisations.</P>
      <P>When commenting earlier on this amendment in reply to Second Stage, the Minister of State said that the plural includes the singular and I think he may have said the corollary also, that the singular includes the plural.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the plural includes the singular, why do we specify the plural or, for that matter, why do we specify the singular?  Language is not that imprecise.  One cannot approach something on as vague a basis as that.  The difficulty which will obviously arise here can be overcome by inserting the word &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; nomination.  If there is more than one such organisation, and the Bill states there is, let them agree on a nomination. That is reasonable and I cannot see any objection being raised to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice I have been given is that in law the plural includes the singular and the singular includes the plural.  The word &ldquo;organisations&rdquo; is used, therefore, but that does not mean the Minister will be obliged to recognise more than one organisation as being representative of consumers.  If he should recognise several organisations, however, it is implicit in the section that those organisations would have to agree on a single nominee.  That is the current practice for the appointment of members to the meat and livestock subsidiary board.  Organisations nominating a person for membership of that board agree a nominee, so a precedent exists in that regard.  In those circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Deputy Cowen's question, as far as I am aware the organisations in contention are the Consumer Association of Ireland and the Housewives Association of Ireland, which is of lesser profile.  If we assume that in future we will have a plethora of these organisations, under Deputy O'Malley's proposal those organisations would have to sit down in some conclave and agree a nominee before the Minister could decide to nominate a person.  The proposal in the legislation is far more effective and practical in that <Col N="444" /> the Minister, in the light of advice from the prevailing consumer representation, would make one nominee given that there will be one vacancy.  I submit to the House that the legislation as presented is the preferable and more practical way of proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister's intentions are good but when two Ministers deal with a Bill, diverse interpretations can arise.  We were told earlier that the consumer organisation will be asked to nominate a person and that the Minister will accept that nomination.  Is the Minister now stating that the converse will be the case, that the Minister will have total discretion in this regard?  Will the Minister be retaining that absolute power?  That is an interesting clarification because we understood earlier that a great divesting of power from Agriculture House was about to take place whereby the consumer organisation would be given the opportunity of making their own nomination.  The Minister's entry into the Chamber has clarified, if not added, to the confusion.</P>
      <P>Is the Government subjected to the same inane requirement of gender balance to which I was subjected as a Minister on many occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall when the An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill was debated in the House last year the Minister was not in a position to confirm the gender of the nominees on the basis that the IFA and the ICMSA were unable to indicate to the Minister, despite his requests, that some lady farmers had indicated an ambition to be members of this coveted board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did, because the surgeon involved in the sex change business had a full waiting list. On a more serious note, there is a gender balance requirement in the programme for Government.  Regardless of effectiveness, 40 per cent of board members must be female.  I do not have any objection to that; we do not have sufficient female representation on boards, but is this rigid requirement an indication that the consumer nominee to this board will be female or will the gender balance not apply in regard to this Bill?  This important point is exercising the mind of Deputy Ferris.</P>

The third is Minister of State Rabbitte, or an tUasal O'Caoinín, as he is known in the official language of the State, and he is the one who really counts so far as this Bill is concerned.  In his contribution today he stated that he subsequently pursued that commitment and was pleased to find he was knocking on an open door with the Minister, Deputy Yates.  He said that this Bill was the result of those discussions which, despite the promises and the rhetoric of the past, for the first time provided for consumer representation on An Bord Bia.  Even though the Bill is in the name of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, we <Col N="446" /> were left in no doubt by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that he was the progenitor of the Bill.</P>

There will be a major problem and the way to overcome it is either to accept my amendment providing for an agreed nomination or to make it singular and say the &ldquo;nomination of such organisation&rdquo;.

    <P>The Minister referred to one, two or three consumer organisations.  Will he indicate the status of the Irish Country-women's Association in terms of consumer organisation?  I consider it has a role to play in the consumer area, but it must not be the political choice of the parties opposite.  The Government will have to follow a selection process and it will have to satisfy the requirements of colleagues on the middle left.  Will the <Col N="453" /> Minister consider the Irish Country-women's Association, an influential organisation which has done great work in this country on behalf of housewives and consumers, in the selection process? I have no doubt it has a major role to play in any consumer forum.  Will the Minister isolate that group?  He mentioned other organisations but this organisation has made a major contribution to Irish society in terms of issues of concern to housewives and it is to the forefront on many social issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely annoyed, frustrated and cynical about the type of operation involved in this project.  A group of people with an excellent record who built the Canon Hayes Sports Complex, a highly successful self-paying venture, got together and bought the Excel Cinema in Tipperary town for £50,000 in 1993.  They engaged architects and engineers for submitted plans to convert it into a heritage complex, including a cinema which would be self-paying, and other facilities.  After much consultation full approval was given by the Arts Council and Bord Fáilte to proceed and accept the project.  Planning permission was granted on 1 March 1995.  The cost was estimated at £3.4 million excluding VAT.  The facilities included a 132 and a 74 seater cinema because people in Tipperary town must travel to Clonmel or Limerick city to a cinema.</P>
      <P>In confirming Heritage Council status on 20 January 1994, Bord Fáilte authorised the appointment of a project director and the design team.  The new Government then entered office and divided tourism grants between Bord Fáilte and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the cultural tourism side, completed applications being lodged with both at that time. During 1995 the organisation received many queries about its ability to raise 25 per cent of the cost of the project &mdash; all of which were answered &mdash; having already raised in excess of £300,000 by various draws held among the local community for that project alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appointed a new committee who held its first meeting in January last and were to report to him <Col N="455" /> before taking his final decision, at which point it was realised there was no cooperation between the two Government Departments.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade was then requested to coordinate the efforts of both Departments.</P>
    <P>Through this period we were assured there was no problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  We were assured by Deputy Ferris that there was no problem, the money was in the bag and the project ready to be implemented &mdash; I have umpteen witnesses to that reassurance &mdash; only to discover that the problem lay with the Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>Over that period several policy changes were effected, several movings of goalposts, the last of which was a request that the directors be given personal guarantees and, in the event of their not being forthcoming, the local authority would give its guarantee.  In their generosity and desire to see the project go ahead, members of the local authority guaranteed that the project would be secured against any future losses, the first time such a unanimous decision had been taken since its infamous support of the imposition of telephone charges for calls made from telephone kiosks, in itself a tribute to those councillors outside the Tipperary area.</P>
    <P>At that point they were afforded full charity status which exempted the Heritage/Excel project from corporation tax in addition to being eligible for section 32 relief under the 1984 Finance Act which provided annual tax relief to individuals or companies ranging from £100 to £10,000 annually.</P>
    <P>Those guarantees were given in the firm belief that those funds would be approved and forthcoming from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Work had begun only to be subjected to what amounted to a knife in the back, delivered in the form of a letter from the Minister's secretary, to the effect that the Minister very much regretted having to inform the group <Col N="456" /> that their project was not being included among others.</P>
    <P>The area is devastated.  That area suffered recently when Mass Mutual closed its factory, leading to a need for its replacement.  This was a project proposed for what is described as the golden triangle between the town of Cashel that attracts 200,000 visitors annually to the Rock of Cashel, the Glen of Aherlow, the town of Cahir which attracts some 145,000 visitors annually to view its castle, and Tipperary town, set to host a heritage, arts and cultural centre.</P>
    <P>The first refusal came from the least expected quarter, from the Minister's Department, resulting in depression and devastation on the part of the local community which I must warn the Minister will quickly turn to anger.  The people of the town and surrounding areas, with an interest in tourism in west Tipperary, wanted this project to proceed, having been given so many assurances that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht would not refuse its funding but that there was a danger that the Minister for Tourism and Trade might refuse.</P>
    <P>On examining replies to parliamentary questions I discovered that £3 million was expended in Galway in the Minister's constituency in 1994, another £3 million in 1995 whereas the corresponding amounts expended in the entire county of Tipperary, consisting of two constituencies, were £800 in 1994 and £67,500 on the Clonmel art project in 1995.  Of the total of £5 million, two-thirds was expended in the Minister's constituency.</P>

      <P>Details of capital moneys expended by my Department in each county during 1994 and to 24 November 1994 are set out in the following tabular statement....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> That statement showed a huge amount of money expended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet this was a community helping itself, organised by a team that had already proved itself in the case of the sports complex in Tipperary, rendering it profitable and viable.  Indeed, a member of this Government was to be invited to open the refurbished swimming pool there. None of this team had anything to gain personally but was interested solely in community activity in their area.</P>
      <P>Before the community's disillusionment turns to bitter anger, I appeal to the Minister to rescind his decision and immediately reinstate this project on the playing pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me to utilise some of his allotted time.  While there were some inaccuracies in Deputy Davern's contribution, I am not here to engage in political point scoring.  For example, Deputy Davern forgot to mention the £750,000 granted for the Clonmel museum recently.  I should point out that the project submitted for approval for grant assistance to Bord Fáilte and the Minister's Department, under the provisions of the cultural development incentive scheme, is costed at approximately £3.4 million, a major portion of which is to be raised from community and corporate financing with a local authority guarantee against revenue losses for ten years.  I was directly involved in ensuring that this decision received local authority approval.</P>
      <P>To date the community has raised £300,000 toward the cost of this integrated centre comprising an art gallery, workshops, theatres, cinemas and an interpretative centre bearing the theme &ldquo;The Land of Tipperary&rdquo; resulting from intensive research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my insistence, the project has been granted charitable status and tax incentives which together will give full-time <Col N="458" /> employment to 24 people in an area of high unemployment.  Unfortunately, because of a long delay on the part of Bord Fáilte to take a decision to submit this proposal to its management committee, the Minister was left with the undesirable option of approving only valid applications submitted which did not include the Heritage-Excel project in Tipperary town consequent on Bord Fáilte's lack of commitment to date.</P>
    <P>If Bord Fáilte agrees to grant-aid this project, I ask the Minister to be prepared to examine a new, revised application from the relevant committee.  I invite him to visit Tipperary to see the site plans and some other successful projects as proof of the successful efforts of this magnificent committee, of which I am a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This case refers to an application submitted to me for the development of the Tipperary Excel/Heritage project by the Tipperary Excel Heritage Company Limited under the cultural development incentive scheme I administer under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999. I was sorry to have had to interrupt Deputy Davern but he should have referred to expenditure under the Operational Programme for Tourism, about which I will say something in a moment, whereas the reply to the parliamentary question to which he referred related to capital expenditures in Galway which included the capital programme of Údarás na Gaeltachta which can be discussed on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an invitation for applications under the scheme a total of 170 were lodged with my Department involving assistance amounting to some £87 million.  The total amount available to me under the scheme during the five year period 1994-99 is £19.7 million, which, together with the matching funds that have to be provided by successful applicants, will enable a total capital infrastructure of at least £26 million to be put in place in the period up to 1999. <Col N="459" /> A total of £14.7 million has been designated for allocation to successful applicants from the 170 applications received.  The remaining £5 million available under the scheme will be allocated following a second and final call for applications.  This call will be made later this year &mdash; I expect around September.</P>
    <P>I engaged the expertise of a number of State agencies to carry out an examination of the applications received.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; the Arts Council &mdash; carried out a detailed artistic examination on applications for projects such as arts centres, galleries, theatres, etc. and supplied my Department with a detailed written submission on each. The Heritage Council assessed similarly applications in respect of museum and other heritage-type projects.  Bord Fáilte carried out a financial/marketing evaluation of projects as required.  An advisory committee, whose brief, following consideration of all assessments/ evaluations, was to make recommendations to me on the projects which it felt merited funding, was established by me.</P>
    <P>Following my approval in principle to fund eight projects, announced in February, which included £1.4 million for a theatre in Galway &mdash; the advisory committee considered the remaining applications, including the Tipperary Excel Heritage project and made recommendations to me recently.  Having considered the committee's recommendations I offered funding in principle to 16 projects, details of which I announced yesterday involving investments of just over £11 million.  Subject to the satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues with the applicants, grant offers totalling £7,845 million in EU and Exchequer funding towards these projects will be made.  I propose to circulate details of the 16 projects to Deputies.</P>
    <P>Difficult decisions had to be made and some worthwhile projects, including the Tipperary Excel Heritage Project, could not be assisted, given the limited funding at my disposal.  While this is <Col N="460" /> regrettable, the fact that I obtained 170 applications for assistance under the scheme indicates the wealth of interest in arts and heritage activities throughout the State.  I very much hope that the cultural development incentives scheme can serve as a catalyst for the realisation of further capital projects and, as I have already mentioned, I propose to invite applications later this year for the remaining £5 million which is at my disposal under the scheme.</P>
    <P>If the promoters of the Tipperary Excel Heritage Project are able to advance other components of their proposal, such as the suggested participation of Bord Fáilte in certain elements &mdash; at the time of my decision no final decision had been taken by the management committee in regard to that &mdash; and achieve adjustments to the costings which are currently envisaged, when I invite applications later this year their application will be reconsidered in the context of all other applications received.

    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a request to the Department of Education to increase the allocation for special education needs from the 1,100 hours set for 1996-97 to 4,000 hours set for 1995-96.  For many years, the town of Tralee Vocational Education Committee has been providing for the special education needs of travellers aged 12 to 15 in a two-track initiative at Tralee junior secondary education centre at the Education Centre, Moyderwell, and the special remedial project at Tralee Community College, Clash, Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision has been in place for the past nine years and Tralee Vocational Education Committee wishes to continue to serve this educational need.  The initiative has been supported through the special allocation of 4,000 hours from the Department of <Col N="461" /> Education.  Tralee Vocational Education Committee notes with regret the proposed reduction of this allocation to 1,100 hours for 1996-97 and cannot understand the reason for this reduction by the Department of Education in view of the excellent record of Tralee Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>In the Tralee urban area 42.6 per cent of people who are unemployed received a primary education only.  This compares to 38.8 per cent nationally.  There are 5,251 permanent households in the Tralee urban area and 2,314 of these houses are provided by the local authority. This is 42 per cent, which is higher than in other similar sized towns.  Local authority housing residents are more likely to be disadvantaged because of the high concentrations of unemployment coupled with low levels of education participation and attainment.  The average long-term unemployment, 12 months or more, in the Tralee area over four years was 78 per cent.  This compares to 49 per cent nationally.  This information is taken from the Social Profile Partnership, Tralee Area Action Plan, 1996-99.</P>
    <P>Tralee community college has always had an open door policy on the integration of travellers into mainstream education.  Of the 39 entrants to Tralee community college in 1996-97, 33 are two years or more behind their chronological age in English.  None of the six remaining pupils has reached his or her chronological age in reading.  In mathematics, 27 out of 39 are two or more years behind.</P>
    <P>Tralee is designated by FÁS in its south-west regional plan for 1996-97 as disadvantaged, as well as north Cork and south Kerry.  This disadvantage has an adverse educational effect wherever it occurs, and in Tralee it is most concentrated in Tralee community college. Mainstreaming of such pupils within an examination-oriented curriculum is not an option.  It would be counterproductive in the extreme, leading to a serious escalation of an already serious problem of early school leaving.  The <Col N="462" /> special remedial project at Tralee community college confers significant benefits on the general body of pupils, which is now more homogenous, with an improvement in classroom management because of lower levels of disruption. The special education needs allocation of 4,000 hours has been servicing the special education needs of travellers in the junior secondary education centre and junior training workshop, travellers integrated into Tralee community college and pupils in Tralee community college who suffer severe educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>These special needs have not gone away, as is painfuly obvious when the reading and mathematical ages of first year entrants are examined.  If anything, the educational disadvantage is being concentrated and distilled almost entirely in Tralee community college.</P>
    <P>The special remedial projects go some way towards redressing the disadvantage experienced by pupils in Tralee community college.  I appeal for the retention of the 4,000 hours that currently support the twin-track initiative and the retention of the services of the fully qualified remedial teachers in Tralee community college and the junior secondary education centre.  The Tralee Vocational Education Committee stance is that anything less would be tantamount to consigning these pupils to an education limbo.</P>
    <P>VTOS has been in operation in Tralee since September 1990.  During that time VTOS students have sat the leaving certificate every year.  Many awards and certificates both in the academic and personal development fields have been achieved.  There is a comprehensive programme for education and couselling available to VTOS participants.  A large number of Tralee town vocational education committee VTOS students have progressed to third level education in institutions such as UCC, UCG, Maynooth and a number of regional technical colleges.  Some students are successful in job applications because of their qualifications and personal growth.  These successes <Col N="463" /> have been achieved through the work of a teaching team who are dedicated and skilled as a result of in-service training over the past six years.  Tralee Vocational Education Committee wants to leave intact a very successful VTOS programme delivered by the existing team of teachers for 1996-97.  Retirements, resignations and opting for new redundancy packages will ease pressures of redeployment.  This, coupled to the provision of new post-leaving certificate course options and an increased share for Tralee community college of first year entrants within the town, should absorb a significant amount of time of the specialists who are now available to be redeployed.</P>
    <P>In view of the excellent record of the town of Tralee Vocational Education Committee, I appeal to the Minister to reverse her decision and retain the <i>status quo</i> of 4,000 hours.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised this matter as it affords me an opportunity to inform the House of both the overall provision being made to address the needs of disadvantaged pupils generally and the specific provision being made in the case raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am committed to improving the provision for disadvantaged and special needs pupils.  As part of this commitment, additional posts have been allocated to second level schools.  The last allocation of such posts was made in 1994 when there were an additional 55 posts.  Second level schools were selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged status scheme in accordance with criteria agreed between representatives of school management, teacher unions, parents and the Department of education. Schools were ranked in order of merit on the basis of these criteria and the posts were allocated accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factors which were taken into account were the number of pupils <Col N="464" /> whose parents are in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit, the number in rented local authority housing and non-permanent accommodation, the number from deprived rural backgrounds, the number living with lone parents, the number whose parents hold medical cards, the number who would be unable to cope with everyday demands if they were to leave school and the percentage of pupils who drop out of school at or about 15 years of age without any formal educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>In addition to the posts for disadvantaged schools, I also allocated additional ex-quota remedial and resource teacher posts to second level schools in the past two years.  A total of 98 remedial teacher posts have been allocated in that time.  Some 25 of these were allocated in 1994 and 73 in 1995.  Schools to which posts were allocated were selected on the basis of priority of need and the existing provision.  Regard was also had to the recommendations of the Department's psychological service.</P>
    <P>Some 56 resource teacher posts were allocated to schools in 1995 to cater for special needs pupils.  Schools were invited to apply for these posts on a specially designed application form. Selection of the schools was on the basis of the information in the completed application forms and having regard to the recommendations of the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, the Department is aware of the situation and the efforts being made by both management and staff to cater for the needs of the disadvantaged pupils attending the school.  I take this opportunity to compliment them on their work in this area. To enable the school authorities to cater for these students, specific additional provision has been made by the Department through the allocation of a total of four ex-quota posts for disadvantaged schools and two remedial teacher posts to the school, one of which was allocated as recently as the beginning of the current school year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Apart from the posts for disadvantaged schools and remedial teacher posts, the school authorities have also been given a specific allocation to cater for the needs of traveller children.  This latter allocation is determined by reference to the appropriate pupil-teacher ratio and includes provision for administration and co-ordination work.  Earlier this year, the Department notified the school authorities of the approved teacher allocation for the 1996-97 school year.  The school authorities recently submitted a detailed appeal for an increase in the allocation to cater for the disadvantaged pupils, including the traveller children.  This appeal is under consideration. A response will be issued to the school authorities as soon as possible and the Deputy will be advised of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for permitting me to raise this matter and to the Minister for coming in to deal with it.  I do not intend to berate the Minister on this issue.  On the contrary I am grateful to her for her efforts in this regard in the past.</P>
      <P>She was good enough to meet what I would term a high-powered delegation from the constituency, comprising of the Wicklow Dáil Deputies, the manager of Wicklow County Council and the chief executive officer of the Wicklow vocational education committee. However, that was a long time ago.  The Minister also graciously met me and spoke with me informally on a number of occasions, to the point where I felt I was pestering her.  I am grateful for that, but we still have a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I aspire in the short time available to me to highlight and outline accurately the details of the vacant vocational school property in Rathdrum, County Wicklow, what has been allowed to happen to it, what plans there are for it, how these plans have been frustrated by <Col N="466" /> inaction and what is needed to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>The old vocational school in Rathdrum was vacated in December 1991 and pupils were moved to a newly built school.  That was almost five years ago. Since then it has been repeatedly vandalised. Windows and doors have been broken, staircases damaged and so on. It has been set on fire on a number of occasions and the fire brigade and the Garda have been called.  Young people hang around it at night, especially in summer when visitors abound, drinking and engaging in boisterous behaviour. The near neighbours are absolutely terrified.</P>
    <P>I have one letter, which I sent to the Minister when I wrote to her some months ago, from which I will read some extracts.  It states:  We are writing to you in the hope that you can get the county council or the vocational education committee to do something about the old vocational school.  As you know we are living right beside it.  It is becoming more dangerous every day... It is no joke trying to rear young adolescents beside it... It is getting to the stage where we are afraid to sleep at night as we do not know if we are going to be broken into.  We know that you understand the problem Joe as you have been trying for a long time to have the situation resolved.  We hope you can convey our fears to the powers that be.</P>
    <P>That letter was signed by Joe and Agnes Kennedy, the parents of a young and growing family.</P>
    <P>Nero fiddled while Rome burned and bureaucracy has been fiddling, prevaricating and procrastinating for nearly five years while this school has been burned and wrecked by vandals.  The local community, Wicklow County Council and the County Wicklow vocational education committee wish to see the school in the ownership of Wicklow County Council for good, constructive reasons in the public interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> The county council wants the site to provide a car park and much needed traffic easing measures.  It is located on one of the main tourism roads in the county and tourism is being affected seriously by traffic congestion.  The local authority is being prevented from dealing with it.  The plan is to make the building available to a local committee, headed by internationally known cartoonist Mr. Terry Willers who has resided in the town for the past 25 years. This group proposes to set up a cartoon college which is an innovative measure. It will lead to the creation of a number of jobs and will maintain the building for educational purposes.  It is a noble and meritorious aspiration.  Wicklow County Council, the Wicklow county manager, Mr. Treacy, the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee, all the members of the vocational education committee and the entire community support these projects.</P>
    <P>Wicklow County Council, through the county manager, made a formal offer at a fair price to the vocational education committee for this property.  The vocational education committee recommended unanimously to the Department of Education that the sale of the property to the county council should go ahead.  The county manager increased this offer several times and the situation remains unresolved simply because a decision will not be made by the Department of Education to authorise the vocational education committee to sell the property to the county council. The transfer by sale of public property from one public body to another for a totally meritorious reason &mdash; it is all open and transparent and endorsed by the community &mdash; should not be frustrated. I am not given to exaggerated language or sensationalism, but in any decent society and by any ordinary standards this has to be deemed a public scandal.</P>
    <P>I know how the parliamentary mechanism which is the Adjournment debate works and I would dearly love to hear <Col N="468" /> good news from the Minister on this issue.  I am convinced she genuinely would like to give me good news to take back to the people of Wicklow.  If that is possible, I will be very grateful and pleased.  If it is not I firmly believe this formidable Minister will infuse some urgency and ordinary commonsense into this situation and demand that the necessary action is taken now to ensure this sorry matter is brought to an expeditious and satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  It gives me an opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>When the new vocational school was opened in Rathdrum in September 1992, the old vocational school building and site became surplus to the requirements of County Wicklow vocational education committee.  However, before the property could be regarded as surplus and disposed of, the Department had to be satisfied it would not be required for any educational purposes in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>A complicating factor in this case was that the sale of the old vocational school property in Rathdrum had for some time been linked to the acquisition of a school site in the Kilcoole area.  It has recently been decided that the two issues should be separated and dealt with individually.</P>
      <P>Having carried out a thorough examination, the Department is now fully satisfied that the Rathdrum property will not be required for educational use and the vocational education committee can now proceed to dispose of it.  A letter confirming the position to the vocational education committee will issue later this week, with instructions regarding the disposal of the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, has had a very long and trying day so I will keep my contribution to the minimum.  The livelihood of a very large community of farmers in <Col N="469" /> west Roscommon in the River Suck valley area is the central issue.</P>
      <P>The Suck valley is a flat low lying area.  To illustrate the flatness of the territory, the river, after traversing an 11 mile course, has got three miles closer to its destination, joining the River Shannon just south of Ballinasloe.  It meanders through the valley.  Every year from October-November until May or June the land in the valley is flooded. In some farms as much as 75 per cent of the land is flooded, in other cases 5 per cent of the farm is flooded.  Unlike other areas classified as severely disadvantaged, the Suck Valley does not lend itself to alternative farming practices such as sheep, goat or deer farming that can be successful enterprises in mountainous areas.  In other areas where the land is not so good it can be used for forestry but none of those options is suitable to this valley since it is under water for approximately seven or eight months of the year.</P>
      <P>The flooded land is not available for use for grazing until mid-June so there is only a four month period when the land can be used leaving the land unusable for eight months.  The only indigenous species to be found during that eight month period from October to June are the wild geese.</P>
      <P>I implore the Minister of State to use his best offices to have this area reclassified under the third tier of extremely severely disadvantaged handicapped areas.  Those descriptive words certainly describe the region.</P>
      <P>If an aerial survey of the area was carried out during June or July, one would have a most misleading impression of what the land is capable of producing. Aerial photography would show a green level area, giving no indication of what it is like from November to the following May or June when it could be under three, four or five feet of water.  If a survey is to be carried out winter conditions should be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about preserving rural communities, which is very desirable.  On occasions we lend it lip service rather than assistance.  We can lend practical <Col N="470" /> support to the people living in the locality by having it reclassified under the third tier.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the farmers in the area are entitled to premium and other headage payments but as 75 per cent of their land may be flooded for eight months of the year they are limited in the number of stock they can keep, consequently the headage and premium payments are reduced and they have lower incomes.  There was a conference in UCG 12 months ago which referred to the right of the people of the west to live in their own territory. This is one way the Minister can see to it that the people of the west will get the chance during the next couple of generations of living in the area in which they were born.  I repeat that the people in this area cannot resort to forestry or alternative systems and the wild geese are their only friends during the winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Deputy for raising this matter and his most enthusiastic treatment of the subject despite the late hour.  It is obvious that he is familiar with the topography of and site conditions in the Suck Valley of which he has given a vivid description. The third tier of extremely disadvantaged areas was envisaged as applying to areas, primarily in the west, in which the land is so poor as to be almost unusable. Generally, this category would apply to mountainous or peatland areas and to inhabited islands which have the additional disadvantage of isolation.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have for some time been considering how best to identify the areas which would be most suitable for classification in this category. There is a need to establish the uniqueness of the areas in order to convince the EU Commission of the special needs of farmers in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criteria by which third category areas are selected have been established: the first is the presence of rough grazing. From satellite imagery of the country, certain areas can be observed to have a <Col N="471" /> high proportion of rough grazing which can be termed as agricultural areas of marginal utilisation.  These areas would consist mainly of mountains and peatlands on which limited grazing would be possible for parts of the year only.  The second is the occurrence of severe climatic conditions.  The occurrence of higher than average rainfall and windspeeds is an inhibiting factor to good, efficient farming.  At this stage, the task of matching satellite image maps and Ordnance Survey maps to identify the boundary of the extremely severely handicapped areas is almost completed. The Minister hopes to be in a position <Col N="472" /> to make a formal proposal to the EU Commission in the near future.  It is his intention to have this new category in place for the 1997 headage schemes.</P>
    <P>Since a proposal has not yet been submitted to the Commission.  I cannot comment on whether any specific area, such as the River Suck Valley, will be included in the areas selected, either in whole or in part.  However, the merits of all potential areas will be rigorously examined to ensure that the most deserving areas are selected.</P>

      <P>The most detailed area breakdown of employment and unemployment statistics comes from the five-yearly census of population.  The small area population statistics provide information for counties and towns, and for some 3,500 wards and district electoral divisions.  The relevant small-area statistics from the 1996 census should be available by the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>Annual information on employment and unemployment is available from the labour force survey at regional authority level.  The sample size of 45,000 households is not sufficient to produce reliable results for smaller areas (such as counties or towns).  In particular, it would be prohibitively expensive to produce employment statistics in respect of the 127 local offices for which monthly live register statistics are available.</P>

    <P>However, the CSO is planning to produce more frequent labour force statistics, starting in the middle of next <Col N="111" /> year.

      <P>The recent report of the Inter-Departmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development clearly identifies and addresses the longterm issues affecting the communities on our offshore islands.  As chairman of the co-ordinating committee, I am responsible for co-ordinating the Government's response to the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>The report provides a strategic framework within which the various Departments and agencies involved can reexamine existing policies relating to the economic and social development of island communities, clarify objectives in relation to the services being provided to these communities and formulate new policies accordingly.</P>
      <P>Specific recommendations have been made in the report in relation to the essential services available on islands and the key sectors for island development. The essential services outlined in the report include access, infrastructure, education, health and energy supply and communications.  The key sectors identified include agriculture, fishing / aquaculture, information technology and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of access services to offshore islands was identified in the <Col N="115" /> report as the priority issue.  The Government has allocated an additional £1 million in 1996, which will be made available to the local authorities on the basis of programmes of work which have been submitted.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position shortly to make a number of announcements regarding the allocation of funding to the local authorities, and I have no doubt that the resulting improvements to access services will ease some of the difficulties experienced by the seasonal influx of visitors.</P>
    <P>The most recent official figures on island population have been taken from the 1991 census which was held on 21 April, 1991.  The available figures are indicated in the following table.  No official figures are available to indicate the number of inhabitants on islands at peak visitor periods.</P>
    <P>As well as identifying priority access works for 1996, the local authorities have been asked to draw up longer term programmes of work for the next three or four years which will take account of other infrastructural and service requirements of the islands.  Over the next few years, therefore, I believe that the islands will be in a much better position to deal with the effects of seasonal population growth.</P>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development in <Col N="116" /> its report accepts that tourism is of crucial importance to the economic and social development of the islands. However, it is concerned with the need to maintain a balance between the number of tourists, the seasonality of the industry and the need to preserve the integrity of island language, culture and environment.</P>
    <P>The report also accepts that the infrastructure must cater for the needs of the ever growing number of visitors, particularly in areas such as water, services, waste management and roads.</P>
    <P>The committee has been mandated to oversee the implementation of the report over the coming three years.  This will be done in consultation with individual Government Departments, agencies and organisations under the aegis of the committee and in particular, with An Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, the Islands' Federation.</P>
    <P>One of the main recommendations of the report in terms of the tourism sector, is that a study should be commissioned by the committee, in consultation with Bord Fáilte, regional tourism organisations, Údarás na Gaeltachta and An Comhdháil, to explore the potential of this sector further.  At a recent meeting between the committee and An Comhdháil, preliminary discussions took place on this matter and I expect to be in a position to report progress on this tourism study over the coming months.</P>

      <P>I am assured by the military authorities that there is no morale problem in the Defence Forces.  The current major reorganisation of the Defence Forces necessarily requires the introduction of significant changes in the structures and operational methods of the Defence Forces, the objective of which is to ensure that the Defence Forces will be accommodated, staffed, equipped and organised so as to meet effectively, efficiently and economically the challenges of the future, to the benefit of military personnel and the taxpayer alike.  This is an indication of the key importance of the Defence Forces in the protection of law and order in our democratic society and is recognised as such by members of the Defence Forces and has the full agreement of the military authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> The EAG implementation plan on the areas of organisation and structures, personnel and manpower policies, training and education, logistics and command, control and management of the Defence Forces is a comprehensive programme designed to address many of the deficiencies which have been identified in the organisation.  A phased programme of restructuring will now be undertaken to develop the Defence Forces as a modern organisation capable of fulfilling the tasks which are assigned to it.  I am confident that the new organisation will further enhance the sense of personal pride in the armed forces and the dedication and commitment to its tasks which have been the hallmark of members of the Defence Forces over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of seven requests to supply Defence Forces personnel for service outside the State were received during 1996.  Details of these requests are as follows.  A request was received from the United Nations on 2 January 1996 for two ammunition technical officers for deployment to Croatia and Bosnia for approximately six weeks.  Deployment was approved on 8 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> However, the United Nations indicated that as there was already an adequate number of suitable personnel deployed they would not be taking up our offer. A request dated 5 February 1996 was received from the United Nations seeking our agreement to the redeployment of five military observers with the United Nations Peace Forces (in the former Yugoslavia) to the United Nations mission in Croatia, Eastern Slavonia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  These missions have a one year tour of duty.  The required redeployments took place on 29 February 1996.</P>
    <P>A request dated 14 March 1996 was received from the United Nations seeking explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams to operate with the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) for a period of about nine months.  It was indicated that each team would consist of two or three personnel of a rank no higher than captain.  The duties would involve demining and destruction of unexploded ordnance and booby traps. Further clarification required by my Department was recently received and a decision will be given shortly.  The United Nations issued a request on 4 April 1996 seeking to increase the number of Irish military personnel serving with the United Nations Preventative Deployment Force in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (UNPREDEP) from one to two observers, the tour of duty to be for one year.  The request was met on 18 April and deployment took place on 18 May.</P>
    <P>HMD International, a UK-based charity issued a request in April 1996 for up to 15 military personnel to take part in a hospital rehabilitation programme in Angola for a period of three months, but there may be a requirement to replace some of the personnel at the end of the three-months period.  The request was approved at the end of May and arrangements are currently under way to select volunteers.  It is proposed <Col N="124" /> that the following personnel will be provided: two medical officers, two nurses, two paramedics, one engineer officer, four tradesmen, two logisticians, one cook and one fitter.</P>
    <P>On 21 May 1996, the United Nations requested an engineering officer for assignment to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, United Nations, New York, for a period of one year.  On 10 June 1996 it was decided not to accede to the request due to priority commitments at home.  Requests were received from the Department of Foreign Affairs on 24 June last for the provision of two monitors for the municipal elections in Mostar and for the appointment of a presidency co-ordinator to liaise between the EU administration in Mostar and the Presidency.  The requests were approved on 27 June and the required personnel have been provided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> During 1996 six Air Corps officers have applied to retire from the Permanent Defence Force.  One officer, who was granted permission to retire with effect from 1 July 1996, has now applied to have his retirement deferred to 30 September 1996.  The other five applications are currently being considered <Col N="126" /> and it is my intention to release the officers concerned as soon as possible subject to the operational commitments of the Air Corps.  These applications have just recently been received and I will make a decision in their regard very shortly.</P>

      <P>At present the Naval Service comprises a total of 1,031 personnel.  The service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter-carrying patrol vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  In the interests of security it is not the practice to disclose details regarding operational equipment, including weaponry, on board Naval Service vessels.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.  The Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance, including assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs, and they will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of such <Col N="128" /> patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti drugs smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such requests.  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 will also increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.  The question of whether additional resources are required will be kept under review as these measures are implemented.</P>

      <P>A total of 197 married quarters have been sold by the Department of Defence to members of the Defence Forces since 1988.  Included in these are 188 other ranks married quarters located outside of barracks sold to the occupants under the terms of a departmental purchase scheme which was in line with the terms of the local authority tenant purchase scheme.  A further two such quarters, which became vacant after the expiry of the scheme, were sold to serving members of the Defence Forces on a competitive tendering basis.  In addition, seven officers married quarters were sold to the occupants at prices as <Col N="129" /> advised by the Commissioner of Valuation. The number of quarters sold to date represents 28 per cent approximately of the total stock of married quarters located both outside and within barracks.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the sale of quarters scheme has operated satisfactorily.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that the recommendation that the FCA/Second Line Reserve be reduced from an existing strength of 16,000, all ranks, to a strength of approximately 5,000, will not be implemented in this the 50th anniversary year of the establishment of this efficient, loyal, patriotic and disciplined force, which has given voluntary unpaid service to the State in cities, towns, villages and rural areas throughout the country.</Quest>

      <P>There are no proposals to reduce the strength of the Reserve Defence Forces. As indicated in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan recently approved by Government, a special study on the Reserve Defence Forces will be carried out during the lifetime of the plan.</P>
      <P>The Government fully appreciates the contribution being made by members of the FCA to the overall effectiveness of the Defence Forces. The FCA is a voluntary organisation. Because of this, all ranks possess a high level of motivation and commitment. Members of the FCA pursue full-time careers and, as a result, training must take place during evenings and weekends. FCA personnel devote a considerable amount of their spare time to the community through the medium of parttime military service.  The dedication and enthusiasm of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil is recognised and valued in local communities throughout the country and at national level by the Government. It is my hope and my intention that the review will acknowledge and enhance that contribution.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the number of reports recording agreement which he has received in 1996 from the conciliation council of the Defence Forces conciliation scheme; the number of claims currently under negotiation with the conciliation council; whether he has satisfied himself that the scheme is operating effectively and to the satisfaction of all the parties to the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14441/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the conciliation and arbitration scheme was established in March, 1993, 71 council reports have been signed. Twelve conciliation council reports recording agreement have been adopted to date in 1996.  A further five reports recording agreement will be adopted at the next meetings of the conciliation council.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the conciliation and arbitration scheme is operating effectively. It is, of course, open to any of the parties to the scheme to raise its operation through the normal industrial relations procedures.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was accepted by both RACO and PDFORRA in 1994.  The associated pay agreement provides that parties who have not processed their claims under the previous <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to a conclusion may process claims on the basis of a negotiated settlement involving changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service.  Alternatively a single cost increasing claim for an amount not exceeding 3 per cent of the basic pay cost of the group of employees concerned may be processed in accordance with the normal industrial relations procedures.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provides that no cost increasing claims other than those dealing with pensions and sick pay schemes, can be made or processed during its currency.</P>
      <P>A negotiated agreement was reached with RACO in 1995 and negotiations with PDFORRA are at an advanced stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has provided certainty of pay costs and has contributed to the present low-inflation and low-interest rate economic climate at present being experienced in this country.  This in turn has created the conditions for the exceptionally high growth rates we are now enjoying.  The role played by the employee interests, including the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, in bringing about this situation is acknowledged and greatly appreciated by the Government.</P>

      <P>As the statistical data requested is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Applications for transfer from members of the Naval Service to the Army or Air Corps are considered on their merit subject to the operational requirements of the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service has a vital role in providing a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. Over 90 per cent of the operational seatime of the Naval Service is occupied with this task.  Other important roles carried out by the Naval Service, generally in support of other Government Departments, include search and rescue operations, aid to the civil power (e.g. drugs interdiction at sea, salmon fishery patrols) and assistance with oil pollution control at sea.  In the exercise of these tasks the service is responsible for the operation, maintenance and administration of five offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  Accordingly it is not possible to approve transfers except in exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>Recruitment to the Defence Forces has always been assessed in the light of operational requirements at any particular time.  I agree that a planned programme of recruitment, both commissioned officers and noncommissioned ranks, is the correct <Col N="144" /> approach to ensuring both an effective strength in consideration of the roles and tasks of the Defence Forces and the most efficient and economic use of personnel resources.  Indeed such has been the primary purpose of the EAG review.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise however that the EAG implementation plan will not make any member of the Defence Forces redundant.  To address the unsatisfactory age profile of the PDF in a co-ordinated manner and allow scope for necessary recruitment, the Government approved a voluntary early retirement scheme for the Force.  This scheme is entirely voluntary.  It also incorporates a counselling support service to assist in the transition to civilian life and in the search for alternative employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>Only dredge spoil and natural material such as sand, gravel and rock, fish waste and sewage sludge (in the case of Dublin) are permitted under dumping at sea legislation.  I am arranging to have a detailed list of all permits which are currently in existence circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation currently holds an annual permit granted by my Department permitting the disposal of up to a maximum of 340,000 tonnes of sewage <Col N="145" /> sludge at sea during 1996 with a maximum of 2,000 tonnes to be dumped per day.  Three trips are normally made to the site per week with approximately 2,000 tonnes being disposed of on each trip.  The dump site is located some 14 miles south-east of the Kish Lighthouse well away from Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>In March 1991, following extensive scientific studies, the site used by Dublin Corporation for the disposal of sewage sludge was relocated from its previous location two miles off Howth Head to a new site south-east of the Kish Lighthouse about ten to 14 miles offshore.  Some localised environmental impact had been identified in the vicinity of the old site.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of the status of the new sewage sludge dump site and the recovery status of the old dump site close to Howth Head was carried out in 1993.  At the new dump site the monitoring revealed that there was no significant impact on the sediment fauna in the area, reflecting the dispersive nature of the dump-site, while at the old dump site the monitoring revealed an increase <Col N="146" /> in the number of benthic faunal species in the area, suggesting good recovery. According to international practice, monitoring of such sites is recommended at approximately five year intervals and the sites will be fully resurveyed in 1998.  Under present disposal conditions environmental problems are not anticipated, however, I am arranging for an interim survey of both sites next year.</P>
    <P>Because of the distance of the current dump site from bathing areas the dumping of the sludge has no impact on bathing areas.</P>
    <P>This is the only authorised dumping of sewage sludge at sea in Ireland.  The new Dumping at Sea Act, 1996 prohibits such dumping with effect from 31 December 1998.  This is in line with the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment (OSPAR).  Dublin Corporation's plan for alternative disposal methods has been approved by the Department of the Environment and work on the implementation of the plan to switch to land based disposal after 31 December 1998 is on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose answering Parliamentary Questions Nos. 33 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Department of the Marine, Donegal County Council has submitted details of its top coastal protection priorities for consideration for aid under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99.  Donegal County Council submitted proposals in respect of the following locations listed in order of priority: &mdash; (1) Maheraroarty; (2) Rathmullan; (3) Teelin, (4) Drung; (5) Mountcharles; (6) White Strand (Buncrana); and (7) Ramelton.</P>
      <P>During 1995 coastal protection works at a number of locations around our coast were aided under the operational programme.  It was not possible to aid any works in County Donegal in 1995.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that as the funding under the programme is limited to £5.1 million over the 1994-99 period it is only possible to grant aid a limited number of projects in any one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, Donegal County Council's priority for coastal protection is Maheraroarty.  Essentially, the problem at this location is that there is a sand bank isthmus running east of the pier which has been severely eroded in recent years.  The council has proposed <Col N="148" /> using rock armour to halt the erosion. The cost of this work is estimated to be in the region of £230,000.  However, given the nature of the erosion at Maheraroarty and the coastal dynamics along that section of the coastline it is essential that the correct type of coastal protection is put in place.  Rock armouring may or may not be the correct solution.  In view of this I have now requested Donegal County Council to undertake a detailed study of the problem, including the design of possible solutions. It is estimated that such a study will cost between £20,000-£30,000. Grant aid amounting to 75 per cent of the cost will be made available to the council.  The engineering division of my Department, who are probably the most skilled corps of marine engineers in the country, will liaise closely with the council on this study, which I am hopeful will identify a long-term solution to the erosion problem at Maheraroarty.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other priority locations identified by the council I am not in a position to allocate any funding this year.  However, the situation will be reviewed annually between now and the end of the programme in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has also asked about Maghery, County Donegal.  I have received representations on behalf of An Coiste Forbartha an Mhacaire regarding funding for coastal protection works at Maghery.  While consideration will be given to the situation at Maghery, I have to say that given the limited amount of funding available for coastal protection and the fact that Maghery is not on Donegal County Council's priority list, it is unlikely that any works will be aided.  That being said, if the local community in conjunction with Donegal County Council wish to undertake any protection works directly, I will give favourable consideration to the granting of any appropriate foreshore permissions for such works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I have received the report and recommendations of the Salmon Management Task Force.  On foot of the report I am finalising a framework of strategic measures for the future management of the wild salmon resource based around the task force recommendations and grounded in the various policy objectives which I have previously outlined to the House.</P>
      <P>Salmon management policy and its future direction is a matter of considerable national importance and concern.  I intend therefore to bring the task force report to Government within the next few weeks, together with my proposals on future management strategies following which the report will be published in full.  I also think it would be appropriate to afford the House, or a Committee of the House, the opportunity to have a full debate on the report and on future strategic directions for salmon management as soon as this can be arranged.</P>
      <P>The basic premise underlying policy is that the balance of advantage on conservation, environmental and economic grounds will lie increasingly with redirecting salmon stocks away from interceptory commercial fishing at sea and towards recreational fishing.  In developing the necessary strategies to bring about that transition, salmon policy objectives must have full regard for the interests of those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation be they commercial or angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> There are complex and delicate balances to be struck in delivering an integrated strategic framework for action grounded in consensus and co-operation by all concerned interests.  There are numerous issues critical to the conservation of wild salmon stocks to be taken into account in developing that framework. I have been weighing all of these with the aim of putting in place the best possible mix of practical measures, within a realistic timeframe, to secure the future for the wild salmon resource. I am confident that a new strategic direction can be achieved and will be supported, and I look forward to a positive and constructive debate at all levels on the way forward from here.</P>

      <P>Preparations are under way for the completion of an environmental quality status report (QSR) for the entire area covered by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic &mdash; OSPAR &mdash; to which Ireland is a party.  For the purpose of the report the Convention area has been divided into five sub-regions. Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of Region III which includes the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, the area to the west of Ireland and the area to the west of Scotland.</P>
      <P>Overall responsibility for the preparation of the report in respect of Region III including the synthesis of Irish and UK contributions, has been assigned to a joint Irish-UK Regional Task Team (RTT) that will meet periodically to review progress.  Ireland is represented on this team by officials from the Departments of the Marine and Environment and the Marine Institute.</P>
      <P>The Irish contribution to the QSR is being co-ordinated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Departments of the Environment and the Marine.  For this purpose, arrangements are in place to establish a national QSR office, consisting of a core group of scientists.  The national team will commence operation this month.  Work is on target to have the report in respect of Region III completed in time for the year 2000 deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The QSR will consist of a compilation of existing knowledge of the area; an evaluation of this information in relation to agreed criteria of environmental quality; and a statement of the <Col N="152" /> prevailing condition of the area.  The report will cover all relevant fields of natural science (e.g. geography, human activities, physical hydrography, climatology, marine chemistry and marine biology) on coastal zones, near-shore and offshore areas.</P>
    <P>The structure, scope and content of the QSR will be largely in accordance with the United Nations Guidelines for Marine Environment Assessments taking into account the OSPAR Joint Monitoring and Assessment Programme and related guidance from appropriate OSPAR working groups.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>in the recent EC Lassen report concerned with the future multiannual guidance programme, Ireland states that our current pelagic tonnage is 16,219 tonnes for 18 vessels and in view of the fact that this figure is at variance with other pelagic tonnage figures in the public domain, if he will clarify the issue and give details of the tonnage of each of these 18 vessels.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14447/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can advise the Deputy that the tonnage figure quoted for the Irish pelagic fleet in the Lassen report was the correct figure at the time the report was compiled earlier this year.  The data used for the Irish fleet information in the Lassen report was derived from the Department's own vessel registry data base as of 31 January 1996.  The figure quoted therefore is a specific snapshot in time.  This reflects the fact that tonnage statistics are not constant but rather evolve upwards and downwards over a given period as vessels move on and off the Register.  There is nothing unusual about this as all national fleet registers throughout the EU will show similar fluctuations.  I am forwarding the breakdown of figures requested directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Irish pelagic fleet has undergone fundamental renewal and replacement over recent years and is now the most modern and efficient in the fleet and indeed one of the most modern fleets in Europe.  The modernisation process has involved significant investment by the sector in new vessels equipped with the latest electronics and refrigerated saltwater tanks.  The pelagic fleet fishes for mackerel and herring as well as non quota species such as horse mackerel in EU waters and is actively pursuing new opportunities in international waters. The modernisation programme has been a very positive development and has been achieved within the context of delivering on our mandatory EU tonnage target for the segment by the end of this year.  I can advise the Deputy that since January, two additional new pelagic boats, replacing older vessels, have been added to the Register and another will be registered shortly which will bring total pelagic tonnage in line with the objective of 19,500 tonnes by end 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> As the Deputy is aware, the report by the Expert Group, chaired by Professor Lassen of Denmark, was prepared for the EU Commission in order to inform proposals on the next multi annual guidance programme for the fishing fleets of member states.  The scientific experts, including an Irish fishery scientist, reviewed the state of fish stocks available to the EU, assessed the fleets of all member states and advised on the levels of fishing exploitation which in the group's view must be aimed for in order to secure the viability of stocks.  The Lassen report makes sobering reading and underlines the need for appropriate measures on all fronts to tackle overfishing, to conserve stocks and to ensure an economic future for the EU fishing sector.</P>
    <P>I have already publicly stated, however, that the Commission's proposals to achieve this by global cuts of up to 40 per cent in EU fleet tonnage are totally unacceptable to Ireland's specific situation.  The conclusions of the Lassen report actually bear out, in my view, the Irish case that getting the balance right between the EU fleet and available resources involves a much wider range of factors than capacity control.  Fishing methods, conservation and control and enforcement must be taken into account also together with the particular needs and position of national fleets.  I have also drawn the Commission's attention to the high levels of effort exerted by other fleets on the fish stocks under pressure in the Irish EEZ including the activities of flagships which has to be addressed in devising solutions to the overfishing problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> The last Irish Ambassador to present credentials in Libya was the late Ambassador Fogarty, who presented his credentials in Tripoli on 13 October 1987 and served until December 1991 in that capacity.  The last ambassadorial visit to Libya was on 6-10 October 1991.</P>
    <P>In November 1991 the Government approved the nomination of Ambassador Patrick O'Connor, Ambassador Fogarty's successor as Ambassador to Italy, as Ambassador to Libya. Ambassador O'Connor did not have the opportunity to present credentials in Libya during his term of office, although diplomatic contacts with Libya continued on a regular basis as outlined in my reply of 11 June 1996.</P>
    <P>The Government has nominated the current Irish Ambassador to Italy, Joseph Small, as Ambassador to Libya and arrangements are being made for his accreditation by agreement with the Libyan authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the joint monitoring committee for the Special EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Chapter 7 of the programme requires that responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the programme is invested in a monitoring committee. The committee consists of representatives of both Governments, the European Commission, the EIB, local authorities, business, trade unions, community-voluntary groups and the joint chairpersons of the consultative forum.</P>
      <P>The first meeting of the monitoring committee was held on 28 February last. The programme requires that the committee meet not less than twice a year at times and places of its choosing.  The meeting held on 27 June 1996 was a special one convened to deal with the specific issues of the mid-term review of the programme.  I attach, for the Deputy's information, the report of the meeting issued by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next formal meeting of the committee will be held on 7 November 1996. This meeting will cover, in far greater <Col N="164" /> detail, reports of progress under the programme to date.</P>
    <P>The full list of members of the committee also follows.  The Deputy will appreciate that the names of the members will be subject to change from time to time.</P>
    <P>EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation &mdash; Special Meeting of the Monitoring Committee.</P>
    <P>A special meeting of the Monitoring Committee for the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland was held on 27 June 1996 in the Guildhall, Derry to consider the evaluation of the Programme. The Committee, which oversees the Programme, is made up of officials from Northern Ireland, Ireland and the European Commission, as well as local members from a range of sectoral interests.</P>
    <P>The Monitoring Committee meeting also heard the first report from the newly established Consultative Forum which met for the first time on the previous day.  The purpose of the Forum, which consists of 60 Northern Ireland members and 20 members from the Border counties is to provide a mechanism for continuing consultation over the life of the Programme.  The Committee welcomed the representation from the forum as a means of obtaining up-todate views from a range of local bodies about the Programme and its progress.</P>
    <P>The special Committee meeting considered a range of technical issues in relation to the evaluation of the Programme. It also heard that all the implementing authorities involved in the Programme were now in a position to consider projects with a view to accelerating expenditure.  A number of projects from a range of sectoral areas including economic growth, community groups, food, fishery and agriculture have now been formally approved.</P>

      <P>As I have no function in relation to the rate of pension paid by United Kingdom sources, I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Irish pound value of sterling-denominated pensions.  As the Deputy will be aware, the sterling/Irish pound exchange rate is essentially determined by the financial markets and reflects <i>inter alia</i> the markets' view of the relative strengths of the economies of the two countries.  The overall trend in recent years is a reflection of sterling weakness.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce measures which would compensate Irish residents for fluctuations in the value of sterling, or other foreign currencies, against the Irish pound.  However, it should be noted that in recent years consumer price inflation in Ireland has been lower than that in the UK.</P>

    <P>A succession of low budget deficits since the late 1980s, together with increases in gross national product (GNP), has resulted in a significant fall in the debt burden in recent years with the national debt to GNP ratio falling from a peak of over 125 per cent in 1987 to less than 90 per cent by end-1995.</P>
    <P>Over the same period, gross general Government debt as a percentage of GDP, which is the relevant debt measure for the purposes of the Maastricht Treaty, has declined from almost 117 per cent to under 82 per cent.  Based on the strong performance in recent years, Ireland has been adjudged to have met all the requirements set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Government policy is to maintain budgetary prudence in order to continue to meet the fiscal criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  In this context, the 1996 budget allowed for an EBR of 2 per cent of GNP.  This equates to a general Government deficit of 2.6 per cent of GDP which will make 1996 the seventh successive year in which the Maastricht criterion of a maximum 3 per cent has been achieved.  It is expected that, in the coming years, continued budgetary prudence combined with <Col N="169" /> strong economic growth will yield further significant reductions in the debt ratio.</P>

      <P>The Irish Red Cross Society undertook at my request an assessment of the extent of the hardship caused as a consequence of the flooding which affected the south and south east of the country, including Wexford town, in the winter of 1995/96. To that end the society carried out a publicity campaign, which included national and local media (radio and newspapers) coverage of involvement in the investigation, widespread advertising in the national and local newspapers including the <i>Wexford People</i> in early May 1996 and follow-up interviews by the society's research staff of those applicants who submitted application forms for humanitarian assistance.</P>
      <P>While I do not have details of the applications received, such information is confidential between the individual applicant and the Irish Red Cross Society, the total number of applications submitted from Wexford town and county to the society was twelve.</P>
      <P>The Government at its meeting yesterday approved the provision of £265,000 to the Irish Red Cross Society for distribution as humanitarian aid to the victims of flooding.  This will be in addition to the 300,000 ECU, £235,000 approximately, which has been promised by the EU.</P>

This will be in addition to the sum of 300,000 ECU, £235,000 approximately, which has been promised by the EU.</P>
      <P>There has been no unavoidable delay in dealing with this matter.  The Deputy will be aware that because of the lack of a budget line in the EU budget I succeeded in securing the promise of Union funding only after difficult and protracted negotiations.</P>
      <P>In order to obviate delays in making payments to the flood victims, I asked the Irish Red Cross Society in advance of any funds having been allocated, to make an assessment of the needs of the flooding victims.  The Government has approved the provision of funds within weeks of the handing over of the society's report to me.</P>

    <P>1.  The main factors contributing to the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases are the withdrawal rate of Family Income Supplement (60%) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax.  (involving a 40% tax rate).</P>
    <P>2.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing Family Income Supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis.  Once awarded it will not be reduced/withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay. Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.</P>
    <P>3.  The numbers of people who potentially lose disposable income as gross pay increases are small. In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax are the main elements of the poverty trap, the number of people affected is essentially a function of the numbers who both receive FIS and pay tax.  It is estimated that the numbers both paying tax and receiving FIS are of the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this situation potentially &ldquo;applied to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>4.  Finally, it should be noted that the entitlement to a medical card applies:</P>
    <P>&mdash;up to a gross income of £8,086 in the case of a married couple with two children</P>
    <P>&mdash;up to a gross income of £8,886 in the case of a married couple with three children</P>
    <P>&mdash;up to a gross income of £9,646 in the case of a married couple with four children.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>whether Ireland has agreed, in the context of preparations for stage 3 of economic and monetary union, that in order to allow the automatic stabilisers to work in times of economic downturn, each member state should aim for a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus in the medium term; and the plans, if any, he has to move to that position; if so, the time-scale involved, assuming no major downturn in the interim.</Quest>

      <P>The need to secure budgetary discipline in stage 3 of economic and monetary union has been a key element of the preparatory work at the level of the European Union in recent years.</P>
      <P>Article 103 of the Treaty on European Union provides for the adoption by the Council of recommendations on the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the member states and the Union.  In December 1993 the first such guidelines, which were adopted by ECOFIN following discussion at the European Council, envisaged that, in the long term, member states' budgetary policies would be directed towards contributing to higher national savings and investment and that this would entail much lower budget deficits, &ldquo;perhaps close to balance by 2000&rdquo;.  In July, 1995 the broad economic guidelines adopted by ECOFIN repeated the goal, which they now referred to as a medium-term one, of bringing budget deficits &ldquo;close to balance&rdquo;.  They noted that, in some countries, the structure of the pension system calls for surpluses in the public accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, discussions have taken place at ECOFIN on ways to ensure budgetary discipline in stage 3 of economic and monetary union, including <Col N="175" /> consideration of proposals put forward last autumn by Germany for a stability pact.  In this context it has been argued that, in favourable times, member states should aim for general government deficits comfortably below the reference value of 3 per cent of GDP referred to in Article 104c of the Treaty in order to ensure that they can keep such deficits to or below the 3 per cent reference value over the course of a normal economic cycle.  In that context, the need to maintain such a budgetary position has recently been restated by ECOFIN.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case, despite varying rates of GDP growth, the budget deficit has been kept well below the 3 per cent reference value every year since and including 1989.  The objective of keeping the budget deficit below the 3 per cent reference value will continue to inform the development of budgetary policy.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Santer proposals for additional expenditure of 1 billion ECU over the period of 1997-99 mainly on providing transport infrastructure networks.  In accordance with the Florence European Council Conclusions, the Council will consider these proposals, in conformity with the <Col N="176" /> imperatives of budgetary rigour and in accordance with the relevant procedures. The European Council made it clear that in considering these proposals, the existing Structural Funds provisions will not be affected.  Ireland supports this approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available relates to the corporation tax liability of companies with annual accounting periods falling between 1 April 1990 and 31 March 1994 and whose liability to tax was computed partly or wholly at the reduced rate of 10 per cent.  The information, in so far as it is available, is as set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Companies which qualify for the reduced rate of 10 per cent on a portion of their taxable profits are included in the table in respect of their total tax liability, i.e. tax paid at both the 10 per cent rate and the 40 per cent rate.  It is not possible to isolate the tax attributable solely to the 10 per cent rate in such cases because certain reliefs relating to income liable for tax at both the standard and reduced rates are set off against the overall tax liability after the relief at 10 per cent has been computed.</P>

    <P>Public funding for health research in Ireland is channelled primarily through the Health Research Board.  The board is not currently undertaking research into ME.

    <P>The condition is the subject of widespread international research.  My Department, and the medical profession generally, keep themselves informed of major developments in the area so that the condition can be identified and managed in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>Disabled person's maintenance allowance is granted on the basis of a medical examination and a means test.  No specific illnesses or disabilities give automatic entitlement to the allowance, but persons suffering from ME may of course be considered for the allowance in the same way as all other persons who make an application.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of parents with regard to the adequacy of speech and language therapy and physiotherapy services for their children and I regard the expansion of such services as a priority.  Health boards have provided additional physiotherapy and speech and language therapy posts with the additional funding provided since 1993 for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. In relation to speech and language therapy services, which are of particular concern, boards have allocated £695,000 to their development in the last three years, including £300,000 in 1995.  This additional funding has allowed the recruitment of 28 speech and language therapists as well as the purchase of additional speech and language therapy equipment.  The Deputy will note that the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities is currently finalising its report which will provide a blueprint for the further development of these services.</P>
      <P>Speech therapy services in County Meath are provided under the community care programme of the North-Eastern Health Board.  There are currently 6.7 speech and language therapy posts in County Meath.  The board has recently submitted to my Department a five-year development plan for speech and language therapy services.  Officials will shortly be meeting with the board to discuss this plan.</P>

      <P>Additional funding has been provided in 1996 and previous years for the development of a broad range of new day services for persons with a mental handicap.  These developments may, in some cases, have resulted in the establishment of some small enterprise type facilities.</P>
      <P>However there are two specific initiatives which the Government has introduced to provide persons with a disability, including persons with a mental handicap, with employment opportunities, namely the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities which has an allocation of £1.729 million in 1996 and the employment support scheme which has an allocation of £0.960 million in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities or PEP was introduced in 1994 and is administered by my Department with the assistance of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The pilot programme <Col N="184" /> is designed to run for an initial three-year period.  The scheme has an employment support fund, as outlined above, which provides an ongoing subsidy payable for each employee with a disability and is related to his/her productive capacity.  Assessments are carried out by the NRB.  Seven businesses employing 150 people with a disability have been grant-aided to date under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Further employment opportunities for people with disabilities are provided under the employment support scheme, which is also administered by the NRB. This scheme gives an opportunity to people with a more severe disability to participate in open employment with the employer being paid a subsidy by the NRB to make up for the loss of productivity by an employee with a disability. Over 300 people with a disability are currently employed under this scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): An official from my Department attended an international drugs conference in Sweden between 10 and 13 June 1996.  The official arrived for the conference at approximately 9.30 p.m. (local time) on Sunday, 9 June, 1996.  The official departed from the conference on Tuesday, 11 June, 1996 at 5.15 p.m. (local time) and left Sweden at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 June, which was when the first convenient flight was available.  The official arrived back in Dublin at 3.45 p.m. on Wednesday, 12 June.  The cost, which was paid by my Department, of sending the official to the conference was £1,502.72.  This covered travel and subsistence costs, including hotel accommodation, and the cost of registration for the conference.</P>
      <P>The conference, which was of 3.5 days duration, dealt with drug issues on research, prevention/treatment, and organised crime.  The sessions on Monday, 10 June and Tuesday, 11 June dealt with research and prevention/treatment which are issues relating to my Department's brief on drugs.  The official did not remain at the conference for the sessions on Wednesday and Thursday as these dealt with crime prevention which is a matter for the Department of Justice and the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The series of advertisements taken out by the Philip Morris company in recent weeks do not claim that tobacco smoke does not damage health.  However the company's claim, that there is a greater relative risk of contracting cancer by consuming such everyday items as chlorinated water or pepper than by being exposed to environmental tobacco smoke is spurious and, in my view, should be treated with the contempt it deserves.</P>
      <P>Over the last thirty years the potentially lethal hazards of tobacco as they affect the individual smoker have been scientifically proven.  Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis/emphysema and coronary heart disease.  It also increases the risk of atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease which can lead to gangrene and limb amputation.  In Ireland, about 6,000 deaths a year are attributable to smoking.  It is only comparatively recently that the hazards of environmental tobacco smoke have become known, affecting the passive smoker as well as the smoker.  These include an increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory disease.  Indeed, there is now evidence emerging that mothers who have been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke may have an increased risk of having a low birth-weight baby.</P>
      <P>The use of selective epidemiological studies by the Philip Morris company to support its message has already been widely refuted by the various health interests here.  These include the chief executive officers of the health boards, the Centre for Health Promotion Studies in University College, Galway, and representatives of many of the non-statutory health organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comments of these experts, made at the time of Commissioner Flynn's <Col N="193" /> request, were a swift rejoinder to the campaign and reflected the feeling of health professionals all over the country. I believe the campaign by Philip Morris is simply a cynical measure, designed to raise the profile of the company and increase its market share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for assistance under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice an applicant must satisfy two basic eligibility tests. The first of these is a means test in order to determine financial eligibility.  The other is a merits test.  The various financial eligibility limits are reviewed from time to time by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on the basis generally of increases in the consumer price index and the provision of the scheme relating to the financial eligibility criteria are amended by the Minister as necessary.  Income eligibility limits were last adjusted with effect from 1 August 1995 following such a review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> An applicant is eligible for legal aid on financial grounds if his or her disposable income and disposable capital are within certain limits specified in the scheme.  &ldquo;Disposable income&rdquo; is the income which remains when various deductions are made from gross income &mdash;&ldquo;gross income&rdquo; being defined as total income received from all sources.  The deductions to be made from gross income, which are referred to as allowances, include, for example, income tax, mortgage repayments, rent, social insurance, VHI contributions, expenses in travelling to and from work together with various allowances in respect of the applicant's spouse and dependent children. At present the income level for eligibility for legal services is a disposable income of not more than £7,350.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the scheme &ldquo;capital&rdquo; includes, for example, money in the applicant's bank, credit union, building society or post office accounts, or the applicant's house, property or land and the aim under that heading is to find the value of the applicant's disposable capital. Disposable capital is its gross value, less, for example, the value of the family home or the cost of releasing assets, outstanding loans, etc.  Since in the vast majority of cases applicants do not have significant capital resources, by and large, eligibility is determined by reference to income alone.  While the income of a husband and wife are normally aggregated, they are treated separately when the parties are in conflict with each other, or where they are living separately and apart.  The effect of this rule is that in a very high proportion of matrimonial cases a wife will qualify for legal services, even if her husband is financially secure.</P>

      <P>I refer the <Col N="200" /> Deputy to my previous response to a question on this matter, i.e. Question No. 50 of 9 May, 1996 (Columns 1008 and 1009 of the Official Report for that day refer).</P>
      <P>The current statutory regime under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988, places a universal requirement on all persons in possession of a television set to hold a current television licence. The revenue generated from the sale of television licences is paid, net of collection costs, to RTÉ for the general purposes of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I am of the view that any financial assistance scheme for persons with disabilities, no matter how well merited, should not be operated at the expense of funds available for broadcasting.  Any such scheme would be more appropriate as part of the social welfare code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The emergency action undertaken by the Waterways Service to oxygenate a stretch of the Royal Canal near Leixlip, County Kildare, has been very effective.  Oxygen levels which were critically low have been raised to acceptable levels and are currently being monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in this area of the Royal Canal is due to the degeneration of the <Col N="201" /> aquatic vegetation there.  While the precise cause of the problem has not yet been established, the condition of the vegetation is consistent with the possible application of a chemical substance. Inquiries to date have not established whether this is due to dumping of a chemical or to some other cause. Samples of water and of the affected vegetation have been taken and are being analysed to try to establish the precise nature of the substance which caused the problem.  The question of whether to take legal action will be considered when the cause of the problem has been established definitively and if the source of the problem can be identified. It is the general policy of my Department to take the strongest and most effective action possible, including legal action where appropriate, in consultation with the other enforcement agencies, against anyone polluting the waterways.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to say when this stretch of the canal will return to normal.  This will depend on how quickly the vegetation regenerates naturally. Fortunately, due to the vigilance of local people in reporting the problem and the prompt action of the Waterways Service in dealing with it, very few, if any, fish have died as a result of the problem and re-stocking is not considered necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent angling location which was being developed by my Department with the assistance of the Department of the Marine under the EU Structural Funds Tourism Angling Measure.  The unauthorised interference &mdash; whether it occurred through carelessness, malicious intent or in a misguided effort to improve the area &mdash; has set back this development seriously.  I again appeal to the public to exercise great care and not to interfere with the waterways without first consulting the Waterways Service, which will be only too pleased to offer advice and, where possible, assistance.</P>

      <P>There are no current proposals before my Department for reclassification of the routes in question.  A lengthy and comprehensive review of the national road system was brought to a conclusion in July 1994 with the making of the Roads Act, 1993 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1994.  I do not propose to make any major changes in the national road network in the near future.  Traffic patterns will, however, continue to be monitored in order to identify any long-term changes which might have implications for the classified system.</P>

      <P>The rate support grant paid to Castleblayney Urban District Council over the years has been calculated on the same basis as applied to local authorities generally.  The initial calculation of the grant reflected the rates income formerly applicable to domestic dwellings, agricultural land and rates on Government property.  Adjustments in rate support grant allocations to individual authorities over the last decade arose from the elimination of certain levies and statutory demands, the writing off of loans from the Local Loans Fund, and measures to reduce debt levels and to deal with other structural problems.  It is not possible at this stage to either increase the 1996 allocation to the council or to improve on the arrangements put in place for advance payment of rate support grant instalments.</P>

      <P>A grant of £5 million was allocated by the Minister for Finance in the 1994 budget towards the cost of the construction of the Cusack stand.  This grant was administered under my Department's major sports facilities scheme and was subject to the normal terms and conditions applicable to all Exchequer funded capital projects.  These include the requirement that the facility being grant aided must be available to the public.  Grants under this programme are payable on the basis of consultants certificates as construction work proceeds and the grant in the case of this project was paid in two instalments &mdash; £4.9 million in September 1994 and £100,000 in October 1995.</P>
      <P>Cumann Luthchleas Gael executed a deed of trust in favour of the Minister for Education to the value of the grant.

Such deeds of trust are executed in all capital projects where the grant exceeds £40,000.</P>

I also established an advisory committee under the chairmanship of Professor John Kelly of UCD to advise on the allocation of the special fund for students with disabilities.  Applications are invited through the third level institutions from students with disabilities in October of each year.</P>
    <P>In 1995 a sum of £105,000 was provided to assist students with disabilities and a further allocation of £225,000 has been made to the discretionary fund for 1996, a large portion of which will be allocated to the special fund.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the excellent work which the disability support office at UCC is doing to assist students with disabilities. In the last two years UCC has received a total of £60,000 from the special fund to assist students with disabilities attending third level courses in the college.</P>
    <P>In planning new third level facilities or expanding existing facilities specific regard is had to the need for appropriate access for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has allocated approximately £400,000 from its 1996 budget to fund special initiatives, including initiatives for the disabled, in Higher Education Authority sector institutions.</P>
    <P>Applications have been received from the institutions, including UCC, and are being assessed at the moment by the HEA.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of the need for additional time in certain instances.

    <P>Applications for resource teacher posts are reviewed on their merits.  A resource post may be shared among a group of schools in an area where the number of pupils with disabilities in a particular school is not sufficient to warrant a full-time post.  Consideration will be given to all schools in County Meath who have pupils with special needs and who are close to the applicant schools for inclusion in a resource teacher caseload.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional resource teacher posts available to any primary school.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers and 29 resource teachers to the primary sector. A total of 1,188 remedial teachers and 36 resource teachers are now in place.</P>
    <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    <P>During the period 1994/1995, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers and 23 resource teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the resource teaching area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to the application from the two schools in question for a resource teacher post.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional resource teacher posts available to the schools referred to by the Deputy or to any primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers and 29 resource teachers to the primary sector. A total of 1,188 remedial teachers and 36 resource teacher are now in place.</P>
      <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> During the period 1994/1995, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers and 23 resource teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the resource teaching area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>The standard rates of capitation grants at primary level and the corresponding local contribution are set out in the following table A.</P>
      <P>Supplementary capitation grants are paid in respect of pupils in all-Irish schools, and in schools which are designated as disadvantaged.  In addition, special capitation rates apply in the case of pupils with handicap in special schools or in special classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard rate of <i>per capita</i> grants payable in respect of recognised students in voluntary secondary schools <Col N="226" /> in the free education scheme are set out in table B. Schools in the vocational and community and comprehensive sector are not funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis but on a budget basis.  Unlike primary schools, there is no requirement for local contributions at second level.</P>
    <P>In addition to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant at second level, additional <i>per capita</i> grants are payable in respect of schools participating in transition year and leaving certificate applied programmes, schools which are designated as disadvantaged, and schools with special class groups (pupils with handicap).</P>
    <P>Details of all special rates at both primary and post-primary level will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the ammunition depot does not pose a significant risk to the safety of prisoners or staff at the proposed new prison.  I am aware that the ammunition depot is operated to the most stringent standards of safety and security and I am particularly conscious of the excellent long-term safety record at the depot.  Furthermore, it should be noted that a significant portion of the Curragh military complex, including military staff residential units and, indeed, some private commercial and residential properties are also in the vicinity of the depot.  Finally, it should be pointed out that civilian prisoners were previously accommodated in the detention barracks as were military detainees immediately prior to the transfer of the detention barracks to the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>The concept of Europol was formally adopted in the Europol Convention of <Col N="231" /> July 1995 but it will need to be ratified by all 15 national parliaments before it can be put into place.  The establishment of Europol will have the following implications: Ireland will be part of Europol and will be required to participate fully in the implementation of Europol policy.  This will have staffing implications for the national office in Dublin and Europol headquarters in The Hague.  It is expected that additional staff in specialist areas will be required such as computer analysts; Ireland will be required to contribute <i>pro rata</i> to the annual running costs of Europol; work practices, and in some cases laws, will have to be harmonised in members states in order to maximise Europol's effectiveness, and comply with regulations when ratified.</P>

      <P>The approach of successive Governments to the European Convention on Human Rights, and to other international instruments on human rights to which Ireland is party, has been to carry out a detailed assessment of their obligations, both before ratification and in response to subsequent interpretation of the instruments, to see whether these are already provided for in Irish law or whether additional legislation is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the incorporation of the European Convention into Irish law raises a number of issues which would have to be answered before such a proposal could be given consideration. Principal among those issues are the conflicts which could be associated with incorporating into our laws provisions <Col N="232" /> relating to rights contained in the Convention which duplicate rights either explicitly provided for in our Constitution or implicit in its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, chaired by Dr. T.K. Whitaker, was published in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report contained, on the one hand, recommendations which consisted of broad statements of principle such as the need to respect fundamental human rights of persons who may be in prison and that persons should be sent to prison as a punishment and not for punishment. Second, there were recommendations which the committee regarded as important in the context of our penal system.  Some of these specific recommendations were very significant, for example, the committee believed that prisons should be only used as a last resort and in this context they recommended that greater use be made of alternatives to custody in various forms. This has been acted upon and there are now several thousand offenders availing of such alternatives to custody.  The recommendation regarding the appointment of a director of prison medical services was also implemented in October 1990.  Another area of concern to the committee was the question of the administration of long-term sentences including life sentences.  With the approval of the Government, the Minister established such a group under the then chairmanship of Dr. Whitaker towards the end of 1989.  This group, known as the Sentence Review Group, is charged with reviewing the cases of offenders who have served a total of <Col N="233" /> seven years imprisonment.  This group's recommendations have generally been accepted by the Minster and the process is considered to be working very well.  The committee also made recommendations concerning prison accommodation and recommended that improvements be implemented.  Major progress has since been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>An important recommendation of the Whitaker report was that a prisons board with responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the prisons be established. The programme for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> also contains a commitment to examine the question of establishing a prisons board to manage the day-to-day running of the prisons.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the commitment to examine the issues of structural reform of the management of prisons, contained in the programme for Government, I directed that the issue of a prison board be examined afresh by my Department.  Outline proposals have been developed and conveyed to the Department of Finance.  These proposals are being considered at present with a view to the matter being placed before Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Whitaker report several changes have occurred in our prison system.  One of the most striking of these has been a sharp increase in the numbers being committed to prison.  The daily average number in custody in 1984 was less than 1,400. Now, however, there are a total of over 2,100 in custody on a daily basis.  This drastic increase in numbers has brought particular problems for the prison service and for this and other reasons it was decided that it was time to re-assess the situation, setting out our policies and plans for the future and also indicating where we stand regarding the implementation of the Whitaker report.  In this regard, The Management of Offenders, A Five Year Plan was published in June 1994.  It contains a detailed and up-to-date assessment of the difficulties now facing the prison <Col N="234" /> system and sets out our plans to deal with it.  This policy document deals frankly with problems facing the prisons system today such as drugs, suicides, overcrowding and the problems raised by communicable diseases, in particular HIV and AIDS.  Along with the plan a revised draft set of Rules for the Government of Prisons was published. The current rules date from 1947 and are considered to be in urgent need of review at this stage.  The five-year plan, while it endorses and emphasises many of the recommendations of the Whitaker report, should also be seen as having built on and developed further the work started by the committee of inquiry.  The Whitaker report will of course continue to be regarded as having made an invaluable and seminal contribution to the development of penal policy in this State.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Europol Convention was signed by member states of the EU in July 1995.  There has been a delay in completion of a Protocol to the Convention dealing with the role of the Court of Justice concerning the Convention because of disagreement about what that role should be.  The recent European Council meeting resolved the problem and finalisation of the text of the Protocol is now in hands.</P>
      <P>The Convention will enter into force three months after the last member state has ratified it.  The necessary legislation to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention is being prepared as a matter of priority in my Department at present with a view to its introduction in the next Dáil session.  I will be urging all member states to complete their national ratification procedures as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There are also a number of implementing regulations dealing with staff, analysis of data, confidentiality among other matters to be adopted by the Council before Europol can become fully operational and I intend that work be completed on these regulations during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the work of the Europol drugs unit, which is based in the Hague, will continue to provide for co-operation and exchange of information between the law enforcement agencies of the member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the 1996 budget, the Government announced a wide range of initiatives particularly addressing the needs of the long-term unemployed.  My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has, for example, refocused community employment into two distinct options in order to give priority to people who are long-term unemployed.  A specific emphasis on the long-term unemployed is also contained in the new recruitment subsidey scheme, Jobstart, and in the pilot whole-time jobs option which were announced in the budget earlier this year.  These initiatives are designed to <Col N="248" /> encourage the creation of job opportunities for the long-term unemployed and to assist employers in hard-pressed labour intensive sectors.</P>
      <P>In so far as my own Department is concerned I am taking a proactive and work supportive approach to encouraging the unemployed to return to the active labour force and a wide range of initiatives are already in place.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced by my Department in 1993 to allow people who have been long-term welfare dependent to test employment and self-employment options and retain a foothold in the labour market while retaining some financial security for up to three years.</P>
      <P>Even though the scheme has only been in operation for just over two and a half years there are over 12,700 people currently in receipt of the allowance at an average weekly payment of £55.  This scheme has been a significant success and it will continue as my Department's principal incentive to the long-term unemployed to leave the live register. Its value as a measure to encourage those who are long-term unemployed to make the transition to work was confirmed by an independent evaluation earlier this year.  In this year's budget I obtained the agreement of the Government to the provision of 5,000 additional places on the scheme and I confidently expect that by the end of the year most of these places will be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a team of 30 jobs facilitators in place in my Department's eight regions and they are responsible for promoting the scheme at local level among employers, the long-term unemployed and lone parents.  They also have a significant role to play in assessing the needs of unemployed people, supporting them in seeking job opportunities and informing and directing them towards the wide range of existing initiatives and options provided by various Government Departments, agencies, voluntary bodies and community groups.  They are also co-operating at local level in the development and implementation of the new Local <Col N="249" /> Employment Service, the establishment of which was the main recommendation of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.</P>
    <P>A package of pro-employment measures was introduced in this year's budget designed to increase the incentive to work among the unemployed and also to encourage employers to create and retain jobs.  These measures included the following:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Family Income Supplement:</i>
    </P>
    <P>income thresholds increased by £10 which means a £6 a week increase for most recipients; qualifying period of employment reduced from six months to three months; scheme extended to job sharers; qualifying hours of employment reduced from 20 to 19 and payment to be adjusted immediately on birth of extra child.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Employers: Lowest 9 per cent rate reduced to 8.5 per cent; main 12.2 per cent rate reduced to 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Employees: PRSI free allowance increased to £80 a week.</P>
    <P>Self-Employed: £10 PRSI free allowance increased to £20; minimum annual PRSI contribution reduced to £215.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment Assistance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Changes were introduced in the way earnings are assessed which are designed to enable unemployed people to retain more take home pay when they take up part-time or casual work.</P>
    <P>Retention of child dependent allowance for 13 weeks for people who return to employment who have been out of work for 12 months or more.</P>
    <P>A programme of educational opportunities is also available to unemployed people.  These optional schemes encourage people who have been cut out of the education system for a long time to resume their education and increase their chances of obtaining employment. At present my Department has <Col N="250" /> approved just over 2,100 unemployed people to take part in third level education. In addition under Social Welfare regulations unemployed persons can participate in recognised second level courses if they are over 21 years and receiving a social welfare payment for at least 6 months.  Usually these are second level courses run by the vocational education committees and lead to junior or leaving certificate or City and Guilds qualifications.</P>
    <P>I should also mention another important employment support scheme, the family income supplement (FIS), which is designed to support families, with children, on low earnings.  This scheme reinforces the incentive to remain in employment where family income is not significantly above the level of unemployment payments.  The number of families receiving FIS payments has increased to almost 11,400 since mid-1993.</P>
    <P>The question of removing poverty traps and work disincentives from the tax and social welfare systems has been a source of some concern in recent years.  While the number of people affected by these traps is small, it is clearly undesirable that anyone should find themselves in the position where they are better off not working than taking up whatever employment opportunities are available.  Last week the report of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems was published.  The report contains a detailed examination of the way the lack of co-ordination of the tax and social welfare systems creates disincentives to employment, and looks at different approaches to overcoming this problem.  The report made it clear that there are no quick and easy solutions to the problem, but put forward a general strategy for gradually removing disincentives and poverty traps over time.  Two key parts of this strategy were child income support and tax reform.</P>
    <P>The report draws attention to the need for reform of child income support. As is now widely recognised, the <Col N="251" /> current range of income supports for children contributes to poverty traps and disincentives to work.  The Government has already been taking steps to reduce the disincentives effects associated with the current structure of child income support.  We have been gradually improving child benefit, while reducing the relative importance of child dependant allowances.  Child benefit has been increased by 45 per cent since this Government took office.  The group put forward a number of different ways in which the overall system of child income support could be improved, from the point of view of incentives.  The Government will be looking at these options very carefully, in order to develop the best strategy for continuing reform in this area.  I will continue to take a very pro-active and work supportive approach to job creation and retention and I will ensure that all relevant programmes administered by my Department are geared towards this objective.  I am confident that the measures which we have in place at present will assist the unemployed in returning to the workforce and my Department will continue in its efforts to support and encourage unemployed people in this regard.</P>

      <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report, Developing the National Pension System, put forward, <i>inter alia,</i> a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions generally, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime.

      <P>Disabled person's maintenance allowance is administered at present by the health boards using a variety of different administrative systems. The transfer of the scheme to the Department will mean that it will in future be operated from one centralised location and using computerised facilities will give greater scope for a more streamlined operation than is possible at present.  The integration of the scheme with other income maintenance schemes operated by the Department also offers possibilities for improved management and other information which will feed into the onging review of the social welfare system.  I am satisfied that the transfer of the scheme, apart from having obvious merit from a policy viewpoint, will also result in a more efficient and cost-effective system overall and enable the provision of an improved service to the people concerned.</P>

The conditions under which the site was made available and any understanding about what else would be provided as part of the work <Col N="254" /> are not matters in which my Department had any involvement, I understand that there have been a number of efforts by members of the clergy and public representatives locally to try and resolve this issue and that the matter was appealed to an Bord Pleanála.  I do not think that a meeting with me would serve any useful purpose.  I have, however, asked my Department to explore whether it would be worthwhile offering a further independent mediation service to both sides in this case.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 188 and 190 together.  I have received the final report of the Integrated Social Services System (ISSS) Inter-Departmental Committee.  The report was presented to Government and agreement was given to its publication. Arrangements for publication are being made by the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, who has been given responsibility for promoting and progressing the recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> The question of setting up a single means testing agency was one of the many issues considered by the committee. In the committee's view there is no compelling reason, at this time, to set up a single means testing agency.  The committee recommended that a central means database be set up to record details of all means assessments and that the means recording system in the Department be further developed for use as a central means database by all income support agencies.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that the issue of a single means testing agency should be kept under review and examined again when the central means database has been in operation for some time.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed that the recommendations in the report will be progressed within the context of the strategic management initiative process and that the various Government Departments and agencies involved should take on board the recommendations as far as possible within budgetary and staff resource constraints.</P>

      <P>The Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, commonly known as the Social Charter, was adopted in 1989. While the United Kingdom did not subscribe to the charter, it must be emphasised that the charter itself &mdash; a &ldquo;solemn declaration&rdquo; by the European Council &mdash; is not part of any of the treaties governing the European Union.  It simply laid down a set of non-binding principles on which laws might be based.  An action programme based on those principles was drawn up by the European Commission and the legislative proposals contained therein (e.g., the Directive on Working Time) were based on Treaty provisions to which all member states, including the UK, were subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement on Social Policy (sometimes referred to as the Social Chapter) attached to a protocol annexed to the 1992 Maastricht Treaty is applicable to all member states except the United Kingdom.  It is to measures <Col N="260" /> adopted under the Maastricht Agreement that the so-called UK opt-out applies.  To date, two legislative proposals, which are not binding on the UK, have been adopted under the agreement, namely, the Directive on the establishment of European Works Councils and the Directive on Parental Leave and leave for family reasons.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to mention that to date there has been political agreement within the Council that the Maastricht treaty base (Social Chapter) should only be used when scope for agreement between all 15 member states has been exhausted.</P>

      <P>I confirm that I have received the letter referred to by the Deputy and the following are my views/observations in regard to same: Community employment is designed primarily to provide temporary work experience, normally of one year's duration together with some training that would enhance the prospects of long-term unemployed people in obtaining a mainstream job.</P>
      <P>The programme consists of the following distinct options:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Part-Time Integration Option:</i> which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining mainstream employment <Col N="261" /> would be enhanced by participation on the programme.  Not more than 10 per cent of participants can be retained for further periods beyond the initial year by sponsors under this option.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Part-Time Job Option:</i> which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with poor employment prospects.  Participants on the part-time job option have an annual contract of engagement for twelve months and, subject to availability of places, can have their contract renewed for up to three years.</P>
    <P>Under the CE programme, public sector and voluantary organisations are grantaided by FÁS in respect of sponsoring a CE project and they in turn benefit in a secondary way by being able to carry out worthwhile work which they could not otherwise undertake.  Suitable projects would be those that can be shown to respond to a clearly identified community need and which also develop the work skills of participants, thereby enhancing their prospect of mainstream employment.</P>
    <P>As CE has become very popular with both sponsors and unemployed persons and is presently operating at capacity level relative to available resources, it is not possible for FÁS, all of the time, to accommodate all sponsors seeking project approval, or all persons seeking a place on the programme, or to meet the needs of some sponsors in full.  Nonetheless the provision of opportunities for an average 40,000 participants throughout 1996 is very significant and will be of considerable benefit to unemployed persons and local communities.</P>
    <P>Recent changes to the programme were introduced in order to better target CE at the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate very much the opportunities provided for long-term unemployed people by schools, I regret it is not possible to grant schools, or indeed other sponsors of CE, a derogation from the criteria governing the programme as to do so would alter the objective of CE, which is to provide <Col N="262" /> temporary opportunities of long-term unemployed people.</P>
    <P>As CE supervisors are engaged by way of mainstream employment, their terms and conditions of employment are matters for negotiation between each individual sponsor, the supervisor concerned and his or her union.</P>

      <P>The Crafts Council of Ireland was allocated £400,000 under my Department's Vote for this year.  This is the same as its allocation for each of the two previous years.  The funding is drawn down via the Forbairt subhead.</P>
      <P>The council is comprised of 15 persons, ten of whom are elected by the craft sector and five of whom are nominated by me.  The current elected members are as follows: Ms Suzanne May, Mr. Michael McCrory, Ms Breda Haugh, Mr. David Comerford, Mr. Knut Klimmek, Mr. Neil Read, Ms Kaethe Burt-O'Dea, Mr. David Shaw-Smith, Ms Mary Jackson, Ms Bernadette Madden.</P>

    <P>Last year I requested a comprehensive study of the activities of the Crafts Council.

Many of these recommendations have already been implemented or are in the process of implementation.</P>
    <P>One of the main recommendations was that Forbairt, from whose subhead the council receives its Exchequer allocation, should assume direct responsibility for the supervision-performance of the council, subject to overall control by my Department.  Forbairt, which has a representative on the council's board, reports to my Department on developments within the council.  On the basis of reports received to-date, and on the basis of my own direct discussions with the chairman of the council, I am satisfied with the current operations of the council and that the council itself is addressing how it can best meet the needs of the craft sector through its own activities and in association with other development agencies.</P>

Accordingly, there are no restrictions on the spread of slurry from a herd which has been de-populated due to a case of BSE in the herd.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the allocation of milk quota under the second stage of the 1996-97 temporary leasing scheme.</P>
      <P>When I announced the first stage of this year's temporary leasing scheme in April last, I indicated that I would review the situation for the second and third stages based on the outcome of that stage.</P>
      <P>That review has now been undertaken by the milk quota review group. In so doing, account was taken of the factors which affected the level of allocations under the first stage.  The change in the operating rules was one such factor.  However, of far more significance was the fact that the amount of quota demanded exceeded the supply by three times.  A further significant factor was the huge increase in the number of applicants.  These factors, allied with a super-levy penalty last year, and production well in excess of quota to date this year, affected the operation of the first stage of temporary leasing.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the recommendations of the review group, I have decided that, under the second and third stages, total priority will be given to smaller-scale producers.  Furthermore, special provisions will be made within this category for producers who were allocated temporary leasing quota under the first priority category in the 1994-95 and 1995-96 schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also announced details of a further subsidised milk quota restructuring scheme to be operated this year.  As this subsidy is in place specifically for smaller scale producers and new entrants to dairying, this measure will benefit those producers who wish to improve the viability of their enterprise, thereby offering further encouragement to smaller-scale producers to remain in milk production.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of the BSE crisis effective market support measures have been put in place to help the beef industry.  These measures have included the opening up of intervention with the easing of the carcase weight restrictions along with the inclusion of 04 grades.  In addition, the increase in export refunds by 12 per cent since 1 May has boosted exports to third countries.</P>
      <P>The Commission has now decided on the intervention arrangements for September. While I am disappointed that the weight limit has been reduced to 390kg, I am pleased that grade 04 steers remain eligible.  My Department will monitor the adequacy of these arrangements and will seek more appropriate arrangements should this be deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that intervention will not provide a complete solution to the problem.  The opening of third country markets will be a very important factor in underpinning cattle prices in the autumn.  In this regard I am pleased that an Iranian veterinary delegation is presently in Ireland.  I see this visit as the logical and essential next step to reopening the market.  In the case of Libya, arrangements are now at an advanced stage for my visit to that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last week's meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, I secured the continuation of the deseasonalisation premium into 1997.  This measure will encourage an orderly disposal of cattle towards the end of the year and will be an important factor in preventing the development of an autumn glut, which <Col N="273" /> was prevalent prior to the introduction of this premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration has been give from time to time on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to various suggestions about telecommunications prices in rural areas, but this is not regarded as formal assessment in the context of this question.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing a telecommunications service and the charges to customers for availing of that service is, in the first instance, a matter for the board of Telecom Éireann and as Minister I cannot interfere in such matters. My only involvement is in relation to proposals for price increases.</P>
      <P>I have, however, brought the content of the Deputy's question to the attention of Telecom Éireann management and the company informs me that in all respects telecommunications prices to consumers are in fact equal throughout the country.  Connection charges, line and equipment rental fees, call charges for local, trunk and international calls are the same for all customers regardless of their location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost to Telecom Éireann of providing that service is not uniform throughout the State.  Providing a telephone service to the western counties involves a higher real cost to the company than providing the equivalent service in Dublin due to the greater distances involved, a more dispersed population and a mountainous terrain. <Col N="276" /> Despite this, a standard price is applied by Telecom Éireann for telephone installation and tariffs throughout the country, the overall cost of which is not fully recouped by the company in revenue.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, that Dublin customers are at a certain advantage, compared to customers in the west of Ireland, to the extent that they have a higher number of telephones available to them at the local call rate.  This situation of course obtains in all major urban centres.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann are endeavouring to address the needs of customers outside the 01 area in that regard with an ongoing policy of price reductions and adjustment of local call areas.  Customers outside the 01 area have benefited substantially from price reductions in recent years.  For instance, a peak time call from Cork to Dublin cost 34p a minute (excluding VAT) in 1992.  The same call now costs 18p (excluding VAT).  Local call areas in many parts of the country were expanded in 1992 and again at the beginning of this year, allowing access for customers in rural areas to a greater number of telephones for the price of a local call.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors radioactivity in the environment to assess the risk to the Irish population arising from radioactive contamination.  The results of the monitoring programme are published regularly by the institute.  The programme includes measurements of radioactivity levels in the air, on the ground, in live sheeps, foodstuffs and in a range of samples from the seas around Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Irish Sea, the monitoring programme involves the routine sampling and analysis of seawater, seaweeds, sediments, from the Irish Sea coastline and fish and shellfish from landings at the east coast fishing ports. Samples of seawater and sediments are also collected from areas of the Irish Sea from south of Dublin extending to the north of Dundalk Bay.</P>
      <P>The results of the RPII's monitoring programme in 1995 indicate that the radiation dose to any individual in Ireland resulting from Sellafield discharges is small.  However, regardless of any reported levels, the Irish Government continues to find objectionable any radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>These monitoring activities are funded from the Exchequer grant-in-aid payment to the institute and no financial contribution is made by the UK authorities. However, the institute has cooperated with the environment service, Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland and the department of experimental physics, UCD, in studies of the radioactivity levels of the two estuaries of mutual interest &mdash; Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  Both studies showed that the radioactivity levels in the estuaries were of negligible radiological significance.</P>

      <P>Funding in support of projects within the trans-European networks may be sought from a number of EU sources, including the Cohesion Fund and the trans-European networks budget line of the EU Commission. The Cohesion Fund may provide up to 85 per cent in aid to a project. The trans-European networks budget line is much more restrictive, providing support through feasibility studies, loan guarantees or interest rate subsidies, and only providing for direct project support in very limited circumstances. The aid rate for the trans-European networks budget line is normally of the order of 10 per cent.  Further, I should point out that, in general, aid from one EU source cannot be combined with aid from another EU source on the same project.</P>
      <P>Trans-European networks projects in the transport areas for which I am responsible, and for which EU aid has been sought from the Cohesion Fund, include rail network improvement, rail track renewal equipment, Rosslare harbour development, DART extensions and a freight village at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>In addition, assistance from the trans-European networks budget line has been sought for three technical development projects, in the air traffic management area, provided by the Irish Aviation Authority, and designed to improve voice communications services over the North Atlantic region, extend radar coverage to the north-west of Ireland and facilitate the evaluation of ground/air data link messages in the Shannon/oceanic area.</P>
      <P>I should point out that financial assistance for other transport projects both within and outside the trans-European networks, is being sought from the EU Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards trans-European network support for electricity, the ESB has examined the feasibility of an electrical interconnector to the United Kingdom. While there is no technical difficulty in such a connection, the economics are <Col N="280" /> unacceptable.  The most recent estimated costs of an interconnector lie between £370 million and £450 million and there is, at this time, no decision to proceed with the project, or to seek EU assistance.  It is clear from the figures available that a large power station, up to 500MW, could be built and located in Ireland with local value-added and employment here, for less than the cost of an interconnector in the UK.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways requires, <i>inter alia,</i> that the accounts for business relating to the management of railway infrastructure be kept separate from those for business relating to the operation of train services.</P>
      <P>Ireland complies fully with this requirement in so far as the cost of investing in and maintaining the railway infrastructure has been itemised separately in Iarnród Éireann's annual report and financial statements since 1993.  I have no proposals for the institutional separation of the infrastructure and rail services functions within Iarnród Éireann, which is operational under the directive.  However, I am advised that a separate infrastructure division is currently being established within the company which will have responsibility for the maintenance and renewal of railway infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recently published CIÉ annual report for 1995, the cost of providing <Col N="281" /> railway infrastructure was shown as £58 million.  The total State grant to Iarnród Éireann for the year was £97 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's concern about the shipments of nuclear fuel and plutonium through the Irish Sea.  Such shipments are governed by the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuels known as the INF Code.  I consider the INF Code to be deficient in a number of very important respects and I wish to inform the Deputy and the House of the steps which I am undertaking to have them changed.</P>
      <P>Nuclear materials, the most lethal of all cargoes, are at present effectively exempt from the normal rules governing dangerous cargoes.  Many of the basic requirements for dangerous cargoes are noticeably absent from the INF Code. There is no requirement to plan the route or to notify coastal states; no requirement to carry out hazard evaluations of the materials being transported and of the flasks in which they are contained; there are inadequate arrangements in the event of accident for emergency response, for recovery of materials lost or sunk or for liability regime for compensation and salvage.  It is not possible to monitor shipments of nuclear materials unless the Irish Marine Emergency Service is notified of their passage.</P>
      <P>At the International Maritime Organisations' (IMO) Assembly in London last November, my colleague at the Department, Minister of State Gilmore, secured agreement from representatives of the 152 countries in the IMO to adopt Ireland's resolution governing the shipment of nuclear materials and to strengthen the INF Code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's resolution seeks to address the deficiencies in the INF Code.  The resolution instructs the IMO's Marine Safety Committee (MSC) and the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to consider extending the INF <Col N="285" /> Code to include the following: route planning, notification to the coastal state, marking of flasks, protection and salvage plans in the event of emergencies, and the designation of sensitive areas in which nuclear shipments must take place.</P>
    <P>The deputy chief surveyor of the Department's Marine Survey Office represents Ireland on both the MSC and the MEPC.  These committees have been instructed to thoroughly examine Ireland's proposal and to report to the next assembly of the IMO next year with recommendations as to how the INF Code should be strengthened.  I am confident that procedures to strengthen the code will have been considered and prepared in time for the next IMO assembly.</P>
    <P>In view of the concerns expressed by Ireland and supported by other IMO countries a special consultative meeting to discuss the code, in advance of consideration of it by the MSC and the MEPC, was called by the secretary-general of the IMO last month.  Ireland was represented at this meeting by the deputy chief surveyor of the Department of the Marine and the assistant chief executive of the Radiological Protecton Institute of Ireland.  Ireland made a detailed presentation at the meeting calling on the code to be strengthened. There was considerable support for Ireland's position.  The MSC and the MEPC will take on board the views expressed at this meeting when preparing their recommendations for the strengthening of the code.</P>
    <P>On 13 September 1995 an EU Directive concerning reporting arrangements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods (HAZMAT) came into force.  Ireland has requested the EU Commission to expand the definition of &ldquo;dangerous goods&rdquo; to include substances coming under the INF Code.  It has now been agreed that the Commission will prepare as soon as possible a proposal to amend the EU Directive. Such an amendment would have the <Col N="286" /> effect of requiring States to report vessels carrying nuclear materials bound for or leaving Community ports.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will continue to pursue every avenue to ensure that a tough new code governing the shipment of nuclear materials is put in place.</P>
    <P>With regard to warships, naval auxiliaries or other ships owned and operated by a State and used solely on the State's non-commercial service, the position is that they are normally exempt from international conventions regulating marine transport, maritime safety and protection of the marine environment. However, contracting states to those conventions are asked to ensure that exempted ships act in a manner consistent, as far is reasonable and practicable, with the international conventions.</P>
    <P>My Department has raised the issue of the transportation of nuclear weapons by the UK naval service through the Irish Sea with the UK authorities. The UK authorities have advised that they no longer deploy nuclear weapons on board British naval ships but that such weapons may be transported by sea.  They further stated that such shipments do not take place outside UK territorial waters and that safety is of paramount importance wherever nuclear weapons are concerned.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that our existing legislative and inspection regime for safety on car and passenger ferries is in line with, and in many respects exceeds, international and EU standards.</P>
      <P>The Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine operates a strict year-round inspection programme for all ferries using Irish ports.  This programme is designed to ensure strict compliance with national, international and EU safety standards.  The programme also encourages a culture of safety, reliability and best practice.</P>
      <P>Irish-registered passenger vessels are subjected annually to a thorough inspection for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  These vessels are required to be equipped, maintained and inspected to the highest international standards.  Foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports are also inspected regularly in exercise of Ireland's obligation as a port state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a large international dimension to maritime safety legislation which is governed primarily by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and increasingly, the European Union.  The IMO's conventions are the cornerstone of maritime safety regulations throughout the world.  My Department will continue to give the highest priority to introducing <Col N="288" /> into Irish law the IMO's constantly evolving standards for ferry safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Penalties for serious and persistent breaches of fishing law must be tough, effective and consistent right across Europe.  I am seeking greater commitment to a system of maximum deterrents in all member states.  Ireland has a very tough penalty regime by European standards.  Since 1994 a regime of hefty fines and confiscations of nets catch and boats has been available to Irish courts. Experience of the current legislation is kept under constant review and I am always prepared to consider the scope for going further.</P>
      <P>With specific reference to the issue raised by the Deputy, I would point out that the matter of management and control of, and access to, an individual member state's quota is a matter for the flag state and not the coastal state where fishing activity is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> Under existing EU regulations the flag member state has the discretionary power to subject any of its fishing vessels which seriously or repeatedly fail to comply with the law to additional unspecified control measures.  It is not apparent that the penalty mentioned by the Deputy would be consistent with EU law but I intend to use the opportunity of our Presidency to pursue our longstanding agenda to stiffen the resolve of other member states to crack down hard on non compliance where we demonstrate that their vessels are committing serious fisheries offences.</P>
