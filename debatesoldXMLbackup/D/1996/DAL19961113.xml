      <P>It is proposed to take No.6 &mdash; Motion re.  Confidence in the Government (Resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when we can expect promised legislation on the courts service and the prisons service?  The Government has a practice of producing heads of a Bill.  The Minister for Finance stated last night that I was wrong in my assumption and that even though legislation is not listed on schedules A, B, C or D of the Government's proposed legislation to be introduced during the lifetime of this Dáil, the Government has it prepared.  Therefore, I presume the heads of the Bills will be available shortly.  If independent statutory boards are to be set up, will the Taoiseach indicate where the policy units in that regard will lie?  Will they continue to be in the Department of Justice under the same officials or will they be in the independent boards?  If they are to be statutory agencies, to whom will they be accountable?  Will they be accountable to Dáil Éireann or will they be like other State companies, which for day to day matters are accountable only to a board? That would mean that today could be the last debate in this House on the courts or the prisons and in future the Minister for Justice &mdash; if she survives in office following the motion tonight &mdash; and other Ministers will not be answerable to this House about such matters.  I would like the Taoiseach to clarify that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us hear the Taoiseach without interruption.  Questions have <Col N="846" /> been asked.  Let us be courteous enough to listen to the replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation was decided upon, in principle, by the Government yesterday and drafting of the heads of the legislation will now proceed.</P>
      <P>In respect of the prisons agency, the Department of Justice has been working on that matter for the past year.  A considerable amount of work has already been done on it.  The drafting of the heads of the Bill has not yet commenced, but will commence immediately and will be given priority.</P>
      <P>Regarding the courts agency, that was decided, in principle, by the Government some time ago on foot of the receipt of the first report from Mrs. Justice Denham's group.  Yesterday the Government decided to proceed initially on a non-statutory basis with that, but also to speed up the preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate that we should have a Second Stage debate on those two items of legislation this morning, but the Deputy has raised two questions I can deal with comparatively quickly, if the Ceann Comhairle allows me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been proposed in both cases is executive agencies which, in accordance with practice, will be responsible for the execution of policy.  The setting of policy will remain a matter for the Minister for Justice who is answerable to the Dáil for policy matters. Under the Constitution the courts are independent in their judicial function.  Questions on day-to-day operations in the prison system will continue to be the political responsibility of the Minister in general terms.  The detail of the precise answering of questions about individual executive decisions will be dealt with in the legislation.  There would be little point in setting up an executive agency if the Minister was to retain responsibility for everything.  That would mean that every decision, however minor, would have to be checked with the Minister.  The precise balance and the location of the line between the <Col N="847" /> responsibilities of the executive agency and the Minister will be set in the legislation.  The Government would have no difficulty in having discussions at the appropriate committee.  It would welcome representations and be happy to hear the views of the Opposition and others on the detail of the legislation while it is being prepared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good idea but it shows there is no real thinking on the matter and that the decision was taken only yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy will be set by officials in the Department of Justice.  People in the media have been led to believe that the policy unit will be independent.  It will be staffed by officials of the Department of Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has allowed much latitude on this matter but I must dissuade Members from the notion that we can debate the detail now.  A debate is about to ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach used five words, &ldquo;further details will be announced shortly&rdquo;.  He also stated that this agency will be established within a week on a non-statutory basis.  What type of agency will be in existence next Wednesday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is dealing with that matter with all expedition. Policy is set by the Minister and the Government, not by officials.  That will continue to be the case following the establishment of the relevant agencies.  In some instances responsibility for the execution of policy will be retained within the Department and, in others, delegated to the executive agencies which will be independent. The setting of policy is and always must be a matter for the Minister who is accountable to the Dáil for policy matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach knows full well, in the case of statutory agencies, policy and day-to-day matters are clearly defined.  This means that in future there will be few opportunities to hold the Minister accountable to the House.  Every day my colleagues receive letters stating that a matter they wish to raise is a day-to-day matter for the agency concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to anticipate the discussion at the committee but if one takes the position that the Minister is responsible for <Col N="848" /> everything that happens on a day-to-day basis, one does not set up an executive body.  Any Deputy who thinks for more than ten seconds about the matter will understand that.  It would be inconsistent to have the Minister responsible for every day-to-day issue.  Considerable work has already been done in both instances in the Department of Justice and there is a willingness to discuss the matter at the appropriate committee at a reasonably early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Government's decision to establish an independent courts service, it is hard not to be cynical because when I asked the Taoiseach about this matter last Thursday he said it was not relevant to what had happened overnight.</P>

      <P>When will the Government bring forward the proposed reforms to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924?  May I take it that Ministers will still be responsible for the running of their own offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said last week &mdash; the Deputy understood what I said &mdash; is not what she is now representing me as having said.  What I said was that there was no reflection on the existing system of administration of the courts by the courts themselves in anything we were saying or any inquiry we were instituting.  From the Deputy's demeanour, I knew she understood what I meant.  She is distorting in a politically unprincipled way what I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the Taoiseach not in a position to give me a commitment on those matters last Thursday?  What has changed in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I was not in a position to do so was that the Government had not decided the matter.  It decided it yesterday.  It was not possible for me to anticipate Government decisions.  As any Deputy who has served in Cabinet will understand, the Government acts as a collective authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, the matter raised by the Deputy does not require legislation and is being dealt with appropriately. An indexation of fines Bill is at an early stage of preparation and any concerns the Deputy, or others, may have about the matter to which he has referred may be dealt with in the context of that legislation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for general supervision of the agencies' operations and for answerability thereon.  As will be evident from the legislation, it would not be possible to set up an executive agency that would have a degree of freedom if the Minister continues to be responsible for every day-to-day operation because every decision would have to be referred all the way up the line. Deputy O'Dea understands that in those circumstances there would be no point setting up an executive agency.  I have already answered Deputy Ahern on that matter.  There will continue to be political answerability.  I am happy to discuss with the relevant Dáil committee the issue of the agencies concerned and their competences.  The matter will be further open for discussion and appropriate amendment when it is presented to the Dáil, which will be as soon as possible.</P>

Níl an Freasúra i ndáiríre ar chor ar bith.  Dá mbeidís i ndáiríre táim cinnte go bhfanfaidís go dtí an tseachtain seo chugainn nuair a bheadh an Tuarascáil os ar gcomhair agus eolas cruinn or chéard a tharla sa Roinn.  Níl siad ag feitheamh don Tuarascáil sin áfach agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil fhios acu nach mbeidh rud ar bith ann a thaispeánfadh go raibh an tAire ciontach.  Níl sí ciontach agus b'fhéidir gurb é sin an fáth go bhfuil an díospóireacht áiféasach seo ar siúl faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this Minister is completely innocent of any wrongdoing.  That is the view of many speakers who contributed to this debate, although others believe that she should carry the can.  Reference has been made repeatedly to the 1924 Act.  Such references are an indication that we should move forward because times have changed radically since 1924.  I am sure in those days Ministers were on Christian name terms with their staff and the workload was very different.  In 1996 we are trying to maintain a standard that was sufficient in 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept fully that Ministers must be responsible for all political activity, the decisions they make and the ones they do not make, but to hold a Minister responsible for an organisation which has responsibility for the Garda, prison officers, etc. is unrealistic and does not reflect modern times.  In any walk of life people are not required to walk the line if mistakes are made by their subordinates.  That is true also in the newspaper world.  I do not know of any newspaper editor who was blamed for a costly mistake made by one of the correspondents.  A political correspondent would not resign over something that happens to one of his colleagues and that is only right but the same standards <Col N="854" /> should apply to Ministers.  If a Minister is proved to have done something wrong that person must suffer the consequences, but we are talking here about serious mistakes made in the Minister's office.  Those mistakes should not lead to the resignation of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Owen, has done much work since coming into the Department but from listening to Opposition Deputies one would think she arrived into a Department that was purring over like a Rolls Royce after seven years of Fianna Fáil Ministers.  If that were the case she could have sat back and done very little.  I intend to outline some of the measures she has put in place in the Department which prove she has been extremely busy and that a great deal of work was left for her to do.  Previous Ministers talked about what needed to be done but this Minister took action on taking office.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated on the proposed changes to the law on bail and on the introduction of the Refugee Bill, a subject on which I made many contributions in this House when in Opposition.  The recruitment of additional gardaí was not a necessity that arose when this Minister came into office.  She also provided for the automated fingerprint identification system, an important measure when one considers that fingerprinting is vital to our criminal justice system.  Another major achievement on the part of the Minister is the air support unit for the Garda.  The recruitment of 200 civilians to release gardaí from desk duties is to be welcomed also.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had taken over a Department where the work had been brought up to date, the implementation of these measures would not have been necessary.  The Minister has also done great work in regard to crimes against the elderly and victims of crime by providing additional resources for these areas.  The effect of the drug trafficking Bill is that people can be detained for up to seven days which allows the Garda to get as much information as possible.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison was always regarded as a place where people were introduced to drugs. Unlike her predecessors, the Minister, Deputy Owen, has taken on the difficult task of trying to control the drugs problem in Mountjoy, despite the fact that some people have said it is easier to let the prisoners have drugs rather than their rights.  I compliment the Minister on addressing this difficult problem.  Much has been said about prison places.  My colleague, Deputy Dukes, was the Minister who provided for the opening of Wheatfield Prison ten years ago.  It has now fallen to another Fine Gael Minister to continue that work and provide additional prison places.  It is hoped there will be an additional 800 places in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost confidence in the work the Minister for Justice has done.  The 1924 Act is out of date.  The Attorney General has been complimented by some Deputies and blamed by others in this debate.  There is a saying, why keep <Col N="855" /> a dog if you can do the barking yourself?  What is the need for an administrative staff if the Attorney General can not alone give advice but administer all his rulings?  It is grossly unfair to the Attorney General to link him with this affair as it is to blame an excellent Minister for this fiasco.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The first duty of any Government is to protect its citizens: in the home, in their place of business, in the street or anywhere else in society.  This is done through many agencies, such as our excellent Garda and prison service.  A fundamental part of our protection is the courts.  Our predecessors in the House felt that the existing courts in 1939 were inadequate and statutorily established the Special Criminal Court.  It is by its name special.  It removes the right of the accused to jury trial but it was thought important enough to be introduced because our predecessors said they required special powers because of the special threat to our society.</P>
      <P>Since it is special and removes the rights of the accused to jury trial, it imposes special conditions of care on the Government, that is the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice.  I am not the only person who thinks that, it was said by John Kelly in his seminal work on the Constitution when he referred to what Mr. Justice Barrington said about the Special Criminal Court.  He made the important point that the court was a creature of statute and that conditions of its statutes on which its jurisdiction depended must be rigorously and meticulously observed.  Mr. Justice Walsh, referring to the same court, said that the procedure of the Special Criminal Court must be construed strictly because, among many other things, it deprives a person of the constitutional obligation of a trial by jury in indictable offences of a non-minor character which, although an obligation, can also be construed as being a right conferred upon an accused person.  It is therefore vitally important that this court be meticulous in its operations.</P>
      <P>There has been a singular failure by the Minister and the Attorney General to honour their obligations to the people under our Constitution, our laws and court precedent about which I have just spoken.  The Special Criminal Court was allowed to operate illegally for three months.  What has happened goes far beyond a mistake or an error.  It amounts to gross and abject negligence at a time when this Government should be seeking to increase public confidence in the Irish criminal justice system. This latest débâcle only serves to undermine the system and those who operate within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old Latin saying which roughly translates as, &ldquo;Who will guard the guardians?&rdquo;. In this case, the guardians, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, have abjectly failed the Irish people.  Equally, the guardian of the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice <Col N="856" /> should be, and is by law, the Taoiseach.  He has also failed to guard the guardians.</P>
    <P>If there is any need for further illustration of just how bad the communication and failure is, we got it here this morning when we were told by the Taoiseach that the Minister did not tell him of the débâcle and what was going on until nearly 12.30 last Thursday morning.  This is despite the fact that she had various letters, many of which she knew about.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his defence of the Minister, leaving aside that he saved her but eliminated half her Department, claimed that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, does not matter.  The message to the people was that the law does not matter.  It did not suit the Government so it did not matter.  It does not matter because we were told in a 1975 report by a former civil servant, William Smith, that the 1924 Act could not be implemented.  It was on this report that the Taoiseach tried to anchor his defence of his Minister yesterday.  In 1975, when that report was issued, the Taoiseach was in Government and was also in Government in the years 1983 to 1987 and from 1995 to 1996.  For ten years, the Taoiseach led or was a senior member of Government and made many speeches on accountability and the reason the 1924 Act should be implemented.  It was only yesterday, when searching for some shred of defence for his beleaguered Minister for Justice and Attorney General, that he came to the conclusion that William Smith was right in 1975, despite the fact that he did nothing about it for ten years when he was a member of a Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is not whether the Minister for Justice knew about the existence of letters.  What is before us for judgment is the inability of the Minister to run a major Department.  The reality is that the Minister is totally out of touch with her Department.  For example, in July, a letter from Mr. Justice Lynch marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo; was received and she saw it. On 1 August, a Government decision was made to make a change in the Special Criminal Court, something she did not act upon.  On 2 October, a letter came to her Department from the Attorney General which was not dealt with.  On 10 October, another letter marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo; from Mr. Justice Lynch arrived.  Unlike the first one in July, the Minister did not get it.  On 5 November, a further letter came and she did not act on it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of that, there is one issue which has not been mentioned which should be commented upon.  There is a further area where the Minister did not act, where no alarm bells rang or no protection of the public interest was clear in our minds.  After the 1 August meeting of the Government, the Minister, like the rest of the Government, went off on holidays, as she is entitled to do.  On 2 September, when the <Col N="857" /> Government came back, the first item on the agenda would have been the minutes of the previous meeting which the Secretary to the Cabinet would have read.  These would have shown the decision of the Government on 1 August to remove Mr. Justice Lynch from the Special Criminal Court.  No alarm bells rang for the Minister.  No little note was taken to say that she should check it had been implemented or whether work had been done on it.  Absolutely nothing happened on that.  I quote from her speech on Thursday, 7 November in this House. She said the letter of 1 November from the Attorney General:</P>
    <P>...was received in my office on 5 November and I saw it that afternoon on my way to a meeting in Dublin Castle.  I immediately phoned the principal officer in the courts division of my Department and asked him to clarify the situation.  I attended the talks in Belfast yesterday and did not have further contact on the matter until I spoke to the Secretary of the Department later yesterday evening.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>She got the letter.  She felt that her responsibility to the people was met by ringing a principal officer.</P>
    <P>On the following day she went to the North, not Timbuktu.  There are telephones; she did not speak to the Secretary of her Department.  The Attorney General may have travelled with her, but she did not speak to him about this.  Nor did she speak to the Taoiseach.  On her return to Dublin she went to the pictures, received a phone call from the Secretary of her Department at about 10 o'clock and, after midnight, rang the Taoiseach to tell him.  If that reflects the Minister's command of one of the most sensitive Departments of this State, she should leave, and the Taoiseach and the Attorney General with her.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we were told the contents of the two letters from Mr. Justice Lynch.  If the two letters from Mr. Justice Lynch were made public, the two letters from the Attorney General should be made public.</P>
    <P>According to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Ms Geraldine Kennedy, the Minister said no one has yet claimed responsibility.  How about the Minister taking responsibility?  It is she who is responsible under the Constitution for running her Department.  However, the Department has had to be destroyed to save the Minister.  The Minister has been irresponsible but it is the Department that has been relieved of its responsibility.  Rushed decisions never work, and those who reform in haste will repent at their leisure.  As to openness, transparency and accountability, prison doors have been opened. On the one occasion when the Minister should have opened them properly, they have been half opened and now the court hearings of people charged with serious crimes are at risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> Yesterday the Taoiseach likened the relationship between the Attorney General and Government Ministers to that between a lawyer and his client.  That is arrant nonsense.  John Kelly's book on the Constitution states that while the Constitution does not formally declare the Attorney General to be the representative of the public for the assertion or defence of public rights or interests, that aspect of the office, which is of great importance, has always been recognised.  It is not merely a question of the Attorney General being the adviser and the Minister being his client.  The Attorney General is the protector of the public interest.  To meet his obligation to the public, the Attorney General wrote a letter to the Minister.  It may have been appropriate and prudent to write the letter, but commonsense should prevail, and if there was a sense of urgency, he should speak to the Minister and to the Taoiseach to ask them to take action.  He did not speak to the Minister on the telephone or at any of their meetings during that month when he knew what the situation was.  He has failed abjectly to live up to his responsibility as protector of the public interest.  The Government does not seem to be aware of the existence of the telephone.</P>
    <P>There is now the potential, in a habeas corpus hearing next Monday, that the detentions of certain persons could be found to be unlawful.  I do not want to predict that this will happen because I do not want to be involved, as Deputy Eric Byrne was yesterday, in interfering in the courts in informing them that the Government will fall were the court to make the wrong decision.  However, I am entitled to say that because a technical error was made there is a 50:50 chance that people charged with the most serious offences will have to be released.  As happened in the Trimbole case, these people could be released and given a head start down the street before being rearrested.  What cost to the State in embarrassment, expense, etc. if that happened, while the Minister and the Attorney General remain in their posts and the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others support them?</P>
    <P>We have a new interpretation of the 1924 Act from Deputy Spring, the Taoiseach and Deputy De Rossa.  They say they trust one another, that no matter how appalling the failure of a Minister or an Attorney General, the 1924 Act does not matter because John, Dick and Frank trust each other.  They do not mind that under the law the Minister is responsible, because they intend to change the law some time in the future.  I am reminded of the general election in 1977.  People think of the 1977 general election in terms of changes in taxation.</P>

Now we have the nauseating sight &mdash; and surely there is no more nauseating sight in public life &mdash; of the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, the arbiter of public morals, on his return from his wanderings in the desert, pouring forth to the Irish people from the rarefied atmosphere of the mount of selfrighteousness saying, <i>á la</i> Fergus Finlay, that because he says something is right, it is right.</P>

      <P>If it was wrong in 1994, it is wrong now.  If the House were to accept that a Minister would not be accountable to the Dáil without direct culpability on his or her part, the principle of accountability would wither away; without accountability the value of a parliamentary democracy would be fatally undermined.  Those are not my words but the words of the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, now Tánaiste, on 16 November 1994.  If that principle was correct in 1994, it is correct today.  However, for the Government it is not a matter of principle but of clinging together in fear of the people.  They will have to face the people who respect and cherish their laws and Constitution, and I confidently predict they will chase the Government from office as happened in 1977.</P>

      <P>We know and accept that a serious oversight has occurred.  Our task today is to consider ways of ensuring that similar lapses will not happen in the future.  In this regard, I wish to refer specifically to the strategic management initiative, or SMI as it is more commonly known, and to the valuable role which it will play in greatly minimising the risk of administrative error.  I have spoken about SMI many times previously, in this House and elsewhere, and have emphasized the important contribution it can make to continuously improving the overall management of the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must advert, however, to comments in some of today's newspapers.  They do little justice to the time and commitment this Government has invested in the strategic management initiative and the public service renewal programme as outlined in Delivering Better Government on 2 May 1996.  Some of the editorials in today's newspapers are contentious.  It makes no sense to suggest, as they do, that the Civil Service is resistant to change.  It must be borne in mind that the Civil Service is not a single organisation but a confederation of organisations with a complex mandate.  Change on a significant scale in such a context is not easy to achieve.  In my experience and contrary to the view expressed in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, the vast majority of civil <Col N="860" /> servants are amenable to change and welcome initiatives which improve the delivery of service.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on the potential of SMI for addressing the questions which today's debate has raised.  How can we ensure that our administrative structures provide a watertight means of implementing the decisions and policies of Government?  What procedures are in place for reviewing the effectiveness of existing administrative arrangements?  What steps are being taken to ensure that these procedures will continue to be effective?</P>
    <P>SMI contains an emphatic answer to each of these questions.  It sets out a framework for ensuring that the Civil Service employs the most effective management practices, practices which will continue to meet the increasingly demanding needs placed on Government in today's rapidly changing environment.  If pressure of work is an issue or workload is unevenly distributed within a Department or office, SMI provides management with the means of ensuring that alarm bells ring in good time and that necessary corrective action is taken.  In other words, SMI is designed to help highlight potential problems before they arise, not after the event.</P>
    <P>In the context of SMI, a number of Departments, including the Department of Justice, have completed an analysis of how their organisations are run and the steps that must be taken to anticipate problems more effectively. The Government decided earlier this year that each Department and office should publish the resulting statement of strategy.  This will be the first time such statements will be published.  The Department of Justice, for example, intends to publish its statement by mid-December.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Initiative does not stop there.  The majority of Departments are currently developing the SMI process so that it aligns the day-to-day work of the organisation with the objectives and communication arrangements identified in their statement of strategy.  This will not be achieved overnight.  The SMI process will take time to develop.  In recognition of this, and the need to ensure that the process of change across Departments is both comprehensive and well co-ordinated, the Government launched its programme of change for the Civil Service last May.  It was launched by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and is entitled Delivering Better Government.  Some Members of the Opposition and people in the media appear to have forgotten the time and work invested by the Government in this project.  We did not become converts to SMI and renewal of the public sector in the past three days</P>
    <P>The programme contains a number of elements which will impact significantly on the questions raised by events in the Department of Justice. First, it will entail a quality service initiative designed to put in place concerted arrangements <Col N="861" /> within Departments to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that services are delivered to the highest standard and that the needs of those being served are paramount.  Such a quality service initiative will raise the profile of customer needs, thus ensuring that there is a clear focus on, and effective internal arrangements for, delivering a quality service.  In this context the term &ldquo;customer&rdquo; embraces not just members of the public but the Minister and the Government.  It is all too easy to forget that Ministers do not work in a vacuum but must depend on their staff to deliver a high standard of performance.</P>
    <P>The quality service initiative will mean having clearly understood quality standards, rigorous criteria for evaluating the quality and delivery of services and a clearly understood strategy for maintaining those standards over time.  It also means having a system of redress, whereby administrative lapses may be traced back directly to the person or persons responsible &mdash; an important consideration in light of recent events. Given that there are about 30,000 non-industrial civil servants, any improvement in the overall quality of service is bound to yield tangible benefits.</P>
    <P>None of this should be taken as an implicit criticism of the Civil Service and the many thousands who every day give an excellent service to the State.  We all too often overlook this and take it for granted.  As the Taoiseach said on Friday, 99 per cent of civil servants are doing a very good job.  One of the aims of SMI is to ensure that this is raised to 100 per cent and that high standards are maintained across the board.</P>
    <P>Second, Delivering Better Government takes up the question of devolving responsibility and accountability in the clearest possible terms.  It has long been recognised that the framework set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 is no longer satisfactory in defining where responsibility for particular matters lies.  All political parties have long recognised that a Minister cannot possibly be held directly and personally responsible for everything that goes on within his or her Department, and it is ludicrous to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>A great deal has changed in the 72 years since the 1924 Act was passed.  The business of Government has grown out of all recognition.  It is also considerably more complex.  Today's economic and social challenges are ample testimony to how complex the issues facing Government have become.  We also cannot any longer think only of a national dimension &mdash; issues are increasingly global requiring an international response.  Our role in the European Union, which has been significant given our relative size, has added greatly to the business of Government.  The particular commitment of the Department of Justice to its role in the Northern Ireland peace process has added enormously to that Department's workload.  This has resulted in greatly increased demands on Ministers and their Departments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> The day when a Minister or any other single individual could be held responsible for all that is transacted within a Department of State is long gone.  Reality has long dictated this; if Ministers of all Governments had not recognised this reality a long time ago, conducting the business of the State would have ground to a halt.  What we must now do is face up to this reality and bring our outdated legislation into line with what happens in practice.  Legislation must reflect reality.  Until we amend the 1924 Act to reflect the needs of today, we will continue to have these nebulous debates about who is responsible and accountable.</P>
    <P>However, it must be said that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 is a substantial legal instrument which has served the country well over the past 70 years.  Our entire system of governance is based on it.  Drafted by the new Government during the early 1920s, in a time of civil war, the 1924 Act drew together into a coherent structure the chaotic mixture of Departments, offices, boards and agencies through which Ireland had been governed by the British.  Government Ministers and officials at that crucial time in our history worked under immense pressure to mould a legislative basis for democratic Government in the new State which has stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 has not been substantially altered in relation to essential matters over the years.  Most of the legislation directly amending the 1924 Act has been concerned with the creation of new Departments of State as the evolution of the Irish economy created greater and more complex demands on public administration.  The amendment of the Act in 1939, for example, established a Department of Supplies which was charged with the maintenance of essential services and provisions during the Second World War.  After the war, an amendment to the Act in 1946 established the Department of Health and Social Welfare.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956 established the Department of Transport and Power and ten years later a further amendment provided for the creation of the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>However, the pace of change in the economy, in society and in the demands being made of public administration and governance means that we must move now to bring the organisation of public administration more up to date.  This is particularly important in relation to the allocation of responsibility and the arrangements to provide for the accountability of those who exercise authority within the system.</P>
    <P>If a particular Minister or civil servant commits a major blunder, the responsibility should start and finish there.  It is only rational and fair that this should be the case.  It is, and will remain, the Minister's responsibility to ensure that his or her Department has staff of the necessary calibre to carry out the various functions of the Department, but it is unreasonable to expect that <Col N="863" /> every last individual will always perform to the highest standards at all times, especially when under pressure.  Humanly we must make some allowance for a consideration such as this.</P>
    <P>Every Minister must also endeavour to ensure that adequate management procedures are in place to run the Department in both an efficient and effective manner.  To achieve this it is essential to have a framework within which responsibility and authority can be more clearly assigned.  The proposed changes to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, as set out in Delivering Better Government, will take this into account and strike a fair balance between the authority and accountability of the Minister, on the one hand, and that of the Secretary and staff of the Department on the other.</P>
    <P>In October, the Minister for Finance received the approval of the Government to arrange for the drafting of a Bill to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  The Bill will put into law the changes which the Government, on the advice of a high level advisory group, has decided are needed to bring about modernisation and improvement in the organisation of the central Government.  In particular, the new Bill is designed to provide for the allocation of responsibility and accountability within the various Departments of State.  Essentially this will require the establishment of a new management structure for the Civil Service.  The details of this were set out in Delivering Better Government published in May of this year.  The Bill is intended to give effect to a new framework for devolving authority, responsibility and accountability from Ministers of the Government to secretaries of Departments of State.  The new legislative proposals will enable a further devolution of responsibility within a Department.  Under the secretary of a Department, those who manage the business of a Department will be provided with the necessary authority and will be required to account for the exercise of their powers and duties.</P>
    <P>Third, Delivering Better Government addresses a wide range of staff management issues, in particular, performance management. Any system of performance management must give a fair and balanced assessment of individual members of staff, set out suitable incentives to motivate staff, and where necessary apply sanctions to those who perform consistently below standard.  I am confident the introduction of such a system of performance management will go a long way towards highlighting the existence of areas where the potential for administrative error is unacceptably high.  This will enable management to take any necessary corrective action before errors occur, measures which will be of benefit not just to the Department but to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>However we look at it we cannot legislate for perfection.  Lapses will occur.  Our task is to minimise the risk of such lapses and make it easier to anticipate circumstances in which lapses <Col N="864" /> are likely to occur.  We must ensure that priorities are clearly established and understood, so that the critical aspects of a Department's activities receive priority attention from management and staff at all levels.  The SMI is intended to bring this about, to create a culture in which the end products, the outputs and services produced by a Department, are kept clearly in view at all times by every layer of management.  This should lead to greater objectivity in assessing a Department's performance and to the identification of indicators which provide a timely and accurate evaluation of performance.</P>
    <P>The effective management of performance requires a change in culture and attitudes, not just the introduction of a scheme or a set of procedures.  The kind of culture sought by Delivering Better Government is one which emphasises excellence at all levels, which constantly hammers home the message that the job is only well done when the customer, including the Minister, is completely satisfied.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to lose perspective at a time like this and make the classic mistake of trying to generalise from the particular.  Every situation is different and we must bear this in mind.  No doubt, the inquiry the Minister has put in place into the lapse at her Department will elicit the facts and allow us to assess just how important the lesson is for other areas of public administration.  Whatever the outcome, we must continue to use the SMI process to pursue a broad approach to good administration, a means of inculcating the disciplines needed to ensure a high standard of quality services.  This process relates not just to the public but to services rendered from one part of the public service to another, as well as services to the Minister and to the Government.  This inward aspect of quality service delivery by Departments will not be forgotten.  The SMI and the programme of change set out in Delivering Better Government will take time to implement.  It will also need the support of all parties extending over a period of years.  This means sharing a common vision for the public service and working in concert to achieve the broad range of improvements we all believe are possible.  It also means having a common perception of circumstances such as this, where an administrative lapse, serious as it may be, is not elevated out of all proportion.  Lapses such as these should be seen in perspective, having regard to all the facts and the circumstances in which they occurred.  It is then the task of management to take whatever corrective action may be necessary.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that my reference to improvements and processes, legislative change and the visible assignment and clarification of responsibility and accountability is simply an attempt to portray the situation in the light most favourable to a colleague under attack, an attempt to deflect an attack on a Minister of my party towards persons unknown in the Civil Service.  This is not the case.  My party, in its infant years, gave this State a civil service system based on the Ministers and Secretaries Act which was not only suited to its time but which was <Col N="865" /> preserved and carried into our day enduring values of incorruptibility and non-partisan services to Ministers and the public.  I was proud to have been chosen by the Taoiseach to spearhead its renewal and to refocus the energies of its personnel in a manner which would best serve the public needs of our time and of the future.  I reaffirm my commitment to that task.</P>
    <P>What has caused this discussion today would appear to be a fall in some quarter from the standard of performance which we have come to expect and which we are entitled to expect from our civil servants.  It may well be that the fault lies in the system or the culture in which the error occurred rather than with an individual civil servant.  I have no wish to institute or participate in a witch hunt.  That offers no solution but I see nothing wrong with putting in place a new legislative framework which makes clear to each and every civil servant what is expected of them in terms of job performance and what is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I accept the Government we replaced had signalled clearly its acknowledgement that changes were needed in the way our Departments and offices did their business by setting in train the SMI.  In so doing it did a service to the State and to its civil servants.  I am sorry to have noted in recent days signs of a retreat from the positive venture by those across the floor.  I too spent time in Opposition and I know how difficult it is to forgo an opportunity to wrongfoot a successful Minister and how in the heat of political conflict we can all forget shared interests.  In the pursuit of the Minister's reputation some of those opposite have lost sight of one interest that all Members must share: the need of our people at a time of challenge to have an efficient, effective and accountable public service and to have a clear vision of the role and responsibility of the individual politician who shapes policy for each Department.  Whatever short-term benefit the Opposition may gain from doing so, it does no service to the State or to the Civil Service to gloss over the fact that the problem we are discussing highlights the lack of clear partition between those activities which a Minister personally directs, and should be liable to account for, and those which are or should be performed by others as part of their normal tasks.</P>
    <P>There is a clear determination among the Opposition Front Bench Members to use the doctrine of ministerial accountability as a means of personalising the blame for this debacle and directing it towards the Minister, Deputy Owen. This can be based on only one of two approaches. First, that the Minister, like all Ministers, must carry the can to the ultimate degree for every error or performance failure in her Department. Their presence on the Opposition benches and dread of remaining there for another term has given the Opposition an interpretation of that doctrine which it did not live up to in Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the Ministers.  The difference lies in the fact that the Minister involved was not one of theirs.  The second approach could be that on which Deputy O'Malley based his point on <i>Questions and Answers</i> on Monday that the Minister, Deputy Owen, by not having in place in her private office a system which prevented letters being mislaid or failure to respond being detected, failed adequately to perform an essential managerial function of her office.  I have not inquired into arrangements the Minister had in place but my experience as an office holder has taught me one lesson.  An incoming Minister or Minister of State does not dismantle or disimprove office systems already in place.  If this is seen as an offence warranting the Minister's resignation what does it say about her Fianna Fáil predecessors who presided over the office from 1987 until 1995?  I do not believe in splitting hairs or resorting to abstruse arguments to define or redefine the meaning of the term &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A Minister is responsible for a Department but this cannot be taken to imply complete knowledge of everything that transpires within its walls.</P>
      <P>The Opposition made great play of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and its application in this case.  However, it has repeatedly failed to say what precisely the term &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; means or can reasonably be expected to mean, in all circumstances in which it applies.  Its argument over the past few days suggests that such a definition is possible.  It cannot come up with a definition, because such a definition is not possible.  We cannot isolate responsibility and accountability from the context in which it occurs.  Neither can we divorce it from common sense.  If this whole saga shows anything, it shows that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, needs to be urgently amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how tightly the legislation is drawn it will still need to be interpreted in a broadminded and common sense fashion, having regard to the circumstances applying in each instance, by spelling out in more explicit terms than at present the respective powers and lines of accountability of all key players, Ministers, Ministers of State, ministerial advisers, programme managers, Secretaries of <Col N="867" /> Departments and heads of offices as well as individual and teams of civil servants.  The proposed legislation will make it significantly easier to determine where responsibility for a particular function or activity lies.  It will also make it easier to apply sanctions in proven cases of maladministration.</P>
    <P>The number of civil servants against whom the ultimate sanction of dismissal is taken runs at an average of about three per year.  These are rarely for inadequate performance.  I do not see the rate of dismissal as a yardstick of the Government's commitment to enhancing the performance of individual civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Our approach will involve better methods of recognising merit and clearer statements of objectives, as well as improving monitoring and training.</P>
      <P>Seen in this light, the Government's programme of change for the public service will go a long way towards improving the operation of Government Departments.  The Government is strongly committed to achieving results in this area.  Significant steps have already been taken in relation to the lapses in the Department of Justice.  As the Taoiseach announced to the House yesterday, two new agencies will be set up to oversee the courts and the prison services. Both will be independent and permanent agencies operating on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Contrary to misinformed comments in the national press, the idea of creating such agencies has not arisen out of the blue but has been in gestation for some time.  I attended a meeting of senior management in the Department of Justice on 5 June this year to review their Strategic Management Initiative, at which the specific initiatives were discussed as part of their overall SMI programme.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the risk of lapses such as that which occurred in the Department of Justice will be greatly minimised.  The public and this House can rest assured that decisive and far-reaching steps are being taken by the Government to enhance the overall standard of management of the Civil Service, to ensure that staff at all levels are aware of their responsibilities and are competent to carry them out.</P>
      <P>I stress my complete and unqualified confidence in the Minister for Justice, her capacity to oversee the effective implementation of the change programme within her Department and to put any necessary structures and procedures in place to ensure the full range of functions of her Department are satisfactorily carried out by the officers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a happy coincidence that my contribution follows that of the Minister responsible for the SMI.  The Minister referred to <Col N="868" /> our difficulty in defining the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.  I refer her to what the man who threw the lifebelt to the Minister in the last couple of hours, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, said on 16 November 1994: &ldquo;At the outset I have to say that semantic distinctions between responsibility and culpability, however interesting they might be in their own right, do not meet the needs of this case&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste still has difficulty defining the word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; two years on.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is responsible for the SMI programme, which she seemed to suggest we had gone soft on.  We have not.  The second report of the SMI to which the Minister referred, under the framework for authority and accountability, refers to the arrangements proposed for allocating authority, responsibility and accountability to the various levels of the system in more detail.  As regards Ministers, it states that the implementation and monitoring of policy is in their remit.  A Minister is also responsible for the co-ordination of issues, specified by the Government, which transcend departmental boundaries and which require high level political input to achieve solutions under the direction of the Government.  The Minister and the Attorney General have neglected their duties under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which the Government is proposing to amend and which we agreed to.  However, they are equally going against the spirit of the SMI, which it is proposing to put in place.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  She will still be responsible for what goes on in her Department, regardless of whether this document is implemented.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to Delivering Better Government.  She also referred to sanctions.  There are sanctions &mdash; against everyone else except the Minister.  She will apply sanctions to those who perform consistently below standard.  These are apt words in the case of the Minister for Justice and in that of the Attorney General, who was involved in the Brendan Smyth affair six months into office.  On 16 November 1994, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton referred to the then Taoiseach as knowing when he rose in the House that he was not giving a full explanation yet still went ahead.  The Taoiseach is not endeavouring to blame his private secretary for not having drawn this matter adequately to his attention.  When it suited the Taoiseach, he was not long getting rid of Matt Russell and blaming an unfortunate civil servant.</P>
      <P>We should not be expected to believe that what happened here as regards the Special Criminal Court is nothing more than an administrative mess.  Anyone peddling this spin is counting on the lack of understanding the general public have of Cabinet procedure.  It is arrant nonsense.  It is obvious that those trying to peddle this view, particularly those in Cabinet, are being less than honest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indisputable that the fingerprints of the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General are <Col N="869" /> very much on this issue from top to bottom.  Both were at the Cabinet table when the decision was made.  Consequently, when their attention was drawn to the issue, which in the case of the Attorney General was in late September and early October, they should have known the dire consequences of their inaction.  Yet, the Minister for Justice, and particularly the Attorney General, moved without any sense of urgency. Judge Dominic Lynch made repeated requests to the Minister to be removed and wrote three letters, including that of 2 July but none was responded to by either the Department or the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister brought forward a memorandum to the Cabinet regarding the removal of Judge Lynch on 1 August.  When such a decision is made, as is normal in Cabinet decisions, the Minister subsequently briefs the Secretary of her Department.  Did she properly brief the Secretary of the Department in relation to what went on at the Cabinet that morning?  It is obvious that the secretary to the Cabinet took the required notes of the decision because it subsequently appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  It seems it was only as a result of the Attorney General's letter of 2 October, that the Department began to move on this issue, even then with total lethargy.  All that time, Judge Lynch was sitting on the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>There was notification in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> there was obviously a rumour going around the Four Courts and the Law Library and the registrar of the Special Criminal Court would have been in daily contact with Judge Lynch, who must have been aware of the proposed changes.  It is possible that Judge Lynch continued to sit on the Bench knowing that a decision had been made but not communicated to him.  Apart from the letter dated 10 October, he put out other feelers.  Given that she has published the two letters from Judge Lynch &mdash; she had to get his permission to do this &mdash; the Minister would shed more light on the issue if she published the letters which passed between her and the Attorney General and any letters or contacts between the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court and the Department about the delay in delisting Judge Lynch and in appointing Judge Kevin Haugh.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy of the Labour Party in this matter is breathtaking.  This is the party which, through its ventriloquist leader, Fergus Finlay, lectured us about accountability and high standards. Even if the roof was caving in on the Government the Labour Party would do all in its power to stay in office.  Democratic Left has thrown in the towel.  In the same way as its leader has demonstrated on numerous occasions that the political existence of Democratic Left is based on one big U-turn, its personnel has shown that it is prepared to accept any misfeasance or malfeasance in order to get into office and stay there.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who lectured us about accountability and said the Government would <Col N="870" /> work behind a pane of glass, is a political hypocrite.  He portrayed himself as a great reformer but the way in which he has dealt with this debate and hides behind the rules at every twist and turn is the total opposite of all he pleaded when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The recent performance by the Minister for Justice on the &ldquo;Six One&rdquo; news was the ultimate in political hard neck.  She blandly admitted that a letter from Judge Lynch had been found in the file and that as she had only been made aware of this before she went into the Dáil she did not have the full facts.  This is reminiscent of events two years ago when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and his Government were put under the cosh.  The only difference in this case is that the Labour Party is not calling for a head &mdash; it has run out of options and has nowhere else to go.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, recently accused Members on this side of the House of sleepwalking.  She does not have to look any further than the Government benches to see people sleepwalking.  The Minister for Justice and the Attorney General have been sleepwalking since 1 August last.</P>
    <P>The Government is a sham and has forfeited any right it had to govern.  It is time its members did the honourable thing and accepted that the security system, its first and foremost duty, is an absolute shambles.  Deputy Owen has yet again surpassed herself as a hapless and hopeless Minister.  The Attorney General, the State's senior legal adviser, has shown that his attention to detail is not as it should be.  He has failed in his duty as legal adviser to the Government in that, apparently, he did not immediately inform the Taoiseach of the dire consequences of the non-delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch when he first heard about it on 2 October and subsequently read about it in the papers on 1 November.  Why did he not make his own inquiries on 2 October and read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, which I presume he receives?  Why did he not check the position with the Special Criminal Court or speak directly with the Special Criminal Justice on the phone?  Last night the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, said he had no responsibility for these decisions but I would refer him again to the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been blindly oblivious to the gravity of what has happened.</P>

It is also the case that this Government would not have been formed without the Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, who brokered the deal between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  At that time the Taoiseach would not talk to the Tánaiste and the Attorney General's house was used as a brokering hall for the negotiations.  The Taoiseach is prepared to put his loyalty to the Attorney General and the <Col N="871" /> Minister for Justice before the common good.  He was warned previously about their inadequacies, yet he passes these off as part of a learning curve. Fianna Fáil has a good history in the Department of Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there can be no learning curve when one is dealing with the security of the State.  There is no place in the Department of Justice for inexperienced people.</P>
      <P>Late last week the Tánaiste made a pragmatic and strategically inspired statement in support of the beleaguered Minister for Justice and almost overwhelmed her with kindness by suggesting that she was achieving unprecedented success in the fight against crime and in putting criminals behind bars.  These comments show how out of touch the Tánaiste and the Government are with the reality of the crime problem.  Of course, it is important to understand that the Tánaiste is rarely in the country &mdash; we got a brief glimpse of him this morning and we might see him later tonight before he leaves again.  The statements made by the Tánaiste in Moscow and Cairo are as transparent as the Government, whose members do not know what is going on outside the House.  The Labour Party will kick to touch at the end of the debate on the pretext of waiting for the results of the administrative inquiry.</P>
      <P>Ministers must be competent and capable of handling their briefs.  They must lead, take responsibility for their decisions and abide by the law of the land as set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  As regards the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, the least we can expect is that the Government will not damage public confidence in the ability of the judicial system to deal with people accused of heinous crimes.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste lectured us about standards in public life and set out his standards of accountability in a pious manner, irrespective of the reasons for the fall of the last Government. Given the lofty high standards set out vainly by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in November 1994, what has brought about the Tánaiste's change of mind and why is he less philosophical about such matters now than he was in 1994?  The crude answer is that despite the pretence and media hype to the contrary the Tánaiste and the Labour Party were not being philosophical in 1994 but rather were being cynical and pragmatic and were utterly without principle.  They have been forced to show the hypocrisy which has characterised the Labour Party since it first went into Government. The policy decision they made in 1994 was that come hell or high water they were going to screw the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and his Government, and they found a great opportunity in Brendan Smyth to do so.</P>

      <P>As a result of inaction by the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice alleged criminals are being brought before courts which are not properly constituted.  The Minister and some of her apologists obviously raked through the files in the Department of Justice and gave examples of previous cases, but they did not find a case relating to the Special Criminal Court. There are decided cases which indicate that everything in regard to the Special Criminal Court must be meticulous as the court is set up under statute and not under the Constitution; in other words, a person brought before it does not have a right to have the case heard by a jury, as happens in the case of courts set up under the Constitution.  The decided cases in regard to the Special Criminal Court state that everything has to be 100 per cent above board.  The Attorney General knew this when he wrote his letter on 2 October.  He knows better than anyone else what the decided law of precedent is in this regard, yet he wrote a letter which he did not follow up and, apparently, he did not talk to the Minister.  I would like to have both the Minister and the Attorney General here to find that out but, of course, we will not get the letters from the Attorney General and the Taoiseach will not let him appear before any committees.  Despite all the nice words about accountability to committees, in the Brendan Smyth case the Taoiseach would not let the Attorney General appear.</P>
      <P>If any of the 16 are successful with their writs of habeas corpus, if the courts decide that any of the 16 should be released on a technicality as a result of the negligence of this Government, or if any of the 16 claim damages as a result of this negligence, will the Tánaiste continue to support the three people responsible for this mess &mdash; the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General and the Taoiseach &mdash; or will he continue to put the interests of his party before the integrity of the Government?</P>
      <P>Inquiries have their merit and I respectfully suggest to the Minister that they are not a fig leaf for everything that has gone on in her Department for the last two years.  Inquiries can only have merit if they are allowed to report. After the debacle last May with regard to the Duncan extradition case the Minister said she would set up an inquiry and promised that it would report quickly, but we are still waiting for that report.  We still do not know the facts but some poor, unfortunate garda was sidelined.  That is the answer &mdash; blame the worker.  Democratic Left and the Labour Party, which profess to be defenders of the workers, are trying to screw them at every opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> This inquiry is irrelevant because within 24 hours of the Minister's announcement of it, the Taoiseach said that no matter what happens he would not accept the resignation of the Minister for Justice.  The Taoiseach accused us yesterday of prejudging the inquiry but he prejudged it within 24 hours of it being set up.  In any case, the importance of an inquiry is secondary to political responsibility for the gross negligence involved.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister publish all the letters, including those she quoted verbatim in her speech of yesterday?  We want to see these letters for ourselves.  It would be appropriate for a committee of the House to see the full file which would not be a very big one.  Is that possible?  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice are duly constituted members of the Government.  They are responsible to the House for their conduct in office.  They have abused that trust and, in the process, have called into question the whole system of justice.  They have brought it into disrepute not only by the standards they set for themselves in 1994 but also by the laws of decency and propriety.  They must forgo their offices.</P>
    <P>The credibility of Government must be beyond the call of any one man or woman.  After the recent debacle, to use the Minister's own word, she, the Attorney General and the Taoiseach have no alternative but to resign.  By doing so they would at least salvage something of the integrity of Government and public office.</P>
    <P>I propose the following questions and perhaps when the Tánaiste is winding up we may hear the views of Mr. Finlay on them.</P>

      <P>Will the Government publish the Attorney General's two letters addressed to the Minister for Justice?  How did the assistant secretary in the Department of Justice become aware that a serious problem had arisen in the courts division regarding Judge Dominic Lynch's delisting?  The Minister stated that a letter was waved in her face as she was rushing into the Dáil late last Thursday.  Surely, in view of the fact that the Government Chief Whip had, late on Wednesday night, decided on a debate and had contacted me at 9 o'clock the next morning about a debate, the Minister and her Department had all day on Thursday to look at what, in effect, was a very small file.  The Minister tells us, however, that it was waved in her face as she was rushing into the Dáil.  It is also the case that when the Minister ordered an immediate investigation in her Department on the Tuesday there were at least two full days for her to find out about this letter.  Will the Minister publish all the correspondence and details of contact between the registrar of the Special Criminal Court and her Department?  Something stinks to high heaven in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> For the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, to suggest that the Attorney General has no role in all of this is a disgraceful attempt, for political reasons, to airbrush out his constitutional and statutory duty. The Attorney General may not have an obligation regarding the implementation of a Government decision but once it was drawn to his attention that a serious problem existed in the court, he had a duty &mdash; not only as legal adviser to the Government but also in his role as guardian of the public interest &mdash; to ensure that the matter was put right.  He blatantly did not do so.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Minister for Justice and others to resign in these serious circumstances has set a precedent which makes a sham of the doctrine of collective and ministerial responsibility.  Accountability in the political lexicon will have to be replaced by the doctrine of political survival, whatever the cost to the public.  The Government has redefined the meaning of accountability.  As far as it is concerned, all it needs to do is come into the Dáil and give a speech with as few facts as possible. Accountability means taking responsibility for matters that are under one's control.  Neither the Minister nor the Attorney General has accepted responsibility in this case.  Shame on them.</P>

      <P>The public wants one question answered here today, which is, when will the Government be allowed return to the tasks it has set itself and continue adding to its growing record of achievements?  There is no doubt that the Opposition has seized the issue regarding the termination of Mr. Justice Lynch's membership of the Special Criminal Court as a means of trying to cloud the genuine progress secured on a wide range of fronts by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you are dumped out of office in disgrace, as Fianna Fáil was, because your partner in Government has lost trust and you find yourself on the Opposition benches looking on enviously at good Government in action, the chances are you will grab at anything to improve your lot in life.  Let us be honest about it, the mood of the Fianna Fáil Party is far from happy.  It is seeing at first hand, through the mutual trust and respect <Col N="875" /> between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, just how a partnership Government should do business.</P>
    <P>We are all in agreement that the failure to inform Mr. Justice Lynch of the termination of his position on the Special Criminal Court was of great seriousness.  The Minister and the Government are treating it seriously.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the issue in simple terms.  As soon as the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, learnt of the situation involving Mr. Justice Lynch she acted.  No one could have acted with more speed or have set in train more quickly the independent inquiry which will establish the real facts.  The Minister, Deputy Owen, came into the Dáil to provide the facts of which she was aware. At no stage did she attempt to dodge the issue or mislead the Dáil.  She faced facts and took decisive action.</P>
    <P>The Justice ministry is probably the toughest brief in Government and there are no hiding places for the faint hearted.  Fortunately, in Deputy Nora Owen we have a Minister with a strong heart and the energy to get things done. Let us look at her record and contrast it with that of her predecessors.  Under Fianna Fáil the issue of new prison spaces was fudged and placed on the back burner while the country cried out for something to be done to end the revolving door syndrome.  The public was fed up complaining that criminals convicted in the courts and finally removed from the streets were back on those very same streets, often in a matter of a few weeks or even days.  Under the Minister, Deputy Owen, the State is embarking on one of the most sustained prison building programmes ever undertaken. Limerick Prison is being expanded, a new prison is being built in Castlerea &mdash; the first prisoners will be moved there shortly &mdash; and planning is well advanced for a new 400 place remand prison at Wheatfield.  We all know the importance of having somewhere to remand prisoners, particularly at a time when the electorate is being asked to change the bail laws.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in power paid lip-service to the need for real money to be spent fighting crime. Under the Minister's stewardship more judges have been appointed, more gardaí have been recruited and a real effort has been made to make our streets safer for decent, law-abiding citizens. Yet, Fianna Fáil &mdash; catapulted out of office &mdash; has the brass neck to put up billboards promising to put all criminals behind bars.  Under Fianna Fáil, the only bars the criminal fraternity saw were lounge bars.  For Fianna Fáil, the road from Government Buildings to the Opposition benches was its road to Damascus.  It was only on that fretful, sad and sorry journey it finally saw the light.  The only legacy left to the Irish public after eight years of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice was a criminal justice system stretched to breaking point.  We had eight years of inaction, inertia and criminal neglect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> Opposition is good for Fianna Fáil.  In Opposition crime is its major policy platform.  In its eight years in Government, nothing was achieved.  It is only two years in Opposition and crime is flavour of the month, but it is too late. Its eight years in power left a sour taste in the mouths of the Irish public.  Fianna Fáil did nothing when decisive action was required.</P>
    <P>After its journey on the road to Damascus, its Justice spokesman is crying like an old testament prophet in the wilderness, but he has been crying crocodile tears.  He should, of course, be crying tears of regret because a golden opportunity to stem the rising tide of crime was not seized when his party was in Government.  An effective Government partnership is now in place and a vital element of that Government team is an innovative, active and reforming Minister for Justice who has, in two years, achieved more than it attempted in eight.</P>
    <P>It is astounding that no one from the Opposition side had the good grace to give the Minister a scintilla of credit for the excellent and reforming work she has done.  It is as a team player the Minister has shown her real strengths. She understands how partnership Governments work, the need to reach agreement and consensus and what it means to take effective action and to be accountable.  From the day of her appointment as a Minister she has been accountable &mdash; accountable to her colleagues in Government but, most importantly, accountable to this House.  She has been forthright, open and honest.</P>
    <P>I understand why Fianna Fáil clutches at straws and froths at the mouth.  The Minister is active where it was idle, effective where it was incapable and radical where it was deficient.  It is time for the Opposition to stop the play-acting and get off the roundabout of rhetoric.  The public wants the Government to concentrate on the business of running the country.  It wants action on two fronts &mdash; crime and the economy.  The Minister is tackling the major issue of crime.</P>
    <P>Under this Government, through the prudent management of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, the economy has never been stronger. Innovation and enterprise are being rewarded. Job creation is at an all time high.  This Government is working well, based on a true spirit of partnership, mutual respect, co-operation and solidarity.  It will not be deflected from implementing its policy programme by personalised, vindictive assaults on any of its members.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been exposed for what they are &mdash; naked political opportunists, rabid in their pursuit of power.  The Government is cohesive and successful.  We still have work to do and we intend to get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the words &ldquo;natural justice&rdquo; have been missing from the contributions of Opposition Members in this debate.  It appears the concept of natural justice is unknown to members of Fianna Fáil and the <Col N="877" /> Progressive Democrats.  Natural justice determines that the inquiry should proceed and that action by way of questions or debate should take place when the inquiry concludes.  That Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats should proceed with a motion of no confidence in the Government without reference to the inquiry or the concept of natural justice is an indication of their cynicism.  During the debate there has been much talk about ministerial and constitutional accountability and Parliament's right to information.  I ask Members to reflect on those concepts.</P>
      <P>We should examine the parliamentary democracy in our neighbouring country, given that our parliamentary practice and procedure were, in the main, borrowed from them.  In this regard, it is worth considering the comments of Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, the former Home Secretary in the UK, who dealt with the question of ministerial accountability as against the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, when a Minister should resign and the obligation on a Minister to answer questions.  Those matters are at the core of the current controversy.  Sir David stated:</P>
      <P>Where an action has been taken by a civil servant of which the Minister disapproves and has no prior knowledge... then there is no obligation on the part of the Minister to endorse what he believes to be wrong or to defend what are clearly shown to be errors of his officers.  The Minister is not bound to defend actions of which he did not know, or of which he disapproves.  But, of course, he remains constitutionally responsible to parliament for the fact that something has gone wrong, and he alone can tell parliament what has occurred and render an account of his stewardship.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what the Minister is doing in these circumstances.  She has already taken questions in the House and dealt with them to the best of her ability.  She disclosed the full and detailed information available to her.  She has also committed herself to coming into the House on completion of the inquiry to deal with the matter further.</P>
      <P>Sir Richard Scott, author of the Scott report, showed interesting insight when he spoke of instances when resignations might be warranted at the 1996 Blackstone lecture at Oxford University.  He quoted the following from the evidence of Sir Robin Butler, a Cabinet Secretary, to the Scott inquiry:</P>
      <P>While Ministerial Heads of Department must always be accountable for the actions of their department and its staff, neither they, nor senior officials can justly be criticised for shortcomings of which they are not aware, and which they could not reasonably have been expected to discover, or which do not occur as a foreseeable result of their own actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Scott then went on to deal at some length with Parliament's access to information, the point currently being addressed by the Minister. Proceeding with this motion at this stage is nothing more than an exercise in cynicism.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats wish to act as judge and jury before the evidence is even tendered.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service has been criticised by Members opposite and commentators.  It is regrettable there has been both expressed and implied criticism of the Civil Service and civil servants in this debate.  I compliment the sense of duty and public service which has been the hallmark of hundreds and thousands of civil servants who have worked for successive Governments since the foundation of the State.  I reject attempts by some commentators earlier this morning and by some Members of the Opposition to undermine the public's confidence in our public service.  Thousands of Irish citizens have given long and dedicated service in the interests of the people, which is part of an honourable tradition that goes beyond the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about an outrageous suggestion that yesterday's decision by the Government to establish new structures in the administration of the courts and prisons is an attempt to do an enormous disservice to the public servants who have worked in this area for decades.  Their dedicated service will be needed under the new structures proposed by the Government.  We, on this side of the House, have a high regard for the public service and its extraordinary devotion to duty.  It is both inappropriate and improper for anybody, particularly Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, to attempt to use civil servants as cannon fodder in a war of political gamesmanship to blow up this Government.  It was recently suggested that Michael Collins was the spiritual father of the Fine Gael Party.  I can think of no better spiritual father of Fianna Fáil than Guy Fawkes, given its propensity to scuttle Governments every November.</P>

      <P>I reaffirm my full confidence in this Government and in the Minister for Justice whose reforms over the past two years can be contrasted sharply with those of a series of Fianna Fáil Ministers in that Department which moved at a snail's pace.  The real issue in this debate, as far as Deputy Dermot Ahern and his colleagues on that side of the House are concerned, is not what happened last night or last August or October, but what happened this time two years ago.  That is the reason they are now looking for an opportunity to embarrass the Government and to drive a wedge between the three hardworking parties in Government.  Their cynicism and opportunism will be seen as such by the people.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, began his contribution by stating the public wanted one question answered &mdash; when will the Government be allowed to return to the tasks it has set itself and continue adding to its growing record of achievements?  I expect the answer is when the Government returns to governing and stops scoring own goals.  We have had beef, blood and now we have blunder, bluster and obfuscation.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Flanagan's statement about the respect of this House and of my party, in particular, for the public service, I have been a Minister in various Departments over the years and I have nothing but the greatest respect for the public service and the civil servants who worked with me.  I remind Deputy Flanagan that this so-called inquiry is being conducted by a decent, retired civil servant who has dedicated 40 years to the public service.  The inquiry is into the Civil Service and the Minister's lack of action in her Department.  To suggest that it has a legal efficacy or statutory quality which would make it <i>sub judice</i> is nonsense, as is the suggestion that we should wait to debate this issue until that wretched inquiry is completed.</P>
      <P>One thing which will result from the recent travails of the Minister for Justice is that her Department will now be organised to reflect public concern about law and order in our society and about the system by which justice is administered.  It may now be better equipped to meet the escalating levels of all types of crime. Perhaps crime will now be tackled properly, no thanks to the Minister who has had a succession of political and administrative own goals and gaffes.</P>
      <P>I am not making a personal attack on the Minister.  She is a woman of dedication and integrity to whom I had reason to be grateful on a number of occasions.  When in Opposition, the Minister met me in Kigali in Rwanda where she worked with Concern on a voluntary basis.  She was decent to me when I was a Minister at that time.  I appreciate the Minister's qualities.  My remarks should not be seen as a personal attack on the Minister but as constructive criticism of her position as Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure to honour the prison construction programme was followed by a rush to re-implement it in a blaze of publicity with the full support of her Cabinet colleagues &mdash; the same colleagues who ran rings around her at the Cabinet budget meetings and denied her Department the funding necessary to implement the programme promised in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  The escalating crime spiral was met with a sudden rush of judicial appointments and a much needed court construction, refurbishment and upgrading programme.  These were announced in a nakedly political manner to keep the lid on the festering pool of public dismay and the knock-on effects on the Government's ratings in the opinion polls.  It took the assassination of a <Col N="880" /> highly respected and courageous crime journalist to force the Minister to let the gardaí have the resources to do the job they are recruited, trained and paid to do.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with the prospect of a succession of costly and time consuming legal processes to undo the harm caused by the invalidity of the orders of the Special Criminal Court since last August.  The Minister will survive the present exposure of her maladministration if none of the persons affected by the orders made by the invalidly constituted Special Criminal Court evades justice.  However, she will have no option but to fall on her sword if one of these individuals escapes justice because of this mess. Even her colleagues in Government recognise this.</P>
    <P>This reform will cost a great deal of taxpayers' money.  We have no idea how much it will cost and the Minister is not rushing to tell us.  The need for an increase in the level of funding for the proper management of the justice system is a cause of great concern to the Minister's Cabinet colleagues in the spending Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Education.  They see their political future resting on their ability to deliver a selection of goodies to the public at the next election.  However, they now see all the money they had earmarked for a particular vote buying exercise being frittered away on the control of crime.  They do not like it but they have, by the exigencies of the Minister's misfortunes, been forced to spend money on her Department to save her political skin.  All the skill they displayed in snatching away her Department's money in the run-up to the last budget was wasted.  They are probably furious that the Minister succeeded by default in getting the money for her Department which they had so cleverly hived off and have, no doubt, indicated to her that she is on her last chance.</P>
    <P>One might observe that the seeds of the present débâcle were sown at those Cabinet budgetary meetings.  If the Minister had been able then to withstand pressure from her Government, if not her party colleagues, for a bigger and better slice of the financial cake, it is possible that her Department might not have found itself stretched to the limit, as we were told by the Association of Higher Civil Servants and mistakes, such as we are dealing with here, might not have occurred.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the fiasco.  A series of important communications were not shown to the Minister &mdash; that is common case.  We do not know why that was so.  An inquiry has been set up with the stated objective of having a full independent examination of the facts.  We were told, in tones of wonder by the Minister and her colleagues, this is the first for the nation &mdash; a milestone, unprecedented.  We are expected to congratulate the Government and the Minister for her courage, honesty and her readiness to create a precedent.  We are to be impressed by the Government's desire to have everything out in the open.  The reality is that the inquiry was <Col N="881" /> instigated only because the Minister could not manage her Department.  She is obviously lacking confidence in her ability to establish the truth for herself or, worse still, doubts that the public will believe her if she tries.  She hopes that the inquiry will lay the blame at some civil servant's door and that she can shrug her beleaguered shoulders and bravely defend the hapless civil servant in the light of the unprecedented departmental pressure which the crime problem has created.  By then the heat may have died down, some other event will have taken the attention of the public and the media away from her.  After all, if the heat is on someone else, it cannot be on her.  That is the first and only rule of thermodynamics.</P>
    <P>The reforms announced yesterday show one of two things, either the Minister admitted she cannot manage the Department or the Taoiseach and her Cabinet colleagues have decided that for her.  She cannot be happy to cede control of half her area of Government responsibility, in particular, in such an unplanned and unstructured fashion.  Now you see it, now you don't.  That is the message from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Justice.  It is like magic.  She cannot be happy that all this is happening as a direct result of her mismanagement and failure to exercise due political control over her Department.</P>
    <P>I look forward to having the opportunity to examine the etiology of the Minister's plans for departmental reform.  I suspect we will find the stately progress tolerated by her in such matters was rudely and abruptly accelerated by this present episode of misfortune and incompetence.</P>
    <P>The Minister must feel deeply hurt by the lack of support she received from her Cabinet colleagues since she was appointed Minister for Justice.  She must deeply resent the hypocrisy of their stated support for her now the lid has come off the can of worms.  I listened with an increasing sense of unreality to the Minister's party and her Government colleagues cite her achievements as Minister for Justice.  Does the Minister really believe what they are saying about her?  Does she believe she has been a better Minister for Justice than any of her predecessors?  I doubt it.</P>

      <P>If she does, she is not fooling anybody but herself.  That great quality of self-delusion is not reserved for any individual.  It is widely spread abroad and about her community. A fair dollop of that problem rests with the Minister &mdash; the capacity to engage in self-delusion. We are all guilty of it, but maybe on this occasion the Minister is more guilty than most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other times, the Minister would have been asked by her colleagues to consider her position, in particular, if one or other of the parties in Government were looking for an excuse to withdraw from Government.  She might even have gone without a push.  Yesterday morning we heard a familiar tone in the Tánaiste's voice as he <Col N="882" /> was interviewed by Charlie Bird and asked if he supported the Minister for Justice.  The Tánaiste's tone indicated to me that his support was conditional and commensurate with his desire to run the Government to the conclusion of its full term, come hell or high water or the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>We see, with crystal clarity, that the Government is not about to be derailed by mere issues of incompetence or failure to govern. Neither is it about to apply to itself the standards by which its various component parties have purported to judge others in the not too distant past.  At least, we have probably heard the last lecture on openness, transparency and accountability from the Minister and her colleagues.  They are all very quiet on those subjects.  The pane of glass which the Taoiseach so proudly erected, all the better for the public to view the workings of his Government, is now obscured by the list of names of his discredited Ministers and Ministers of State.  It is our job to ensure the public understands what is really going on.</P>
    <P>I express sympathy for the Minister.  As a longserving Member it does not give me any pleasure to see colleagues of whatever party in difficulties. As I indicated to the Minister, there is nothing personal in what I say about her because I have regard and respect for her integrity and her willingness to get on with the job, even in the most difficult circumstances.  Certainly the circumstances are difficult for her now.  I am not critical about her personally, but about her corporate position.  I understand her frustration at the enormity of the task membership of a Government and Cabinet office entails.  I believe her to be an honourable person and have no doubt she is totally committed to her job as a parliamentarian and as a Cabinet member, but it is unfortunate that her best efforts do not appear to have been good enough in the context of her position as head of her Department.  I realise it is a difficult Department.  It is a Byzantine Department surrounded by secrecy.  It is the Department on St. Stephen's Green &mdash; even that makes one shudder.</P>

      <P>I was not there long enough to find out.  I genuinely think the Minister has been unlucky.  We have heard that Napoleon's first requirement in regard to his generals was that they be lucky.  When the Taoiseach appointed Ministers, and that will be the last occasion, he should have asked them if they were lucky. Maybe if the Minister for Justice had told him <Col N="883" /> then she was unlucky she would not be in the trouble she is in at present.  She is an unlucky Minister.  She has been faced with a succession of sticky political and administrative wickets and has said as much in this House.  Despite her impressive and lengthy track record in Opposition, she has failed to come to terms with her brief.  While she is hard-working, enthusiastic and dedicated, it appears she has fallen some distance short of the qualifying mark to hold her present office.</P>
      <P>It mystified me, and I am sure it remains a mystery to other Members, why the Taoiseach did not reshuffle his Cabinet and put the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, into the Department of Justice where he might have been more surefooted. I do not say that to cause embarrassment to the Minister.  I would not want to see her dropped from the Cabinet.  If I were the Taoiseach, I would have transferred her from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health.  If he had done that, maybe he would not be facing the difficulties he is facing now with this unlucky Minister, but so be it.</P>

      <P>He got that badly wrong.  He did not so much get it wrong as make an unfortunate comment about women.  The Minister for Justice will continue to rely on her Government colleagues to keep her in office and they will not risk their positions in Cabinet by forcing her to do what they forced others to do in much the same circumstances not long ago.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, and the unfortunate Deputy Hogan &mdash; two decent men &mdash; bit the dust for far less heinous transgressions than the one the Minister has been found guilty of on this occasion.  She will, probably, stay in office but she has been damaged in the eyes of her colleagues and the public. When we next hear of low standards in high places, perhaps the Minister and her colleagues in Government will have the common decency to blush.</P>
      <P>I like the Minister, although this may not have been reflected in my contribution.  I would not like her to think I think badly of her, if she cares what I think of her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud to give my full support to the motion.  As Minister for Finance for the past two years, I have worked closely with my colleague, the Minister for <Col N="884" /> Justice, in planning and preparing the remarkable programme of reform she has put in place in the areas for which she holds responsibility.  I have been struck by her dedication and commitment not just to managing her Department but to changing it.  Let there be no doubt that Department needs change.</P>
      <P>Deputies who have had experience of Government know the traditions and culture of the Department of Justice do not sit easily in a modernising society.  Despite the undoubted integrity and commitment of its officials and management, there has been a marked reluctance during the years in that Department to keep pace with the development of the crime problem and the necessary measures to tackle it.  Our prisons bear a remarkable resemblance to the prison system that existed in Victorian times except that we did away with the independent Prisons Board in the 1920s.  Our courts have been neglected for decades.  In addition, the treatment we have meted out to so-called aliens has not been in keeping with international standards.  If an Irish citizen was treated in a foreign country in the way we treat foreigners, there would be uproar.</P>
      <P>The Minister has firmly addressed all these issues in the past two years.  Her work has dispelled the cloud of inertia that hung over St. Stephen's Green for far too long.  It was my privilege to work alongside her during the summer when together we assembled the greatest anti-crime package this House has ever seen.  This included, at the Labour Party's initiative, the establishment of a special agency, the Criminal Assets Bureau, with specific powers to take decisive actions against professional criminals and drug barons.  The state of turmoil in the criminal underworld is positive proof of the success of the Government and the Minister.</P>
      <P>More needs to be done, not least in relation to bail.  That is the reason I fully support the Minister's measured and careful proposal to amend the Constitution which will be put to the people on 28 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has done far more: the setting up of the Courts Commission, a long-standing project of my party, has produced a unified effort by all those involved in the administration of justice to establish a proper independent courts service removed from the dead hand of bureaucracy.  The Government agreed to appoint the chief executive of the new body yesterday and legislation will follow.  The long overdue separation of the prisons from central control by civil servants, recommended in the Whitaker report ten years ago and proposed by the Labour Party in the 1992 general election, is in train with a new independent board to supervise developments.  The new Refugee Act, in which the Minister took an active interest when on the Opposition benches, is a comprehensive and humane response to the deep anxiety felt by many citizens of this Republic at the arbitrary way we have traditionally dealt with problems of asylum, and the traditional system of appointing <Col N="885" /> judges by naked political patronage has been replaced with the transparent procedure of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  In all her work, the Minister has been ably assisted by her Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton.</P>
    <P>The recent and almost disastrous administrative failure of one or more individuals will be fully reported to the Government by Messrs Cromien and Molloy next Monday. Deputy Andrews said the inquiry is being undertaken by a retired eminent civil servant. The reason it is being undertaken by Mr. Cromien who intimately knows the procedures of the public service and also by an independent outside consultant, Mr. Edmond Molloy, is to address the concern expressed by the Deputy, although knowing Mr. Cromien I am sure it would not be valid but perception is important.  It is a pity the Deputy was not accurately informed.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for the public service, I am determined that the recommendations of their report for improvements in the delivery of service to Ministers and the public should be fully implemented.  The Minister for Justice is accountable to the House and will satisfy Deputies that proper controls and procedures are in place to prevent a recurrence of this serious administrative failure.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is about to bring before Government the text of the Freedom of Information Bill which will dramatically open up the process of Government to each and every citizen and expose our administration to full scrutiny.  I remind the Fianna Fáil Party that it was unenthusiastic about this proposal being inserted in our partnership programme in 1993.  I find its conversion on this issue welcome but a little hypocritical.</P>

      <P>I am happy to say there is no lack of confidence in the economy by either the public, investors, international commentators or domestic and foreign markets.  I will give the figures for the two years I have been Minister for Finance.  The rate of growth in real GDP in the economy this year is now forecast at more than 7 per cent.  This will be the highest in the OECD <Col N="886" /> for the third successive year.  During the lifetime of this Government there has been almost unprecedented growth in new jobs.  The average net increase in employment this year is projected at about 50,000.  As the Taoiseach said yesterday, this amounts to an extra 1,000 new jobs approximately each week.</P>
      <P>Investment in building, construction, machinery and equipment is essential to provide the basis for future growth in output, incomes and jobs.  The volume of fixed investment is projected to grow by about 9.5 per cent this year helping to give us a firm foundation for continued expansion in the medium term.</P>
      <P>Growth in consumer spending in real terms is forecast at close to 6 per cent this year. Notwithstanding the high growth-high-em-ployment outlook, inflation will remain moderate at about 1.75 per cent on average.  This record growth and employment performance coincides with the maintenance of a general government deficit of about 1.5 per cent, well within the 1996 budget day target of 2.6 per cent.  In this context, it is worth remembering that a general government deficit of 3 per cent is the Maastricht Treaty nominal convergence budgetary criterion which is generating major difficulties for some of our EU partners and, in the case of France, as we witnessed this time last year, trouble on the streets.</P>
      <P>There have been few comparable periods in the history of the State when we have seen such a performance of growth in output, investment and exports, low inflation and the generation of unprecedented numbers of new jobs in the economy.  Output, incomes and jobs are not the only concerns of macro-economic policy.  The performance and management of the public service is a key dimension of the Government's macro-economic policy.  One of the five goals I set out in my first Budget Statement as Minister for Finance was the creation of the most efficient and effective public administration in Europe by the year 2010.  The present difficult circumstances which have arisen in the Department of Justice can properly be raised in the context of this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still believe that this is a realistic goal.  Not only should we aspire to excellence in public administration, we must set ourselves the highest objectives in regard to structures, management and performance in our public administration.  This prize, however, cannot be won simply by wishing for it.  Building a better public administration for the citizens of this State requires a constant drive from Government and the Oireachtas, a continuous commitment and effort from civil and public servants and a willingness to accept and implement change in the way we conduct the business of Government.  It is because the Government appreciates the importance of modernising the machinery of Government that we have seen a greater range, level and diversity of initiatives for public service reform in the past <Col N="887" /> two years than at any comparable period in more than a generation.</P>
    <P>Since the late 1980s the necessity for a prolonged period of budgetary constraints and a number of issues involving certain aspects of public service management &mdash; the problems giving rise to the beef tribunal being a case in point &mdash; gave rise to a fundamental debate at political and administrative levels on questions of efficiency and effectiveness in public administration generally.  These issues have been addressed among an increasing number of public service senior managers.  Within the Civil Service this debate has led to a profound and critical self-examination of roles and mandates of the various tiers of public administration.  Top management in Departments across the Civil Service produced analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of their organisations.  Moreover, the crucial importance of identifying the specific needs of their clients, whether Ministers of the Government or members of the general public, has been increasingly emphasised.  The present position in the Department of Justice reinforces the need for this process of strategic thinking.</P>
    <P>This process of debate and critical self-examination revealed at first a general lack of clarity of specific objectives of many Departments of State.  In developing an understanding of where the key deficiencies in public administration lay it was necessary to look outward towards best practice in organisations beyond the confines of the Civil Service.  Drawing from experience in other countries with similar models of public administration and from large corporate organisations in the private sector, there was a growing realisation at political and administrative levels that a strategic approach was needed and feasible in the Civil Service environment.  It has been increasingly clear that industrial countries across the world are grappling with precisely the same fundamental issues of public service management and reform as we are, even if the specifics of the problems emerging vary from state to state.  This process of inquiry added to the momentum towards a strategic management approach to public service reform culminating in the Strategic Management Initiative, SMI.</P>
    <P>Under the SMI three key objectives were set for Departments and offices.  These are: to make a great contribution to national development; provide excellent services to the public and other clients and make better use of available resources.  Why is there need for these objectives? To understand the thinking underlying the SMI it is essential that we appreciate the contribution which the public service can and must make to the development of the economy and society in general.  The public service constitutes a significant proportion of economic activity and directly employs a substantial percentage of the total number of people at work.  The public <Col N="888" /> service is, in summary, a big player in the economy.</P>
    <P>The OECD report, Governance in Transition, published last year, observed that it has become increasingly clear &ldquo;...that economic and social objectives could not be achieved without the public sector making its full contribution.&rdquo;  I agree entirely with that.  However, the precise way in which the public sector makes its full contribution will vary according to the historical, structural, cultural and ideological factors particular to individual states, and ours is no exception in this regard.</P>
    <P>The structure and approach of the public sector has evolved increasingly towards the continental European model.  Government is both a participant and a facilitator in developing a partnership between employers and trade unions to address high level economic and social policy objectives.  Centralised wage bargaining is one dimension of this process.  This approach helps to build consensus and flexibility in response to general macro-economic policy objectives set by Government.  Under the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and, most recently, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, many of the positive features of the consensus or social market approach have been developed.  Talks are in progress with a view to deepening social consensus even further and agreeing a new programme which will bring us up to the start of the new millennium.  Given this crucial role played by the public service, it is essential that the structures and system of public administration are organised and managed in the most efficient, effective and economical means available.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Initiative incorporates essential elements of the process of modernisation.  It is not enough simply to offer a solution to this one problem which has arisen in the Department of Justice.  What this House demands and what I can give is an assurance that action is being taken to address the organisational and management needs of an efficient and effective system of public administration.  I can give that assurance because the Strategic Management Initiative already incorporates the essential elements of this process of modernisation.</P>
    <P>Work carried out for the Government by the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries set up to oversee and direct the SMI identified a number of service-wide management issues needing to be addressed.  Consideration of these led to proposals for a major programme of change in the Civil Service.  The programme is set out in Delivering Better Government which was formally launched by the Taoiseach in May this year.  The key messages in Delivering Better Government are that the programme of modernisation in the administration of public services will: deliver an excellent standard of service to the various customers of the Civil Service; put in place the appropriate legislative <Col N="889" /> systems, human resource management and financial management systems to support the delivery of services and ensure that authority, responsibility and accountability rest in the appropriate places.</P>
    <P>Work on the implementation of the ambitious programme of change set out in Delivering Better Government is progressing rapidly.  A new co-ordinating group has been established to monitor developments and progress, and key working groups have been set up to develop programmes of action.  Working groups involving senior civil servants and non-civil servants have been set up to develop further the key initiatives.  Frontline working groups drawn from middle managers, clerical and other grades have been established to advise on issues such as service delivery.  In addition, consultative and participative structures are being put in place in each Department and office.  Across the public service at various levels and with the help of outsiders we are addressing this complex and difficult issue.</P>
    <P>Last month the Government approved a general scheme of a Bill to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and it has been sent for drafting on a priority basis.  The changes proposed in the Public Service Management Bill are designed, within the Minister's overall responsibility for administering his or her Department, to provide a legal mechanism which will allow responsibilities and accountability within the Civil Service to be more clearly identified and assigned.  At the same time the ultimate responsibility of Ministers to Dáil Éireann, their position as head of their respective Departments and the authority for determining policies, priorities and the allocation of resources will be preserved.</P>
    <P>The draft Bill provides for a new management structure reflecting the key elements proposed by the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries and approved by the Government.  It includes provision for the devolution of authority, responsibility and accountability from Ministers to Secretaries of Departments of State, particularly in relation to day-to-day management.  Within Government Departments the Bill also provides for the devolution of responsibility and authority down through the various layers of administration so as to ensure that public service administration is carried out in the most effective and efficient manner.  In essence this means that there will be a clearer identification between individual officials undertaking tasks and their responsibility to account for how those tasks are fulfilled.  Officials in my Department are working with the parliamentary draftsman to make this legislation ready for publication at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Another major Bill is the Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses Bill.  The basic purpose of this legislation is to give Oireachtas committees increased powers of investigation into areas of public concern.  This involves the following separate but related <Col N="890" /> concepts of compellability, privileges and immunities of witnesses.  In essence this means that committees of the Oireachtas are to have the power to compel witnesses to attend hearings and to respond to questioning when they attend.  As committees' inquiries will be quasi-judicial in nature, in the interests of balance witnesses who are compelled to attend are to be given High Court privilege which means their evidence is immune from defamation actions or self-incrimination. This legislation is now awaiting completion of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I assure this House and the public that this Government is working well.  That is self-evident in all the areas to which I have just referred; I could add more to that if I had sufficient time. The reason it is working well is that the three parties are working well together because the three party leaders trust each other and consequently work well with each other.  The Opposition parties do not seem to understand this point.  Perhaps they fail to understand, not having worked well together in the past, how any combination of parties, even those that are clearly different both in historical evolution and philosophical orientation, can work well together. Since the 1970s the Fianna Fáil Party has been riven by internal dissension which on a number of occasions saw a forced change of leadership while that party was in Government.</P>

      <P>It is clear that ministerial accountability and responsibility, the whole system of accountability as we know it is dead. The Government promises to introduce a public service management Bill, which the Minister for Finance has just outlined, but what is the position in regard to ministerial responsibility in the interim, between today and the passage of that Bill?  It seems that from now until the passage of that Bill we have a limbo land in terms of ministerial responsibility.</P>
      <P>We all know things have gone disastrously wrong in the Department of Justice.  The Minister admitted in the House yesterday that the debacle in relation to the delisting of Judge Lynch from the Special Criminal Court was a serious failure.  Her Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Finance, put it even more strongly.  He said what happened was not an administrative error.  He described it as a monumental failure and spoke of a Department in a state of permanent crisis. We now have testimony of this crisis from civil servants.  Despite this monumental failure it seems nobody is prepared to take responsibility for what has happened.  Is a golden handshake to two civil servants to be the maximum level of accountability we can expect from this Government which promises better Government?</P>
      <P>By supporting the Minister for Justice in this controversy the Government parties have in effect accepted an entirely new doctrine in Irish political life, that Ministers are no longer responsible for what happens in their Departments.  What are the implications of that for our democracy?  Who now is to be accountable to the public for the workings of Government as outlined under the Constitution? We are going down a dangerous and confused road.  The Government continues to be confused about this matter; that was clear from the Taoiseach's response on the Order of Business that he is still confused about where the various levels of responsibility start and finish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is giving <i>carte blanche</i> to every Minister to be as negligent as they like and, if they are found out, they will not have to face the consequences.  That situation will apply until the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 is repealed or amended by the Government, and in <Col N="892" /> the meantime we will have a limbo land of ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1924 provides the legal foundation for public administration.  The law is that Ministers are responsible and accountable for everything that happens in their Departments.  If this Government was not happy with this legislation it could have sought to amend or repeal it in a substantial way.  It has neither been repealed nor amended by the Government.</P>
    <P>The rage among Government spokespersons and Ministers is to dismiss the 1924 Act as somehow unreasonable in present day circumstances, something which could in effect be waived or ignored.  That is not the case because it is the law.  The Act confers enormous privileges on Ministers.  In the case of the Minister for Justice it gives her influence over promotions to the top ranks in the Garda Síochána, over the appointment of governors in the prison service and over the elevation of people to the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been quick to dine out on the successes of her Department, which were few, never missing a photo opportunity to launch yet another crime package or announce the provision of additional prison spaces, but she cannot have it both ways.  She cannot continue to enjoy the powers and privileges of her office while seeking to ignore and indeed fly from her duties and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In her contribution yesterday the Minister defined accountability as &ldquo;an obligation to furnish information &mdash; to furnish an account&rdquo;. That is a conveniently narrow definition of political accountability.  Accountability also means paying the account, paying the price when things go wrong.  The Minister's greatest line of defence is ignorance.  This betrays her own ignorance as Minister, or worse, her ignorance of the legal duties attaching to ministerial office. The public cannot have confidence in a Minister whose Department staggers from one crisis to the next to the extent that the word &ldquo;blunder&rdquo; has become synonymous with justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister's catalogue of cock-ups is truly astonishing.  There is no more important Department than the Department of Justice.  It protects the citizen and the democratic institutions of the State.  It deals with the security of the State.  The Minister makes a virtue of ignorance.  She pleads on this occasion as on others that she did not know of the matters which are now controversial.  Does she not see that if this is to be accepted as a principle in Government and as a means of evading ministerial responsibility, it is a prescription for blind and uninformed Ministers?  It is positively dangerous in a parliamentary democracy for Ministers to operate in such a blind and uninformed way.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the roll of shame over which the Minister has presided.  First we had the Brink's-Allied robbery, the largest in the history of the State.  The Minister said the Garda <Col N="893" /> Síochána did not have any prior knowledge that such a robbery was imminent.  It subsequently emerged that it did.  The Minister did not know what was going on.  We then had the Urlingford operation.  The Minister was unaware that what she thought was a major drugs seizure was in fact a Garda sting.  The Minister did not know what was going on.</P>
    <P>We then had the Duncan extradition case.  She was unaware that the crucial extradition warrant had been shredded by a member of the Garda Síochána and she allowed the impression to be given that it was the British who were responsible.  The British Attorney General was asked to resign.  She was the last to hear that a garda had been transferred early on in these events.  Where is the account of the inquiry established on foot of that?  The Minister did not know what was going on.  Then there was the incident in County Wicklow where two convicted criminals serving sentences for serious offences in Shelton Abbey prison were found drinking in the local pub, something which did nothing for confidence in our criminal justice system.  The Minister did not know that was going on.  Then there was the case of the unfortunate Algerian deported by immigration officials in breach of a court order and the Minister did not know what was going on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently turned her sights on the Special Criminal Court with the usual calamitous results.  Put simply, she failed, as Minister for Justice, to ensure that the Special Criminal Court was properly constituted thereby opening up the appalling vista of people charged with the most serious of criminal offences walking free on a technicality.  The Special Criminal Court is arguably the most important and sensitive in the criminal justice system.  It is the front line in defending our State and democracy from the threat of terrorism and subversion.  If the Minister for Justice cannot be trusted to get things right in relation to the Special Criminal Court, then we are entitled to ask what can this Minister be trusted to get right?  It is not as if she did not have adequate forewarning of the difficulties into which she was heading.  She and her Department had notice of the impending calamity from several different sources: two letters from the Attorney General addressed personally to the Minister, two from the judge concerned addressed directly to the Minister, two and possibly more communications from a leading defence lawyer to the Department of Justice and direct communications from the Special Criminal Court to the Department.  Was there a communication with the President of the Circuit Court?  What does it take for the Minister for Justice to be energised into action?</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that, no matter who is responsible or how we examine the paper chase in her Department, it took an incredible six weeks for the Minister for Justice to act on information originally conveyed to her by the Attorney General on 2 October.  The staff in the <Col N="894" /> courts division of her Department spent a month trying to draft a simple letter to tell Mr. Justice Lynch that he was no longer a member of the Special Criminal Court.  The letters to the judge and to the Registrar of the court did not have to be masterpieces.  We are not talking about the letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians but about a letter which had only one thing to say: that Mr. Justice Lynch was no longer a member of the Special Criminal Court.  It took two months before pen could be put to paper and another month to finalise the letters.  All of this resulted in the bizarre spectacle of a midnight operation in which prisoners were roused from their beds, released and rearrested before being rearraigned before the Special Criminal Court.  Through all this saga, as in all the other events, the Minister for Justice did not know what was going on.</P>
    <P>The final chapter of this drama is still being played out in the courts.  Yesterday, we heard on the national airwaves a member of Democratic Left voicing conditional confidence in the Minister which depended on the outcome of the court cases.  If the prisoners walk, the Minister walks, according to Democratic Left.  Do we now have a situation where the fate of the Minister lies in the hands of the judges hearing these cases?  So much for the separation of powers. Meanwhile, Fine Gael Ministers still plead clerical error and allege political points scoring. If a Minister is so unaware of what is going on in her Department, what is the point of having her there at all?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's confidence in his Minister is misplaced.  He is colluding in what might be called the &ldquo;limpet&rdquo; tendency in Irish politics whereby Ministers cling to office for dear life no matter what they have done or failed to do.  The debacle surrounding the delisting of Mr. Justice Lynch has brought the entire criminal justice system into disrepute.  If this is not a resigning matter for the Minister involved, what is?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach announced yesterday that responsibility for the courts and prison service is to be taken from the Department of Justice.  This is not before time.  These are badly needed reforms and the Progressive Democrats has been calling for them for some time.  They are welcome but the circumstances of and motivation for their announcement reflects little credit on this Government.  It is clear, it takes a crisis to stir this Administration into action.  A member of the Garda Síochána, Gerry McCabe, and a much respected journalist, Veronica Guerin, were murdered.  Suddenly the Government was able to bring forward legislation on crime which it had been dithering and fighting over for years.  The Russian ban on Irish beef had to be introduced before the Government announced a new food safety board which should have been in place long ago.  It took unprecedented vigilantism and thousands marching on the streets before we got Operation Dóchas to reform policing in Dublin. It took the tragic death of Brigid McCole and the public outrage at the handling of the Blood <Col N="895" /> Transfusion Service Board scandal for the Government to establish a tribunal of inquiry and for the BTSB to admit liability.  It takes the fiasco in the Special Criminal Court to get a prisons and courts executive.  What was out of the question is suddenly Government policy.  The Government voted against Progressive Democrats proposals for a prison service executive in February of this year.  The Minister accused me then of attacking civil servants in the Department of Justice.  Who is attacking civil servants now?  These reforms were announced by the Taoiseach, not the Minister.  The Taoiseach will today vote confidence in the Minister for Justice.  By his actions yesterday, however, when he whipped half her Department out from under her, he was implicitly voting no confidence in her as Minister. It was as if he said to her that the portfolio was too big for her to handle.</P>
    <P>An independent prison service board is something which is badly needed.  The prison service has a vital role in the fight against crime and if it does not function properly, as at the moment, it greatly reduces the effectiveness of our anti-crime effort.  What is the point of gardaí risking their lives apprehending dangerous criminals and securing convictions against them when we have a system which releases them because of a shortage of space?</P>
    <P>We have a tendency to see all administrative problems in terms of resources.  We believe that any problem can be solved by throwing more money at it.  A shortage of money is not a problem in the prison service.  We spend more than £2 million a week on a system which is not capable of delivering even the minimum security service.  It is a highly inefficient and ineffective system by international standards.  The average cost of keeping someone in a jail is now £900 a week and can be as high as £1,700 a week in some institutions.  This is twice as high as Britain and more than four times as high as some developed countries.  We have more prison officers than prisoners in our jails, yet overtime spending seems to be out of all control.  We spent £75 million on prison service overtime in the last five years which is enough to build two new high capacity prisons.  Last year, one prison officer earned £827 per week in overtime and extras.  The system is a shambles.  It is failing in its duty to protect society yet there has been no accountability for these matters and there will not be any.  Individual prison governors, the Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice refuse to accept responsibility for the mess created.  A total of 197 people absconded from open prisons this year and, I believe, 55 are still at large.  No one is responsible for that.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy O'Dea's Question No. 18 of 16 October 1996, about the transaction of business in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In that reply I indicated that I had been assured by the Director that business in his Office is transacted expeditiously and that this had been borne out in two independent studies.</P>
      <P>The preliminary draft of the Department of Finance Report to which I referred did point to the scope for some improvements of the type which have been suggested for most Departments in the context of the Strategic Management Initiative, notably in regard to training and more extensive use of information technology.  There has been ongoing consultation between the Department of Finance and the Office of the Director on the preliminary report as well as consultation with the Department of Justice and the Chief State Solicitor's office on aspects of it. The final report is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind the Deputy that in my reply to the earlier parliamentary question I stated that the various reports on the State legal offices were under consideration by a group with a view to ensuring that the optimum organisation structure and working arrangements for the State prosecution service and the legal offices generally are put in place.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned at the sequence of events outlined by the Minister for Justice on 7 November last in that there seemed to be much passing of the buck between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General. According to the Minister's statement, personnel in both offices answer questions by suggesting that the matter in question comes properly within the remit of the other office.  Given that since 1974 it is the Director of Public Prosecutions who prosecutes many cases on behalf of the State, does the Taoiseach believe that not only has the Attorney General failed in his duty to citizens by not taking action when the problem in the Special Criminal Court came to light, but that the Director of Public Prosecutions should also have been aware that he was prosecuting cases before an invalidly constituted court?  Is the Taoiseach not concerned about that?</P>

      <P>I dealt with the substance of that in my speech during the debate yesterday.  I made the point then that the implementation of the decision in regard to changes in the Special Criminal Court was a matter for the Department of Justice, the proposing Department, and that any other necessary action flowing from that decision is also, under Cabinet procedure instructions, a matter for the promoting Department.  The inquiry which is currently under way will establish how the problem arose.  That is the fairest way to proceed.  It is best, in the interests of all concerned, that the facts, those already in documentary form and information that may be obtained orally from people giving evidence at the inquiry, should be drawn together in the inquiry and a comprehensive statement made on the matter.  That statement will be available next Monday and the Minister for Justice has indicated that not only will she make it available to the House but she will also be willing to answer questions on it.</P>

      <P>We now know that the Director of Public Prosecutions contacted the Department at 4.30 p.m. last Thursday, almost six hours before the Minister was contacted.  What were the circumstances leading to the Director of Public Prosecutions contacting the Department at 4.30 p.m. last Wednesday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter will be dealt with in the inquiry.  I will give the best information available to me at present; it may not turn out to be all the information there will subsequently be. It is my understanding that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions became aware of the problem at 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 November on receipt of a call from the Chief State's Solicitor's Office.  Subsequent to that, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions contacted the Department of Justice.  Following confirmation of the situation from the Department of Justice the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions took certain steps in regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>The question that will obviously be in the Deputy's mind is what prompted the Chief State Solicitor's office to make this call.  I am not in a position to give a definitive answer.  I can only assume that there may have been contact between the registrar of the court and the Chief State Solicitor's office, because we know already the registrar of the court had contacted the Department of Justice on the previous Tuesday evening about the matter.  My assumption &mdash; I emphasise that it is just an assumption &mdash; is that when doing so the registrar of the court also contacted the Chief State Solicitor's office which, in turn, contacted the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That matter is not one I can confirm beyond all doubt.  If I need to alter or add in any respect to what I said, I will be happy to do so at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>I did not understand from anything that was said yesterday or from anything that the Minister said last Thursday that the inquiry by Mr. Cromien and Dr. Eddie Molloy would examine either the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Office of the Attorney General.  The Taoiseach now says that these matters will be dealt with in the report and that there will be reference to their involvement or non-involvement in these matters.  If I have misunderstood the Taoiseach in that regard perhaps he would correct me, but that is what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of the inquiry invite Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the failure to communicate the Government decision to Judge Lynch and to consider what procedural, administrative or other changes should be made in light of the outcome of the inquiry.  The inquiry arises from the statement of responsibility in the matter which is contained in Government procedure instructions which require the proposing Department not only to implement the decision but also to carry out any other necessary action.  Other necessary action is the responsibility of the promoting Department. Obviously the matter concerned, in a secondary sense, also involves the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the event of the inquiry not adequately covering that matter, it will be immediately inquired into.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference invite the inquiry to make recommendations on all procedural issues that stem from this, whether they are directly within the Department of Justice or on a wider canvas.  In the event of that aspect not being covered adequately it, too, will be inquired into. It is clear there was a serious failure in this area and I do not wish anything I have said to take from that.  It is my hope and intention that the inquiry will be comprehensive, but if a remaining problem is not fully investigated it will be investigated immediately.</P>

      <P>This is useful information for the House in regard to the remainder of the debate today.  It was not in the public domain that the Offices of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions would be questioned and investigated as part of the inquiry.  Clearly they are involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday that those conducting the inquiry are free to talk to anybody inside or outside the public service in pursuit of their inquiries.  The terms of reference include considering what procedural, administrative or other changes should be made in light of the outcome of the inquiry.  That is not limited, in terms of the procedures and administrative or other changes, to any one Department or office. It will be a matter for the inquiry to decide to whom they wish to talk in pursuit of their remit. <Col N="899" /> It is not for me to tell them to talk to anybody in particular, nor would I attempt to suggest that there is anybody to whom they should not talk. They will be free to make that decision in light of the terms of reference that have been published. If any further relevant matter that ought to be inquired into is not inquired into by the inquiry, it will be inquired into later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of clarity and to avoid the Taoiseach being misunderstood for want of my asking the relevant question, he appears to be making it clear that Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy are free to investigate procedures in the Offices of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Both offices were directly involved in last week's débâcle; both were involved in replying to letters and communicating with each other or with others.  It would be impossible to have an investigation that can conclusively deal with this problem or make any suggestions without the inquiry engaging in discussions with the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If the Taoiseach disagrees with that he should make it clear.</P>
      <P>The inquiry will not investigate why the Attorney General did not follow up on the letter of 1 November and why it took him a month to follow up on the reply because those matters were in the domain of the Attorney General and had nothing to do with the courts officer in the Department of Justice, the Private Secretary in the Department or the Minister.  They were the responsibility of the Office of the Attorney General.  This is the first time it has been made clear to me and my colleagues that the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions will be examined by the inquiry.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know if there were any communications between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions on this matter?  If not, does he think the Attorney General should have contacted the Director of Public Prosecutions to alert him to the fact that cases being prosecuted by the State were being heard by an invalidly constituted court?  The jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court includes various schedule offences.  The court has extraordinary powers and functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of such communications?  As he is answerable for the Office of the Attorney General, does he not agree that it would have been correct for the Attorney General, in the context of this important matter, to have communicated directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions either by letter or, in view of the seriousness of the offences concerned, by dealing directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the function of the Attorney General to deal with the administration of the courts or the implementation of decisions regarding the appointment or allocation of judges.  That is a matter for the Minister and the Department of Justice.  Second, the Attorney General communicated his query about the matter in October and subsequently in November to the appropriate sponsoring Minister.</P>
      <P>With regard to the inquiry, the terms of reference of the inquiry contain two elements: (1), to investigate the circumstances surrounding the failure to communicate the Government decision and, (2), to consider what procedural, administrative or other changes should be made in light of the outcome of the inquiry.  It will be a matter for the inquiry to decide whether it needs to speak to the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other officer.  I made it clear yesterday that, as far as I was concerned, Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy were free to speak to anybody to whom they believed they ought to speak to complete their inquiry satisfactorily in accordance with their terms of reference.  I am not saying anything new today but simply reiterating my comments in response to the Deputy's questions.</P>
      <P>With regard to communications with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the appropriate communication with regard to the position and appointment of judges by the Attorney General is with the responsible Department, the Department of Justice.  The Attorney General did that.  I am not aware of any communication between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions on that matter.  The appropriate line of communication about a concern in regard to the appointment of judges by the Attorney General or anybody else is with the Department of Justice which is responsible for the courts system.  Regarding individual prosecutorial decisions by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the handling of particular cases, the Director is independent of the Attorney General in his decision making in that area.</P>

      <P>This matter has been dealt with and is the subject of the inquiry but it has also been dealt with yesterday.  I hesitate to be drawn into any attempt at speculating about the findings of the inquiry in that regard.  My understanding is that the matter was already being dealt with in the Department of Justice on foot of the Attorney's second letter, approximately 24 hours before the DPP contacted the Department of Justice.  While the DPP did contact the Department of Justice after 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, the Department of Justice had already been instituting action to remedy the situation from the previous day, Tuesday, the day it received the second letter from the Attorney General.  I think the inference in the Deputy's question is not correct.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to make available the letters between the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, his correspondence and any relevant correspondence between the DPP's Office and the Attorney General in this matter?  I accept what the Taoiseach has said about the DPP being independent.  Maybe he cannot answer for that office but he is responsible for the Attorney General's office.  We have Justice Lynch's correspondence.  While it seems the Taoiseach does not want me to bring the DPP's office into the matter, it was the DPP's office who contacted the Department of Justice.  A large part of the Minister's statement on 7 November related to the toing and froing, or buck passing, between the DPP's office and the secretary's office.  I contend that the DPP was involved in the various matters dealing with the courts.  The DPP's office has those extraordinary powers of deciding what goes to the Special Criminal Court and what does not go to the Special Criminal Court.  Certainly the DPP's office is engaged in this matter and will be engaged in it from now on with the various cases. Will the Taoiseach, as the person responsible for the Attorney General's office, make available today the correspondence between the Attorney General's office and the Minister for Justice and any correspondence between the Attorney General's office and anyone else, but particularly the DPP's office, on this matter from the period 1 August to 7 November?</P>

      <P>The full text of the correspondence by the Attorney General will be made available to those conducting the inquiry. There are two letters from the Attorney General. One contains legal advice, the other simply conveys a concern or passes on a query to the Department of Justice.  There is a difficulty &mdash; and I have considered this matter &mdash; of establishing any precedent for the publication of the advice of the Attorney General to his client, which is the Government.  Never has any Government published the advice of the Attorney General to it.  I understand there are difficulties with that.  I have not, however, <Col N="902" /> concluded my consideration of the matter and if I am persuaded that there are reasons of an overriding character which would require the publication of the full text of the letters that can be done.  I have already indicated, as has the Minister for Justice, the content of those letters as to their substance.  The letters will be made available to the inquiry so that it can complete its work.</P>

      <P>I know of no precedent where a judge of the Special Criminal Court has not been informed that he was delisted or the new judge informed of his position.  Perhaps that would be valid grounds for the correspondence to be made available.  Since 1974 it is the DPP who prosecutes many cases on behalf of the State.  Does the Taoiseach not believe the Attorney General failed in his duty to Irish citizens, from the time he wrote his first letter on 1 November, to communicate directly with the person who would be engaged in the prosecutions, the DPP?  The Taoiseach has not stated there is no correspondence, he has said he is not aware of it. I ask the Taoiseach to check if there has been correspondence or any contact.  If so, will he make it known to the House?  It may be all right to say that the members of the inquiry, Mr. <Col N="903" /> Cromien and Dr. Molloy, will see this correspondence.  We in this House are engaged in a confidence motion and the correspondence is relevant to this debate and should be produced in the democratically elected assembly, not merely to the two good gentlemen who are doing their best.  This correspondence should be here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three precedents which I quoted yesterday of judges who were appointed by Ministers of the Deputy's party.  In one case the preparation for the appointment of the judge was so badly done that he had to draw his pay for five and a half years without being able to perform his work.  The then Minister did not do the necessary preparatory work before appointing the judge in question.  I gave two other examples of that, all of which were cases where the Minister was a member of the Deputy's party. The then Opposition did not table a motion of no confidence in the Minister on that occasion. There was no inquiry and no disclosure on those occasions.  The Deputy is wrong in making the statement that there are no precedents.  The precedents that occurred when the Deputy's party was in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were more serious and displayed a great deal of negligence on the part of the Minister from the Deputy's party.  Obviously Deputy Bertie Ahern does not view omissions by members of his party in the way he would those of other parties.  There are precedents.</P>
      <P>Second, as regards the matter raised concerning the Attorney General, this question is not about the Attorney General but the Director of Public Prosecutions. As regards the first letter of the Attorney General in early October, I have made it clear that at that time the Attorney General did not believe anything was amiss.  He believed Mr. Justice Harvey Kenny, who spoke to him about the matter, had not been told of a change that had already been made.  The Attorney General assumed it had already been made and the difficulty was one of communication within the court.  It would not have been appropriate for him to communicate with the Director of Public Prosecutions because he was not directly involved.  He communicated with the Department of Justice, who were directly involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any contacts between the Attorney General's office and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Consultations between the DPP and the Attorney General are never made public.  There is a precise provision in legislation for such consultations which are only undertaken on the basis of that legislation and in conditions of absolute confidentiality.  The reason for this legal provision is that the DPP is entirely <Col N="904" /> independent in the performance of his duties. This is an important consideration.</P>
    <P>The inquiry will not be constrained by me if it decides to consult any of the parties concerned, including the DPP and the Attorney General, to fulfil its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated the position regarding the publication of the letters.  The full content of the letters has been made known to the House. There is a question about the publication of any letter containing advice, not because the advice in this instance is of any particular moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but because, to the best of my knowledge, there has not been a precedent for the publication of the Attorney General's advice to any Government.  There is no particular difficulty, other than the one I have identified, about making these letters available.  There is nothing in these letters that would be of concern to anybody but publication would establish a precedent regarding the publication of advice between lawyer and client, in the case of the Attorney General and Government.</P>

      <P>Is the DPP, through the Chief State Solicitor's office, the prosecutor in the 16 cases an issue as a result of this débâcle?  It is strange that the DPP's office from August onwards apparently was not aware of the delisting of Mr. Justice Lynch.  When the Attorney General contacted the Minister for Justice on 2 October, should he not have contacted the DPP's office?  The Attorney General has a function under the Constitution and under statute to uphold the proper administration of the courts as regards public interest.  The Attorney General should have contacted the DPP's office when he first received notice on this matter and he failed in that duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question is valid.  As we know, the delisting of Mr. Justice Lynch was published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and in one national newspaper.  Obviously there are questions as regards whether these publications are read when relevant.  If that matter is not adequately covered in the inquiry, I will be happy to make necessary inquiries to establish what did or did not happen and what ought to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already answered the second part of the Deputy's question, on whether the Attorney General ought to have contacted the DPP in October when he first raised the matter with the Department of Justice.  As I have already explained, when the Attorney General wrote the first letter, he did not believe anything was amiss in terms of substance.  He was working on the assumption that the judge to whom he had been speaking, and with whom he had a comparatively casual conversation as far as this issue is concerned, had not been told of a change that <Col N="905" /> had been made.  It would not be reasonable to expect the Attorney General to contact the DPP on this matter.  It would be reasonable for him to contact the people responsible for the failure to implement the Government decision &mdash; the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The primary question now is why did the Department not act on the original Government decision.  Second, why did it not act on the first letter from the Attorney General, which drew its attention to the issue?  These are matters which the House will discuss next week when the inquiry is completed.  If there are any other ancillary questions which need to be asked, I will have no problem in implementing the necessary inquiries and will report to the House on the matter.</P>

      <P>If I understand the Taoiseach correctly, something is seriously wrong.  Can he confirm I am correct in assuming that the first letter was an inquiry and the second letter contained advice?  Does this not indicate that the Attorney General was aware of a serious problem in the Special Criminal Court?  If he was obliged to give advice, somebody may have asked him for it.  It is extremely unlikely, given that the second letter was one of advice that the Attorney General would not have consulted the Minister for Justice prior to writing it.  If the second letter contained advice, then it betrayed a knowledge on the part of the Attorney General.  If the first letter contained advice that also betrayed knowledge on the part of the Attorney General. The second letter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are all good questions. First, the letter which contained advice was the second letter which was received on Tuesday, 5 November.  There was no advice in the first letter in early October, which was simply an inquiry on foot of a conversation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Attorney General sent the second letter &mdash; this has already been made public &mdash; is that he noticed cases had been heard by Mr. Justice Lynch, he was concerned he had not received a reply to his previous query and that there might be grounds for concern.  At that point he was not aware of the substance of the concern but his concern was greater at that point than it had been at the time <Col N="906" /> of the initial letter.  This is why he offered advice in the second letter about the potential implications, of which we were subsequently made aware.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if the Attorney General offered advice in the second letter because he had been asked for it.  I can state categorically that that was not the reason; he offered the advice because he felt, on the basis of information available to him from published sources, there were sufficient grounds for concern.  He decided on his own initiative and without any request being made to him to advise the Minister for Justice of the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked if, given the nature of the second letter sent by the Attorney General to the Minister for Justice, there should have been oral communication on the matter.  That issue has been dealt with substantially in the debate.  The Attorney General takes the appropriate view that the most reliable and confirmable form of communication is a letter.  Given his concern about the potential seriousness of the matter &mdash; this transpired to be the case &mdash; he chose the most appropriate method of communication, a letter which was sent to the Department of Justice which has responsibility.</P>

      <P>In the first part of his question the Deputy seemed to suggest that the Attorney General knew more than he stated he knew at the time he sent the second letter.  He suggested that because the Attorney General had to &ldquo;compile the advice&rdquo; he, therefore, had to know much more than he said he knew.  That is not true.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's suggestion that that was the case is not true and, therefore, the inference he draws from it is not true either.  My concern is that the publication of any communication containing legal advice would create a precedent which could give rise to a difficulty.  Apart from that concern, I do not have the slightest difficulty with the nature of the legal advice being made known.  It is obvious from what we know about the circumstances of the matter what the nature of that advice would be. The Attorney General's role in this matter is exactly as I outlined it yesterday and any attempt by Deputy O'Donoghue to suggest that the Attorney General knew more than he said he did ought to be withdrawn as it is an imputation of untruth on the part of the Attorney General, which is as unworthy as the direct imputation of untruth on the part of the Minister for Justice <Col N="908" /> which Deputy O'Donoghue made and which I again invite him to withdraw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 139 of 30 October 1996, the response of the UK authorities to the submission made by my Department has been set out in a consultation paper of 28 October 1996, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The UK Government proposes, subject to statutory consultation requirements, to agree to the request to permit the continued export to the UK of certain clinical wastes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister of State mean exactly by saying that the UK authorities propose to accept medical waste &ldquo;subject to statutory consultation requirements&rdquo;?  In view of the fact that the 1 June decision of the UK authorities in relation to medical waste was long signalled by the Department of the Environment in the UK, why did the Department here wait until 4 September to write seeking a derogation for Ireland?  Why did the Government then seek disposal facilities in Holland before the UK authorities had even replied to the Department of the Environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The UK has agreed that while the statutory consultation incorporated into its plan is in progress, which takes about seven to eight weeks, the continued import of some health care waste is permitted for disposal in incinerators in the UK.  The consultation required under statute is not an obstacle to the resolution of this problem which has been resolved satisfactorily.  The fact that there is now access at a competitive rate to other countries for such disposal is a positive factor, not a negative one. We all recognise there was a temporary blip concerning this problem but it has now been resolved satisfactorily.  Perhaps the Deputy will welcome that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that some progress was made because the Minister, the Department and the Government eventually got up off their rear ends and decided they would do something about a problem that I signalled in this House last June.  I certainly welcome that but I do not welcome the fact that six months later we are still trying to resolve the problem and have consultations.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether the instruction from the Government to make an arrangement with a company called Cara has been met by the health boards?  Why was the normal tendering procedure set aside without notice in relation to the appointment of this company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister invited Galway Corporation last month to consider the option of a treatment plant based on alternative technology that would allow the facilities to be built underground on Mutton Island and eliminate the need for a permanent causeway.  The only response to date was a letter requesting that &ldquo;technical reports and costings available to the Minister&rdquo; be also made available to members of the city council.  A reply issued to that letter from my Department on 31 October. This indicated that the advice available to the Minister is that use of alternative technology has <Col N="913" /> permitted plants to be located underground in other cities where particular circumstances point to such a solution.  The letter also pointed out that use of different technology in the handling of sludge could obviate the need for a permanent causeway.  The letter stressed that the Minister's suggestions were not based on any particular technological solution and that he had not suggested that the corporation should adopt any particular company's proposals or technology.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is for the corporation itself to obtain its own professional and technical advice on the different options available, if the alternative approach suggested by the Minister is to be pursued.  It is now a matter for the corporation to decide whether it wishes to investigate fully and pursue the option suggested by the Minister.  In order to obtain tenders from contractors for a design, build and operate project, the corporation would first have to appoint specialist consultants as client's representatives.  They have been assured that my Department will co-operate in every way possible in securing an early appointment of consultants.</P>
    <P>Seghers Engineering NV submitted a study to the Department on the feasibility of providing a waste water treatment plant underground on Mutton Island.  Issues and queries arising from this were the subject of a number of discussions with the company at official level.</P>
    <P>There are generally recognised principles governing the health and safety issues which arise in the construction and operation of a treatment works.  These would have to be fully reflected in the technical documentation submitted to the Department in due course for any alternative scheme at Mutton Island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply of the Minister of State is extremely interesting.  It appears the Minister for the Environment proposed an option of alternative technology to Galway Corporation without having considered its technical details.  Is it true that the option put forward, for political reasons, by the Minister was rejected by the technical people in his Department?  Was he told it is not a feasible option?  The cost originally submitted for the project by Seghers Engineering in April 1996 was £11.34 million and in August 1996 that was revised to £23 million.  The latest information available to Galway Corporation is that the project will cost £35 million and considerably more to operate than the original proposal considered by the corporation.  Is the Minister of State saying the Minister proposed an option to Galway Corporation without researching it?  That appears to be the case from her reply.  I want a specific answer as to whether the technical people in the Department rejected this option before the Minister wrote to the Corporation.  The Minister of State should be careful in answering that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some confusion about the matter.  The Minister did not <Col N="914" /> recommend a specific option to Galway Corporation.  He suggested that the corporation might consider alternative technology, already in use elsewhere, for the project.  The Minister did not recommend a specific alternative technology or system.  In an effort to resolve this extremely difficult problem, he suggested that the corporation might consider examining alternative technologies, not for the site, but for dealing with the sewage and that if it did adopt such an approach he would assist it by designating consultants as swiftly as possible.  It would be the job of the consultants, not the Minister, to assess the possibility of alternative systems, under the guidance of the corporation.  The Minister was trying to assist the corporation by making this suggestion.  It is important to clarify what was proposed.  The Minister did not propose a specific alternative to what is already on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State answer the specific question I asked twice?  Is it true the technical people in the Department of the Environment advised against recommending this system?  Is it true they disowned the system and that the proposal, for political reasons, is being put forward by political advisers to the Ministers for the Environment and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht?  If the Minister did not make specific recommendations about Seghers Engineering, why has it set up a branch in Galway in anticipation of the tender being put forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is beyond my capability to say why a private company would set up a subsidiary anywhere in the world, not to mention Galway. The Minister suggested an approach the corporation could adopt to resolve this problem. He did not assess a particular system.  In his response to Galway Corporation, he suggested an approach for it to consider and on which to seek expert advice.  The corporation must make decisions about the ongoing maintenance and health and safety factors involved in such major infrastructural developments.  Those matters must be considered fully and comprehensively using expert advice provided by the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disappointing that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who has been closely associated with this sad, sorry and expensive saga, is not here to answer these questions.  May I take it from the earlier replies of the Minister of State that neither the Minister nor his Department had information on the likely costings of providing the sewerage scheme underground, without a causeway to Mutton Island?  Even though he did not have such information he made an announcement rescinding his earlier decision to proceed with the scheme and stated he would not fund a causeway to Mutton Island.  Is the Minister indicating that that decision is also rescinded and that he intends to provide funds for the causeway?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's proposal for a treatment plant, based on alternative technology, was prompted by his concern at the increasing difficulties which the corporation's existing proposals had run into and which have the potential to delay the project indefinitely.  The Minister suggests the alternative approach, which he asked the corporation to consider, would meet the principal objections to the existing proposals, while securing the provision of a treatment plant in the shortest possible time.  The advice available to the Minister is that the use of alternative technology has permitted plans to be used elsewhere.  It offers the corporation the possibility to consider alternatives.  The Minister has made it clear he is extremely concerned about the ongoing pollution problems in Galway Bay, that he is committed to the project, including the <Col N="916" /> causeway, and that he will provide an alternative approach should the corporation choose to adopt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question but I did not get an answer.  The Minister does not seem to be properly briefed and is answering questions without knowing the facts.  She said the Minister is committed to the provision of a causeway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from making that comment, the Minister did not answer my question.  When the Minister announced he would not go ahead with the approved scheme, he stated he would not provide funding for the construction of the causeway.  Has that position changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not include this in his Question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it is extremely difficult to answer questions which are not on the Order Paper, no matter how well briefed I am. The Minister has suggested to the corporation that it should consider the alternatives which have been tried elsewhere and which may be of use in relation to this sewage plant.  The Deputy's question extends beyond the Question on the Order Paper.  I will provide him with further information if he requires it, but he must accept that the Question on the Order Paper relates to the corporation's ongoing problem and the Minister's response to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter from the Minister to the corporation mentions the Minister's proposal and the Minister's suggestion.  Deputy Molloy was right when he said the Minister told the corporation it could not go ahead with the approved project and it should consider the alternative.  Perhaps the Minister, who is extremely well briefed, might answer the second part of my question, that is, if he will give details of all the discussions between his Department and Seghers Engineering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in danger of repeating myself.  The Minister proposes that alternative methods should be considered.  That does not mean there is an option on the table, whether it is Seghers Engineering or anyone else.  He <Col N="917" /> suggests that alternative technologies, which may help to resolve the problem in Galway, should be considered.  It is wrong for anyone to believe the Minister has given a commitment in this regard. The Minister has not met Seghers Engineering. Discussions took place in the Department but these will not have any influence on the corporation's position should it adopt this approach.  It is important to separate the two issues because there is confusion, which I hope is not deliberately created.  The Minister has not met this company and does not recommend that its system should be adopted by the corporation. He recommends that the corporation should assess the alternatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to put words in the Minister's mouth but I am sure the city engineer, members of Galway Corporation and the consultants it employed to examine this matter will find insulting the Minister's insinuations that they did not look at alternatives to resolve this issue.  She said the Minister for the Environment did not meet this company.  Did any other Minister meet this company or its representatives at home or abroad in the past six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say whether other Ministers met this company or its representatives.  The Deputy should ask them.  It is wrong to suggest that we underestimate the capability of any local authority to carry out such an assessment.  That is not the Minister's intention or mine when responding to these questions.  We must understand that technology is making advances all the time.</P>

      <P>It has lost its blue flag status and officials from the local authority have said they will soon have to put up no bathing notices on the beaches in Galway and Salthill, which is a major tourism resort.  This Government is waffling and is unable to make a decision about it.  My specific question about the causeway has not been answered, so I take it the Minister will not make money available for it.  Was the Minister aware, when he decided not to grant approval for the approved scheme and when he suggested going underground on Mutton Island without a causeway, that the annual running costs of the scheme would be £0.5 million higher than the approved scheme &mdash; a difference of between £300,000 per year operational costs for the previously approved scheme and £800,000 for the scheme with which the Minister suggests they should proceed?  Who will pay the additional £0.5 million operational costs per year, which would increase with inflation?  Will those additional operational costs add to the burden of service charges in Galway city?  Will they increase the commercial rates in Galway city to a higher level than currently and make it an unattractive location for investment?  The future of our area is tied up with that sewerage scheme.  The Government is prevaricating and is unable to make a decision.</P>

      <P>We have listened to Deputy Molloy, perhaps he would extend me the same courtesy.  As he is aware, a court action is pending in relation to this.  There is a danger of delay which is not of the Minister's making.  He has put forward an approach in a genuine effort to try to resolve problems and prevent delays which are possible if we cannot deal with this issue effectively.  Of course any future maintenance charges are a factor that must be taken into account.  Those who know about the structure of local authorities are aware that maintenance costs <Col N="919" /> in regard to large schemes will place a considerable burden on local authorities in the future.  That factor is being taken into account in regard to the strategy on the funding of local authorities.  We are aware of that problem.  It does not apply only to Galway but has significance there.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy this is an attempt to speed up rather than to slow down the resolution of this matter.  There is no question of trying to slow it down.  He must acknowledge that the Minister has shown commitment to trying to fully resolve the problem.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the answer given by the Minister of State because it is more or less the same as the one we were given last summer.  Urban renewal schemes have been a major success.  Time is an important factor in regard to them.  As the Minister is well aware, a number of large schemes in Dublin are awaiting a Government decision.  One, in particular, on the north side of the city is probably the largest and most exciting private urban renewal scheme in the history of this State.  Those involved in it must be informed of future plans before they can continue with their work under the scheme.  The words &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; and &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; are not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I want the review completed as quickly as possible.  It is almost complete.  The review will be comprehensive.  When I initiated this review I probably underestimated the comprehensiveness of the brief I gave to the consultants.  This is the first time a review on urban renewal schemes has been carried out.  It includes not only the financial implications involved &mdash; the traditional yardstick used for measuring the success of schemes &mdash; but also the architectural and social impact of urban renewal designation.  It is a major review and I am impatient for it to be available into the public arena.  I can assure the Deputy that I am confident that it will be completed in a short time, but I cannot give a date because we are dependent on the consultants.  I assure the Deputy that I am well aware of the concerns regarding a timeframe that apply to certain projects, not only in Dublin city but elsewhere. Difficulties have arisen for a raft of reasons and that has created problems for those developing sites, who are not at fault in that regard.  I am seriously considering that problem and, having worked in the building industry, I assure the Deputy that I am conscious of the need to make decisions in regard to the review at the earliest possible date and I am committed to that.</P>

The Minister said she wants the report to consider not only the financial benefits of urban renewal but other aspects of it, with <Col N="922" /> which I agree.  If we miss the boat or there is a downturn in the property market, we will lose the momentum we have built up and will end up with sites remaining derelict, as has been the case for the past 25 years.  The Minister must act on this matter as quickly as possible.  As the Minister is aware, there is a growing perception that nothing is happening and the people involved in these schemes want to put the plans in place.  Will the Minister ask the consultants to complete the report by a certain date.</P>

While I have undertaken to do this, I have to ensure also that the review does what it has set out to do.  This is the first time that such a review has been carried out.  It should cover all aspects and factors and its findings should inform urban renewal policy, perhaps into the next century.  I am happy that the consultants are working to complete the review as quickly as possible and understand it is at the point of finalisation.  I have made it clear to them publicly that their report should be published as speedily as possible and that the views of those with a particular interest in the matter and of those most directly affected should be taken into account.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have been advised that they may purchase private houses where the cost of the acquisition can be met from the authority's capital allocation and the acquisition represents a cost-effective and economical means by which the authority can meet the housing needs of persons who have been included in the last assessment made by the authority under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, or who have been accepted for inclusion in the next assessment.  The approval of my Department is not required for individual purchases.</P>
      <P>It would not be practicable to issue guideline figures, as suggested, to local authorities in respect of the purchase price of private houses, given the variations in the nature of the needs to be met, the size of houses required and the level of house prices experienced in local housing markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State realise that houses to a value of £84,000 have been purchased?  Does she believe that value for money or social engineering should be the main priority in dispensing taxpayers' money? Realising that most of the houses bought cost £35,000 to £40,000, will she accept that the main aim should be to buy the maximum number of adequate houses rather than going over the top by purchasing houses to a value of £84,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the term &ldquo;social engineering&rdquo;, it is not appropriate to use it in relation to housing policy.  The cost of acquisition is on a par with the cost of building houses.  Value for money is obtained, particularly in cities.  In the Dublin Corporation area, where it is difficult to <Col N="924" /> acquire sites and there are delays in providing houses because of planning procedure, the policy of acquisition has proved effective in meeting the needs of those on the housing list.  I am happy to allow local authorities to make a choice when it comes to housing provision whether they will build or buy, once they have shown they have adopted a reasonable approach, are not concentrating on one particular area and are genuinely seeking a social mix.  Under the local authority housing construction programme there is a complete range of costings across the national spectrum.  It is essential that the housing programme is met by the local authorities providing houses of good quality.  They should promote the concept of social mix so that we move away from the residue of the old policies under which poor quality and cheap housing was provided in large estates.  That day is gone.  There is a cost to be paid in promoting this concept and providing good quality housing but it is money well spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy should be consistent.  It should encourage people at all times to improve their lot.  It is important that we offer a range of housing options.  Is it right that houses are bought for £70,000 and £80,000?  Those who have taken out a local authority loan and are participating in the shared ownership scheme cannot aspire to owning such a house.  They can only dream about owning a house worth up to £55,000.  Does the Minister of State understand the concern, objections and resentment of those who have struggled, often at huge personal sacrifice, to buy a house in a private estate when they see someone else being given the same type of house courtesy of the taxpayer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I wish to put the matter in perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 an estimated 300 houses will be acquired, of which four will be in the price range of £80,000 to £84,000.  It is, therefore, exceptional for a house acquired by the local authority to cost that amount.  Dublin Corporation has adopted an approach, based upon good management, which respects the aspects referred to by the Deputy in terms of acquisition in private estates.  It does not concentrate on any particular estate but ensures a genuine social mix.  I reassure people who may have fears that experience has been there are no problems with this approach.  The corporation has shown that it has managed this system well.  The previous approach to housing policy generated enormous problems, which are ongoing &mdash; I appreciate the Deputy is aware of these.  I ask him <Col N="925" /> for support in this regard because the approach adopted by the corporation is meeting the need in terms of land acquisition and it also has the positive benefit of enabling a social mix in a well managed way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy has my support and that of my party, but it is a case of how quickly the price is reached.  I accept that not many houses acquired cost more than £80,000, but in the last couple of months prices have increased rapidly.  My concern is that people on shared ownership and local authority loans can only afford houses up to £50,000 or £55,000 while local authority tenants are being housed in accommodation costing much more than that. Perhaps what is needed to overcome this problem is improved shared ownership and local authority loans because one option is out of kilter with the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember what housing policy is about.  We ensure that the need is met.  Some years ago there was a vastly reduced social housing programme which led to a great increase in the number of people waiting for housing.  We have an obligation to provide for those people but that does not mean we should provide poor quality accommodation &mdash; I am aware the Deputy does not disagree with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious about social mix, excellence and design we must pay for it.  In providing social housing, whether in the acquisition or construction of houses, the costs are similar.  Local authorities do not acquire inordinately expensive houses &mdash; many of them are good value for money.  If we look at the national figures, three years ago approximately 24 per cent of houses were acquired of the total housing programme whereas this year only about 20 per cent will be acquired.  This is not a new phenomenon.  It is concentrated more in the Dublin Corporation area but it has been part of housing policy and I fully support it.</P>

      <P>How successful is the scheme of purchasing local authority houses in private areas?  Are figures available for the various local authorities of the number of houses that have been purchased in the last year or two?  The figures of £50,000, £60,000 and £70,000 compare favourably with the cost of construction of local <Col N="926" /> authority houses.  What is the current cost of the provision of a local authority house, taking into account the cost of the site as well as construction of the house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to help the Deputy but I do not have the precise figures he requested because they do not form part of the question.  I will, however, do my best to provide the information which he seeks.  It is up to the local authority to determine how it approaches the balance between acquisition and construction. Construction costs, whether in the public or private housing market, have increased.  The present policy ensures good quality housing. There is no question of providing cheap housing, that day is gone.  It is extremely important to ensure that the quality of housing is maintained and that the social mix involved in the various options continues.</P>

      <P>It is proposed shortly to make regulations under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to commence the system of licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency of major waste management facilities. This system will involve high environmental standards and high development and operational costs for landfill facilities.  The need in this context to achieve reasonable economies of scale is likely to bring about a rationalisation of the existing network of such facilities.  However, decisions to close or upgrade landfills, or to develop new landfills, are matters in the first instance for the local authorities or other operators concerned, subject to planning and licensing legislation.</P>
      <P>As regards discussions with local authorities, my Department arranged a seminar on waste management in late 1995, in prospect of the new legislation, which was attended by managers and other senior local authority officials.  This has led, <i>inter alia</i>, to the preparation by a number of local authorities, in some cases jointly, of proposals for waste management strategy studies.  One such proposal, involving grant assistance, has already been approved and assistance in some other cases is being considered.</P>

      <P>There are 120 operational landfill sites at present and the Minister has pledged under the waste management plan to reduce the number nationally to 50 within five years.  Is that <Col N="927" /> still the Government's intention?  Is the Minister in consultation about the location of those sites?</P>

      <P>According to the Environmental Protection Agency national waste database report, there are 118 landfill sites, 87 of which are operated by local authorities and the remainder by private operators.  There is no question of reducing the number to 50 or of the location of new and upgraded landfill sites being imposed by the Department.  The Department simply forecast the likely trend having regard to the diminishing capacity of many of the landfill sites currently <i>in situ</i> and in the context of the higher standards that will apply to landfill sites under national and prospective European Union laws.</P>

      <P>To answer the second question first, the European Commission is expected shortly to introduce new proposals and a directive in relation to landfill sites.  The proposed directive will establish common EU standards for the design, operation, closure and aftercare of landfill sites.  In that context the question the Deputy raised will be considered.  In answer to Deputy McCormack, the strategy studies currently being undertaken by a number of local authorities, one of which is being funded by the Department, will examine all options.  There will be a need for landfill sites in the foreseeable future but alternative disposal technologies must be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke earlier of the impossibility of extracting accountability from this Minister for maladministration in the prison service over the past two years.  Earlier this year I became aware of serious abuses taking place in our prison system.  These were allegations I deemed to be of a very serious nature and because I did not have any opportunity of establishing their veracity I wrote to the Minister for Justice privately on 6 September setting out the facts as I knew them, asking her to inquire if they were true and to revert to me.  Time passed. I did not receive a reply, not even an acknowledgement.  Like others I sent a reminder to the Minister on 25 September.  Eventually, by letter dated 8 October &mdash; almost five weeks after my first letter &mdash; I was graced with a reply in which the Minister accepted the substance of the allegations made and indicated that preventative measures were being put in place to remedy the position in the prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if that is to be the end of the matter. The Minister did not give any indication in her <Col N="929" /> reply that she accepted the gravity of these allegations or the seriousness of the abuse concerned.  She has failed so far to make any public statement on this most important matter and I now invite her to do so.  Clearly the Attorney General and Judge Lynch are not alone in having difficulty getting a quick response, or even an acknowledgement, to letters on serious matters.</P>
    <P>During the past two years we have seen bungling and incompetence in virtually every area within the administrative ambit of the Department of Justice.  The Minister for Justice has political responsibility in the areas of extradition, immigration and the prison service.  I am one of the proposers of the no confidence motion put down in the Minister.  That is not a personal attack on Minister Owen.  It is a gender neutral motion of no confidence in a Minister who lacks the authority required as Minister.</P>
    <P>The Government's confidence motion is, on the other hand, a loyalty motion tinged with brazenness.  It seeks to change the goal posts about ministerial responsibility because it suits present circumstances.  It offers measures which this Government has recently voted down to distract attention from its discomfort.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach promised measures to improve accountability at all levels but he failed to mention inaction and his own U-turn on Cabinet confidentiality.  He failed to mention also the reason the compellability Bill is disabled in Committee, possibly fatally, because holders of high office continue to have fundamental objections, which they have voiced, to being accountable to Dáil committees.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach introduced a spurious concept of lawyer-client relationship as between the Government and his Attorney General.  He failed to acknowledge the independent role of the Attorney General as guardian of the public interest and public protector of constitutional rights.  This is a role independent of the Government.  Is it not a constitutional right for a citizen to be brought before a properly constituted Special Criminal Court?</P>
    <P>We are talking about the Office of the Attorney General which, in 1992, independently injuncted a 14 year old girl leaving the jurisdiction for an abortion with the view of vindicating the rights of the unborn.  The independent role of the Attorney General has been upheld by the courts. This is the office which could act to preserve the confidentiality of Government decisions without consulting the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has promised a tracking system for ministerial correspondence.  Any tracking of this Minister's record, quite apart from her correspondence, reveals a litany of errors and a permanent flight from her responsibilities as Minister.  She is a Minister who does not have authority in her own Department, does not see her urgent post, operates on a need to know basis with disastrous consequences, makes a virtue out of her own ignorance of events crucial to her <Col N="930" /> ministry and to the public interest, and presides over a situation where blunder is synonymous now with justice and where bluster and brazenness replace the honourable course open to her.  This is a Minister in whom confidence has been gradually eroded by her own failures.  The Minister for Justice is in the last chance saloon and, ironically, her ultimate fate now lies in the hands of the courts.  So much for the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>This debate is not about play acting.  It is about a breach of duty by the Minister to manage her Department, to know what is happening in her Department and to carry through the implementation of a Government decision.  She has failed manifestly in these personal, non-delegable duties and I urge Deputies to ignore the Government's confidence motion which is based on bluster and a limpet tendency to hang together come what may.</P>
    <P>Conditional confidence has been voiced, publicly and privately, by some Government Deputies.  They say they want to wait and see what happens in the courts but that if a person charged with serious offences is released because of this blunder, their positions would be different. I urge the House not to support the Government's motion of confidence.</P>

      <P>If he does not arrive I am happy to take the full 20 minutes.  When I come into this House to make a contribution I normally have a prepared script but in essence this is a debate about nothing other than naked politics.  As a politician, therefore, I do not have any difficulty in dealing with this debate or in asserting that it is founded in the opportunism of Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil has not got over the shock of what happened two years ago.  The party is stuck in a time warp and if anyone really believed the collapse of the last Fianna Fáil Coalition Government was the fault of official A, official B, the Duggan case or letters in isolation, they need only read the transcripts of the court case currently taking place in London.  The vitriol shown towards and accusations made against senior Labour Party advisers show the level to which relationships were not only ruptured but were dysfunctional.</P>

Anyone who wants to know why that Government broke up in late 1994 should read the transcript.  That is my comment and my case and they are in order.</P>
      <P>There is an obsession with letters and with who said what and when.  The Minister for Justice deserves the unqualified and unconditional support of this House and her colleagues.  I am proud to be a member of a Cabinet serving with her.  I say, without reservation, that she has conducted herself with admirable dignity although she has been totally and unfairly scapegoated.  She has shown very high standards in public office despite all the unjustified attacks against her.  Everyone knows &mdash; people are saying it in every pub and workplace &mdash; that she is winning the fight against crime.</P>

      <P>On the television, one can see people being arrested in our ports every weekend with boatloads of cocaine, heroin and other illegal substances.  One sees increasing arrests and the discomfiture of drug barons who are being subjected to the full rigours of the law.  A new Garda Commissioner has been appointed and a package of criminal justice reforms implemented. The Criminal Assets Bureau has been set up in a unified way with the Garda, customs and other authorities to ensure the godfathers of crime are tackled.  The Minister's record speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil seems to have discovered crime in Opposition.  What did it do between 1989 and 1994?  It provided a measly 57 extra prison places. The Minister will have provided, by January 1997, an extra 404 prison spaces with the necessary decisions taken to create a further 400 spaces in Wheatfield.  She has given new technology and extra personnel to the Garda and reformed the courts system, with the assistance of the Denham group.  Her record speaks for itself and it is because she was winning the war that the Opposition grasped what was a failure in the administrative system to deal with correspondence and other matters.</P>
      <P>This side of the House is happy to allow the inquiry to find the truth and provide the detailed answers.  Yet again, the Opposition has jumped in to be judge and jury without any inquiry and has found the Minister guilty before the inquiry has even started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate, and the Fianna Fáil approach, arise because that party is unnerved at the total cohesion of Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Labour Party in Government.  We operate on the basis of a professional relationship, mutual loyalty, respect and a sincere desire to do the best for the country and implement our programme for Government.  This debate shows the solidarity of this Government despite the tidal wave of criticism of the Minister, the Attorney General <Col N="932" /> and the Taoiseach.  This Government is standing rock solid and the people know, notwithstanding the naked politics that is taking place, that we are determined to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>That job has never been more important.  The Taoiseach, and other speakers, have outlined the economic progress we are making, the net 50,000 extra jobs, the decline in the tax take and the real growth in spending.  I have heard glib remarks from speaker after speaker about this being the latest debacle, about blood and beef, etc.</P>
    <P>I am proud of my record for the past two years. I defy anyone to go to Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom or the Continent and see the devastation of the beef industry.  We are the largest exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere.  I have secured £140 million in extra compensation from Brussels.  That is on top of a special exclusive deal for Irish sheep farmers last year and the deseasonalisation premium.  I have radically reformed the TB eradication scheme, more than occurred in its 40-year history and it is working well.  I have extended and expanded the disadvantaged areas to help small farmers in greatest need.  I have radically overhauled the milk quota system to introduce clawbacks to stop cheque book farmers taking up milk from small holders.  When I was appointed Minister there were only 350 participants in the REP scheme. There are now more than 22,000.  This year, I got an extra £84 million for my gross estimate.  The list is endless: an extra £16 million for CFP grants, etc.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is all too quick to point to its record on the economy and say that this Administration is only reaping the benefit of what it did.  What about Fianna Fáil's record on the extra cases of BSE, on the hepatitis C scandal and the equality payments?  We inherited those problems from the so-called brilliant Fianna Fáil administration.  The EU beef fines took up much of my time earlier this year when negotiating a mitigation.  I have put in place, and will research, further, the most stringent BSE eradication plan here.  It was unacceptable to me that the meat from depopulated herds was available for human consumption and that the cohorts and progeny were not being taken out.  The acid test of my record in handling the BSE crisis is that, in 1996, the consumption of beef in Europe will be at a historic low &mdash; it has never been lower in the history of the European Union.  In 1996, we will have slaughtered, processed and sold more steer beef than ever before.  Considering the calamity we faced, that is a remarkable achievement.  I look forward to increased prices, to the payment of further compensation and the restoration of supports.  I assure people that as far as agriculture is concerned, notwithstanding that this was the worst disaster to hit European farmers in the past 30 years, we have managed it competently and professionally.</P>
    <P>I understand the frustrations of the Opposition. They have thrown the kitchen sink at the Minister for Justice, but she has come through.  All <Col N="933" /> Ministers are only passing through and no one holds tenure forever.  In five or ten years, it will be shown that the record of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in the Department of Justice was historic and radical.  It will also be shown that she, with distinction, turned the tide against the criminals in favour of the victims with the changes in the bail laws and other measures relating to the courts, prisons and the Garda Síochána.  The House will assert confidence in the Government tonight with solidarity between the three parties which are operating well.  I have no doubt we will get a mandate to continue that work after the next election.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity and am proud and privileged to support the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  If we had had Ministers like her in the past, crime would not be as rampant as it was when she was appointed and gangsters and criminals would not have had free rein to accumulate massive amounts of ill-gotten goods, property and investments.  Listening to the Opposition parties one would think crime began two years ago when this Government come to office.  It was brought to public notice when the Government took over and the drug barons were brought to heel.  As a fine person with a good political background the Minister for Justice has my full support, and she has the trust of the people which is important in the ministry she holds.</P>
      <P>The contributions of the Progressive Democrats Deputies, and particularly of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, deserve to be treated with the contempt with which thousands attending the film &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; viewed Fianna Fáil's advertisement to the effect that Fianna Fáil, the so-called republican party, would deal with drugs when they get back into power.  That advertisement is a joke.  Fianna Fáil is climbing on the back of a great statesman while at the same time stabbing in the back his grandniece who is dealing with crime.</P>

Did they allow him to open the door of his car to make a bid for freedom in a fair fight?  They did not have the courage to do that.  These are the people the fat cat lawyers, the do-gooders and some members of the Fianna Fáil party want to see free on our streets this weekend.  They have no support for that.  Did the people who shot Veronica Guerin in cold blood give her an opportunity to say a final prayer before she went to her eternal reward?  The perpetrators of that crime &mdash; some of them are behind bars &mdash; would seek to have their constitutional rights defended. It sickens me and it sickens decent people.

      <P>I have never made a statement in this House that I could not repeat outside.  I am saying what honest decent people are saying &mdash; 95 per cent of our population.  It is time crime was dealt with.  It is time for all of us to support the person who is dealing with it the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen.  She has the confidence of the people.</P>
      <P>There are tremendous crime problems which I would liken to a nest of wild bees in rural Ireland on a summer's afternoon.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats walked by and did not stir them so they would not get stung.  Deputy Owen did not walk by the criminals.  She has taken the honey from them, the money they took from young people as they peddled their evil wares. She is dealing with them.  They are scattered all over the world.  They are running out of the country.  Their empires are being brought down and peace, honesty and dignity will return to the country under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and under the stewardship of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some regard for some of the members of the Progressive Democrats, and I have a high regard for their Leader, Deputy Mary Harney, particularly in the context of her attitude to the IRA.  She never failed to condemn the IRA outright and I admire her for that.  However, her contribution yesterday, in which she tried to crawl on the graves of decent women who lost their lives tragically to make political points, was beneath contempt.  She tried to vilify the Minister's concern.  Both Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Nora Owen are decent people who would not cause hurt to anybody and <Col N="935" /> they are dealing with the problems as they should.</P>
    <P>As to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to whom I am closer and for whom I have the highest regard, I did not mind in the least Deputy Harney's swipe at the Russian deal &mdash; at least we are dealing with the animal world and we can take that.  However, as in the case of her previous statement, what she said was untrue. The measures that were put in place were in place before the Russian deal, and that deal was done to protect the market.  Farmers know that.  The Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Brian Cowen, knows that.  He got that message loud and clear in Cootehill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has the full support of the farmers and is doing a marvellous job.  The contribution of the Progressive Democrats should be treated in the same way as the offal which caused a problem in agriculture. It should be consigned to the inferno and burned, because it was not worth listening to.  We have major problems, and we hope the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, will remain in office for a further full term to address them.  The people are depending on her to do that.  It is unfair that people with ill-gotten gains should be able to buy freedom, to acquire the best legal brains to defend them and perhaps get off because of a loophole in the law.  That is not acceptable.  If it means amending our laws to deal with the matter, that must be done.  The Minister will have the people's support in doing that, just as the referendum on bail will have unanimous support, and new laws will go some way towards protecting decent people so that they will not be afraid to stay in their homes and leave their doors unlocked as was traditional among old people so that a neighbour could drop in and have a chat. As things are, they have to have locks, chains and bars to protect themselves because nobody was prepared to deal with crime.  Judges seem to think their hands are tied.  I do not accept that.  Judges have sufficient laws to put people behind bars on remand.  Criminals thought they might as well hang for a sheep as a lamb when charged with a crime and set free on bail for anything from three to 18 months under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration.  The people on remand continued to plunder and to beat up old people.  When they came to trial all counts would be taken into account and they would receive one sentence.  That should no longer be the case.  Each felony should be dealt with and penalised and the appropriate term of imprisonment served.  That is what the people want.</P>

      <P>Loyalty is a Roman virtue and I have never condemned it.  However, it left the Opposition with no option but to table a motion of no confidence.</P>
      <P>It is clear the independent inquiry established had nothing to do with the conduct of the Minister and everything to do with locating a public servant who might be deemed responsible for the events that occurred.  There is little point waiting to hear the outcome of an independent inquiry if the Taoiseach announces in advance that the political head of the Department being inquired into is not on the line as far as the matters under investigation are concerned.  That is why we had to bring this matter before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, said a few moments ago that Fianna Fáil was trying to act as judge and jury before the independent inquiry came to a conclusion.  However, the Taoiseach acted as judge and jury because, according to reports, he indicated last Friday that in no circumstances would he accept the resignation of the Minister, even if she offered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was understandable but improper of the Association of Higher Civil Servants to issue such a deplorable statement last Friday.  I was disappointed that not once did the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice or the Minister of State with responsibility for the strategic management initiative and the evolution of our public services, Deputy Doyle, repudiate it.  The statement was a departure from the norm that is supposed to obtain in the administration of public business in <Col N="937" /> this State, that the Civil Service does not intervene in partisan politics.  The independence and impartiality of the Civil Service is a valued asset in the administration of the State, yet the statement issued by the Association of Higher Civil Servants, in effect, supported the Minister.</P>
    <P>That was a sinister development.  It was even more sinister that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the public service neglected to deal with it in their statements.  We talk about the right to silence in our discussions on judicature and law reform.  If we were to draw an inference from the silence of the Government on this statement, we would have to say that the Government was guilty in some way, although I am not suggesting it, and that a civil servant was approached to support the Minister.  I am not making that allegation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is improper for an association of civil servants to issue a political statement of that nature.  Perhaps the motivation for the statement was the fact that the Taoiseach made it clear before a motion was tabled in the Dáil that he would not accept the resignation of the Minister.  It was only natural to assume that the purpose of the inquiry was to isolate one of the civil servants in the Department as the culprit in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made extensive reference to the proposed Public Service Management Bill.  Let us look at the context in which the Bill is being introduced.  The Taoiseach said that judgment of the Minister for Justice must be made in the context of the impending legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, also dealt with the Bill in great detail.  However, the provisions of the Bill do not deal with the circumstances which arose in the Office of the Minister for Justice which have given rise to this controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not propose to devolve the appointment of judges under the Constitution or their assigning to the Special Criminal Court to somebody else.  If their appointment will not be devolved to somebody else, one can take it that the courtesy of informing judges of their appointments will also not be delegated to another civil servant.  Therefore, the main intellectual justification advanced by the Taoiseach, as distinct from the vulgar laughter and abuse of the Fianna Fáil benches in which he engaged yesterday, has no application to the facts of this case.  It is not proposed, I take it, to set up an executive agency to write to judges informing them of their appointments to different judicial <Col N="938" /> offices.  It will remain the personal responsibility of the Minister for Justice to ensure such notifications take place after the enactment of the proposed Bill</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to an extensive reshuffling of responsibilities regarding prisons and the courts.  However, it is not suggested that the new courts service will advise judges of their appointments.  If they do there will be another letter in the chain of correspondence when a judge is appointed to a court.</P>
    <P>I am probably out of line with the views of many Deputies in sounding a note of caution about the number of bodies we are establishing to which we are developing functions which should be administered by Departments of State.  At present there is a guarantee to the citizens of the State that the Minister for Justice is accountable to the House, at least notionally, for the administration of prisons, the operations of the Garda Síochána and the staffing arrangements of the courts.  I am not sure that the proposed changes, which involve the shuttling of responsibilities to various boards, will maintain the degree of control the citizen can exercise through this House.  I am not saying that in a contentious sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>She may have but she is not a Member of this House.  She is an eminent member of the Supreme Court which has a different function under the Constitution.  Its function is to adjudicate disputes before it, not deal with staffing arrangements.  One of the reasons such staffing arrangements were made the responsibility of the Minister for Justice at the foundation of the State was that it was an administrative service in which the citizen should have confidence.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the prisons board, the courts service and the Freedom of Information Bill.  The latter leads me to the Attorney General and his advice.  I welcome the fact that the Minister laid the correspondence before the House.  The Taoiseach now has the opportunity to lay the correspondence of the Attorney General before the House.  Two letters are involved and it would assist us in the conduct of the debate if we were given sight of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, as the Taoiseach pointed out yesterday, that the Attorney General, strictly speaking, had no function in this matter.  In no sense is the Minister for Justice a client of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General took it upon himself to give advice in this matter.  I am not sure whether that can be described as the exercise of a guardianship of the public interest or as an excess of duty.  The Attorney General had no strict function in the matter.  He imposed himself as a legal adviser.  If I can be so disrespectful to suggest, he constituted or sought out his client.  He was not selected by his client <Col N="939" /> for advice on this occasion; he decided to give a potential client advice, if we are to follow the lawyer-client metaphor which the Taoiseach adopted yesterday.  The Attorney General took it upon himself to look for business, so to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Taoiseach, the Attorney General has 112 written communications with Ministers and senior civil servants in any month, in addition to consideration of 150 files.  In the course of much of that business the Attorney General would deal with an officer who is assigned to a particular file. The number of occasions on which the Attorney General would have direct correspondence with a Minister would be few.  There are 15 Ministers in the Cabinet.  Taking the Taoiseach's figure of 112 written communications and restricting our calculations to the number of communications with Ministers, it does not amount to a substantial amount of correspondence.  The point has been made in the debate but it is incredible that this correspondence was not drawn to the attention of the Minister.  The public has been asked to believe that and we have to apply some presumptions in relation to honesty.  It is a strange state of affairs that that was the case.  It appears from Question Time today that the second letter from the Attorney General contained advices.  In my experience, advices are not given unless requested.  I would like to know why the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; was used by the Taoiseach in relation to the second letter from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>One other matter, about which I am confused is the whole question of Judge Haugh.  As the Minister pointed out last night, on 6 September the warrant appointing Judge Haugh to the Special Criminal Court was sent to the Dublin County Registrar but it does not appear from the statement when Judge Haugh was advised of his appointment.  I ask whether there was a similar lapse of time in relation to that issue as in relation to the advice given in respect of Judge Lynch.  This matter is not clarified in the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>On the general question of confidence in the Government, the Taoiseach gave a stirring defence of his general guardianship of the nation's affairs last night.  I was disappointed that throughout that defence the greatest legacy he received from the previous Administration was not mentioned, the peace process in Northern Ireland.  I found that the most telling aspect of his speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the most recent débâcle of the Minister for Justice it was great to hear the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, defend the Minister for Justice by praising himself in 95 per cent of his <Col N="940" /> speech.  Some things never change.  I welcome also the new film critic of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, Deputy Boylan, who gave a critical appraisal of the film &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; which I saw on Saturday night, it is an excellent film.  I suggest there is some supreme irony involved in that the Minister was viewing the premier of her illustrious relative &mdash; a man who was able to break down the domination of Dublin Castle by getting spies to infiltrate and making sure he knew what was going on.  Perhaps the Minister should employ a similar tactic in her Department and get a few people to tell her what is going on in her Department.  That would be a major advance in terms of the information technology expert who is trying to find out how to put a date on a letter.  I would not have thought an information technology expert would be required for what is obviously a complicated task in the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The response of the Government to the prisoners débâcle last week would be astonishing if it were not for the fact that it forms part of a consistent pattern of incompetence, inconsistency, arrogance and evasiveness which have come to characterise the performance of the Government.  The trail of chaos which preceded the last debacle is worth recording.  First, the Minister for Health, having refused to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the blood transfusion scandal, was ultimately shamed into setting up a full inquiry but only after he had scandalously abused the memory of the dead victim of his own Department's incompetence for which he subsequently and properly apologised.</P>
      <P>Second, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry boasted of doing hard deals at Dublin Airport while he was in a licensed premises in Enniscorthy in his constituency.  Third, the Office of the Minister for Defence was bandied around the Four Courts in the context of who said what and who drank how much at a reception in Cyprus.  Neither should we forget the Walter Mitty type hallucinations last year of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications or the circumstances which necessitated the resignation of Fine Gael's first choice as Minister for Defence and also of its junior Minister at the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Now we have the débâcle of the Minister for Justice who has admitted that there was maladministration in her Department; that 16 persons remanded in custody in connection with very serious crimes had to be released and rearrested, five of whom have successfully applied to the High Court for an investigation into whether they are in lawful custody; that she was present at a Cabinet meeting when a judge of the Special Criminal Court was delisted but never told with the result that the legality of the Special Criminal Court was voided for several months; and that her civil servants' view of her standing in her Department was such that she was left in the dark, according to herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Last week the Minister for Justice failed to disclose to the House that not only had the Attorney General twice written to her in vain attempts to highlight the unlawful composition of the highly sensitive Special Criminal Court but that Judge Lynch had written to her asking for clarification of the position.  She said she did not disclose the contents of this letter because it was undated.  She said she did not understand where it fitted into the sequence of events or whether it was relevant.  We can only charitably assume that her explanation was concocted by her or by the officials in her Department, into whose conduct she has now established an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The content of the letter from Judge Lynch spoke for itself.  In the context of her statement to the House last week it was clear the letter had to be relevant.  A person with any modicum of intelligence would have known that.  The question of when the letter was sent was obviously relevant and of political and administrative significance. That it was relevant was transparently clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not admitted everything.  As demonstrated yesterday in the High Court, there are still question marks surrounding the legality of the detention of the 16 prisoners.  The legal experts would appear to agree that had the Minister arranged for the prisoners to be released through the gates of Portlaoise Prison, as the original detention was on foot of an admitted maladministration in her Department, they could have been lawfully rearrested and recharged. Even that could not have been properly organised by the Minister.  On the basis, presumably that she could not be confident that she could organise the arrest of 16 people emerging, one by one, at a time and place of her choice, she arranged that they would be arrested while they were still within the walls of the prison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I have no role in the re-arrest of prisoners; that is a role for the DPP.  Lest there be confusion, my role was in their release.  The Deputy is a lawyer and he should understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My comment is in relation to the manner of their release.  As these people were never released from the precincts of Portlaoise Prison they are now arguing that their unlawful detention never ceased and that their current detention is tainted with illegality.  That this is an arguable proposition has already been demonstrated by the decision of the High Court to grant conditional orders of <i>habeas corpus</i> to five of them.  It is well established that where persons are placed in unlawful custody due to technical errors, while they may have to be released, their release need only be technical and they need not be set at liberty in any meaningful way.  They do not have to be given what is called a head start.  It is equally well established that where persons are unlawfully detained, as part of a deliberate and conscious violation of their rights, they are entitled to be released in a <Col N="942" /> meaningful way and be given such a head start. No doubt it will be argued that although she knew the detention of these men was unlawful, the Minister elected never to release them from Portlaoise Prison&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but deliberately and consciously decided they would be rearrested while still in unlawful custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no role in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether there is merit in that argument will be for the courts to decide.  That the argument is being advanced is a further damning indictment of the Minister's performance.  The position of some of the Government parties seems to be that the Minister does not have to resign yet but that if any of the prisoners ultimately end up being released she will have to go.  So far the response of the Government has been that if the Minister makes a complete hames of running her Department she will not be removed but most of her Department will be closed down.  It is ludicrous that she is being left to run what is left of her Department while we await the outcome of proceedings in the High Court, brought about by her ministerial incompetence.</P>
      <P>What about the role of the Attorney General? We all appreciate he is a very busy man having to run not only his own office of State but also having to play the role of political babysitter for the Taoiseach.  Nevertheless, it is astonishing that a lawyer as eminent as the Attorney General would regard the fact that the Special Criminal Court was not properly constituted as a matter to be dealt with in a letter.  The failure to reply to it caused no surprise for more than a month.  He had received no reply to such an important letter for a month and what did the Attorney do?  Did he lift the telephone to speak with his ministerial and party colleague, the Minister for Justice?  Did he not think of saying something to her on one of the many occasions on which they must have met during that month?  Why did he not simply lift the telephone and speak to her in the first place?  Why did not the Minister for Justice lift the telephone to speak to Judge Lynch last week and ascertain the date of his letter instead of coming into the House and suppressing its existence?</P>
      <P>It is difficult to believe that an eminent lawyer is not familiar with the potential of a telephone as a means of communication.  The people are entitled to expect of the Attorney General at least the same degree of service that would be afforded by him to his private clients when in practise at the Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect, the Attorney General is not answerable to this House but to the people of Ireland.  The Taoiseach is answerable in this House.  It is widely believed that the Taoiseach's <Col N="943" /> unexpected survival is entirely due to the political babysitting skills of the present Attorney General.  The survival of the Taoiseach is too large a price to pay if the security of the State is endangered because the Attorney General is unable to find time to do his own job.</P>
    <P>What about the ultimate arbiter of all that is right and proper in this land of ours?  What about Mr. Openness, Mr. Accountability and Mr. Transparency &mdash; the Tánaiste?  He will finish the debate and make sure nobody can come in and argue against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue which gave rise to this debate is the institutional failure of which the current incident is the latest, and potentially most serious, manifestation.  Drastic system failures do not occur suddenly, they are the product of a long build-up.  This is why it is nonsense to blame the current Minister.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged by everyone that there are serious problems in the Department of Justice. Deputy Owen has been in charge of that Department for less than two years.  These problems predate her tenure in office.  They have now come to light in dramatic fashion but it must be said that while this is the most serious, it is not the first administrative system failure in the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen inherited rather than created these problems.  The Opposition is keen to see parallels between what is happening now and the events of two years ago.  There are some similarities but there is one essential difference &mdash; this is an embarrassing and unacceptable system failure which is openly acknowledged by the Minister and the Government and which is being thoroughly investigated and will be remedied. Two years ago we witnessed a system failure which the parties did not acknowledge the existence of and tried to cover up when all else failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report on the current problem will be published next week in full and without the sort of selective editing and advance briefing which Fianna Fail indulged in two years ago when the <Col N="944" /> beef tribunal report was issued.  The Minister will answer questions fully and comprehensively in the Dáil.  There will be no attempt to exclude, cover up or put a spin on anything.  This Government and this Minister have nothing to hide &mdash; we recognise the failure and we intend to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>I am greatly impressed by the number of times the Opposition have had to rely on quotations from the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, to make their point.</P>

      <P>Deputies Ahern and Harney, apparently, are unable to put their own words on the necessary standards to be applied in Government.  It is heartening that they have accepted that the Tánaiste is the authority on which they must rely.  I can only hope that they have genuinely taken his standards to heart and will apply them if they are ever in Government again.</P>
      <P>In my short time as a Minister of State in the Department of Justice, with limited responsibilities, I have found the officials in the Department, like other public servants, to be in general decent and honourable individuals. Again, as in other walks of life, some are outstanding, some are average and some are inefficient and do not provide the quality of service to which the public is entitled.  In this respect the Department is no different from other Government Departments or institutions. Department of Justice officials, however, operate under a considerable disadvantage &mdash; they are often overwhelmed by the institutional culture which they have inherited.</P>
      <P>I know and acknowledge that many Department of Justice officials are deeply upset and embarrassed by what has happened.  The criticisms I will mention in my speech today have been heard already by those officials.  My contribution is made in a spirit of constructive criticism and out of a genuine wish for reform.  I know that many officials will welcome the changes we are proposing and I realise that these changes will require negotiation and planning.  I do not doubt the capacity of officials to implement these changes.  The fact that the Justice culture has not been tackled before is largely the responsibility, not of officials but of successive Governments.</P>
      <P>No serious attempt was made prior to 1992 to address the structural problems in the Department of Justice.  It is an utter nonsense for the Opposition to suggest that previous Ministers for Justice were in command and control of their officials to a degree that the present Minister is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Justice have not tackled the problem whereby too much power rests with officials who are not accountable.  That such power has remained in the Department of <Col N="945" /> Justice since the foundation of the State is the responsibility of all Ministers of Justice.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the changes announced by the Taoiseach yesterday are a cynical response to a crisis.  This is unfair.  These commitments were explicity outlined in the programme, A Government of Renewal.  A number of measures have already been introduced to remove some of the functions of the Department of Justice and to place them in other agencies.  It is true that dramatic events tend to galvanise people into action with more urgency than might otherwise be the case.  This does not just apply to politicians and public servants but to many sections of the community.  Institutions are inherently resistant to change; crises sometimes have the necessary cathartic effects.  This crisis provides us with an opportunity to take the further measures to change the way we run our criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>By setting up independent authorities to look after the courts and the prisons we are continuing a trend of replacing direct departmental control over important matters with independent bodies. In another Department, for example, we have already devolved planning appeals to an independent authority.  We have also devolved the question of constituency boundaries and we are proposing to devolve responsibilities to local education boards.</P>
    <P>The Labour and Fianna Fáil Government of 1992 made the first move to change the Department of Justice when responsibility for civil law reform was transferred to the new Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The quality and quantity of the major programme of law reform undertaken by that Department in the past four years is a testament to the improvements which can be made when institutional gridlock is removed.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act, which I steered through the Oireachtas earlier this year, involves the removal of the current functions of the Department in this area to an independent Refugee Commissioner. Again, this will mean that the process of dealing with asylum seekers will not only be independent but will be seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already announced the Government's intention to establish an independent courts service and an independent prisons board.  I welcome these.  I also want to see an independent Garda authority in addition to the proposal in the Government's programme to designate the Garda Commissioner as the accounting officer for the force.  I also believe that the area of criminal law reform should be transferred to the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Furthermore, I want to let light shine on our obscure immigration rules and our dealings with non-nationals who are not refugees.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing here is not just reform &mdash; it would more appropriately be described as creating new systems rather than simply reforming old ones.  The creation of a new system <Col N="946" /> for administering the courts is not particularly difficult.  I acknowledge that the creation of a new system for the prisons is much more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report on the Penal System described how &ldquo;the detailed administration of prisons has moved to an excessive degree into the Department of Justice, to the detriment of discretion and responsibility, and therefore of good management&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;fundamental malaise&rdquo; which the committee recognised as existing in the relationship between management and staff in the prison system has not improved.</P>
    <P>Over the years, officials in the Department have effectively been allowed to exercise power without responsibility.  This has to end.  The new board will have the power, but also the responsibility.  As with the Courts Service, that responsibility is to the community and not just to any one section of it.  The new prisons board will have a difficult task.  If it is properly structured and has suitable personnel in charge, it should be able to greatly improve the running of our prisons.  Its establishment is a recognition that the considerations which apply to the running of the prison system are not exclusively security ones.  A proper parole system needs to be introduced and it is appropriate that this be done independently of the Department, as stipulated in the Government's programme.  Similarly, entitlement to temporary release should be determined independently.</P>
    <P>Access to the courts is one of the most basic civil rights of citizens.  Speedy trials are an essential element of justice.  The present arrangements are not satisfactory.  The new courts service must exist for the benefit of all citizens, the entire community.  This will require a strong consumer input into the structures and procedures.  While judges must make decisions on legal matters and on matters affecting people's rights, judges and lawyers are not necessarily the best people to decide on administration, which is the function of professional management with appropriate training and experience.  There is a perception that the courts are run by lawyers for lawyers and if this is the case it has to be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act is widely acknowledged as progressive and humane and we are in the process of setting up the offices of the commissioner and appeals board.  I expect this work to be accelerated as the process of change takes root in the Department.</P>
    <P>The question of our dealings with non-nationals needs to be addressed, the relevant legislation needs to be updated and a clear and transparent immigration policy set out.  The application system for visas is a mystery even to the initiated.  This is unacceptable in a modern democracy.  People who apply for visas or residence permits do not necessarily have a right to get what they are seeking but they have a right to natural justice and proper procedures and to have their applications assessed in accordance with clearly known criteria.  The perception that <Col N="947" /> this is not the case at present cannot be easily rebutted because of the shroud of secrecy which surrounds the entire process.  This is why I referred to the culture inherited by the Department since its foundation.</P>
    <P>The absence of openness and transparency in this area not only goes against the principles of open government but it also means that an inordinate amount of official time is spent trying to explain actions in the courts.  A new system is required for practical reasons as well as reasons of principle.  The new systems must be staffed at a senior level by people with a public service ethos and management abilities.  They must be prepared to take personal responsibility for the operation of the systems and not be subject to the corrosive effects of permanence.  Effective democratic government requires the responsible exercise of power, which must reside clearly and explicity in certain people who are accountable for their actions.</P>
    <P>These changes mean that the Department of Justice will be essentially a home affairs Department with policy making responsibilities. Given its heavy operational workload, the Department has not been able to develop its policy making role to any serious extent.  The changes we are making will allow for more concentration on policy issues rather than on the need to respond to the demands of the moment. The demands on officials are very severe.</P>
    <P>The Department will continue to have a significant involvement in matters relating to Northern Ireland and to the justice and home affairs pillar of the EU.  The Government's continuing efforts to bring about a settlement in Northern Ireland require continued involvement by the Department of Justice at the most senior level.  While the Secretary of the Department and an assistant secretary in Belfast are involved in this work, a second secretary or deputy secretary should be appointed to look after the administration of the Department.  This is particularly important in order to oversee the transfer of functions to the new agencies.  We are indebted to these officials for their work in this area.</P>
    <P>The justice and home affairs pillar of the EU is a morass of impenetrable bureaucracy which has been created by the 15 member states.  There is a plethora of working groups, steering groups, committees of experts and a committee of senior officials.  There are 28 groups dealing with various aspects of the justice and home affairs pillar. When I was being briefed by my officials I had to ask them to draw a diagram as I could not understand the complicated structures.  The activities of this pillar should either be transferred to the first pillar or abolished.  The work being carried out by the Department of Justice in these groups and committees is not based on any stated policy and it is very difficult for anyone to find out what exactly is being discussed.  There is no public input into the process.  When our <Col N="948" /> Presidency is over we must take a hard look at our involvement in this area, open it up to public scrutiny and question whether we should be as deeply involved as we are at present.  This is pertinent to the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference process.  While there is a lively public debate on issues relating to common foreign and security policy, social policy &mdash; for example, hours of work and the social chapter &mdash; agricultural policy etc. the areas of justice and home affairs are not being opened up to public scrutiny.  I would like to see changes in this area.</P>
    <P>The respective roles of the officials and the Minister in policy making need to be clearly designated.  We all know the theory but putting it into practice is not so easy.  There are areas of policy which are never scrutinised by Ministers. This applies to many Departments.  Many policies put forward, particularly at EU level, have never been the subject of a Government decision because they come from the sub-committee structure of officials.  Members who have been Ministers and been involved in European Union affairs will understand this point.</P>
    <P>When problems arise it is normal to say there is a need for more resources.  There is always a need for more resources, but I want to state clearly and unequivocally that I do not believe the essential problem in the Department of Justice is one of resources.  It would be entirely wrong and possibly disastrous if the problem was addressed simply by allocating more resources to the Department.  Real reform and new systems are required and some of this may necessitate additional resources at some stage.  The introduction of reform is difficult and throwing money at it is not the way to go.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the Government and all its Ministers.  I am proud of the Government's record in the areas of education and equality, the improvements in social services and the measures taken to deal with crime and the drugs menace. During the Minister's tenure of office extraordinary legislation has been enacted, for example, the legislation setting up the criminal assets bureau and the other structures to fight the problem of drugs and crime.  The Government's policy on the arts has been particularly effective. I am proud of my record which has seen major increases in overseas development assistance, a leadership role in peacemaking, a significant involvement in disarmament, particularly the movement to eliminate landmines, and major reform of our refugee laws.  I was proud to represent Ireland on the Troika which recently visited the Great Lakes region.</P>
    <P>This matter is important but so are the lives of many people currently at risk.  The legislative record of this Government is second to none; its management of the economy, its development of services, its inclusive commitment to the social and economic rights of all people cannot be matched.</P>
    <P>Reform is necessary and the officials and staff who work in the Department of Justice are more <Col N="949" /> than capable of implementing the reforms required.  I assure the Opposition that this is a long playing record which has a full year of good music still to play and the studios are booked for the subsequent five years.  Nostalgia may be a potent force in the music business but it is not suitable for politics.  The hymns this Government sings are for now and for the future.</P>

      <P>It is often said that justice is blind. The Minister and her Department appear to have taken this literally.  The Minister appears to know little or nothing of what goes on in her Department concerning the important issues of the day and the Department appears to be determined to keep it that way.  Since the Minister took office she has repeatedly come into this House to stand over one blunder after another by persons in respect of whom she had direct responsibility.  The excuse is always the same: that she did not know, was not informed or is awaiting the outcome of an inquiry.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that my comments are political and directed to the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General, the Taoiseach and the Government.  The comments are not personal.  I know the Minister personally and respect her.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy Owen, and I worked together on many issues related to Africa. However, as Mr. Fergus Finlay said in his book <i>The Cruel Trade,</i> politics is a cruel trade.  These comments are made as one politician to another. Perhaps the conclusion might be that they put Deputy Owen in the wrong ministry.</P>

      <P>As regards not knowing what is going on, we will now give the Minister the facts. We had the Duncan extradition affair when an extradition warrant was shredded by a member of the Garda Síochána.  According to the Minister, she was unable to ascertain what happened and remained in ignorance for over a month.  How does it take five weeks for the Minister for Justice to find out that a member of the Garda Síochána shredded the warrant when this was known within days by the garda's superiors?  The Minister claims she was not told and was not able to find out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister commended the Garda Síochána for its part in the so-called Urlingford drugs seizure but it subsequently transpired that the drugs at Urlingford had been put there by the Garda Síochána in the first place.  This massive drugs haul, supposedly made by the Garda Síochána, was the subject of huge media <Col N="950" /> coverage.  Why was the Minister unaware that the drugs had been placed there by the Garda Síochána?  Why, when the seizure became public knowledge, was the Minister not informed of the true circumstances?  The public relations exercise for the Minister and her Department backfired.</P>
    <P>It now seems that a personal letter from the Attorney General to the Minister, addressed to her private office, is not to be seen.  How long has this system been in operation?  Who put these procedures in place, and was the Minister aware that this system operated in her private office?  If so, why did she allow it to continue?  If she was not aware of the systems and procedures within her office, why not?</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice operates with little or no input from the Minister.  As the country looked with growing unease at the rise of the drug barons and their apparent immunity to the legal process, the Minister and her Department stood idly by, gangland feuds and contract killings escalated, the drug barons continued to amass vast fortunes and it fell to Fianna Fáil in Opposition to present the Minister with a Bill providing for the seizure of criminal assets.</P>
    <P>The latest fiasco beggars belief.  The Government relieved Judge Lynch of his duties as a judge of the Special Criminal Court &mdash; a post in the most sensitive court in the State &mdash; whose members are placed at increased risk of attack from subversives and serious criminals.  The Minister was present at the Cabinet meeting when the decision was made to relieve Judge Lynch of his duties and replace him on the court with Judge Haugh.  It is up to the Minister and her Department to implement the Government's decision but it was not conveyed to Judge Lynch. The response of the Minister to this débâcle is to simply say it had nothing to do with her and that she did not know.  However, if the Minister had not allowed her Department to effectively run out of control this would never had happened.</P>
    <P>If the Minister did not know until 4 November, then this situation was brought about by her failure to ensure that proper procedures were put in place in her private office.  Is the Minister telling us that she has no responsibility for the systems operated in her private office?  This is ludicrous because it is her office and it is up to her to order how it conducts its business.  The Minister is responsible for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims she cannot be expected to be aware of every scrap of paper that arrives on her desk but surely any letter from a judge or the Attorney General in relation to the Special Criminal Court cannot be described as a scrap of paper.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not alone, however, in failing to grasp the significance of the matter under debate.  It seems that in early October the Attorney General was made aware of an impression among the Judiciary that Judge Lynch was still a member of the Special Criminal Court. What did the Attorney General, as the Government's legal adviser and guardian of the <Col N="951" /> public interest, do when informed of this impression?  Did he contact Judge Lynch to find out if he has been informed of the fact that he has been removed from the Special Criminal Court?  Did he contact the president of the court to establish whether he was informed of Judge Lynch's removal?  Did he make any attempt to establish the facts?  The answer is no on all counts.  He merely conveyed this impression to the Minister by way of a letter.</P>
    <P>When he did not receive an acknowledgement of this letter and no apparent action was taken, the Attorney General did nothing further.  It was only when he apparently read in a newspaper that Judge Lynch continued to sit on the Special Criminal Court that he took further action.  What further action did the Government's legal adviser and guardian of the public interest take?  Did he seek a meeting with the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach to apprise them of the situation? Did it occur to him to telephone either the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach directly and discuss the matter with them?  Again, on all counts the answer is no.  Instead, the Attorney General decided to write a second letter to the Minister stating that this situation could cause legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>Presumably the release of 16 high security prisoners is regarded by the Attorney General as nothing more than a potential legal difficulty.  A number of days passed and still no apparent action was taken on foot of the Attorney General's second letter.  It seems that the Attorney General was reluctant to contact the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach personally or directly.</P>
    <P>This is extraordinary.  It seems that the man who was hailed as a legal whiz kid, the man who would drag the Attorney General's office into the late 20th century, the man who would oversee the computerisation of the Attorney General's office and the introduction of state-of-the-art technology into the functioning of that office, did not think about using a simple old fashioned telephone to call either the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach.  Instead he decided to write vague and ineffectual letters to the Minister while keeping the Taoiseach in the dark.</P>
    <P>Surely the Attorney General as governmental legal adviser and guardian of the public interest had a duty to bring the significance of this matter to the attention of the Taoiseach as soon as he became aware of a potential problem.  Surely he was under a duty to bring to the attention of the Taoiseach the fact that the most sensitive court in the State was unlawfully constituted, and have the situation rectified immediately.  That was his duty but he failed to carry it out.</P>
    <P>He either did not appreciate the legal significance of the problem or, more likely, he was prepared to simply sit back and wait to see what the Minister might eventually get around to doing.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice to publish the correspondence from the <Col N="952" /> Attorney General which is crucial and central to this debate.  Members are entitled to see that correspondence.  By refusing to disclose these letters the Minister is involved in a blatant coverup.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's defence of the Attorney General in claiming that he had to deal with 112 such written communications during October with Ministers and senior civil servants is pathetic.  It is difficult to accept that the other 111 issues were of the same crucial importance when one considers that as a result of the Attorney General's incompetence and negligence on this particular matter, 16 high security prisoners had to be released and rearrested.</P>
      <P>The Government parties are prepared to stand over the mishandling of this matter by the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.  It seems that Democratic Left and the Labour Party can think of no grounds upon which to criticise the Minister or the Attorney General for their handling of this fiasco.  Does anyone seriously believe for one moment that if the Tánaiste or the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, were sitting on the Opposition benches, they would be condoning the conduct of the Minister for Justice or of the Attorney General?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste's utterances on accountability in November 1994 have already been referred to. Those fine words and sentiments now ring hollow in the public ear.  Where is the concern for accountability now?  Where is the concern for the doctrine of ministerial responsibility?  Where is the bloody and invisible hand of the Tánaiste's adviser?  It appears the sacrificial knife is to remain firmly in its scabbard.  The Tánaiste's high standards have slipped significantly since going into the present Coalition.  He and his party are prepared to tolerate any dereliction of duty on the part of any Minister to avoid a confrontation or a dispute within the Coalition.  The Tánaiste's <i>volte-face</i> on this issue is explicable only by one thing, fear.  He and the Labour Party are afraid to face the electorate.  The Government is afraid <Col N="953" /> of the electorate, but the electorate is watching and waiting.  Voters are not as naive as the Tánaiste believes and sooner or later they will have their say.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste can run, but he cannot hide.  His hypocrisy is patent, he stands exposed as the Minister of double standards.  He applied so-called standards when he and Mr. Finlay wanted to get out of the last Government. The same standards will not be applied now because he has nowhere to go.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, claim this Government is different from the last Fianna Fáil-Labour Government in that its members trust each other. It is now patently obvious they trust each other so much they will cover up for each other no matter what conflict or crisis emerges.  The Government has talked much about accountability, but from the day it took office it failed to practice what it preached.  How can the Government parties stand over the Minister's handling of this affair?</P>
      <P>I have often heard it said that God does not answer letters.  It now appears that neither does the Minister.  Is she trying to tell us something? The Taoiseach claims the Minister is the best Minister for Justice we have had for years.</P>
      <P>What about the Duncan extradition affair, the supposed Urlingford drugs seizure, the escalating gangland feuds and contract killings and the fiasco concerning the Special Criminal Court?  Is it not time the Taoiseach woke up and smelled the coffee?</P>
      <P>For some time I have been concerned about the Taoiseach's grasp of reality.  His response to the latest scandal in which the Minister is embroiled gives me further cause for concern.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the Minister's record? Does he read the newspapers?  I considered writing a letter to him appraising him of the record of his Minister for Justice, but given what we have learned so far about the workings of the present Administration there would be little point in doing so.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing time with me.  This has been an interesting and extraordinary debate.  The Taoiseach divided his speech into three parts.  In the first part he went to great lengths to point out that, irrespective of any lapse in Government activities, one could exonerate himself, his Ministers and the Attorney General.  He claimed they were not responsible. He even quoted Professor David Gwynn-Morgan to enable him blame the civil servants.  He stated that it is unrealistic and dogmatic to expect a Minister's head to roll because some routine act of administration is badly executed by one of his or her civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> In the next part of his speech he stripped the Minister of half her functions.  This was a knee-jerk reaction.</P>

      <P>Does anybody who sat at the Cabinet table on 1 August have responsibility?  The decision to relieve Judge Lynch of his responsibilities in the Special Criminal Court might not have been the most important decision on the agenda that day, but failure to implement the decision could have serious consequences for the State.  When the minutes of that meeting were read at the following Cabinet meeting, did any member ask about the decision?  I was talking to a constituent last night who wondered why this did not happen. This is what happens when serious issues are dealt with at meetings of all small organisations and committees.  Did the Taoiseach or the Minister not ask about the matter?</P>

      <P>Did the Attorney General not whisper to somebody that he or she should ask about it?  Did the leaders of Democratic Left and the Labour Party not ask about it?  With their knowledge of everything that happens, one would have expected one of them to ask about the decision.  There is a lack of public confidence in the Government, something the Taoiseach did not appreciate when making his contribution yesterday.</P>
      <P>This matter is being misrepresented &mdash; I am not saying purposely &mdash; to the public, some of whom believe that, even though a letter was sent to the Department of Justice, the Minister was not informed of it and nothing was done for five weeks.  The Minister and the Government sat around the Cabinet table on 1 August and made this decision.  It is important that people are aware that every member of the Government was aware of the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference to what has happened in the Department of Justice in the past two years. The Minister, through no fault of her own, got off to a bad start when she was not given money to build a prison in Castlerea.  Deputy O'Donoghue, our spokesperson on Justice, introduced a number of Bills, made a number of statements and tabled parliamentary questions calling for the introduction of legislation, but the Government refused to listen.  It was only after the murder of Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Jerry McCabe that legislation was introduced.  Some of the Government's best decisions have been knee-jerk reactions.  It is unfortunate that such <Col N="955" /> legislation was not introduced until two people were murdered.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said the Attorney General did not have responsibility in the implementation of Government decisions.  He is the upholder of statutes, the defender of the Constitution and the defender of the public interest.  It is interesting to note the reference to that in the programme for Government.  The Attorney General failed in this responsibility.  Why did he not inform the Taoiseach of his concern about legal difficulties in this regard?  Why did he not communicate directly with the Minister?  Deputy Kitt referred to 112 letters.  Surely that letter must have stood out when he knew the implications of not implementing the decision.</P>
    <P>The fact that yesterday the Labour Party and Democratic Left, including the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, did not applaud the Taoiseach at the end of his speech spoke volumes.  I will not quote what the Leaders of those two parties said during a similar situation in 1994, but it makes interesting reading in the context of what is happening today.  The Leader of Democratic Left has given his full backing to the Minister for Justice.  He blamed nobody for this mess in the first half of his statement yesterday but the second half suggested that if someone must be blamed, it should be the civil servants.  No blame is attached to the Government.  I read in today's newspaper that yesterday he stated in court that he had burned his papers of 30 years.  That is a tragedy because they would have made interesting reading for the public and for officials in the National Archives.</P>

      <P>It has been a desultory, uninspired and almost perfunctory performance by the Opposition which has lacked purpose or conviction.  How can Deputy Harney justify her claim of yesterday that the Taoiseach is running away from responsibility?  The only running yesterday, as the day wore on, was Deputy O'Donoghue's mascara.  The House will know of my regard for Deputy O'Donoghue.  He is an intelligent man and an authentic representative of his constituents.  However, it is sad to see this previously unadorned spokesman for his people reduced to a film extra by the Fianna Fáil makeup department.  Whatever will they think in Cahirciveen when the word leaks out that Deputy O'Donoghue is now only permitted to come into this House heavily coifed and plastered in makeup?  Deputy O'Donoghue is in danger of becoming a caricature of himself.</P>

      <P>There has been a communication failure in the Department of Justice, which is difficult to understand and should not have happened. Immediately on learning of the implications of the non-communication of the Cabinet decision of 1 August, the Minister for Justice moved to set up an independent inquiry which will report within days.  I hope the puzzlement we all feel will be cleared up by that independent inquiry. However, the Opposition parties have jumped the gun and decided not to await the findings of the inquiry.</P>

      <P>The attempt to find parallels between this event and the events of 1994 must be deemed superficial.  Accountability had to be extracted over a long period in 1994.  We have had recent testimony to the conviction that there was a calculated effort to conceal vital information.  Whether or not that was the case, the events were taking place in a climate where trust had completely broken down.</P>
      <P>Comparisons between letters from Attorneys General in 1994 and 1996 are even more facile. For example, it is important to record that, according to recent testimony, if a letter from the Attorney General in 1994 was not passed to the Taoiseach of the day, it was only because it was in the hands of the present Leader of the main Opposition party.  The only inferences capable of being drawn from that recent testimony are that Deputy Bertie Ahern withheld the letter or he did not understand its contents.  I do not draw either inference; I will leave that to the historians. However, neither inference can be drawn in the case of any Minister in this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt to implicate the Attorney General in a matter outside his formal responsibilities is symptomatic of Fianna Fáil's obsessive preoccupation with the affairs of 1994.  It is entirely human to grieve for a period following <Col N="958" /> the loss of someone or something near or dear and there is nothing so dear to Fianna Fáil as power.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil should realise it is out of power and that this is a strong reforming cohesive Government and is widely recognised as such.</P>
      <P>The measures announced yesterday by the Taoiseach concerning the prisons board and the courts service are the most far reaching reforms in these critical areas since the foundation of the State.  It is a widely held view that the courts have not been functioning to optimum efficiency nor has the management of the courts been responsive to the pace of change and demands of modern day business and living.  An independent board will now manage a unified court system headed up by a chief executive recruited through open competition.  In the programme, A Government of Renewal the three parties committed themselves to &ldquo;a fundamental reform of the courts system&rdquo;.  Mrs. Justice Denham's working group was established and duly submitted two reports and yesterday's announcement by the Taoiseach confirms this major reform.  On page 77 of the programme, A Government of Renewal, there is a commitment to &ldquo;Examination of the establishment of a Prison Board to manage the day-to-day running of prisons.&rdquo;  This decision was taken last May and yesterday's confirmation that responsibility for the prison service will be transferred from the Department of Justice to an independent statutory board will give this major reform further impetus.</P>
      <P>Neither step would ever have been contemplated by Fianna Fáil despite all its years in office.  The attempt to portray these radical measures as a fire brigade response to recent developments is spurious.  There is no need for the Government to send for the fire brigade to put out this particular fire because a wet towel will do the job sufficiently.</P>

      <P>The leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, criticises my colleague the Minister for Justice because she is not &ldquo;a hands-on Minister&rdquo;.  Maybe he has a point certainly <Col N="959" /> there will be no front page stories about the Minister, Deputy Owen, trundling across St. Stephen's Green clutching a bundle of Irish passports and making a personal hands-on delivery to foreign businessmen waiting in the Shelbourne.  I can live with that and the fact that the Minister for Justice will never be able and will never want to take such a hands-on approach.</P>
      <P>Speaking of passports, I remind Deputies opposite of the last time the Department of Justice found itself in the eye of a storm.  I do not wish to retrace the painful history of the passports affair but merely to point out the contrast between Fianna Fáil in office and Fianna Fáil out of office.  Its current quest for a ministerial head contrasts oddly with its furtive silence in the face of that decision, taken personally by the then Minister for Justice, which had beneficial business implications for the family of one of her colleagues.

      <P>I remind Deputies that the proposals for an independent prisons board first surfaced in the Whitaker report over a decade ago.  That report was buried by successive Fianna Fáil administrations, which preferred to maintain the <i>status quo</i> rather than confront the shortcomings in the broader legal system head on.</P>
      <P>For years Fianna Fáil was content to preside over a growing crisis in our prisons, a crisis which militated against society and against individual prisoners and which substituted simple containment for rehabilitation.  The establishment of an independent prisons board is the first step towards developing a modern, effective and accountable penal system.  The establishment of a courts service, as recommended by the Working Groups on the Courts chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham is equally important and I look forward to the early implementation of the working group's other recommendations.</P>

      <P>Seventy-three years after his untimely death at Beal na Bláth his name is internationally acclaimed while others who lived in the same period have long since been forgotten.  The audacity of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to direct this barrage of criticism at the Minister for Justice, a grandniece of that great man, is an insult to every law abiding citizen in this country.  She did not create these problems, she inherited them from previous Administrations.</P>
      <P>This Government is working as a team, a winning team.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left are an excellent combination and the country is proud of their achievements. During the past two years they have performed in an excellent fashion.  The Government has an outstanding record in every Department for which our Ministers are responsible.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice had the courage to come into Dáil Éireann last Thursday evening and told the truth.  She again explained the full facts of the matter here yesterday.  Did she shred the documents as Fianna Fáil did in office to hide its shortcomings?  She did not, rather she told the truth which, at times, is bitter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon stated that the Taoiseach has taken away some of the responsibilities of the Department of Justice.  That is untrue.  Fianna Fáil criticises the changes to be made in that Department as they will bring to an end its philosophy of jobs for the boys.

      <P>It is stumbling from one disaster to another.  Its days are numbered.  The most recent débâcle shows that its members are not even talking to each other.  Despite its best efforts to remain glued together, it is beginning to fall apart.</P>
      <P>Because of the failure of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General to act collectively, a distinguished judge of the Special Criminal Court has been embarrassed and 16 prisoners in our top security prison were released.  On 2 October the Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice asking her to establish whether the Government's decision to delist Judge Dominic Lynch at his request had been conveyed to him and the President of the court.  Why did the Attorney General not ring the alarm bells?  He subsequently met, almost daily, the Minister for Justice and, frequently, the Taoiseach.  He sat with the full Cabinet each week.  The media covered the major events and decisions of the Special Criminal Court.  Yet, a clear Government decision, in which all Ministers participated, was not implemented and a senior judge was allowed to make judgements in an unlawfully constituted court.</P>
      <P>The outcome of this débâcle was disastrous and undermines confidence in the Government and the legal system.  Because of the lack of attention paid by the Government to important business, the Special Criminal Court was not properly constituted when it sat in October.  Its every act, therefore, was unlawful.  Those remanded and held in unlawful custody may sue the State for damages for false imprisonment.  If any of the prisoners had been tried and convicted, the ability of the Director of Public Prosecutions to successfully try them again for the same crime would be in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the Government to notify a judge of the Special Criminal Court that he was no longer empowered to sit in that court is not a minor administrative matter.  It was a crucial decision in the administration of justice for which the Minister for Justice and the Government are responsible.  At a Government meeting the Minister asked for and got a formal decision but nobody told the judge concerned.  Anyone <Col N="964" /> familiar with the justice system should be aware of the possible disastrous consequences of a court sitting with a judge presiding who, for whatever reason, is not properly appointed.</P>
    <P>The Special Criminal Court is the only court to which the Government can appoint judges and then withdraw them.  In every other case judges are nominated and appointed to the Bench with full power to preside until they resign or retire. When the Government decides, therefore, to withdraw a judge from the Special Criminal Court and replace him with another, it is making a decision which, at the very least, is unusual and not a part of every day office procedure in the Department of Justice.  It is a decision of considerable weight and import and not often made.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental and of great importance to ensure that the person being withdrawn is told immediately.  To fail in this regard is a major blunder with disastrous consequences.  In attempting to diminish the seriousness of such a blunder the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have shown they do not fully grasp the significance of the Cabinet's decision.</P>
    <P>Even if it was a case of administrative absent-mindedness as the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste would have us believe, the matter does not end there.  It is the function of the Minister, the Attorney General and all members of the Government to ride shotgun with the Civil Service to ensure administrative errors, be they big or small, do not develop into major disasters.  We are entitled to expect that when the Attorney General heard on 2 October that the Judiciary did not know that Judge Dominic Lynch had been withdrawn at his own request from the Special Criminal Court two months before on 1 August he would instantly see the potential for disaster.  It is not too much to expect that he would keep his eyes open and his wits about him.  He should see the problems, be they acts or omissions, and deal with them before they develop into disasters.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General had the good fortune to discover in time, albeit by accident on 2 October, that the message of Judge Lynch's withdrawal had not got through.  In many ways, it was a stroke of good luck and should have enabled him to solve the problem.  Yet, all he did was write a letter to the Minister for Justice.  Every alarm bell in his office should have rung as disaster beckoned.  He should have telephoned or spoken to the Minister.  Yet, nothing other than a perfunctory letter was sent.  This is incomprehensible and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As a constitutional officer obliged to protect the public interests and legal adviser to the Government, why did the Attorney General not inform the Government of the legal problems which could arise for the highest security court in the land?  Did he raise the matter with the Taoiseach who relies on him heavily for advice? Worse was to follow.  On 2 October the Attorney General had no reason to know Judge Lynch was <Col N="965" /> sitting.  He had every reason to fear, however, that he would sit unwittingly and without lawful authority.  Judge Lynch sat during October when numerous cases were dealt with.  They were, as are all Special Criminal Court matters, very high profile cases, which were widely reported, yet throughout October while the court sat unlawfully nothing was done by the Attorney General.  Are we to believe then that he does not read the papers, watch television or listen to the radio?  The word that comes to mind yet again is &ldquo;incomprehensible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Even worse was to follow.  The Attorney General discovered from the newspapers on 1 November that Judge Lynch was sitting in the Special Criminal Court.  An awful reality should have dawned on him then, but instead of raising the roof he merely wrote another letter.  Five more days followed before action was taken.  In the end it was not the Minister or the Attorney General but some person unconnected with the relevant section in the Department who finally made things happen.  The initial mistake was bad enough but failure on the part of the Minister and the Attorney General to act when they got an early warning is utterly bizarre.  The Government may be able to find some unfortunate official to carry the can for the Minister's failure to notify Judge Lynch of his release from the Special Criminal Court, but the Minister and the Attorney General cannot evade responsibility for the sorry mess that developed after the matter was brought to the Attorney General's attention on 2 October.</P>
    <P>Eight deadly errors appear to have been made. The Minister responsible may be able to find a scapegoat for the first, failure to inform the judge of his release, but there is no excuse for the other seven errors: failure of the Attorney General to act effectively when he discovered on 2 October that the judge was still considered to be a judge in the court and to immediately avert a disaster; failure of the Minister to organise her office in such a way that letters addressed to her from the Attorney General are automatically brought to her attention; failure of the Attorney General to follow through on his letter of 2 October; failure of the Attorney General to inform the Taoiseach of the serious situation that had been brought to his attention; failure of the Attorney General to keep an eye on the position after 2 October so that he could immediately react; the Attorney General and the Minister allowed the position to remain for more than five weeks while high profile cases were dealt with in the court and failure of the Attorney General to act instantly and effectively when he discovered on 1 November from reading the papers that Judge Lynch was still sitting in the Special Criminal Court, allowing a disastrous situation to continue. The finger points clearly and directly at the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General. The consequences of this are not yet fully apparent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> The latest revelation of the letter the Minister received has been dealt with comprehensively here.  It is particularly sad the Minister did not tell the House last week that she had received that letter.  The self-serving interpretation of the rainbow Coalition of ministerial responsibility for a decision which emanated from the Cabinet is that the Minister is responsible but not to blame. The Government has chosen that interpretation because those who are to blame are fired.  A great deal more can be said about this case, but I wish to share my time with Deputy Kenneally.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring, as others have done, to the comments only two short years ago, on 16 November 1994, of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, when he stressed very strongly the importance of responsibility and culpability and that they cannot be separated.  The references are clearly on the record for everyone to see. Accountability and culpability for actions or omissions are just as important now as they were two years ago.  If we accept the double standard of accountability now put forward by the Government, the double standard outlined to this House by the Minister for Justice, we will debase politics and deepen even further public cynicism. If the Labour Party turns on its head the high-flowing principle of openness and accountability trumpeted by it two years ago it will drag into the gutter those principles of honesty and consistency that are essential to the conduct of public affairs. There is no place for such breathtaking hypocrisy. Members of this House and the public are entitled to better.  The Labour Party cannot have it both ways, either it stands up for the principles of accountability and openness expounded by it two years ago or the Tánaiste stands indicted for double standards and gross hypocrisy in public affairs.  Tonight's vote will tell the tale.</P>
    <P>The rainbow Coalition told us in the course of this debate that if they trust one another and stick together, accountability does not matter.  That is what was stated repeatedly by Ministers.  They will find a sacrificial Civil Service lamb to slaughter on the alter of political expediency, but that will not work.  The Government will be held accountable and responsible and I look forward to that day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Woods for sharing his time with me.  Rarely have I risen in this House more angry than I am at present and rarely have I endured such hypocrisy, effrontery, blind political posturing and naked desire to hang onto power as I have heard and seen during the course of this debate.  Never have I heard such feeble arguments and rarely have I heard such equivocation, deviousness and waffle as I heard from Government speakers in the past two days. I am pleased to add my voice to the chorus of protests which rang out from many quarters about the misuse of power and abuse of a Government majority which keeps a clearly incompetent Minister in charge of one of the most sensitive portfolios in Government.  Never <Col N="967" /> have I seen such a U-turn on the part of any political party as is evident from the Labour Party on this issue as it wriggles to get off the opportunist hook on which it impaled itself two years ago.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the Labour Party is caught in a cleft stick on this issue and that its credibility as a party of honour is at stake.  On the one hand it will not be seen to bring down another Government, which would be the third from which it exited when the going got rough &mdash; the fourth if you count the one in which their present chairman gave the famous kiss of death to Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  When the going gets tough, the tough get going, and the Labour Party gets out.  Neither should it be seen to support a Government which cannot pay the going rate for incompetency or misleading of this House.  To be consistent, it should send its troops to demand a head, with a script similar to its now famous, or infamous, Albert and Harry sketch.</P>
      <P>It is clear to everyone, with the exception of the Minister and the Taoiseach, that a blunder of catastrophic proportions has been made on this occasion, of which the full effects may not yet be known.  Yet speaker after speaker on the Government side tried to tell us that nothing is wrong, that what happened is a matter of no import and that the Minister can continue as heretofore.  Whose confidence does she retain? Perhaps she has the confidence of the Taoiseach who still believes that she is the best Minister for Justice in recent history.  What history is he reading?  What Cabinet meetings does he attend? What television reports does he watch?  I wonder is he on the same planet as the rest of us.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach has any understanding of the importance of the Cabinet decision taken last August and the failure on successive occasions to act upon it, he is living in a world of his own if he thinks such negligence is not deserving of sanction.  Suspected criminals who have been charged with the most serious crimes, some in conjunction with the two worst crimes this year, maybe even this decade, have had to be released because of the incompetence of the Minister and her departmental staff.  In any other democracy the Minister would have read the reports of such events in the evening papers as she rode home on the DART as a private citizen.</P>
      <P>It ill behoves the Government, with its grandiose claims about openness and transparency &mdash; perhaps for some members of the Government, glasnost and perestroika might be more appropriate &mdash; to have the unmitigated nerve to tell us that in the Department of Justice it is business as usual.  That is not good enough. The Minister is on trial for her political life.  The Taoiseach's political judgment is equally at stake as is the Attorney General's understanding of the responsibilities of his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheer cheek of this Government is breathtaking.  If the Minister for Justice has confidence voted in her tonight, and the political <Col N="968" /> arithmetic suggests she may well survive, what members of the public can view her with any confidence? How can somebody with as many blunders, political mistakes and black marks beside her preside over an effective police force, prison service and courts system?  Two elements of those services already have been taken from her which hardly amounts to a vote of confidence.</P>
    <P>Gardaí risked their lives, and continue to do so daily, to bring suspected criminals and subversives to justice.  They have had the sickening experience of seeing the work they did and the risks they took thrown to the winds by the Minister for Justice last Thursday morning. That must have been a bitter sight.  How can they have confidence in a Minister who has required the gates of our prisons to be thrown open to accommodate her negligence?</P>
    <P>What if the business of the Special Criminal Court, with a discharged Judge Dominick Lynch still sitting, had been to sentence the killers of Garda Gerry McCabe or Veronica Guerin on conviction rather than remand prisoners who had only been charged with offences?  Upon release there would have been no opportunity to rearrest them on the same charges and they would have walked free on a technicality.  Would the Taoiseach still consider the Minister Deputy Owen the best Minister for Justice in recent history?  Would the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, be happy to continue to support her at the Cabinet table and in public?  I doubt it.  Even they cannot be that naive or foolish or think the public that foolish either.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister look the Garda Commissioner in the eye and assure him that everything is rosy and it is business as usual? Everything is not rosy and we cannot have business as usual.  The trust is broken, confidence is gone and it is time for the Minister to go too. If there was a Department of boobs, leaks and blunders in this Government, Deputy Owen would be at its head.</P>
    <P>There was a time when it was felt the Tánaiste was the only one to drop the ball when the pressure was on, but the Minister for Justice can hardly keep the ball in her hands these days.  The Government defence is under strain and it appears the role of the Labour Party and Democratic Left is to be two props holding up the scrum which is about to collapse at any moment.  While the political accountability for this disaster rests with the Minister alone, the responsibility for what happened goes far wider than that.</P>
    <P>I know a Government Minister cannot and will not see every letter that comes into her Department.  Even the public, remote from the administrative centre, understands that.  What the Minister would see, however, are the important letters and those that come to her marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo;.  The letters from the Attorney General must surely fall into the &ldquo;important&rdquo; category and come through the administrative system.  On the other hand, letters which are not <Col N="969" /> date stamped must fall into the &ldquo;personal&rdquo; category.  That is the reason I consider it most likely the undated, unstamped letter from Judge Lynch was addressed to the Minister personally. Good civil servants did not open and date stamp it but handed it to the Minister.  The civil servants in the Minister's Departments have little to be proud of in regard to the statements they have issued.</P>
    <P>I regret time constraints prevent me from going into further detail on this issue.  Suffice to say that the public will not be fooled.  They know, even if the Government does not, what is the proper and honourable course in this instance.  If this House is not in a position to apply the proper sanctions, I have no doubt the electorate will in due course.</P>

      <P>In boxing terms, few Members on the Opposition side of the House have laid a glove on this Government; I am not sure if any of them can do so between now and 8.30 p.m.  I am surprised at their inability to stand behind their own motion.</P>
      <P>I have known the Minister since she was first elected to this House.  She shared an office with me in those early years and since that time I know her to be a person of honesty and credibility, a caring individual who has the interest of everything she does in public life at heart.  I am happy to support her in this motion of confidence tabled by the Government of which I am proud to have been a member for almost two years.</P>
      <P>It is probably fair to say Fianna Fáil Deputies are suffering from over anxiety.  They have not prepared properly for this fight and have chosen the wrong pitch on which to fight it.  An opportunity will present itself in 1997 when we will see their ability on the political playing field. Much to their disappointment, and to their awe in some cases, this partnership Government has set new standards in reforming many areas of life and has introduced much new and effective legislation.  In addition, it has been in a position to introduce much needed reform of the legislative process in the Oireachtas.  The establishment of additional Dáil committees has helped to speed the passage of legislation through the Houses with the minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> The results of prudent management of the economy and careful political decisions are clear. We have a booming economy, a low inflation rate and unacceptably high levels of unemployment are on a downward spiral.  Careful management of the economy has made us one of the top three economies set to meet the demanding Maastricht criteria for entry to economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999.  That has made us the envy of many other countries in Europe, something we would have thought utterly impossible a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The Government also has a proud record in the reform of social legislation.  Last week the necessary legislation which allows divorce for couples whose marriages have irretrievably broken down passed through the Seanad.  Third level education has been made more freely available to all and there have been major reforms in the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has there been more obvious reforms than in the Department of Justice.  Credit must go initially to the Minister Deputy Owen who, as the Taoiseach already pointed out, has shown herself to be the best and most effective Minister in this post in recent years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is very wide of the mark when it suggests the Department of Justice is being stripped of half its responsibilities.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It should be pointed out to Opposition Members that the Minister for Justice and the Government will remain responsible for formulating policy for the new agencies that will administer both the courts and the prisons.  It is unfair to suggest new agencies can trump up new policies overnight.  The policies will be those of the Minister and the Government and they will be administered by the agencies.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest the far reaching reforms of the criminal justice system announced yesterday are a fire brigade response by the Government.  No Minister has ever been more active in this area than Deputy Owen.  From the time she was appointed Minister for Justice she has advocated reforms of both the courts and the prisons.  Not only has she been a champion of these reforms, she has also formulated the policy on how to deal with them.</P>
    <P>It is convenient for the Opposition to forget the publication of the first report on management and financing of the courts which was approved by the Government on 21 May this year.  The Government also approved in principle the primary recommendation of that report that an independent body be established to manage a unified courts system.  That is precisely what the Taoiseach announced and what the Government approved in principle.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed by civil servants, politicians and members of the media that the arrival of Deputy Owen in St. Stephen's Green introduced an air of openness to a previously largely secretive Government Department.  As Minister of State Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, there are no more instances of Ministers for <Col N="971" /> Justice trundling across St. Stephen's Green with passports falling out of every pocket.  Within the natural security restraints which must exist, the Minister has tried valiantly to open up the Department of Justice and make it a thoroughly modern organisation ready to meet the challenges of the 21st century.  The innovative measure announced by the Taoiseach will further that process.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into detail on the issue of Mr. Justice Dominic Lynch and whether the Minister did or did not see his letters.  I was struck, however, by what Deputy Kenneally said. He seemed to imply that this undated letter was handed to the Minister by what he termed a good civil servant and was then clipped to a file.  His allegation is that the Minister received, opened and read the letter, climbed up two flights of stairs and clipped it to a file which is now being examined as part of the independent and open inquiry which the Minister announced.  What nonsence.  All these events have been repeatedly analysed in this House during the past 26 hours.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few comments on the Minister, a party and ministerial colleague with whom I have worked since she became a Member.  Before she entered politics she was an active member of a number of voluntary organisations which have had a major impact in her native area of Malahide.  Since entering the Dáil in 1981 she has shown herself to be a dedicated public representative.  This culminated in her appointment as deputy leader of Fine Gael in March 1993.  Her skills and abilities were rewarded when the Taoiseach appointed her to the Justice portfolio.  She was faced with a number of challenges which threatened the roots of our society, notably the drugs epidemic and organised crime.  Through initiatives and legislation, these twin evils are being met by the Government and many of the crime bosses have felt the heat so badly they have gone into hiding in other countries.  They are not safe there, thanks to new directives agreed with our European partners which mean that wanted criminals are no longer safe in traditional hideouts like Amsterdam and Spain.  The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau will probably go down in history as the singular critical measure which thwarted the nefarious activities of the Irish underworld, especially the Dublin one.</P>

      <P>The result of these measures, which have been painstakingly examined to ensure they do not interfere with the natural rights of our citizens, has begun to appear.  In the months ahead, as more measures are implemented and the fight against crime intensifies, we can expect to see the dividends of these measures yield one hundredfold.  As a result of the Minister's direct actions, there are now more prison places and more judges in the courts <Col N="972" /> than before and the most efficient procedures are in place for tackling serious crime.  More gardaí have been recruited and better trained to cope with the demands of modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>More back-up facilities for the Garda, including air support, have been provided. The latest technology has been made available to the force.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that we must investigate the controversial issues of the past week.  It was while watching the film about her famous granduncle that the Minister first heard about the potential legal difficulties arising from the administrative failure to inform Mr. Justice Lynch that his request to be removed from the Special Criminal Court had been granted.  Even before the film was over, the Minister had already taken immediate action by ordering that a number of prisoners be released from Portlaoise Prison and rearrested.  At all times the security of the State and the proper administration of justice were her top priorities.  The due process of law is being applied to these 16 prisoners and we must await the final outcome of these hearings.  Given the limited amount of information available to her at the time, the Minister is to be commended on her swift action to protect the interests of the State.  No Minister from any party could have acted more responsibly.  The Minister then followed up her investigations by appointing an independent inquiry of two very distinguished people who have total freedom to prepare their report.  That will be presented by the Minister at next week's Government meeting.  No Minister could have acted more swiftly.  Furthermore, the Minister has promised to publish that report and to come into this House and answer any questions which Members may wish to ask.</P>
      <P>This action by the Minister contrasts sharply with that of previous Fianna Fáil Governments who achieved something of an international reputation for attempting to conceal the facts.  I need only point to the infamous beef tribunal where the chairman, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, commented that, if there had been a full revelation of all the facts to the Dáil, there would have been no need for an inquiry which cost the taxpayer millions of pounds.  Fianna Fáil's tradition has consistently been to tell only on a need-to-know basis.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it cannot aspire to what it had for too long.  It is precisely because of this failure that it is now in Opposition and not in Government.  It failed to build up any trust with the Progressive Democrats, although that is being attempted now, and the attempted coalition with the Labour Party ended in downright disaster, principally because of a lack of trust and integrity.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Minister for Justice proposed a major reform of our bail laws which will make it more difficult for regular offenders to be granted bail.  The referendum on this will take place shortly.  Polls have shown that in proposing this measure the Minister and the Government have the support of the majority of the people.</P>
      <P>The success of the Minister and her Government colleagues in the northern talks process has been of enormous benefit to me as Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Our trade figures are at record levels &mdash; £30 billion in exports.  Thanks to the continuing co-operation and goodwill of my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Baroness Denton, I had the privilege this week of launching a new all-Ireland £30 million investment in tourism which will promote this island as a single destination.  Yesterday, for the first time ever, at the second largest travel trade fair in the world in Earl's Court, London, the Ireland stand was a single stand for the benefit of the people and economy of this island, north and south.  There is everything to gain from the promotion of the island as a single entity and that is what we are doing.  Before we can do that, a level of trust, integrity and co-operation must be demonstrated and that is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few Ministers have worked harder than the Minister for Justice in promoting her case at Cabinet and in encouraging Government to respond to the difficulties of crime.  Fianna Fáil seem to have a fixation about Attorneys General. To bring the Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson, into this, a man of the utmost integrity and absolute commitment to the State and Constitution, is <Col N="974" /> nothing short of disgraceful.  It is difficult to take on trust a party which has a history of involvement in Government with a number of parties.  Its fixation with Attorneys General goes back a couple of years to a well-documented occasion when an Attorney General appointed by the Fianna Fáil Government was brought into these environs at 2 a.m. with an overcoat over his pyjamas.  That level of trust and activity is something which cannot be condoned.  For Fianna Fáil to attempt to bring the Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson, into this row, when he had nothing to do with it, is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, spoke previously about temporary little arrangements.  The strength of this Government is the openness and accountability which is displayed between the leaders of the parties and the discussion of the issues of Government.  In this case the Minister has responded swiftly, immediately and for the good of everybody by sorting this business out.  I am sure that when she comes into the House with her report next week she will answer any questions comprehensively.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Owen is one of the best Ministers for Justice ever, and women are reacting to the attacks by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the weekend while this was unravelling one could see the pep in the step of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  They could see the mercs and the perks; they thought they were back in power again.  When Commissioner Padraig Flynn was in Mayo he used to talk about &ldquo;the car with the star&rdquo;.  Members of Fianna Fáil will have to wait a long time for the cars with the stars.  We have a star in this Government, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and she will be with us for a long time to come.  She has done nothing wrong and everybody in the country knows that.  Fianna Fáil are jumping on the bandwagon in the belief that they will be back in Government in a few weeks time.  I have news for them.  The people of this country are satisfied with the performance of this Government.  They have had enough of Fianna Fáil.  I remember when a car with a star was overturned in Tralee.  The Tánaiste, who is from <Col N="975" /> Tralee will not want to remind the House of that, but I will say it for him.  I remember when those cars contained machine guns down in Kerry.</P>
    <P>Nothing like that happened when Deputy Owen became Minister for Justice.  When she came into office she was landed with problem after problem, problems she inherited from Fianna Fáil.  Coming from the film &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo; last Sunday night a Fianna Fáil supporter told me that with Fianna Fáil backers with plenty of money they would make a Fianna Fáil version of it, but Deputy Owen is there for the long haul and no attack by Fianna Fáil will damage her because she is a woman of quality, a woman of compassion and, most important, a woman of ability.  She has proved that.</P>
    <P>The first item she identified on coming into Government was the problem with the bail laws. I am glad that, in spite of their attacks on the Minister, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will be supporting the Minister in the next month to get the referendum passed.  They recognise the Minister's quality and that she was right when she identified these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Members, male or female, did not take exception to Deputy Ring's sexist remarks.  When I see a Minister it does not matter to me whether that person is a man or a woman.  If he or she is doing a good job I will not complain.  We are having this debate not because the Minister is a woman but because she is incompetent and has failed to do her duty.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that two years ago the Minister sat on this side of the House shouting across at the then Taoiseach and Government about a whole series of issues, particularly the fact that there was a seven month delay in dealing with a matter in the Attorney General's office.  Deputy Owen could not believe that a file could be left unattended for seven months in the Attorney General's office.  According to Deputy Owen, and her colleagues in Fine Gael and Democratic Left, it was a conspiracy, a cover-up, a sinister plot by the Attorney General, by the Government, by the Taoiseach, by the Church, by everybody.  At that time Deputy Owen expected someone to be held politically responsible for the fact that a file was left lying in an office for seven months.  She expected the Attorney General to pay for that mistake but she also expected somebody to pay politically.  Ultimately a Taoiseach paid the price, even though he had less knowledge about that file than had the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen, who was present at a Cabinet meeting which agreed to delist Judge Lynch &mdash; and she was personally charged with <Col N="976" /> responsibility for so doing &mdash; is pleading ignorance of the fact that the judge and the courts were not informed.  A decision which she knew about, which she had responsibility to discharge, sat in her Department for three months and she did nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister for Justice to know every judge sitting in all the courts, but I do expect her to know a little bit more about the judges sitting in the most sensitive court in this land.  The Minister's explanation for not discharging her duty is that she did not see the letter from the Attorney General, that she did not see the letter or letters from the judge.  I am told that the Protocol in this House is that, in the absence of direct evidence to the contrary, one must accept that the Minister is telling the truth when she makes statements in the House.  I accept that Protocol, but there are thousands of people outside this House who are under no such constraint and I know what they believe and, if the Deputies opposite are listening to what is being said, they know what people believe.</P>
    <P>If we accept what the Minister said, it means that a situation exists within the Department of Justice and within the Minister's own private office whereby she is not allowed to read her own mail, mail which is marked for her attention, mail which is marked personal.  Does the Minister honestly expect anyone outside this House to believe that a letter from the Attorney General's office or from a judge is not shown to the Minister when it arrives in her private office?  Could anyone outside this House believe that a judge in the most sensitive court in this land could write a letter to the Minister and that the Minister would not see it?  Can any person imagine the Attorney General and a judge writing to the Minister and someone in the Minister's office deciding that these letters are not important enough to bring to the Minister's attention?  It beggars belief.  Whose correspondence does the Minister read? Obviously not that of a senior judge or the Attorney General.  In this scenario it is possible to believe the Minister does not read correspondence from the Garda Commissioner, the Chief Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor, and that letters and files in her office are collecting dust because she does not read them.</P>
    <P>It is plausible that there is a letter from the Taoiseach which has lain in her office for some time and which outlines his regret that because of the Allied-Brink's débâcle, the delay in providing extra prison spaces, the upset caused to Deputy Spring and Deputy De Rossa when the Minister announced a bail referendum prematurely, the shredding of the Duncan extradition document and other matters, he was reluctantly requesting her resignation.  It is possible that such a letter, marked &ldquo;Personal&rdquo;, is lying in the Minister's office and she has not seen it.  It is possible because apparently the members of the <Col N="977" /> Government have so much trust in each other that they do not even talk to each other.</P>
    <P>That might sound implausible or even cynical but it is no more implausible than some of the comments from the Government in the last few days.  Is it more implausible than the fact that the Minister for Justice saw none of the letters to which we have referred or that the Minister, having been alerted to the Attorney General's letter on 5 November, went home and did nothing about it until the following day or that the Minister went to the cinema when the crisis was developing and returned to the film when the scale of the problem was known or that the Minister went from the cinema to a party in Dublin Castle while 16 prisoners were released and rearrested?  Is it more implausible than the fact that the Minister told the House last Thursday that she would present full information even though she decided prior to speaking that she would not mention a second letter from Judge Lynch?  At a minimum, the Minister should have told the House she had the letter but was not sure of its date.  She knew she had the letter before she came to the House and when she was questioned about this matter, but she withheld that information for the spurious reason that it might confuse us or somebody who was involved in the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the Dáil two years ago that the truth should not be drip fed but that is precisely what she has done in recent days.  There were many words and hypocrisy from the Minister two years ago and we are getting the same now.  Yesterday the Taoiseach defended the role of the Attorney General in this affair.  It was clear he intended to exonerate Mr. Gleeson from blame.  It is difficult to reconcile the Government's approach with the approach taken by the same Deputies to the former Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan.  Deputy O'Donoghue put it aptly last night when he said: &ldquo;Harry Whelehan did not know and did nothing, Dermot Gleeson did know and did nothing.  Who is more culpable?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke about the Government's success and claimed credit for everything. However, there was not a word in his speech about the Northern Ireland peace process.  We know what the Taoiseach thinks of the process from the remarks he made in Cork.  It is obvious he still does not think much of it.  He spoke about the function of the Attorney General and likened it to advising a client.  He stated: &ldquo;Clients, once advised, are normally responsible for action to be taken on foot of advice given by a professional adviser&rdquo;.  Later he said that clients are expected to take responsibility for implementing advice received.  It is clear from the Taoiseach's remarks that if the Attorney General is not responsible the responsibility lies with his client, the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Another interesting part of the Taoiseach's speech dealt with the inquiry that has been <Col N="978" /> established.  I have not seen its terms of reference but I understand from the Taoiseach's remarks during Question Time that the members of the inquiry will be able to seek explanations from anybody inside or outside the public service who can throw light on anything in the file or the issues surrounding it.  Does that mean the inquiry can ask the Minister the serious and pertinent questions it must ask?  It is necessary to ask what procedures the Minister has in place to ensure letters of an urgent nature are brought to her attention.  She also must be asked what procedures were put in place to ensure that letters marked &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; are brought to her attention immediately.</P>
    <P>These questions are vital to the inquiry and must be answered.  If the Minister has no such procedures she cannot hold a civil servant responsible for this debacle, as Government speakers continually tried to do today.  The Minister must shoulder responsibility for what happened because it is her duty to give leadership and direction to her Department.  She has singularly failed to do that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach outlined Deputy Owen's achievements last night.  He omitted the most important one.  After more than a decade, this Government has devised a response to GUBU. It is called NORA.  When this Government is in trouble it shouts NORA, not our responsibility anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>From its first days this Government has shown signs of being out of touch with the needs of the nation.  It was abundantly clear that a coalition of three parties which represented the extremes in Irish political life was bound to result in a major lack of focus and direction in policy formulation.  It was also clear that the only unifying force was the desire to obtain power and retain it at all costs. However, the most cynical observer could not have anticipated how wrong the rainbow coalition could have gone in so short a time.</P>
      <P>The anticipated lack of clarity and direction in policy has become a reality in practically all arms of Government.  Aside from the scandals and conflicts which have dogged this Administration, there is a list of issues which have either been put on the long finger or shelved.  What happened to the urgent need to deal with Cabinet confidentiality?  Does anybody hear any more talk about the third banking force?  What is the Government's policy on consolidation of our vital agriculture based industries?  How are the serious problems of social deprivation and inequality to be tackled?  How can we make serious inroads in the battle against crime and particularly against the alarming development of a drugs culture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage it is a waste of time to expect an indication of decisive action from the Government on these issues.  Its track record is there for everybody to see and it is one of which one cannot be proud.  The Government's brief history has been littered with scandals and <Col N="979" /> mistakes which are depressing to recall.  In the midst of this shambles even the most cynical person would expect that the core issues affecting Irish society would be protected from the rot which set in so early in many aspects of Government.</P>
    <P>We confidently expected our system of justice would be in safe hands irrespective of the other disasters that regularly occur.  Unfortunately we had ominous early indications that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, was finding it impossible to come to terms with her brief.  The lack of legislative proposals from the Minister was hidden to some degree by the excellent work of Opposition spokespersons Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy O'Donnell.  On many occasions the Minister refused to meet these Deputies halfway in a constructive manner. Instead, she adopted a negative approach and mindlessly opposed many excellent proposals from those Deputies, particularly in the criminal law area.  When the Minister eventually woke up to the fact that crime was getting out of control, in the absence of legislation she lamely adopted Fianna Fáil Bills as a last resort.</P>
    <P>The Minister's record in the management of operational issues has been equally disastrous. For example, her lack of information on the Brinks Allied raid and the Urlingford drugs fiasco was alarming to say the least.  This did not deter her from availing of photo opportunities whenever possible.  Her abject failure to deal decisively with the divisions in the Garda representative bodies has also been damaging. The only two areas where the Minister made an attempt to influence the course of events were in relation to the bail laws and the crisis in prison accommodation.  Were it not so important her management of the bail laws would be laughable.</P>
    <P>Early last year she told the nation on the &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; television programme she would be organising the necessary referendum in the near future.  Her public statement, obviously, was made without prior consultation with her Cabinet colleagues.  Consequently, colleagues such as the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who at that stage were attempting to cling to some remnants of their liberal agenda, were quick to put her firmly in her place.  In the midst of all this bungling many law abiding citizens had to pay the price for the shambles in Government since they became victims of crime carried out by hardened criminals released on bail.  If this was not enough the Minister was equally unsuccessful in tackling one of the main reasons which has led to the liberal interpretation of our bail laws by the courts, the serious shortage of prison spaces throughout the country.  At a time when the Minister for Finance is only too happy to tell all and sundry about the surplus of cash in the national coffers, the Minister has failed in her attempt to obtain meaningful support for her extremely modest development programme. <Col N="980" /> Thus, the events of last week come against a background of total ineffectiveness on the part of the Minister combined with a widespread failure on the part of the Government to carry out its duties to the nation.</P>
    <P>The examples of standards and failures on the part of this Government are too numerous to mention.  We do not have to go back far to recall the bi-location of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, the hepatitis C scandal, the totally insensitive handling of illegal immigrants and ministerial resignations.  The net effect of these events has been to undermine the very structures which the Government is contracted to protect and the general weakening in the quality of political life and debate in this House.  When any Government puts aside the key principle of accountability there is only one path open, a path downwards.  Even at the 23rd hour the Taoiseach must act decisively if he is to retain even the smallest amount of credibility and respect.</P>
    <P>The facts relating to the Special Criminal Court debacle are clear.  The Government made a decision in early August to transfer Judge Lynch, at his request, from the court and the Minister failed to take the necessary steps to ensure this decision was implemented immediately.  I am tired of observing the drip feed of information on this matter when a four year old child could readily assess the situation.  Clearly, the Minister did not take the trouble to pursue the decision as is her solemn duty.  One wonders whether she has applied the same level of efficiency to implement the other Cabinet decisions over the past two years.</P>
    <P>It is clear the Attorney General was aware of the non-implementation of the decision at an early stage.  Clearly, he did not rate the matter as being sufficiently important to either telephone or fax the Minister or raise the matter at one of their, presumably, regular meetings.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the House is right to reaffirm its confidence in the Government, the members of which, individually and collectively, have been working hard for the past two years as a united and cohesive team, dedicated to serving the public interest.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, have been two dedicated and outstanding Cabinet colleagues who have my full and unqualified support and that of all members of the Government.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary on an occasion such as this for me to outline the many achievements of my colleagues and the progress made in my Department in the past two years.  Those achievements are facts which stand on their own merits.  The Opposition cannot credibly dispute those achievements.  Instead, it seeks to argue that the House should withdraw its confidence in the Government as a result of the handling of the delisting of Judge Lynch.  This is an entirely fatuous and opportunistic argument for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>It is said the Minister for Justice should resign because of errors made within her Department of which she did not have knowledge.  Frankly, this is a ludicrous argument.  Is the fate of every Minister in every Government of every political persuasion to be held hostage to termination at random, because of some action or inaction of which the Minister had no knowledge?  That would be a most unjust and unwise policy and I totally reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that errors did occur.  She has accepted the gravity of the mistakes made.  She has accepted political responsibility for what happened in her Department.  She cannot reasonably be asked to <Col N="982" /> resign over something about which she had no knowledge whatever.  A distinction must be drawn between constitutional, legal and political responsibility for actions of officials, on the one hand, and personal or moral responsibility on the other.  The Minister has constitutional, legal and political responsibility for what happens in her Department but she could only credibly be asked to resign if she had a personal involvement in the action taken &mdash; in other words, if she had a personal or moral responsibility or, to use a term referred to yesterday, if she had culpability.  This was obviously not the case.</P>
    <P>It is also said the Minister should resign for not having had sufficient control over the actions within her Department.  I do not accept that suggestion.  A Minister is entitled to assume, unless there is reason to believe the contrary, that instructions given will be carried out, that Government decisions made will be implemented and that any actions consequential on ministerial directions will be taken.  If it were shown that a Minister approved some departure from this practice the position would be different.  That is not the case in the Minister's situation.</P>
    <P>It is also said the Minister should resign because she did not inform the House of the existence of the second letter from Judge Lynch when she addressed the House last week.  Clearly, the steam has been taken out of this argument by the publication of the actual text of the letter itself yesterday.  The letter is, to say the least, innocuous.  Its contents do not exactly cry out for attention.  It is easy to envisage how the Minister could have concluded, in the brief time available to her, that her state of knowledge as to the letter did not warrant her departing from her speech in order to mention it specially.  It was undated by the sender, it was not date stamped.  She ordered that the letter form part of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is made that the Minister is in some way being punished for this incident or, as it is put, denuded of her powers.  This suggestion is totally misconceived.  The Government decided, on the Minister's proposal, to establish new structures to improve the management of the courts and prisons.  I believe those structures are long overdue and it is a credit to the Minister, Deputy Owen, that she is the one to introduce them.  This is not a question of removing powers from the Minister for Justice.  It is a question of separating the policy role, which remains with the Minister, from the role of administration, which is to be devolved to the new authorities.  It is worth noting that prior to recent events, the Government had already agreed to the setting up of a courts service and work was already progressing on the setting up of a prisons agency.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the decision to set up an authority to manage the prison service.  This was a recommendation of the Committee on the Penal System chaired by Dr. T. K. Whitaker in 1985. When, in his previous capacity as a Member of the other House, my colleague Deputy Costello moved a Bill in the other House to implement the <Col N="983" /> Whitaker Report during the lifetime of the 1989-92 Government, the parties opposite would not facilitate leave to allow the Bill even to be published.  The subject of prison reform has at times been neglected over the years and I pay tribute to Deputy Costello for his work in keeping it on the agenda.  I look forward to the early enactment of the new legislation.  I hope we can also look forward to consideration of inclusion of structures for parole and for long sentence review in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has also chosen to raise the role of the Attorney General in this affair and, by implication, the Taoiseach as the member of Government politically answerable for the Attorney General's office.  The criticisms of the Attorney have no foundation whatsoever. Deputy O'Donoghue makes great play of what he calls the Attorney's constitutional role as guardian of the public interest and considers that this role should have required the Attorney to take action in the matter.  This argument is presented with almost breathtaking effrontery by the Deputy and contains more misconceptions than I have time to deal with in this contribution.</P>
    <P>The Attorney's primary constitutional role is as legal adviser to the Government.  His public interest role exists on the legal, not the constitutional, level and is by no means a general roving licence to do good in any and all matters, public and private.  It is not in particular a licence to do the work of Ministers.  The Attorney did more than enough in writing letters which he was not obliged to write, which he had every right to assume would be acted upon, and which in any case he had no obligation to follow up.</P>
    <P>The speeches from Members opposite commit a serious logical and legal error in confusing the roles of legal adviser &mdash; a role which the present occupant of the office of Attorney General occupies with tremendous skill, helpfulness, and ability &mdash; and the role of Minister, with the responsibility to account for decisions taken or not taken.</P>
    <P>There has also been reference to officials.  I make no comment on this aspect because I do not wish to prejudge the results of the inquiry. However, I do not think we should automatically seek to hang officials for any and every error made by them.  Despite the fact that the mistake made in not implementing the Government decision was extremely serious, we should be open to hearing explanations if and when they are forthcoming.  None of us is more than human and not every offence is, or should be, either a sacking offence or unforgivable.</P>
    <P>All the facts have yet to emerge and clearly there are many lessons for the future.  One obvious lesson is that Government decisions affecting the legal position of third parties should not take effect on the day they are made, unless there is a guarantee of immediate communication of such decisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> I await the inquiry with great interest. However, in the meantime, I have no hesitation in urging the House to reaffirm its confidence in this Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and affirm my confidence in the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>That the Government decision of 1 August was not communicated to Mr. Justice Lynch with due speed, and the consequences of that, is a very serious matter.  None of us denies this.  Deficient systems and procedures must be rectified without any delay to ensure the situation is never repeated.  To maintain public trust in our democracy, our systems of public administration must always be capable of administering Government decisions with due speed and efficiency.  Where reforms are necessary to achieve this, the issues must be tackled head on and necessary improvements made.  That is both the lesson of recent events and what people rightly expect.</P>
      <P>There is a need to reform the public service.  I served as a civil servant 25 years ago.  In many ways the systems in place today have evolved little in that time.  I have great respect for the dedicated work of individual civil servants and the ethos of public service they bring to their job. There is a need to reform systems within the public service and to devise new management tools to prioritise work and ensure proper procedures are in place.  I believe the major reform task until the turn of the century will be that of ensuring the Public Service delivers quality service to this House, the Government and the public it serves.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice and I were both elected to Dublin County Council on the same day in June 1979.  I have known Deputy Owen since that time as a woman of great ability, integrity, ideas, imagination, hard work and commitment.  We have been on opposite sides of the table on various occasions.  I have had my differences with her at council level but have always found her direct, straightforward, keen to get the job done and above all, a woman of great integrity.  Recent events have demonstrated these qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a major mistake to fail to implement a Government decision in the Department of Justice.  However, as soon as the Minister was belatedly told of the nature of the mistake, she immediately acted to rectify, as far as possible, what had happened.  She released those who had been unlawfully detained and established an independent inquiry with no holds barred.  This will be conducted by two eminent people, Mr. Seán Cromien, who has a profound knowledge of the public service and Dr. Ed Molloy, a respected consultant.  They will examine the files, talk to those involved and discover what went wrong and what can be put right.  There is a strong <Col N="985" /> commitment to put any systems deficiency right. That report will be before the House next week and will be publicly debated.  The Minister will answer questions and be accountable to the House.</P>

    <P>The Government is doing the job it was mandated to do in December 1994 on the basis of an agreed programme and in a spirit of co-operation and trust, with due respect for each party's genuine concerns, traditions and sensitivities.  We need look no further than its economic record to have confidence in the Government.  We have the fastest growing economy in Europe.  When I attend meetings in Europe my colleagues ask me how we managed to achieve record growth in the economy and reduce the number of unemployed.  Over the past two years 93,000 new jobs have been created and <Col N="986" /> these have been translated into a reduction in unemployment and the availability of more jobs for school leavers, women who wish to return to the workforce and returned emigrants.  The record low level of inflation has helped to maintain fixed incomes and the incomes of pensioners, while low interest rates, which are of particular benefit to people with mortgages, have encouraged investment by businesses.  Investors and consumers have confidence in the economy and prudent management of the public finances by the Government has ensured that we are well within the Maastricht criteria.  The Government's performance in regard to the economy has been excellent.</P>

      <P>The Government has reduced not only the overall level of unemployment but also the number of long-term unemployed.  The 1995 Labour Force Survey shows that the number of long-term unemployed fell by 25,000 and that there was a greater decrease in the number of long-term unemployed than in the number of short-term unemployed. The focus on long-term unemployment, an issue dear to Deputy O'Rourke's heart, is beginning to pay off.  However, more needs to be done in this area and we must not forget the need for special policies.  The rising tide does not lift all boats.  The Government's focus on long-term unemployment is beginning to pay off and this is a source of satisfaction.  The Government is working in a cohesive way and will complete the tasks it set for itself on its formation.</P>

      <P>The Dáil is debating the political accountability and culpability of the Minister for Justice.  Mr. Seán Cromien is undertaking the administrative inquiry while we are holding the political inquiry.  It is important to mark that distinction.  Initially the Minister and the Government sought to have the entire fiasco dealt with by way of the administrative inquiry and valiant efforts were made by Government spokespersons to have the debate postponed. Before I deal with this political mismanagement saga, I wish to state clearly that I am not laying a personal charge against the Minister for Justice; rather I am making a charge of incompetency and mishandling by a Minister in charge of an extremely important Government portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is personable and hard working but endless activity and amiability must be accompanied by a clear edged authority by those in charge of a Department of State.  There is a marked lack of <Col N="987" /> authority and incoherence in all the mishaps which have befallen the Minister.  Previous Opposition speakers catalogued the list of earlier catastrophes and I do not intend to revisit that terrain.  However, I intend dealing with the present debacle which began when the Minister brought to Cabinet her memoranda regarding the delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch.</P>
    <P>Presumably there was a discussion at the Cabinet table, with the sponsoring Minister endorsing her view.  There was a clear and unequivocal political responsibility on the Minister to ensure that the Government decision was acted upon and subsequently implemented. This action has three distinct phases, all of which are political: (1) preparation and supervision of the memorandum for Cabinet; (2) discussion and endorsement by Cabinet of that memorandum and (3) ensuring the implementation of the decision within the Department.  Actions (1) and (2) were carried through but the crucial action of ensuring implementation was casually neglected. The beaches beckoned and blithe Nora went off.</P>
    <P>The months of August and September went by in a haze of inactivity on this issue.  On 2 October the Attorney General disturbed himself on foot of legal rumblings and wrote to the Minister for Justice inquiring about the position of Judge Lynch.  When he received no reply to that letter he wrote a second letter a month later.  Leisurely letters written one month apart is the stuff of an old fashioned, bygone Victorian era.</P>
    <P>I lay a political charge clearly at the door of the Attorney General who has a definite remit as custodian of the public good.  Despite the convoluted explanation given yesterday about the Attorney General and his clients, the facts are clear.  Mr. Dermot Gleeson knew the precise implications of the non-implementation by the Minister for Justice of the Government decision to stand down Judge Lynch.  He took no action, apart, of course, from writing leisurely letters. This is political culpability of the gravest kind which, to put it in its simplest form, could threaten the security of the State.  We are not dealing with petty crime or minor traffic offences but with issues which could fundamentally affect the lives and safety of citizens who should be the primary concern of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>What do the letters contain?  The Taoiseach gave alarming answers to questions today about those letters and undoubtedly there will be more developments in this area.  The programme for Government states that people in high office should make themselves available for scrutiny by Dáil committees.  Given the mystery surrounding his role, the Attorney General should submit himself to scrutiny by the appropriate committee. I ask the Tánaiste to deal with this issue in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice did not, unbelievably, give instructions in her office for letters from such an eminent colleague as the Attorney General to be brought to her attention.  The second letter <Col N="988" /> from Mr. Dermot Gleeson was posted on Friday, 1 November and read by the Minister the following Tuesday.  It is mind boggling urgency and I do not blame An Post for that delay.  More ineptitude by the Minister now emerges cloaked in words like &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; and &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; when she speaks in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister finally read the Attorney General's second letter on Tuesday, 5 November. What was her dramatic intervention then?  She telephoned a principal officer in her Department and then went off without taking any further action.  She went to Belfast on Wednesday and returned to see the film on Wednesday night. Thirty hours after she read the Attorney General's letter, she had to be called out from the film to take action.  She then went back to the film and on to a party.  Endless activity and amiability but no control of her Department.</P>
    <P>That 30 hour gap shows so strongly the Minister's lack of focus, political perception and sense of authority.  The moment the Minister finally read the Attorney General's letter on Tuesday, 5 November alarm bells should have rung.  She should then have acted decisively as the political head of that Department, holding an immediate meeting with her senior officials to devise an urgent strategy.  She should have perused the files and contacted the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is even stranger how it was only as she was preparing for the Dáil debate on Thursday afternoon that Judge Lynch's letter was brought to her attention.  This sequence is quite unbelievable.  It is further compounded given that the Minister came into the Dáil yet did not disclose the existence of the letter.  Later, we were treated to a flimsy excuse but the fact remains that the Minister knew of the letter but did not tell us.  It is obvious that knives are being sharpened for a junior official in the Department of Justice while the Minister quite brazenly wraps herself in the surreal frenzied plaudits of her rainbow colleagues.</P>
    <P>Turning to a more general point, the Government is laden down with programme managers, advisers and press officers.  Is the work of a private secretary and the Minister's private office often diluted by or perhaps merged with the mission of her programme manager?  It is a question worth probing in the context of this debate and I would like to hear Mr. Cromien speaking about this matter next week.  I hope we will hear him.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;trust&rdquo; if often abused.  The Taoiseach said last night the difference between 1994 and 1996 was that trust exists between the three rainbow partners.  This much vaunted trust is based on desperation.  As Johnson said, we either hang together or we hang separately.</P>

The electors are far away from cosy rainbow alliances, waiting for an opportunity to cast their votes.  Arrogance, ineptitude, evasions and mismanagement are the hallmarks of this Government.  They endorse one another, cling together and hope for a new dawn but justice will be meted out to this Government when the general election occurs.  We eagerly await that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for sharing her time with me.  The core issue is how the rainbow arrangement turned into what can only be described as the most farcical Government this State has had to endure since its foundation.  Any expression of confidence in this Government can only be interpreted as the most cynical and self-serving of gestures, and totally unworthy of any self respecting politician.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach and his droll band stumble from disaster to catastrophe, it is only too easy for those of us in Opposition to resort to opportunistic comment and point scoring. However, I do not intend to follow that route since the matter at hand is far too serious.  It would not be going too far to say the abject performance of key figures within the Government is threatening to undermine public confidence in our democratic institutions to an unprecedented degree.  Consequently, unless the current sequence of mistake followed by gross mistake is firmly brought to an end we will all be losers, ultimately.</P>
      <P>It gives me some satisfaction to see and hear those who have adopted the high moral ground for some time, and who have pointed the finger at Fianna Fáil so often, having to come into this House and blatantly try to justify something which is unjustifiable.  There is a trend in all their speeches.  They start off by conceding that this is a serious matter in a sensitive area but nobody will accept ministerial responsibility for it.  They will give us independent bodies, dismantle the Department and set up any kind of quasi-State apparatus rather than apportion responsibility for this.  That is a change for some people.  When we had the last serious problem in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry we got an independent food monitoring authority and now we have another independent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How has the current unbelievable situation occurred where the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues indulge in the most cynical of verbal gymnastics simply to hang on to Government? The root of the problem goes back to the formation of this rainbow Coalition.  As is now only too evident, a mixture of perceived political expediency and weak leadership under pressure resulted in the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, deliberately destroying an excellent Government two years ago.  Bad as this act was in terms of betrayal of trust and political responsibility, the matter was seriously compounded when Deputy Spring and his colleagues attempted to wrap themselves in a blanket of moral superiority while <Col N="990" /> at the same time maligning their Government colleagues without the slightest sense of fair play or honour.</P>

      <P>If at this stage this Government has any genuine interest in what is best for our democratic process, there is only one honourable option available to the Taoiseach and his colleagues.  They should immediately resign from Government.  By taking such a course of action they will responsibly admit the core deficiency of any moral centre to their Administration.  Taking into account the wildly differing agendas of Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left, this simple reality is only too evident even to the most inexperienced bystander.  By resigning, the Government will firmly place the initiative back in the hands of the electorate who will then be in a position to give their verdict on the matter.  The electorate are hard taskmasters, however, and it <Col N="991" /> is not so easy to face them, particularly when one has gone from blunder to disaster.</P>
      <P>It is fine to come into this House and say we have a great economy.  We have many great things but there is no honourable acceptance that the inheritance of a good economic situation was the result of post-1987 economic restructuring and the restoration of the national finances. Unfortunately, from the comments of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, there is no sign of a sense of responsibility or contrition for the appalling mess they have created.  Rather, we have had a series of depressing, shallow and shameless speeches which show no sensitivity to the stark reality that the credibility of their Administration has been well and truly blown apart.  In what can only be described as the ultimate folly, we had the bizarre spectacle yesterday of the Taoiseach expressing total confidence in his Minister for Justice while at the same time using the scalpel to dismantle her Department.  I have never seen such a daft performance in my political life.  If the Taoiseach were captain of a stricken ship, I have no doubt he would confidently blow air bubbles into the hold as it slipped under water.</P>
      <P>As it appears another major scandal will be necessary before this incoherent and fatally damaged Administration is finally forced to leave office, it is necessary to recall its brief history.  The first hiccup came within weeks of it assuming office.  Having regard to the Coalition's unique and comical working definition of the lofty aspirations of openness, transparency and accountability, it is not surprising that the first problem involved the advance leaking of sensitive budget information.  Faced with the fearsome wrath of the Labour Party perched on the high moral ground, the head of the then Minister, Deputy Hogan, had to be sacrificed irrespective of the fact that he had no personal involvement in leaking that information.  The whistle was blown and when the Tánaiste blows the whistle, one has to get out.</P>
      <P>Many people thought the leaking affair would be a once off matter and that the rainbow Coalition would avoid further scandals during its remaining time in office.  It was felt that the lack of meaningful policy potential between the far left, the centre and far right political parties would at least free the Administration to concentrate its energies on self-preservation and self-promotion, while basking in the reflected achievements of the Government that preceded it.  Unfortunately, life is not that simple and Deputy Hogan had barely reached the dugout when the referee &mdash; the Tánaiste &mdash; was again furiously tooting his whistle.  This time it was a Cork Minister's head that was at stake, that of poor Deputy Coveney</P>

Unfortunately, this has led to the break-up of that organisation, to conflicting statements from it and to an undermining of its integrity and neutrality.

      <P>The efforts by Fianna Fáil to implicate the Attorney General is irresponsible and irrational.

Members of Fianna Fáil must believe the electorate has a collective short memory. They would be better employed having consultations with Dr. Anthony Clare rather than with Terry Prone in Carr Communications.  It is obvious they need deep psychological counselling to overcome the trauma of what happened to them two years ago.  Fianna Fáil will need time to get over the mess it created in Government this time two years ago and if the mood of the electorate is anything to go by, it will be given every opportunity to rehabilitate on the Opposition benches during the next five years.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express confidence in the work of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and, in particular, the Minister for Justice.  Instead of attacking the Minister, members of Fianna Fáil should express regret at the state in which they left the criminal justice system, which was stretched to breaking point after eight years.  We should focus on the extraordinary reforming zeal, energy, commitment and persistence which the Minister has shown in dealing with her brief.  The beneficial effects of her reforming zeal will be felt in our criminal justice system for a long time.</P>
      <P>Many demands are made on the Department of Justice on a daily basis and many decisions must be made.  What is important is how people behave in a crisis.  Let us look at how the Minister has behaved in this crisis.  As soon as she realised what was happening, she initiated an inquiry. Natural justice demands that we await the results of that inquiry before we make a judgment or condemn individuals involved in this situation. The Minister came into the Dáil and answered questions and she will be here again when the results of that inquiry are known next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to look at the Minister's record in the Department of Justice.  People have talked about bail reform for many years, yet nobody except this Minister has asked the people to vote in a bail referendum.  There has been much talk about what needs to be done but she has taken action in many important areas.  People have talked about the need to reform our courts system but nothing was done for the past eight years.  Before the announcement was made yesterday, the Minister had already asked Mrs. <Col N="997" /> Justice Susan Denham to head up a commission of inquiry and had given a commitment to implement its recommendations.  People talked about the lack of prison spaces and the revolving door syndrome in our prisons yet this issue was not tackled.  This Government has taken a more proactive approach than any Government to this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has initiated reform in many other areas.  She has provided more Garda resources in Dublin and throughout the country. She has set in place a reorganisation of the Garda force and placed much more emphasis on the victims of crime, a much neglected area for many years.  Last week she received a report on violence against women and is determined to act on that.  For many years people talked about the seizure of criminal assets, but who took action? No one.  Yet within two years the Minister for Justice took action and established the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's party failed to wind it up for the past two days.</P>
      <P>This is a motion of confidence in the Government.  This Government came to office in difficult and unusual circumstances and I will deal with that in more detail later.  Despite that, the Government has presided over the most successful economic period in the history of the State.  It has created more jobs in a two year period than in any comparable period in our history.  It has repaired the damage to the social and economic fabric of our community that was inflicted on it during the period of three years when the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil were in Government.  It has and is presiding over some of the most complex negotiations in the recent history of Europe and is doing so in a manner that has attracted high praise throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has reversed the shameful cuts in health, housing, education, welfare, aid to the developing world and a range of other areas that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had so savagely implemented in their time in a disastrous Government.  It has introduced free third level education for the first time in our history and an entire programme of far reaching reform in the education area.  It has also introduced reforming legislation in the area of <Col N="998" /> family law that had been sought for well over 25 years.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken on the battle against an epidemic of crime and drugs that had been building up for many years.  It has introduced wide-ranging reforms in this area and is totally committed to taking on the drug barons in every area of their activity.</P>
    <P>Is é an Rialtas seo a rinne mórbheart chun saol cultúrtha an phobail a athbheochan, comh maith lenár gcultúr agus ár dteanga arsa dúchais a caomhnú agus a leathnú.

      <P>It has succeeded in getting a fixed date for all-party talks and their commencement.  It has agreed the procedures and ground rules for those talks in intensive negotiations and discussions. The Government works night and day to try to rebuild the process of inclusion that was shattered by the Canary Wharf bomb.  In short, the House is being asked to vote confidence in a Government born in turbulent circumstances, that has been in office for almost two years and can already account for historic achievements in the economy, job creation, Europe, social policy, family law reform, the battle against crime and in the painstaking struggle to further the cause of reconciliation and inclusion in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Those who have sought to blame the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for the problems that undoubtedly exist in that Department might do well to reflect on that fact. <Col N="999" /> It was Fianna Fáil Ministers, some of whom have taken part in this debate, who allowed a culture of obsessive secrecy to be built up in that Department.  They failed to implement the Whitaker report, allowed the management of the courts to get into such a state that they have been in crisis for years and allowed the free legal aid service to run down to a point where battered wives and their children had to be turned away from the centres.</P>
      <P>I have worked closely with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, during the past two years as she has spearheaded the fight against crime and introduced the legal and management reforms necessary in that area.</P>
      <P>I have also worked with her in relation to Northern Ireland at intergovernment level and in the all-party talks.  In all those areas she has been an excellent colleague and contributor and has carried a huge workload with energy and commitment.</P>
      <P>I have also worked with the Attorney General in the same areas and have relied heavily on his advice in others.  One of the more unwarranted attacks in this spurious debate must surely be the attacks on him.  What is the allegation against the Attorney General?</P>

      <P>He advises them on a huge range of issues from constitutional law, to administrative law, to public international law, to criminal law, to commercial and contract law &mdash; every branch of the law and every issue with which a Government becomes involved which has a legal dimension which, in modern society, means virtually every issue.</P>
      <P>Is it seriously suggested that on top of all of this, on top of doing his work as Attorney General and giving legal advice, he is supposed to ensure that his advice is implemented and acted upon?  In my experience a lawyer must advise his client, but it is not his responsibility to ensure that his client acts on that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the logic of the Opposition attack on Dermot Gleeson.  He is criticised for neglecting his job, even though he did it and did it very well. He is also criticised for not doing the administrative work of the Department of Justice. The criticism is patently unjust.  I refer to the equally spurious charge that we have, in some way, removed key responsibilities from the Minister for Justice.  Did the Minister for Finance cease to carry responsibility for the national debt when the NTMA was set up?  Was the Minister for Communications deprived of power when <Col N="1001" /> Telecom Éireann and An Post were established? As Deputies are aware, the answer is no.</P>

It forms an integral part of the programme, A Government of Renewal.  The Minister for Justice's commitment to it stands up well to examination by comparison with that of her predecessor.</P>

      <P>I do not recall Deputy Ahern receiving that speech with such approval at the time it was delivered but, clearly, it has grown on him in the intervening period.  Selective quotation of speeches is not always a great idea.  It seems Deputies Ahern and Harney agree absolutely with the principle of accountability as I tried to define it then, the notion that a Minister is accountable to the Dáil even in respect of a situation in which he or she is not directly culpable.  As they see it, accountability means that one is fired or resigns.</P>
      <P>Deputies Ahern and Harney should perhaps have read that speech a little further.  I went on to set out what it was the Labour Party was trying to achieve at that time.  Three or four paragraphs after the section Deputies Ahern and Harney quote with such approval I put it simply and clearly: &ldquo;What the Labour Party wants is an accounting, a true and fair accounting, and nothing more than that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Instead of concentrating on what is important, the serious problems that must be addressed and resolved, this House is being invited to compare what has happened on this occasion with what happened in 1994.  I am happy to do so.</P>
      <P>In 1994 we had a Government that had set out with high hopes two years earlier to bring about change and peace on this island.  Throughout that year it struggled to deal with issues of trust brought about, in every single instance, by actions not of the Labour Party's making.</P>

We all know about the attempts to implement Government decisions as <i>faits accomplis.</i>  I notice that my absence from Ireland on EU and Presidency business has been a source of great complaint by some of the Fianna Fáil speakers in this debate, even though, in their usual two-faced way, they never tire of demanding that I sort out any problem with an international dimension from Russia to the Great Lakes region.</P>

      <P>We demanded that accountability in writing at the Cabinet table.  Those letters have been published.  We demanded it from the law officer who had overall responsibility for a debacle that should never have happened.  We demanded that there should be accountability before that law officer was promoted to the second highest judicial office in the land because real accountability would not be possible after his promotion but we did not get it.  The Dáil was denied it.  Instead we got a Cabinet meeting which rejected the Attorney General's explanations for the fiasco and then went on to promote him to a post where he was immune from further questioning.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach who rammed that decision through on a Friday tried to pressurise the same person into resigning the following Monday, went on to defend him and all his actions on the Tuesday and excoriated him on the Wednesday.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, did not come into the House last Thursday seeking to evade responsibility or to justify the promotion of anyone to a position where they were immune from accountability.  She did not receive advice from the Attorney General and then tell him it was not going to be used.  She had no note in front of her which said, &ldquo;if pressed, keep repeating the above&rdquo;.  Instead, she came into the House and offered a true and fair accounting, exactly what we looked for in 1994. Even before she came into the House she had begun an investigation.  This did not happen in 1994 when the explanations had been rejected and the decision made anyway.</P>

Despite that, to this day, not one Fianna Fáil person has ever said, &ldquo;we got it wrong in 1994, we should have insisted that Albert Reynolds went into the Dáil and told the whole truth before Harry was promoted&rdquo;.

      <P>That is what really hurts Fianna Fáil.  They were done in by the truth, nothing more, nothing less.  They cannot bear it now when they see a Government Minister facing up to a difficult situation truthfully and honestly, coming into the House and offering the accountability it requires and deserves.</P>
      <P>This three-party coalition under the Taoiseach's leadership has been a good Government.  It is a Government that is prepared to account for mistakes, tell the truth to the House and face the consequences.  It is also a Government that has much work to do.  By the time it faces the electorate it will have added yet more achievement to its record.  It is our intention to continue the work of reform, growth, dynamism and peace.  It will be for the people ultimately to decide who understands and is committed to the principle of accountability.</P>
      <P>I accept fully that the issue of accountability must remain at the heart of our political life.  In addition to the reforms and measures we have already announced, I would like to believe that the belated but welcome conversion of Fianna Fáil would guarantee support for a package of measures that could be finalised quickly and which would make certain that accountability would become, in the phrase of a former Fianna Fáil Minister, a core value of Irish politics.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Industrial Development in Border Counties.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter which is of the utmost importance to the region I represent.  I ask the Minister for Finance to review Border funding so that provision can be made to encompass capital investment for infrastructural development in Border regions.</P>
      <P>The fund for peace and peconciliation, which is 75 per cent funded by the European Union, is distributed on the basis of 80 per cent to Northern Ireland and 20 per cent to the six Border counties.  Funding from that for capital investment &mdash; the building of factories &mdash; has been secured by Northern Ireland.  No such allowance is made for the six Border counties.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Finance for a review based on the reasoning that the much talked about Washington Conference and the matchmaker programme established after the peace process have not delivered the jobs, especially to the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. The partnership programme was set up in 1995 to form a strategic alliance between companies in the Border region and North America.  It is claimed that, since it was established, hundreds of jobs have been created. Of the 15 companies who originally participated and the nine involved at present, not one set up in Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo or Leitrim.  All the companies had to set up in Donegal or Louth. There is a real need, therefore, for factory space.</P>
      <P>We were told, when Oireachtas Members met Forbairt and IDA officials in November 1995, that an approved project could be secured if factory space could be provided in County Monaghan.  Well-serviced sites are available, one of which has a new treatment plant in anticipation of development which failed to materialise.  I ask, therefore, for a re-examination of this funding to give us parity with our counterparts in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke yesterday of the record number of jobs; 46,000 in 1994 and 57,000 in 1995. During the period from November 1994 to September 1996, unemployment in County Monaghan rose from a normal 3,073 to 3,508. This 14 per cent increase is the highest ever.  That calls for action and the only way action will be obtained is to have factory space in the county which has a record in the food industry and furniture manufacturing.  County Cavan also did not fare well but not as badly.  During the same period, it had a 6 per cent increase in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> There should be recognition of those figures and facilities to provide the jobs because it must be recognised that the region's economy was in tatters for 25 years.  It bore the brunt of the northern troubles more than Northern Ireland because the British Government piled in money. I witnessed it in the terminals, harbours, in transport, the airports, etc.  We got nothing.  We suffered then and, when matters improved and there was an expectation that the economy would develop by increased funding, we were still no better off.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this.  Once we were highly developed in the tourism industry and considered fit to compete by the IDA and the industrial development body in Northern Ireland but we now find it very difficult to compete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I had the chance to address Deputy Leonard since he announced his retirement.  He is not gone until he goes and he might change his mind.  Nevertheless, I wish him every happiness in his retirement and he will bring the same grace he has brought to this House to whatever field of endeavour he applies his mind.  He has been consistent on this issue which is dear to his heart. As a result of that and his detailed knowledge of the topic and the rules and regulations governing the two funds from the European Union, he will be aware that the measures under which funding is provided through the medium of the INTERREG and Delors peace programmes was agreed with the Commission at the start of the programmes.  There is no scope for renegotiating the programmes at this stage.  However, and this may be to what Deputy Leonard is referring, the mid-term reviews being carried out on both programmes by independent evaluators may enable some limited adjustments to be made within measures.</P>
      <P>The funding available to the Border region across a wide variety of measures under the programmes is substantial.  There are many other counties which would love to have the same access to money.  The INTERREG and peace programmes between them provide for additional EU funding for the Border region of £120 million. When the full amount of public investment provided under the programmes is taken into consideration, the full extent of additional funding available to the Border region under these programmes exceeds £160 million.  The investment is additional to that which is available to the Border region under the Community Support Framework, other Community initiatives and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding under the various measures of the peace programme was based on the weighting given to the various constituent sectors by the EU Commission task force which took wide-ranging consultations in the target area.  Without exception, all recognised the emphasis the programme needed to place on measures to <Col N="1010" /> support peace and reconciliation.  There was no support for the view that the programme should allocate significant sums to infrastructure.  The overwhelming consensus of those consulted endorsed the view that the prospect of lasting peace requires efforts to overcome the effects of the disruption of normal economic and social relations.  By addressing these challenges, the programme aims to help secure a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>There is some provision for infrastructure investment under sub-programme 3, measure 2, of the programme where nearly £7 million has been made available for road improvements in Border counties.  The programme also contains some other measures which are intended to contribute more directly to economic development, particularly sub-programme 5.</P>
    <P>Measures 1 and 2 of that sub-programme offer some scope for additional assistance in the area of provision of industrial sites.  These measures are administered by the commercial banks and ADM Ltd. respectively.  An essential condition is that relevant Government Departments and the county enterprise boards are involved.  The total amount of funding available to measure 2 is £2 million so it is obvious that the scope is extremely limited.  Any decision on a refocusing or reallocation of funding can only be made with the approval of the joint monitoring committee, which includes Commission representatives as well as representatives of the various sectoral departments and implementing agencies.  The Deputy may be aware of criticism from all sectors in Northern Ireland of the funding of an advance factory in Strabane under this sub-programme. The question of additionality was raised in that connection and I would not like to hear similar criticism levelled should this measure be availed of in a similar way in the Border counties.  It should be noted that considerable investment in infrastructural services in the Border region has been made under the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme.</P>
    <P>When drawing up the INTERREG programme the Government believed that a coherent economic development strategy for the Border region was dependent on infrastructural foundations.  It agreed that the bulk of the funding on the Southern side should be allocated to the infrastructural and environmental sub-programmes. Roads, sanitary services, electricity networks and telecommunications are vital in underpinning tourism, agriculture, food processing and industrial and service sectors.</P>
    <P>The Commission accepted the argument that a significant part of INTERREG funding should be invested in infrastructure, and more than £32 million out of the £72 million was reserved for such areas.  When the matching funding elements provided by the State and State agencies is added, the total available for infrastructure in the Border counties comes to more than £51 million.</P>
    <P>Under the infrastructure sub-programme special emphasis is being placed on investment in <Col N="1011" /> non-national roads additional to the main Operational Programme on Transport.  This includes the improvement of roads of importance to economic and rural community development in the Border area, including cross-Border roads that were closed due to security problems.  Other road improvements include projects complementary to the Trans-European Road Network.</P>
    <P>The energy provision relates principally to funding for electricity interconnecting projects between the Northern and Southern electricity systems, including the restoration of the main interconnector on the Louth-Armagh border. These projects are of significance to the development of the electricity market and to the containment of costs.</P>
    <P>Funding for telecommunications is supporting the creation and development of a digital communications system which will benefit communities on both sides of the Border. Exporters are increasingly dependent on telecommunications for marketing, purchasing and electronic transfers for cash transactions. Industrialists are reluctant to locate in areas where modern telecommunication facilities are not available.  Much money has already been invested in infrastructure in a manner of which the Deputy may not be fully aware.</P>
    <P>Regarding the registered increase in unemployment in the two counties the Deputy has the honour to represent, one should go behind some of the statistics.  For example, previously a husband with a dependent spouse was registered as one person on the live register. A couple now have the right to register separately, and many women have chosen to so do for a variety of reasons and, therefore, the same economic unit or household is registered as two persons on the live register rather than one. The discrepancy between the Labour Force Survey and the live register is explained in part by such administrative procedures.  There may be a similar explanation for the rise in numbers on the live register in the enterprising counties of Cavan and Monaghan at a time when there has been an unprecedented level of economic activity throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this important matter and the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I have a personal interest in this project in that a member of my family currently attends the school as a student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two all-Irish primary schools serving the Tallaght area, Scoil Santain and Scoil Chaitlín Maude.  For a number of years students in the Tallaght area wishing to further their education through the medium of Irish at second level had the option of attending Coláiste Chilliain which is located in Clondalkin.  Because of the growth <Col N="1012" /> in numbers in the catchment area for Coláiste Chilliain, that safety valve was closed off to students from Tallaght in the past few years.  This made the issue of the provision of a permanent second level school in the Tallaght area all the more urgent.</P>
    <P>Coláiste de hÍde was sanctioned in November 1992.  It opened its doors in temporary buildings in September 1993 and currently has approximately 150 students.  It occupies an inferior site which is very small, and the accommodation consists entirely of prefabricated buildings.  The site in the Mountain Park area of Tallaght, the arrangement of the prefabricated buildings and the fact that the site is railed off with very high railings are of concern to parents from the perspective of evacuating the site in the event of a fire or some other emergency.  For these and other reasons it is important that progress be made with regard to the provision of a permanent building to accommodate Coláiste de hÍde.  As well as the current student population of 150 on an extremely overcrowded site, it is expected that an additional 50 students approximately will seek entry to the college next September.</P>
    <P>The school is an excellent school.  It is soundly supported by the parents and has an excellent staff.  It is very popular and there is a high demand for entry to it, but it is totally inadequate to cater for the needs of second level students.  A permanent building is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education currently owns a suitable site in the Tallaght area, referred to locally as the &ldquo;Tymon Park site&rdquo;, and the Minister for Education has indicated in replies to me that she has approved that site for the erection of a permanent building.  For a number of years the local authority maintained the site because the Department of Education had no use for it and was not in a position to maintain it properly.  Differences arose between the Department of Education and the local authority with regard to compensating the local authority for maintaining the site over the past number of years, and the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, which has responsibility for the provision of the school at the direction of the Minister for Education, is caught in the middle.</P>
    <P>I understand that strenuous efforts have been made in the past number of months to resolve the difficulties with the local authority.  However, the Minister for Education owns the site and would be entitled, subject to reasonable consultation with the local authority, to proceed with the provision of a permanent building.  It is this failure to provide a permanent building that has annoyed the parents of the students attending Coláiste de hÍde.</P>
    <P>What is required is a commitment from the Minister that she will insist on the site being used immediately for the provision of a permanent building and, if difficulties arise, will use her office to ensure that after reasonable consultation <Col N="1013" /> the project will proceed.  Also needed is the Minister's full support for the project.  It gives me no great pleasure to say that the view of parents is that the Minister is lukewarm about this project.  We hope that is not the case.  It is also required that the Minister ensure that the necessary finance is included in this year's Estimates to provide a permanent building.</P>
    <P>What the parents do not want to happen towards the end of this year or early next year is for a site to become available with no difficulties, the planning and design stages to be completed and at the end of the process to be told there is no finance available to provide the building.  A commitment must be given to proceed with the construction of this much needed project on a site in the ownership of the Department of Education and every effort must be made to ensure that the building is open and ready for business in September 1997.  That is the call of the parents and it is not unreasonable.  I seek a commitment to be given tonight that these objectives can be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed new school for Coláiste de hÍde in Tallaght.  Initially, I will give some details regarding the background to this case.</P>
      <P>Coláiste de hÍde is an all-Irish post-primary school which was established under the aegis of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee in September 1993.  The school is at present housed in the Cumann Gaelach premises in Oldbawn, Tallaght, Dublin 24.  It is accepted that these premises are not adequate for second level school purposes because only very limited facilities are available.  In an effort to alleviate the problem in the short-term, the Department recently approved the provision of prefabricated accommodation on the site.  However, this is not intended to be anything more than a short-term solution to the school's accommodation difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Minister has decided that permanent accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term enrolment of 600 pupils and she has approved the use of the Department's site at Tymon Park for the purpose of providing the new school.  Unfortunately, it has proved difficult to secure immediate vacant possession of the Tymon Park site from South Dublin County Council due to its current use as part of a wider amenity area.  The matter has been the subject of negotiations between the vocational education committee and the county council with a view to a resolution of the problems involved.  The Deputy also referred to strenuous efforts to reach agreement.  Officials of the Department have also met with representatives of the council to stress the urgency of the situation relating to the accommodation needs of Coláiste de hÍde.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the pressing need for this new facility and it is hoped that the position <Col N="1014" /> relating to the siting of the new school will be finalised shortly.  Every effort will be made to ensure that architectural planning for this project is progressed as quickly as possible and construction commenced at the earliest opportunity.  The actual date for the commencement of work on site will very much depend on the capital allocation to be made for post-primary building purposes in 1997.  The Coláiste de hÍde project will receive every priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter and the Minister of State for his attendance.</P>
      <P>Up to the commencement of the current law term the District Court in Dublin operated from three courts within the Four Courts.  The Department of Justice decided to take over the three courts and convert them for High Court sittings.  It intended to rent vacant offices in Dollard House beside the Clarence Hotel to transact the business of two of the courts in that building.  The problem is the Department was not aware that the courts in Dollard House would be dealing with persons in custody and, accordingly, there was no provision for holding cells in the building.  It was also unaware that its geographical location made it entirely unsuitable.  I understand the Garda were opposed to the plan for security reasons.</P>
      <P>By the time these facts came to the notice of the Department the proposal had gone as far as planning application stage.  At the same time, the Department proposed to transfer the third District Court to the courthouse in Green Street where the Special Criminal Court sits.  Again it had to be pointed out that there were no holding cells there and that there were major security considerations, such as ordinary criminals and subversives mixing.  The Department had not even considered the security implications and, amazingly, it did not consult the Garda.  In any event, this proposal was also abandoned and judges sitting in this court were directed to adjourn cases to the court in Green Street and any cases so adjourned may now fall.</P>
      <P>There was also a proposal around the same time to move the parking fines court from Smithfield to the Central Mission in Lower Abbey Street.  The proposal related to the second floor of the building which consist of a badminton hall that is 45 steps above entrance level.  The premises, which consist of church buildings, are used for a combination of religious and other uses during the day.  A healing ministry is held each Wednesday and funeral services are conducted from time to time in the morning in the hall floor chapel.  Other groups also use the premises.  The church provides a catering facility for those groups from mid-morning onwards. Access is not suitable for elderly people or women with children in pushchairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> The matter was brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice but she refused to reconsider the proposal.  Subsequently many hundreds, if not thousands, of summonses were issued and served for the venue which was due to commence on Monday of this week.  The saga did not end there. It transpired that there was no planning permission for the change of use nor was the proper planning procedure followed by the Department.  Notwithstanding grave reservations expressed by interested parties as to the suitability of the premises, its use is to proceed as soon as planning is in order.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice was requesting District Justice to go into a premises which did not have planning permission.  It is a criminal offence to use a premises without planning permission so the judges were being placed in an invidious position.  Summonses issued for this court may well prove to be of doubtful validity and this may result in many cases falling.  It would probably be asking too much of a Minister for Justice, who does not receive or respond to personal letters from a judge in the Special Criminal Court and who only receives some letters from the Attorney General about that court, to provide adequate District Court accommodation in Dublin, let alone accept political responsibility for this shambles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to speak to the House on this matter. Deputies will appreciate that, arising from a recent appointment by the Government of 16 additional Supreme, High, Circuit and District Judges under the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, it was necessary to provide courtrooms and ancillary facilities for them.</P>
      <P>As the majority of the additional judges will sit in the Dublin metropolitan area there is a need to provide courtroom accommodation in Dublin for the short and medium term, pending the availability of further accommodation in the Four Courts.  In this light the Department of Justice asked the Office of Public Works, who act as the Department's agents in this respect, to source the necessary accommodation for both short-term and long-term use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that for practical and administrative reasons, ideally the courts in Dublin city should be centralised either in or around the Four Courts.  However, as Deputies can appreciate, at this particular time the need for courtroom accommodation in the Four Courts area outstrips availability.  The Department plans to move the Land Registry out of the Four Courts complex and use the accommodation which this will make available for additional courtroom and court office accommodation and facilities.  However, it will take considerable time for the Land Registry building to become available for court accommodation.  The Office of Public Works has just completed a scoping survey of the Four <Col N="1016" /> Courts which will help to properly plan what is required in the long-term.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Office of Public Works has reported on the various options for additional short to medium term court accommodation which is available and the following options are being pursued.  First, the premises of the former Richmond Hospital are being leased for ten years and will yield five courtrooms and ancillary facilities.  Work on the refurbishment has commenced and will be completed and ready for court use in late April 1997.  The property at Riverbank Theatre is being leased to provide three courtrooms and ancillary facilities.  Work on refurbishment is under way and the facilities are scheduled to be ready for use in early February 1997.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware of recent media coverage in relation to a premises in Abbey Street.  A premises in Abbey Street, which was used up to late 1988 as court accommodation, was sourced by the Office of Public Works for short-term use and it negotiated a lease on the building for use as temporary court accommodation.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for obtaining any necessary planning permission for the change of use of the premises rests with the Office of Public Works. The Minister understands that a senior architect from the Office of Public Works discussed the use of the premises in Abbey Street with a senior planning officer in Dublin Corporation and was given an opinion by the senior planning officer that, as the building in question had been used for court sittings in the recent past, there was no change of use involved in having a temporary court in the building.  On this basis the Office of Public Works did not seek planning permission. The Office of Public Works informed the Department that the premises would be available for use as a court from 11 November 1996.</P>
    <P>The decision not to seek planning permission was challenged by a solicitor on behalf of a client. On receipt of this challenge, confirmation of the need for planning permission was sought from the Office of Public Works and the planning officer. At this stage the senior planning officer informed the Department he was now of the opinion that planning permission should be sought.  On this basis the President of the District Court decided he would adjourn all the cases listed for hearing in Abbey Street until a later date.  The Minister understands that the Office of Public Works is making preparations to seek the necessary planning permission.</P>
    <P>As these developments only came to light late last week, it was not possible to notify the people summoned for the earlier days of this week. However, all persons involved are being notified. A member of the court staff will be on hand at the premises this week to inform people who turn up.  This inconvenience to the public, their legal representative and members of the Garda is regretted but the matter is being addressed and the court cases will be heard at a future date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> The Minister has been informed that when the additional court facilities become available at the Riverbank Theatre and the Richmond in February and April 1997 respectively, the accommodation will be adequate to meet current requirements.</P>

Mura réiteofar an fhadhb seo tá go leor daoine ar mhaith leo dul ag plé le slog-éisc nach mbeidh in ann é sin a dhéanamh i ngeall ar éiginnteacht sa tionscal.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply.  He is probably wondering if some disaster has hit the shellfish industry recently.  To my knowledge this has not happened but we will need a compensation fund in place when the problem arises to ensure the continuance in business of shellfish farmers.  We all agree that shellfish is one of our underdeveloped natural resources.  It is important that we develop it in such a way that individuals and small groups will be able to derive the maximum advantage.  One of the major difficulties to date has been that a person, through no fault of their own but through natural circumstances, could lose a year's income due to red tide.</P>
      <P>Algal blooms or red tides are phenomena that occur in Irish maritime waters from time to time. They occur both offshore and inshore and are caused by the tiny plants which inhabit the open seas.  Blooms are brought about by an extensive growth of one or several species of these tiny plants.  Most blooms are natural events, quite harmless and even beneficial to the environment. Some blooms can be so intense that they cause a discolouration of the water.  This discolouration is usually brown, red-brown or red-orange, hence the name red tide.</P>
      <P>Occasionally blooms can contain toxic or harmful species while on other occasions they are responsible for bringing about drastic changes in water quality which can be detrimental to aquaculture operations in both fish and shellfish. One such change is the significant reduction in the oxygen content in the water and such an occurrence effectively wiped out a major shellfish operation involving abalone in Clew Bay last year.  A few species of these tiny plants have the capacity to produce potent toxins that can find their way through both fish and shellfish to humans.  The plants responsible for the vast majority of shellfish toxicity problems in Ireland belong to a group called dinophysis and its related toxicity is called DSP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> The length of closure following red tide can vary depending on the intensity of the toxins. Closure at any time is disruptive but is extremely serious during the winter sales period October-March each year when the bulk of the crop is sold.</P>
    <P>The financial consequences vary depending on the lenght of closure and the tonnage at the time in a particular bay.  The most recent example is Killary Harbour in my constituency which was closed from November 1995 to May 1996, resulting in a loss of sales of approximately 500 tonnes.  Mussels are valued at between £400 and £450 a tonne.  The consequences of such a closure are that the farmer loses the total crop or faces a serious reduction in the value of the crop and a serious loss of income over a long period, in some cases a year.</P>
    <P>In the event of red tide I suggest a fund be available, out of which compensation could be paid automatically to fish farmers in the event of such a natural occurrence.  Similar compensation funds have been made available for farmers who suffered serious losses in potato crops etc.  I understand a compensation package was made available to farmers in the south-west region in recent years for loss of mussels.  It is important that oyster, fish and mussel farmers should be guaranteed an income which is necessary if this industry is to reach its potential.  Security of income should be put on a regular footing.  An industry that has not contributed in the way it should would reach its full potential and give to the economy a new source of income which it badly needs.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith lion iarraidh ar an Aire breathnú go báiúil ar an iarratas seo.  Dhéanfadh sé andifríocht d'fhorbairt an tionscail seo.  Is ceann le na riachtanais mhóra atá ann.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The shellfish industry is a young industry with enormous potential.  The total amount of shellfish farmed has tripled since 1980.  Most of this has been due to the development of the Pacific oyster and rope mussel farms, which together employ 1,574 fulltime and part-time people.  Over half of existing farms were set up since 1987 and the pace of start-ups has accelerated in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A generous emergency aid package for shellfish growers was put in place during the past year to assist the industry with losses that had been sustained in previous years.  The scheme comprised two main elements.  First, the package addressed problems experienced by the rope mussel industry.  A sum of £100,000 was provided to implement key elements of the report of the task force on biotoxin contamination and monitoring.  Following discussions with the Irish Aquaculture Association, I established this group in March 1995, to assist in the search for remedies <Col N="1019" /> to the unprecedented toxicity problems arising from DSP (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning) contamination of rope-grown mussels.  As the Deputy may be aware, this is commonly known as red tide.  The contaminations resulted in prolonged closures of farms and restricted harvesting arrangements with consequent adverse economic impacts on growers and markets alike, particularly for the rope mussel industry in the south west region.</P>
    <P>Toxic algal blooms caused by natural blooming of microscopic marine plant life has impacted severely on rope mussel producers in recent years.  As a significant segment of the aquaculture industry in Ireland, the rope mussel industry makes a vital contribution to employment and local economies in coastal areas.  This report, compiled with full industry participation and extensive consultation with producer representative bodies and co-operatives, identified a wide range of solutions to tackle the problems besetting the industry.  A key recommendation of the task force was a proposal for the introduction of an emergency aid scheme for the industry to restore industry confidence and protect employment.</P>
    <P>However, financial assistance is only one element of a range of measures designed to combat the biotoxicity problem.  In addition, the report has recommended the introduction and implementation of a new marine biotoxin action plan.  Key components of the plan which are now put in place include an enhanced national monitoring programme for biotoxins covering all the main shellfish growing areas in Ireland, and the establishment of a national marine liaison advisory group, now up and running, to oversee implementation of the report's recommendations, to provide an ongoing forum for industry inputs and for the periodical review of the results of the national monitoring programme with a facility to recommend modifications as necessary.</P>
    <P>The second element of the emergency aid package was in respect of the pacific oyster industry.  A substantial number of oyster farmers engaged in the cultivation of pacific oysters experienced unprecedented levels of mortalities in 1995 seed inputs, due to the unusually hot summer and high seawater temperatures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> Following a national survey of oyster farms, undertaken by BIM, to pinpoint the extent of losses, it was estimated that 71 million seed out of a total industry input of 118 million seed was lost.  An emergency aid package of £300,000 was put in place to assist affected growers to restock farms and help to restore production potential, thereby protecting jobs on the farms affected.  Of the 200 pacific oyster farms operating around the coast, it is estimated that 85 had experienced losses of varying magnitude.  As continuity of supply is the key to developing and maintaining markets for oyster growers, non-replacement of seed inputs immediately would have disrupted market supply in future years.</P>
    <P>The effects of exposure of oyster seed to warm weather conditions can be mitigated and preventative measures and refinements in methods of culture are being researched by the marine institute and the industry to prevent a recurrence in future years.</P>
    <P>The industry did, of course, have to bear a share of the losses as part of the normal commercial risk associated with farming and husbandry operations.  The provision of compensation funds on the lines described by the Deputy must have regard to Exchequer resources and the requirements for EU Commission approval for aids to industry which are stringently applied.</P>
    <P>It is not feasible or desirable that shellfish farmers necessarily should be compensated for losses due to natural phenomena.  In the case of recent emergency aid schemes which received both Government and EU approval, the objective was to restore production capability rather than compensate growers for losses.  It must be recognised that shellfish farmers, with the finfish sector of the aquaculture industry, operate in the commercial sector and cannot realistically expect to be compensated by the State for losses due to natural phenomena.  In relation to any emergency aid package, including that for mussels and oysters to which I have referred, such EU approval is not lightly given and I am advised, would not be given for repetitive events arising from naturally occurring phenomena such as red tides.</P>

      <P>The Government's position on this matter was the subject of a public statement on 9 October last.  The statement referred to the fact that, in the Seanad, a wide range of views were expressed on the proposals published by the Government last March, and it noted that, while the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs had endorsed the principle of Seanad representation for emigrants, it has proposed that the six Seanad university seats be abolished and the number of emigrant seats increased to at least five.</P>
      <P>The statement went on to point out that five emigrant voting groups expressed varying degrees of opposition to Seanad representation for emigrants, even as a first step towards full voting rights, and that 39 other organisations and individuals commented on the proposals; eight were fully supportive and the remainder were either opposed to them or indicated reluctant acceptance of them.</P>
      <P>As already announced, the Government has decided not to proceed on the basis of the consultation paper, given the divergence of views on how best to proceed.  It will be open to the allparty committee on the Constitution, in the context of its review of the functions and role of the Seanad, to consider the rationale for, and the relative merits of, university and emigrant representation, having regard, in particular, to the views of the Constitution Review Group and the wider issue of Seanad reform.</P>

      <P>While I recognise that a general house improvement grant scheme would help to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, I am particularly conscious of the cost of the previous scheme.  The Government's priorities in the housing area, as set out in the programme A Government of Renewal, are to expand the local authority and other social housing programmes and to upgrade deficient local authority dwellings.  As the available resources will, accordingly, be concentrated on these <Col N="1023" /> programmes, I have no proposals, at this stage, to reintroduce a house improvement grant scheme.</P>

      <P>Following the recent Supreme Court decision to allow the case taken by the County Louth residents against BNFL to be heard in the Irish courts, the Minister convened a meeting of the Ministerial Group on Sellafield and the Irish Sea on 31 October.  As a result of this meeting, the Minister brought proposals to Government leading to the Government's decision to offer State financial assistance and other support to the residents in respect of specific items of scientific investigation, research and other work to be identified and seek agreement for the removal of the State as the defendant from the action.</P>
      <P>The ministerial group has already met with the County Louth residents to explore how to advance these matters and communication with the residents will continue.</P>

      <P>The housing aims of Rural Resettlement Ireland have my full support.  Since 1992, my Department has paid grants totalling £215,000 towards the administrative and general expenses of RRI in respect of their housing-related activities, including £60,000 this year.  RRI have also been granted approval body status for the purposes of the voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes and are providing a number of houses under these schemes.</P>
      <P>Households moving under the RRI programme may be eligible for local authority house purchase loans or shared ownership, and the deposit requirement under the latter scheme has been eased in these cases.

This new mortgage will assist qualifying families to resettle permanently by purchasing and restoring, where necessary, existing houses.</P>
      <P>The significant support provided by my Department to RRI means that their programme can, as requested by RRI when they met the Minister in September, already be regarded as one of the range of social housing options now available.  However, as I have indicated previously, I do not have proposals to provide for an additional &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; grant along the lines envisaged by RRI.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for upholding the quality standards prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, rests with sanitary authorities, under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The agency published an annual report on the results of sanitary authority monitoring required under these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent report, which relates to the year 1994 and was published in June of this year, indicates that public drinking water supplies continue to be of satisfactory quality overall, with some fluctuations in quality occurring either because of natural or seasonal variations or as a result of one-off contamination incidents.  The <Col N="1029" /> report does, however, highight continued difficulties with the more vulnerable private supplies.</P>
    <P>Apart from coliforms, compliance levels in respect of strictly health-related parameters were again very satisfactory, at or above 99 per cent in 1994.  In the case of coliforms, the overall compliance level in respect of 1993, at 87.2 per cent, was maintained against a background of increased monitoring of more vulnerable private supplies.</P>
    <P>In response to the findings of the Environmental Protection Agency report, the Minister has requested sanitary authorities first to review their monitoring regimes and current treatment works practices; second, to take a more proactive approach to improving the compliance of privately-sourced group and individual supplies; and third to focus special attention on public water supplies which are experiencing consistent breaches of parameters.</P>
    <P>In order to meet both quality and quantity requirements throughout the country, funding of some £55 million will be provided to sanitary authorities in 1996 for the development and upgrading of public water supplies.  In the case of group schemes, funding of £6 million will be provided this year for connection to the public network or, where this is not feasible, for the provision of treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department will continue to support the development of the integrated training programme for personnel involved in the treatment and supply of drinking water which is being promoted by the Sanitary Services National Training Group.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of roads in urban areas rests with individual road authorities. In the case of non-national roads, the improvement of such roads normally falls to be funded from the road authority's own resources, supplemented by the annual grants for these roads; it is generally a matter for individual road authorities to select the projects they wish to fund, subject to the guidelines which apply.  In the case of national roads, any necessary improvements would be a matter for consideration by the local authority concerned and the National Roads Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £8 million in discretionary block grants has been allocated to urban road authorities in 1996 for works on non-national roads in their areas.  The level of these allocations has increased significantly in the last few years, <Col N="1030" /> from £5.5 million in 1993 to £8 million in 1996, an increase of 45 per cent.  In addition, a sum of £4.07 million has been allocated to urban authorities in 1996 under the EC co-financed scheme of grants for specific improvement projects on non-national roads and under a special, once-off scheme for the restoration of road pavements in areas where exceptional damage has been caused by work connected with water or sewerage schemes.  In all, therefore, grant allocations of £12.07 million have been made to urban authorities in 1996 for non-national roads, an increase of £2 million on the grants paid in 1995.</P>
    <P>Over £225 million has been provided to the National Roads Authority for the improvement and maintenance of the national road network in 1996.  The allocation of grants to local authorities, including urban authorities, for works on national roads is a matter for the Authority.</P>

      <P>Provisional Garda figures for the first nine months of 1996 show that there were 302 fatal accidents in that period in which 330 people were killed, compared to 291 fatal accidents in 1995 in which 315 people were killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of road casualties, and especially the increase in the last two years, is a matter of serious concern, but there is no easy solution to the problem and it takes time for new measures to achieve positive results.  A combination of efforts by all of the public and private agencies involved, and by all road users, is of the utmost importance if we are to reduce the number of accidents.  A new national road safety campaign <Col N="1032" /> was launched in May with a focus on all responsible agencies &mdash; my Department, the Department of Justice and the Garda; the National Roads Authority; the National Safety Council; and the local authorities &mdash; working together with the road user to increase the effectiveness of their enforcement, education, engineering and encouragement measures.  Side by side with this, existing measures must be maintained; these include constant media advertising, education of road users, especially children, and improvements to our road network.</P>
    <P>New measures which have been introduced this year include the publication of a Guide to Road Safety Engineering; new radio and TV advertisements by the National Safety Council; an enhanced role for local authorities in promoting road safety at local level; the establishment of a voluntary register of driving instructors; and the introduction of on-the-spot fines for speeding offences.  Further measures which are proposed include the introduction of a theory test for new drivers, the publication of a comprehensive traffic signs manual for local authorities and the introduction of new traffic regulations.</P>

      <P>Information supplied by fire authorities indicates that fatalities from fires in the home which were attended by fire brigades totalled 47 in 1992; 48 in 1993; 42 in 1994; and 38 in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Building Control Act and the Building Regulations prescribe detailed fire safety requirements for new buildings and for material alterations or changes of use.  Technical Guidance Documents, which accompany the regulations, contain comprehensive guidance on matters such as means of escape (including the provision of smoke alarms), internal and external fire spread, and access and facilities for the fire brigade. Following a review by my Department, it is intended to publish new technical guidance before the end of the year; this will require improved standards in many aspects of new buildings, including fire safety provisions.</P>

      <Col N="1033" /> In the last analysis, fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder, and, in this context, better awareness of the dangers of fire can help to prevent and minimise house fires.

      <P>In adopting the Dublin County Development Plan 1993, the council decided that a draft variation of the plan, as it affects the Swords area, should be prepared by Fingal County Council.  The rezoning now being proposed by that council, and a variation adopted in November 1995 in relation, inter alia, to the location of the council headquarters in Swords, derive from that decision.</P>
      <P>The council has now completed its consideration of the observations received on the draft variation and has proposed various amendments.  It is understood that the proposed amendments will shortly go on public display for a one month period, in accordance with the provisions of section 21 A of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Following this period, it will be a matter for the council to consider any observations received on the proposed amendments before deciding whether to adopt the variation.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments that local councils and the public they represent are generally in a better position than central government to decide on the details of land use in their areas.  However, the Minister has already made it clear that he will not be influenced by excessive zoning in determining priorities for the allocation of funding for infrastructural services.  In the light of a Supreme Court judgment some months ago, local authorities have been reminded of the need to have regard to the adequacy of existing and prospective sewerage infrastructure in preparing and adopting their development plans.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for lake water quality and for the implementation of appropriate measures to deal with pollution is a matter primarily for local authorities.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also involved, especially where activities licensable by the agency may be implicated.  Extensive statutory powers are available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990 and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 to support these bodies in their roles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent Environmental Protection Agency report <i>Water Quality in Ireland 1991-1994</i><Col N="1036" /> indicates that the extent of algal development recorded in 18 per cent of lakes for which data are available for the period concerned suggests a strong to very high level of eutrophication.  In many instances, the principal sources of nutrients affecting these lakes are believed to be non-point discharges of agricultural origin.  Single point sources, such as discharges from sewage treatment plants and industry, are also partly responsible.</P>
    <P>Farmers can significantly reduce nutrient losses from their holdings by adopting the recommendations on the management of farm wastes and the use of chemical fertilisers contained in the Code of Good Agricultural Practice which the Minister for the Environment jointly launched in July with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Local authorities have been requested to actively promote the code among farmers.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are now in a position to impose statutory controls in respect of nutrients, where warranted for the purposes of restoring or protecting water quality, as a result of an amendment made earlier this year to the Water Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1990.  The provision allows authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans with the aim of relating nutrient applications to crop requirements, taking account of water quality protection considerations.</P>
    <P>There is concern that present recommended application rates for phosphorus fertilisers may be excessive, having regard to the crop response situation and increased losses of phosphorus to waters leading to eutrophication.  At the request of the Minister, these recommendations are being reviewed by Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>New intensive agricultural activities in the pig and poultry sectors coming within the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, are subject to integrated pollution control licensing since 3 September 1996.  The agency may not grant a licence for these activities unless it is satisfied, <i>inter alia,</i> that waste arising will not cause significant environmental pollution.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with local authorities, is continuing to implement a major programme of capital investment entailing estimated expenditure of £1.3 billion by 2005, on upgrading sewage treatment facilities so as to meet the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.  Four lakes, Loughs Derg, Leane, Oughter and Ree have been identified as sensitive areas in accordance with the provisions of the directive.  As a consequence, phosphorus reduction facilities will be provided by 31 December 1998 for sewage discharges from towns with population equivalents greater than 10,000 in the catchments concerned &mdash; Athlone, Nenagh, Tullamore, Killarney, Longford and Cavan.  In addition, the Minister is prepared to go beyond the requirements of the directive and approve the installation of nutrient reduction facilities in the <Col N="1037" /> case of smaller sewerage schemes which affect the sensitive areas concerned, or contribute to the eutrophication of other lakes.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency are in a position to impose appropriate controls on industry to the extent that industrial activities may contribute to eutrophication, through the exercise of the statutory powers available to them.</P>
    <P>To provide better co-ordination for the above actions, and to intensify efforts at protecting the vulnerable water quality of lakes, my Department is finalising a lake catchment management strategy.  This will aim to encourage an integrated approach to catchment management, based on the cooperation of all economic and other interests involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>The 1982 report of the Stardust tribunal, a copy of which was placed in the Oireachts Library, made a wide range of recommendations in relation to the fire service and other related matters.  These recommendations have either been implemented or taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy on fire safety and the development of the local authority fire services over the intervening period, with the support of successive Governments. Improvements have been made on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, the legislative framework, and emergency planning.</P>
      <P>With respect to capital investment, a total of £81 million has been provided from State funds since 1981 to finance work on 92 new or reconstructed fire stations, the purchase of replacement fire appliances and major improvements in telecommunications, emergency equipment and so on.  As regards staffing, there were about 30 professional posts in the local fire service prior to 1982, whereas now there are 129 such posts, with a greatly increased emphasis on fire prevention and fire safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, strengthened the overall statutory regime for enforcing fire safety. Regulations under the Act make the locking of exits and blocking of escape routes from places of assembly an offence.  Building regulations, which came into effect in June 1992, set out the <Col N="1039" /> requirements, including fire safety requirements, to be met in the design and construction of new buildings and material changes in existing buildings.  With some limited exceptions, a fire safety certificate is now required for new buildings, extensions, and material alterations and changes of use.  It is intended to publish new technical guidance to accompany the regulations before the end of the year following a review by my Department; this will require improved standards in many aspects of new buildings, including fire safety provisions.</P>
    <P>A series of codes of practice and guidelines have been issued giving advice on fire safety in places of assembly, in hotels and guesthouses, in flats and apartments, in regard to furnishings and fittings in places of assembly and, most recently, in regard to nursing homes and similar type premises.  Operational guidelines covering training needs, the use of breathing apparatus, etc. have also been issued to fire authorities. Work is continuing on the preparation of further advice and guidance.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in fire service training have also taken place.  For example, since it was set up in 1983 the Fire Services Council has held over 160 training courses at central level for over 3,000 local fire service personnel, to supplement the training carried out locally by fire authorities. Major training facilities for the fire service have been provided at several centres around the country including the Dublin Fire Brigade training centre at Marino.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council, established in 1988, promotes public awareness in relation to fire safety, as well as roads and water safety. Local authorities have developed plans to deal with major emergencies and my Department provides extensive advice and assistance to the authorities on this matter on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Three mobilisation and communications centres to handle all fire &ldquo;999&rdquo; calls are being developed in Limerick, Dublin and Castlebar. The Munster system came into operation in 1993, planning for the fitting out of the control centre in Dublin is at an advanced stage, and the Castlebar centre is being developed at present.</P>
    <P>All the recommendations of the report have received full and careful consideration in the ongoing development of the fire service.  I am satisfied that the improvements which I have outlined have significantly strengthened the capacity of the service to respond to fires and other emergencies, and in fire prevention activities.</P>

      <P>Accommodation for elderly persons may be provided under the local authority housing programme or the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme.  In addition, there is a range of improvement schemes to assist elderly persons wishing to stay in their own homes and communities, each designed to meet different needs and different circumstances.  These schemes include the disabled persons grant, the essential repairs grant, the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, and the special housing aid for the elderly scheme.  The latter is the only scheme which is not directly operated by local authorities, as appropriate.  It has, since its establishment in 1982, been under the aegis of the health boards and is widely acknowledged to have achieved, with a minimum of cost and formality <Col N="1044" /> considerable improvements in the housing conditions of elderly persons.</P>
      <P>Overall, I am satisfied that there are adequate arrangements for co-ordination between local authorities and health boards in regard to the accommodation of the elderly.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to relate the above live register figures to appropriate Labour Force Survey categories, for the purpose of calculating an unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>The Labour Force Survey provides comprehensive annual information on employment and unemployment.  This is a sample survey which provides regional data but does not provide separate results for counties or county boroughs.  Statistics are available from the LFS in respect of the Dublin region, i.e. Dublin County Borough, Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown.  In April 1995, the estimated number of persons unemployed in the Dublin region, using the ILO definition, was 62,800 and the unemployment rate was 13.6 per cent.  This compared with a national unemployment rate of 12.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The five-yearly Census of Population gives statistics on counties, county boroughs and smaller areas.  The relevant results of the 1996 Census should become available early in 1998. The most recent results currently available are from the 1991 Census.</P>
    <P>The following table shows the numbers at work, unemployed, the total labour force and the unemployment rate in each of the five cities in April 1991, using the Principal Economic Status (PES) labour force definitions:</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Presidency of the European Union has been following with the deepest concern the further deterioration in the situation in Eastern Zaire.  As I indicated in my Adjournment Statement to the House on 6 November, both I and the Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for Development Co-operation, Deputy Joan Burton, have been engaged in active consultations with EU colleagues, the United Nations, the UNHCR and with African leaders in the Great Lakes region on possible ways through which an end can be brought to a conflict which has the potential to lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.  In addition to direct consultations with the UN Secretary General, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has briefed me on developments in the Security Council and on the role of his Special Envoy, I have also had discussions with US Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher and the Canadian Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, on the modalities of a possible multinational intervention.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency has been, and continues to be, fully engaged with our European partners and the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, in an intense round of contacts with regional leaders on a possible way forward.  Mr. Ajello has been given an additional and specific mandate to support efforts to resolve the crisis in Eastern Zaire.  Following discussions in Kigali, Rwanda, Zaire and Uganda, Special Envoy Ajello attended, on behalf of the Union, the Summit of Regional Leaders on the crisis in Eastern Zaire which was held in Nairobi on 5 of October.  At the Nairobi Summit, the outcome of which has been welcomed by the Presidency and our EU partners, the regional leaders called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to take urgent measures to ensure the establishment of the safe corridors and temporary sanctuaries for refugees by deploying a neutral force.  The Summit affirmed the readiness of the sub-region to make its own contribution to that effect.  At a later meeting of the Central Organ of the Organisation of African Unity for Conflict Prevention in Addis Ababa on 11 November, which was also attended by Special Envoy Ajello, these views received further endorsement from African leaders.</P>
      <P>In the context of the need for a comprehensive approach to the complex and inter-connected problems at issue in the Great Lakes region, a special meeting of European Union development and humanitarian aid Ministers was held in Brussels on Thursday 7 November.  The meeting was chaired by the Irish Presidency, Deputy Joan Burton, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Development Ministers were briefed on the evolving situation in the Great Lakes region by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Mrs. Ogata and by representatives of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the World Food Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting reaffirmed the Union's determination and commitment to assist vulnerable people, refugees and displaced persons in Eastern Zaire, in averting further human tragedy there and in avoiding a potentially catastrophic humanitarian disaster in the region. Following the Special Meeting, a Special EU Mission to the Great Lakes region, led by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, along with her Italian and Dutch counterparts and <Col N="1047" /> Commissioner Bonino, left on 9 November for Zaire and Rwanda.  Their mission, which will report to the EU General Affairs Council, has had a number of high level meetings with the Zairean and Rwandan Governments, as well as representatives of NGOs and UN agencies operating in the region, and included a visit to Gisenyi on the Rwanda-Zaire border.</P>
    <P>Although the security situation had prevented humanitarian agencies from operating in the region there have been some hopeful developments in the last few days.  I welcome the decision by the Rwandan Government to allow a selected number of NGOs to enter Zaire to provide humanitarian assistance and prepare a plan of action on the refugee issue.  These organisations, including Concern and Trócaire, began to cross the border from Rwanda on Monday and have begun to assess the precise needs within the Goma area.  In addition the Rwandan Minister of Health is involved in mediating with Zairean rebels, in order to improve the level of security for the aid agencies.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council in New York has been pursuing its own consideration of the issue in parallel.  In its Resolution 1078 on 9 November, the Council &ldquo;strongly urges member states, on an urgent and temporary basis and in co-operation with the Secretary General of the Organisation of African Unity, to prepare the necessary arrangements, in consultation with the States concerned, to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organisations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire and to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary and secure repatriation of refugees&rdquo;. Resolution 1078 also requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council by 20 November with a &ldquo;concept of operations and framework for a humanitaarian task force, with military assistance if necessary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>European Union member states are now giving active consideration to how best they can assist in the early implementation of Resolution 1078 as the basis for the authorisation of a multinational humanitarian intervention.  In so doing they will be taking account of its prospective mandate and the contributions which can be made by the Organisation of African Unity, African countries, the United States, Canada and others.  The outcome of the Security Council's consideration of the issue, which is expected very soon, should provide the broad framework within which a concerted international response to the crisis will be situated.  As EU Presidency, Ireland will maintain close contact with the United Nations in New York, the Organisation of African Unity and the regional leaders on the progress of this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government supports in principle the idea of the deployment of an international humanitarian protection force or monitoring presence in support of a solution to the crisis in Eastern Zaire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> However, as I have stated in my previous reply, such a force would have to be accepted by both sides to the conflict and be seen as impartial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a general election held on 26 October there was a change of Government in Malta.  The new Government of that country, implementing a commitment made during the election campaign, has withdrawn from Partnership for Peace.  On 30 October the Maltese Government made it clear that its decision in no way implies any judgment about the manner by which other countries define their particular approach to neutrality or how they implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government respects the right of any other state to determine for itself what role and contribution it wishes to make in international affairs.  I would, however, note that the outgoing Government of Malta took the opposite view to the new Government and did not consider membership of Partnership for Peace to be incompatible with Malta's constitution.  I would also note that other countries with which Ireland has far more in common in its approach to international affairs, such as Finland, Sweden and Austria, are participating in Partnership for Peace, without prejudice to or implications for their positions outside military alliances.  At the <Col N="1049" /> time when Malta was withdrawing from Partnership for Peace, the Swiss Government was announcing its decision to join Partnership for Peace on the basis that it was fully compatible with Swiss neutrality.  As I said in reply to questions in this House on 31 October Partnership for Peace imposes no Treaty obligations of any sort, no mutual defence commitments and has no implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  It remains my view that it is in Ireland's interests to participate in Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EU's response to the stated intention of the Government of Malta to negotiate new commercial, social and security ties with the EU, the question has not yet been considered in detail pending clarification from the Government of Malta about its intentions.  As the Deputy is aware, Malta had applied for EU membership and the Cannes European Council in June 1995 agreed that negotiations on the accession of Malta and Cyprus would begin, on the basis of Commission proposals, six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, taking the outcome of that Conference into account.</P>

      <P>On 30 October 1996 Wang Dan was sentended to 11 years imprisonment at his trial in Beijing.  On 1 November the Irish Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union which expressed the EU's profound concern at the conviction and sentencing of Mr. Wang.  The EU stated that Mr. Wang was sentenced to a lengthy period of imprisonment for activities which, in a democratic society, would be considered as the exercise by him of his intrinsic and inalienable right to freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>In the declaration the European Union recalled that its concerns about this case had been made clear to the Chinese authorities well in advance of Mr. Wang's trial.  The EU deplored this punitive and repressive sentencing of Mr. Wang which, it said, raised justifiable concern about China's commitment to the rule of law, necessary for China's continuing growth and development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 83 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Community Humanitarian Office &mdash; ECHO &mdash; has provided more than 9.5 <Col N="1051" /> million ECU in humanitarian relief to Iraq during 1996.  As a follow-up to the meeting with member states on 30 September.  ECHO has also requested both its representatives to return to their posts in northern Iraq.  The representatives are currently completing an assessment of the humanitarian situation there and preparations are in hand for a new aid package of 20 million ECU for Iraq.  This assistance will be channelled through the UN agencies, the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations.  The approval of the EU member states for this aid package will shortly be sought by ECHO.  At the ECHO meeting on 8 October, Ireland, along with other member states, encouraged ECHO to ensure a balance between aid to the north and the rest of Iraq.</P>
    <P>As Presidency, Ireland, in consultation with the other EU member states, will take every appropriate step to ensure the humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq continue to be addressed.  Since 1992 the Irish Government has disbursed over IR£200,000 on humanitarian assistance to UNICEF for women and children in central and southern Iraq.  The Government is actively considering a new allocation in response to the UN-inter-agency consolidated appeal which was launched in September.  Last month the Government disbursed a grant of IR£35,000 to assist the efforts of the Iranian Red Crescent to bring relief to the refugees from northern Iraq.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Ireland requested the Presidency representative in Ankara, the Netherland Embassy, along with a representative of the European Commission, to undertake an assessment mission into northern Iraq from 19-21 September 1996.  During their visit, meetings were held with the duty officer commanding the UN Guards, representatives of 18 NGOs in northern Iraq and Mr. Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, KDP.  The assessment of the Presidency and Commission representatives was that the situation in the area was generally calm.  Shops were open and business seemed to have resumed as normal.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 9 of 2 October 1996 the EU representatives were also given assurances by Mr. Barzani that local aid workers employed by organisations from the EU would be afforded adequate protection in the areas under the control of the KDP.  The Presidency's representative in Ankara have also made a number of approaches to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Turkish authorities to facilitate the activities of NGOs operating in Iraq, so that they can carry out their work efficiently and in accordance with their mandate.  The EU representatives also stressed to the Turkish authorities the Union's support for the valuable work performed by these NGOs, and reiterated that the NGOs operated in accordance with the rights and obligations of international humanitarian law.</P>

      <P>Approximately 56 million ECU has been expended to date under the TACIS programme on the projects and activities listed below in the context of the TACIS nuclear safety programme, the Chernobyl regional programme and the G7 action programme-information provided by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The TACIS nuclear safety programme includes: Fire protection training in Chernobyl, Ukraine; assistance with decontamination around Chernobyl; Chernobyl inventory-measures to mitigate the consequences of the disaster and to promote the economic regeneration of the area; preparation of the decommissioning operations, Unit 1, 2, 3 at Chernobyl nuclear power plant; study on the management of radioactive waste in dumps in the Chernobyl 30km exclusion area; feasibility studies on improving the state of the existing shelter accommodating Unit 4 at Chernobyl; study on alternative bio-diesel sources in relation with soil decontamination in Belarus; pilot radiation early warning system in Ukraine and Belarus; assessment of the consequences of structural failure of Chernobyl Units 3/4; environmental assessment of the Chernobyl decommissioning plan; development of an integral concept for radioactive waste treatment and conditioning, for storage and disposal of such waste and for storage of spent fuel at Chernobyl; Chernobyl Unit 4-support for the nuclear regulatory administration of Ukraine; technology transfer of ground penetrating radar for the investigation of radioactive waste dumps in the Chernobyl exclusion area; and, technical equipment of the radiation monitoring laboratory for the &ldquo;Georgy Gotoytchits&rdquo; ship for monitoring the water system of the Dnieper river.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The Chernobyl regional remedial programme deals with the following: Thyroid cancer treatment-training for medical staff; designing and installing facilities for forming and packaging L-Thyroxine tablets in the Chernobyl affected regions; defining and implementing measures to improve the production, packaging, storage and distribution of iodised table salt in the Chernobyl affected regions; assistance in determining plans for the creation of a physical infrastructure for a &ldquo;New Town&rdquo; at Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast, Russia; defining and initiating a business development agency in Gomel Oblast, Belarus; defining and initiating a business development agency in Chernobyl, Ukraine; definition and implementation of a pilot project for the abstraction of groundwater for domestic potable supply; defining and implementing measures to improve and support public information in the Chernobyl affected regions; and, defining and implementing measures to improve the use of contaminated forestry waste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 22 October 1996, the Government would naturally be extremely concerned if any sale of prohibited nuclear weapons technology by a nuclear weapons state to a non-nuclear weapons state were to be confirmed.  Such sales to a non-party to the NPT which is, moreover, one of the three so-called &ldquo;threshold nuclear weapons states&rdquo; would be a particularly grave matter.  I also said in that reply, however, that I had no evidence at my disposal that China had sold prohibited nuclear technology to Pakistan and that both China and Pakistan had denied that any illegal transfer had taken place.  I have no authoritative new information at my disposal at this time nor has Ireland any independent capacity to verify the accuracy of the reports in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an international mechanism through which allegations concerning prohibited nuclear sales can be investigated.  The International <Col N="1054" /> Atomic Energy Agency is charged with overseeing the implementation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and in exercise of this function, it endeavours to investigate allegations made by member Governments.  From time to time, substantiated reports are brought to the attention of the membership.  If the agency were to confirm that NPT commitments had actually been breached, Ireland, along with the other members of the agency, would consider what action would be warranted.</P>
    <P>If, as a member of the relevant export control regimes &mdash; the nuclear suppliers group or the missile technology control regime &mdash; Ireland received confidential information tending to confirm the alleged sale of prohibited nuclear technology or otherwise giving cause for concern, we would, as a responsible exporter be guided by such information when making any pertinent export control decisions.  Ireland adheres scrupulously to its obligation not to export any material likely to contribute to a clandestine nuclear weapons programme.</P>

      <P>The commitment of the Government is clear and has been confirmed in this House on numerous occasions.  As stated in paragraph 4.115 of the Government White Paper on Foreign Policy, the Government has undertaken to put the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy to the people in a referendum.  This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged, unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to questions from Deputy Burke and Deputy Ahern on 31 October, this commitment is consistent with the declaration of the four party leaders before the Maastricht referendum which confirmed that any decision arising from the EUs 1996 Intergovernmental Conference on defence for the EU would require a further referendum.</P>

      <P>However, this tax measure is only part of the Government's broader strategy to assist the elderly.  The Minister for Social Welfare established a task force in January of this year to examine how the security needs of elderly persons who could not benefit from the tax relief might best be addressed.  As a result, a number of initiatives were launched last February, one of which involved £2 million in grant aid being made available this year to voluntary groups for security initiatives for the elderly, including the installation of physical security equipment such as monitored alarm systems.</P>

    <P>While I am satisfied that this annual injection of funds over a number of years has made a substantial impact, I am aware that more needs to be done if the needs of those awaiting services are to be met.  The Government is committed to the continued development of the services, as resources become available.  This commitment is outlined in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i></P>
    <P>I would hope to continue the development of further services for persons with a mental handicap based on the needs identified by the database.  My priority is to ensure that provision can be made to meet the needs of those who are currently without a service.</P>

This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.

This includes 56 posts which have been allocated under the early start pre-school programme.  I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources.</P>

      <P>One of the key principles underlying the curriculum <Col N="1068" /> for all schools, both primary and second level, is that it should respond to the needs of all pupils including those of low academic ability.</P>
      <P>In most instances, the classroom teacher is in a position to assist pupils with low academic ability.  For other pupils with more defined needs, a wide range of special educational services is provided including special schools, special classes, remedial teachers and resource teachers.</P>
      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee, which was published in 1993, set down a comprehensive range of measures for the future development of special education services. The recommendations of this Committee, which I have accepted in principle, are being implemented by my Department on a phased basis and as resources permit.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has already been made in this regard, including: a very substantial increase in special capitation rates payable to pupils attending special schools and classes; a one unit improvement in the pupil teacher ratio for special schools and classes in the 1996-97 school year; the upgrading of specialised equipment required in special schools and classes; a pilot scheme for the provision of escorts and safety harnesses on certain school transport services to assist pupils with special needs; the counting of pupils enrolled in special classes in ordinary national scools as part of the general enrolment for staffing purposes; the recruitment of additional psychologists; the appointment of additional remedial and resource teachers, bringing the total number of posts in the primary sector to 1,188 and 46 respectively; and the appointment of additional child care assistants to special schools and special classes bringing the total number of such posts to 232.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined have contributed to a significant improvement in the level of service available to pupils with special needs.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools. Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue the process.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the basic educational aims, which is set out in the White Paper on Education <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> is to provide students with the necessary education and training to support the country's economic development and to make their particular contribution to society in an effective way.  This aim underpins the process of reform in the education system.</P>
      <P>The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) is one particular initiative in the second level sector which responds to the changing work and business environment.  A central focus of the programme is to foster a spirit of innovation and initiative in young people by developing vocational, technological, communicative and interpersonal skills within the same programme.</P>
      <P>Modern European languages are an integral part of the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme as well as in the established Leaving Certificate Programme.  The improvement of the teaching and learning of languages in our second-level schools has been one of my policy priorities since I became Minister.  The White Paper on Education stipulates that all second level students should have access to the study of a modern European language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ongoing phased reform of the established Leaving Certificate subject syllabuses there is an increased emphasis on the vocational orientation of all subjects.  The languages, French, German, Spanish and Italian are among the <Col N="1072" /> subjects on the revised syllabuses which already have been introduced for examination in 1997 and after.  One of the main features of these revised language syllabuses is the increased emphasis on oral language.  The percentage of marks allocated to oral and listening skills is being increased from 30 per cent to 45 per cent in the Leaving Certificate, for both higher and ordinary levels, beginning in 1997.</P>
    <P>At third level the question of the supply of graduates in information technology has been under review.  The annual output of graduates in the computer sciences has increased steadily over the years and has doubled since 1986.  In the 1996-97 academic year the number of places in one year post-graduate courses in software under the EU-funded advanced technical skills programme has been increased from 150 to 600.</P>
    <P>I also announced in September 1995 that the Government had approved a £60 million capital development initiative funded equally by the State and the private sector to provide an additional 6,200 places in the universities by the year 2000.  Emphasis has been placed on the provision of additional numbers in the computer science application areas and as a result 1,200 of the additional places will be in these areas.</P>
    <P>In the languages area the third level institutions have developed a range of programmes which cross faculties and incorporate a foreign language as an integral part of the degree programme.  In the main the focus in these programmes is on applied languages with a view to producing graduates to meet the needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>The implications for the education system of the technological and language requirements of Irish industry and enterprise are, of course, kept under continuous review by my Department through a variety of processes and agencies.  The specific issue of skill requirements in the area of foreign languages is currently being examined by a joint Department of Education-IDA Working Group.  This is examining, in particular, the needs of the telemarketing sector.  On the wider strategic aspects, my Department, is working closely with the Department of Enterprise and Employment and its agencies in identifying the long-term skills needs of the Irish economy. Clearly technological and language requirements are high priority issues in this regard.</P>

    <P>Credited contributions ensure that a client's insurance record is maintained and these contributions can be taken into account in determining entitlement to other social welfare benefits and pensions subsequently.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>Community Employment is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation of long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is a social welfare payment.  Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those at whom the programme is targeted.  The present eligibility criteria for CE only came into effect earlier this year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment. In view of this and taking into account that the programme is operating close to capacity I do not propose to widen the eligibility criteria.</P>
      <P>Persons, including those signing for credits, who have been on the live register for more than 12 months are of course long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I understand from FÁS that the Co-operative Development Council and the Co-operative Development Unit &mdash; CDU &mdash; aims to assist the creation of a strong, commercially viable, worker co-operative sector.  In furtherance of this aim, the CDU provides three broad categories of financial assistance to its clients &mdash; assistance towards the preparation of a feasibility study-business plan; assistance towards start-up and working capital; and developmental grants for existing worker co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To obtain financial assistance towards the establishment of a worker co-operative, the promoters of the enterprise must first supply <Col N="1076" /> sufficient information to the CDU to allow it to make a judgment on the potential commercial viability of the proposed project.  Should the project have the potential of commercial viability, in the opinion of the CDU, financial assistance towards the preparation of a feasibility study may be sought.  To be eligible for feasibility study funding, the promoters would have to meet the following criteria.  The enterprise must consist of at least three persons and where there are only three people involved, the three persons concerned must not be related &mdash; in order to preserve the democratic nature of the enterprise &mdash; one person one vote; the promoters must have a commercially viable business idea; the promoters must have the balance of the funding needed to complete the feasibility study; and, the promoters must have the necessary skills to run the enterprise.</P>
    <P>When the feasibility study indicates that the project is viable, it is submitted to the grant approval committee which is a sub-committee of the co-operative Development Council.  This committee decides, on the basis of normal commercial criteria, whether financial assistance is provided, the level of that assistance and it will set out the conditions, standard and special, which will have to be met before the funding may be drawn down.</P>
    <P>The amount of the financial assistance available is set out in information literature which may be obtained from the Co-operative Development Unit, 27-33 Upper Baggot Street, Dublin 4, or through any FÁS office.</P>

      <P>Presumably this question relates to reports on the presence of inhibitory substances in foodstuffs.  The position in this regard is that in accordance with a series of EU regulations and directives my Department is required to carry out testing programmes for residues of pesticides, veterinary medicines, including hormones and antibiotics, and heavy metals and to compile, and submit annually, to the EU Commission reports on the results obtained under these programmes.</P>
      <P>While, in the case of veterinary medicines and heavy metals, the test results are not published they are supplied to interested parties on request. A summary of the results obtained under the pesticide residue programmes for the years 1990-95 was published last week.  More detailed results are currently being collated in reader friendly form for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 for publication in early 1997.</P>
      <P>As the foregoing indicates, these reports are not of an investigative nature.  However, if, in the course of a testing programme, any of the samples examined are found to contain residues of either prohibited substances or of permitted substances at levels above the maximum recommended or permitted levels further investigations are undertaken and, where sufficient evidence can be established to enable me to do so, legal proceedings are instituted.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated publicly on several occasions recently both my Department and I are totally committed to ensuring that inhibitory substance residues in food are reduced or eliminated altogether as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the article in the <i>Examiner</i> of 1 November 1996, which alleged the existence and suppression of &ldquo;a secret Department of Agriculture report&rdquo; on residues in pigmeat in 1995.  I have already indicated that no such report was either commissioned by or submitted to my Department and I attach a copy of a statement by my Department on the matter for the Deputy's information.</P>
      <P>As indicated in this statement, tests are carried out on an ongoing basis to monitor pigmeat for antibiotic residues.  It is accepted that while the action taken to deal with the higher level of antibiotic residues as disclosed by monitoring earlier this year was effective, a clear difficulty was created by the fact that consumers were not informed of the problem.  For the future, I intend to issue global results of residue testing on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it is my objective to secure the total elimination of antibiotic residues in pigmeat in order to ensure full compliance with legal requirements and to allay consumer concerns.  Following my demand for action, agreement has been reached between the representatives of the main producers and processors on the introduction of enhanced measures to deal with antibiotic residues.  My Department is committed to rigorously applying tighter controls in this area and to prosecuting those who fail to observe the relevant requirements.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in this House on 8 October 1996 to Questions Nos. 215 and 216 in relation to consultants appointed by me to make a technical assessment of an application from South Coast Community Television for a licence to operate their TV retransmission service.</P>
      <P>The consultants' brief does not extend to making an assessment of any other application but, as I have said before, I will have regard to the implications for other deflector systems which may arise from that assessment.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to support the mariculture industry in the Carrigaholt area of County Clare; and if he will ensure that water quality remains at the highest standard in the oyster beds.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the sustainable development of mariculture in coastal regions.  A total of four development sites have been licensed to date, in the immediate Carrigaholt coastal area, authorising the West Clare Development Co-operative Society Ltd. and an individual to engage in shellfish culture, including oysters.  A further three mariculture sites are currently under consideration for licensing to the local co-operative.</P>
      <P>BIM has been working closely with both the co-operative and individual oyster growers in the development of aquaculture on the northern side of the Shannon Estuary.  BIM has assisted a total of 31 projects in the region to develop oyster nursery and on-growing facilities with an aggregate investment of some £950,000 including Exchequer and EU grant aid.</P>
      <P>Carrigaholt Bay has a high water quality classification and is listed as a Category &ldquo;A&rdquo; area under EC Directive 91/492/EEC which lays down the health conditions for the production and placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs. Category &ldquo;A&rdquo; classification allows live bivalve molluscs, including oysters, from the area to be harvested for direct human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> Maintenance of marine water quality generally requires co-operation among several agencies including my Department, the Department of the Environment and the relevant local authorities.  If the Deputy has a specific concern in relation to water quality in Carrigaholt, I will be glad to have it examined further in conjunction with other relevant State agencies.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to implement, as quickly as possible and in a co-ordinated manner, the recommendations and objectives of the Review Group on Fishing Vessel Safety.  This will be achieved through a new national policy on fishing vessel safety which is in the final stages of preparation.  The success of this policy will especially require that the industry and individual fishermen address the need for change and develop a safety culture.  It will also require the putting in place of the necessary legislative framework, structures, logistical and financial resources, including Structural Funds and Exchequer moneys.  I am totally committed to pursuing these resources.</P>
