      <P>Does the Taoiseach wholeheartedly endorse what the Tánaiste said last night about not blocking a renewed IRA ceasefire and, if so, why does he not take the opportunity, which he again refused to do yesterday, to say this loudly and clearly either inside or outside the House?  Will he agree it is not so much a case of the British Government moving the goalposts on Sinn Féin's participation but that it has not decided where to put them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear we need an IRA ceasefire.  The conditions to be fulfilled for Sinn Féin's entry to the talks are set down in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules document. What the Tánaiste said was entirely consistent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about the proposed legislation to establish a food inspectorate.  Given that the Government cancelled its press conference yesterday, when will we see the legislation?  Is it the case that this will be a toothless quango which will not take over any of the regulatory functions from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry? If so, it will be seen simply as a PR gimmick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation will be published as soon as it is ready.  When I answered the question yesterday I indicated to the Deputy that it is being prepared as a matter of priority but I cannot give a time at this stage.  It will confer on the new board substantial powers to ensure food standards are maintained and enhanced in every case and that there is an effective inspection system to ensure that assurances of food quality can be stood over and constantly maintained and updated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry maintain its existing regulatory functions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the relevant responsibilities for the enforcement of individual items of legislation is under constant review and will be kept under examination at all times.  Any changes necessary will be made to ensure we can guarantee in every case that there are effective food quality regulations.  The problems in the food area have confronted us for some considerable time.  I am glad the Government is acting on the matter to enhance the existing regulatory arrangements over and above those we inherited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the action being taken in this matter.  When will we see the legislation?  Fianna Fáil will co-operate in the speedy handling of the legislation which everybody in the country agrees we should have. We can argue about the detail but I ask the Office of the Attorney General to give it priority so that it can be dealt with in the House before Christmas.  Is that possible?</P>

    <Col N="1595" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to Deputy Harney yesterday and again today that the legislation will be produced as soon as possible and that it is being treated as a priority matter both in the determination of the heads and its drafting.  I am not in a position to go any further to indicate a time but it will be produced as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As we all know, in recent months the Government could bring forward crime legislation within a matter of three weeks. Will the Taoiseach be more precise?  Is it likely, with the co-operation of every Member of the House, that the legislation will be passed before Christmas?  That is a fair question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give a similar degree of priority to the food safety legislation as was given to the crime legislation but I will not say that it will be produced within a given number of weeks as I do not know whether it will be.  I am not in a position to answer the question and I will not answer it before I am in a position to do so.  We will produce it as quickly as possible.  It is being treated as a matter of high priority and will involve a substantial enhancement in the oversight of the enforcement of food quality regulations through the food chain, it is important legislation for which there is a considerable and understandable public demand. The Government will respond to that demand with great speed.  It is important &mdash; I said this in regard to the crime legislation when Deputies were pressing me for time limits and so forth &mdash; that legislation of this nature works.  For legislation to work it has to be properly drafted. I will not set any artificial time limits which might inhibit the drafting of this legislation. Unfortunately, the legislation the Government is now introducing was not introduced earlier by this or any other previous Government.  It is now being treated as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the legislation should be properly drafted and it is nice to hear the Taoiseach say he is giving the matter priority. Three weeks ago, when the legislative plans for the remainder of this Dáil were issued, this legislation was not on any of the three schedules. We will co-operate in order to have this legislation brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is absolutely right and I make no apology for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Taoiseach to apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is clearly substantial public demand for this legislation.  It is necessary in the light of experience and public concern and that is the reason we are introducing it.  It is appropriate that the Government is seen to respond when an issue like this arises that <Col N="1596" /> requires legislative action.  We are acting on that priority which is felt by the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the legislation is urgently required and it is important that it works, but if it is not intended to take over existing functions from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry it will not work.  That Department has shown clearly over some considerable time that it is incapable of doing the job required of it.  Even if it takes more time the Taoiseach should examine this matter again because from what I read today it will not be adequate to do the job that is required.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach report any progress to the House on the administrative procedures Bill, a major commitment in the programme for Government dealing with citizens' rights in relation to all legislation from 1980 onwards?  It was to be sited in the Ombudsman's office under the jurisdiction of that office.  I asked about this matter a year ago and the Taoiseach said substantial progress had been made.  Why have we not seen this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Other issues have taken higher priority, one of which the Deputy has been referring to, namely, the crime package. Provisions in regard to other legislation are getting priority because of the importance of the issues concerned.  Given the limited drafting resources available, and we have increased them substantially on what existed when the previous Government was in office, it is impossible to proceed at the same pace with all legislation. Some Bills have higher priority than others.  For every priority there is obviously a posteriority.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa chomh maith thar cheann an Pháirtí Glas gach rath a ghuí ar Theilifís na Gaeilge.  On promised legislation, will the Taoiseach explain to the House the ongoing delay in bringing forward the Credit Union Bill which has had several promised dates of publication?  We were told it would be published before Christmas.  Is that the final date?  Will consideration be given at the appropriate time to debate the legislation on the new Food Advisory Board as amendments are necessary to what is proposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The food safety legislation has yet to be produced.  We will obviously take into account all points of view on the detail of it.  It is important that those who are inclined to be critical should await the proposals before they voice their criticisms because those who voice criticisms of legislation they have not yet seen are liable to be seen as being prejudiced and not people who have an open mind on the matter.  It is important that the legislation should be seen first before people decide it is deficient in a particular regard, and this legislation has not yet been produced.  I would advise Deputies who are prone to criticise to wait until they see the legislation before they do so.</P>

      <P>The Irish Takeover Panel Bill, 1996, provides for the designation of a takeover panel to monitor and supervise takeovers and certain other transactions in relation to securities in certain companies &mdash; mainly public limited companies quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange.  The designation of the takeover panel has two main objectives: to protect shareholders in situations where takeovers or other relevant transactions, for example, substantial acquisition of securities, are contemplated and/or put into effect; and to <Col N="1600" /> provide support and credibility for the Irish financial markets following the separation of the Irish Stock Exchange from London.</P>
      <P>The Stock Exchange Act, 1995, which was promoted by the Minister for Finance, provides for the regulation of stock exchanges and their members.  This Act was the first major legislation relating to the stock exchange in almost 200 years &mdash; it replaced the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799.  Essentially, the 1995 Act provides for a new supervisory system under which the Central Bank, as the supervisory authority, will have substantial powers concerning both the initial authorisation of stock exchanges, member firms and their ongoing supervision.  With the enactment of this Bill, the Irish Stock Exchange, Dublin, which up until then formed the Irish unit of the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Ltd., separated from the combined exchange.</P>
      <P>When the Dublin stock exchange formed part of the combined Dublin and London exchanges, the takeover code and rules of the takeover panel in London applied, respectively, to takeovers of companies listed on the Dublin, as well as the London, stock exchanges.  However, with the separation of the exchanges, the takeover panel indicated it no longer wished to retain responsibility for supervising takeovers in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>A working party drawn from a cross section of those involved in the Irish financial services industry, established in 1993 under the chairperson of the then president of the Irish Stock Exchange, examined the need for an Irish takeover panel in the new situation following the separation of the exchanges.  The working party recommended that such a panel be established. The majority of the working party favoured a statutory backed panel essentially to avoid any uncertainty in the area of takeover and merger activity in Ireland following the separation of both exchanges.</P>
      <P>Until now takeovers of companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange were subject to the UK takeover code and rules governing substantial acquisitions of securities.  These rules were operated on a voluntary basis.  However, because of the nature of the London market, parties involved in takeovers would generally respect any directions or rulings given.  In the new situation arising with the Irish exchange separating from London, there was concern that, if the takeover rules and panel were to operate other than on a statutory basis, there may not be the same respect for the rules and rulings given.  Such a situation would be totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides, while neither the UK panel nor its takeover code operate under any statutory or other public legal authority, the operation of the code is recognised and supported by the mechanism of the UK's Financial Services Act, 1986, which provides the regulatory framework for the protection of investors and the conduct of the financial markets in the United Kingdom.  The <Col N="1601" /> Securities and Investments Board, as well as the Securities and Futures Authority, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and other bodies discharging supervisory functions under the 1986 Act have imposed obligations on firms authorised to carry on investment business in the United Kingdom which relate to and support the code and its application by the panel.  For example, SIB has imposed the so-called &ldquo;cold shoulder&rdquo; rule which, in essence, obliges an authorised firm to which SIB's rules apply not to act for any person in connection with a takeover, merger or relevant acquisition of shares if the authorised person has reason to believe the persons for whom the firm would so act where not likely to comply with the code.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the matter, the then. Minister for Enterprise and Employment accepted the recommendation of the working group and undertook to provide the necessary statutory backing.  This Bill is the culmination of this undertaking.  The takeover panel will operate principally to ensure fair and equal treatment of all shareholders in the takeovers which fall within its remit.  The rules currently being drawn up by the panel will provide an orderly framework within which takeovers will be conducted.  As far as possible it is the intention of the panel to replicate the rules of the UK panel.</P>
    <P>The code is not concerned with the financial or commercial advantages or disadvantages of any particular takeover.  These are matters for the company and its shareholders.  Equally, the code is not concerned with issues such as competition, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of this Bill, the UK takeover panel has continued to accept responsibility for monitoring, etc., takeovers which fall within the takeover code.  This is being done on a grace and favour basis.  Also, following the confirmation that the Minister proposed to legislate for a takeover panel, the proposed nominating members of the panel have formed an interim panel and the Governor of the Central Bank has appointed a chairperson designate, Mr. Dan O'Keeffe, SC.  An interim director general designate, Mr. Leo Conway, formerly of Ulster Bank Finance, has also been appointed.  The preparation of the draft Bill has involved close and protracted discussions and consultations with the interim panel.</P>
    <P>The Bill is essentially concerned with giving statutory backing to a company to be known as the Irish Takeover Panel to monitor and supervise takeover activity here with a view to ensuring fair and equal treatment of all shareholders in takeovers which fall within its remit &mdash; in the main, these will involve companies currently quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>The Minister will designate this company to discharge this task subject to certain conditions <Col N="1602" /> being met.  The company must be incorporated under the Companies Acts as a public company limited by guarantee and the Minister must be satisfied that the company's memorandum and articles of association are consistent with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>There will be five members of the panel drawn from the various interests in the Irish financial markets.  The Minister can, by regulation, alter the membership if circumstances so require in the future.  The board of the panel will have seven directors.  Each of the members will nominate and appoint one director each.</P>
    <P>The Governor of the Central Bank nominates and appoints the chairman and vice-chairman and he will take account of the general public interest in making these appointments.  The directors so appointed can co-opt three further directors as required.  There is provision for alternate directors to be appointed where conflicts of interest arise.  The directors will be independent of the members in the discharge of their monitoring and supervisory functions.</P>
    <P>The panel will operate for this purpose through the medium of detailed rules which the panel will draw up.  However, in a number of key areas the Bill specifies what these rules must contain and provides, in relation to some of this number, that the Minister be consulted or approve them.</P>
    <P>The rules, which will be modelled where possible on the UK rules, must reflect the general principles set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The Minister can amend the Schedule, by regulation, after consultation with the panel.  The panel can give rulings, directions, etc., as required in each case arising.  It can apply to the courts to have these rulings enforced, if necessary, and an aggrieved party can seek a judicial review in the courts in relation to specific rulings or directions etc., of the panel.  The panel will be self-financing and required to submit an annual report which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I now propose to deal with the detailed provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As the title of the Bill makes clear, the task of the takeover panel will be to monitor and supervise takeovers and other relevant transactions, terms which are defined in section 1 of the Bill.  The reference to other transactions would include all matters that are incidental to takeovers, including work on the preparation of a takeover offer.  It also includes substantial acquisitions of securities.  These involve ways in which parties acquire shares in a company which falls within the remit of the panel but can only do so at a predetermined rate within specified timeframes.</P>
    <P>Other terms defined in section 1 which are also fundamental to the Bill are the definitions of &ldquo;acting in concert&rdquo; and &ldquo;control&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Acting in concert&rdquo; is a concept that is very important in the context of activities in which the takeover panel will be interested.  Essentially, it deals with circumstances where two or more parties act <Col N="1603" /> together.  It would be quite easy to avoid the provisions of the Bill if parties were able to so organise their affairs that no one of them fell within the size criteria laid down.  That would enable interested parties to drive a coach and four through the requirements of the Bill and the rules made by the takeover panel.  &ldquo;Control&rdquo;, as defined in the Bill, will arise where a party holds, in aggregate, not less than 30 per cent of the voting rights of the company.  This is also central to the activities of the takeover panel in that, when somebody acquires control, the party or parties acting in concert will have to make a mandatory offer to the remainder of the shareholders.</P>
    <P>In terms of the scope of the Bill, section 2 defines the companies to which the Act will apply &mdash; that is public limited companies or other bodies corporate incorporated in the State, whose securities are currently listed on the Stock Exchange or have been traded there within the previous two years.  It also enables the Minister to provide, by regulation, that the Act should apply to the securities of other public limited companies in the future if the need arises. Specifically excluded from the remit of the panel will be UCITS and investment companies under Part XIII of the Companies Act, 1990.  The former are excluded because of the particular manner and purpose for which the shareholding of such companies are brought together, namely, investors with a common purpose.  The same consideration essentially applies to investment companies within the meaning of Part XIII of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the designation by the Minister of the Irish Takeover Panel as the body to undertake the functions of the panel as set out in the Bill.  Certain conditions must be complied with before the designation can take place.  The specific conditions are that the panel be registered under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, as a public company limited by guarantee, to be known as the Irish Takeover Panel, and that the memorandum and articles of association of the company be approved by the Minister. Section 3 also specifies the provisions of existing Companies Acts that are disapplied in respect of the panel, and who will be the members of the panel.  There will be five members of the panel and these are the bodies specified in section 6, namely the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies -Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Irish Bankers' Federation, and the Irish Stock Exchange.  In the case of any of these bodies not being a body corporate, section 3 provides that an individual or body corporate nominated by the unincorporated body will be the member of the Irish Takeover Panel.  The membership of the panel is representative of the various interests involved in the Irish financial markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> Sections 4 and 5 deal with the other matters relating to the memorandum and articles of association of the panel.  Section 4 is designed to ensure that, following the incorporation and designation of the panel, the members will not be able to alter either the memorandum or articles of association without the prior approval of the Minister.  As already indicated, section 3 provides that the memorandum and articles have to be approved by the Minister prior to the designation of the company.  The particular section 4 provision will now ensure that no changes are made without the Minister being made aware of and agreeing to them.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the principal objects that must be included in the memorandum of association of the Irish Takeover Panel.  These are the monitoring and supervision of takeovers and other relevant transactions to ensure that the provisions of the Act, including the scheduled principles and any rules made by the panel under section 8 of the Bill, are complied with as respects each such transaction.  It further provides that the panel can include in its memorandum such other objects and powers as are reasonably necessary or proper to enable it to discharge its functions, provided these are consistent with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6, already referred to, makes provision for the directors of the panel.  Effectively, the directors of the panel will monitor takeovers and issue any directions and rulings pursuant to the rules which they make under section 8. Accordingly, it is vitally important that the panel and its directors should be able to discharge their functions without hindrance or other improper direction from the members who have nominated the directors.  The panel will have seven directors who will be nominated by the five specified bodies already referred to, representing the various interests in the financial industry.  In addition, the Governor of the Central Bank will appoint the chairperson and deputy chairperson. While not stipulated in the Bill, the Governor will have regard to the general public interest in making these appointments.</P>
    <P>In particular cases, conflicts of interest could arise, and it is accordingly proposed that the directors should be able to have alternates nominated to take their place in such circumstances.  In addition, particular takeovers may arise where the expertise available to the panel may be wanting in some respects.  In such circumstances, it will be possible to co-opt up to three additional directors to the panel whose term of office may relate to the individual takeovers, but is not so limited.  Because the provisions of section 182 of the 1963 Act override any provision in the articles of a company, and provide that the members of a company may remove a director, it is necessary to disapply that particular provision in respect of the panel, given that we want the panel directors to be totally independent of the members who nominated them.  Provision is made for the Minister to either <Col N="1605" /> add to or remove any of the nominating bodies in the future, if circumstances arise where this proves necessary or desirable.  The consequence of such a removal is that the director, nominated by such a member who is removed, should automatically relinquish his position and this is provided for in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the general duty on the panel to monitor and supervise takeovers to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act, including the scheduled principles.  However, to avoid circumstances where parties try to encourage the panel to undertake activities that are not within its remit, subsection (2) provides that the panel cannot be compelled to act in circumstances where it would not otherwise be required to.  The section also provides that the Minister may amend the scheduled principles following consultation with the panel.  This will require a positive resolution of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is a key provision of the Bill and will enable the panel to make rules to set out the various requirements to be complied with by parties engaging in takeover activity.  In general, the approach is that it will be the panel's responsibility to draw up the rules in accordance and compliance with the Act.  However, in three specific areas, section 8 lays down requirements that must be included in the rules.  Subsection (2) provides that the Minister must be consulted in regard to the determination of what will amount to a &ldquo;substantial acquisition of securities&rdquo;.  The reason this is proposed is that the rules in this instance will determine percentage limits and time limits within which acquisitions can only take place, but which will not result in actual control of a company arising.  For instance, under the present UK substantial acquisition rules, no party may acquire 10 per cent in any company in a seven day period if, as a result of the acquisition plus what he already holds, a person would end up holding between 15 and 30 per cent.  This follows the same approach as in the case of a takeover in that it is the Minister who will determine the percentage limit as to when control arises.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 8 provides that the panel must make rules for the making of a mandatory offer where a person acquires control of a company, whether acting alone or in concert with other parties.  The takeover panel rules may also apply to companies that are subject to the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, and this section provides that the rule must make specific provision for what happens if the Minister makes a reference under the said 1978 Act to the Competition Authority.  The possibilities that would arise include the suspension of the take-over offer while the matter is considered by the Competition Authority and the Minister, through to the lapsing of an offer where a reference is made.  However, the detailed rules will be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that the panel may grant derogations or waive rules in the particular <Col N="1606" /> circumstances of an individual case.  However, this can only be done by reference to the scheduled principles.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the power of the panel to make rulings, give directions, etc.  As already indicated, there was concern that, if the Take-over Rules and Panel were to operate here other than on a statutory basis, there might not be the same respect, as applies in London, for the rules and rulings given.</P>
    <P>Consequently, section 9 is one of the central pillars of the activities of the panel, in that it underpins rulings and directions that will be given by the panel.  In addition, the provision provides that where the panel issues rulings and directions, it may publish these.  This will ensure that all market participants are aware of the decisions given and taken by the panel.</P>
    <P>To enable the panel to operate effectively, it must also be able to obtain information, this section will ensure that the panel can seek information and the parties who are asked for the information will be obliged to provide it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is designed to ensure that, following appropriate inquiry or examination on the matter, the panel may, if it thinks fit, advise, admonish or censure parties in relation to their conduct in a take-over.  The section further provides that the panel can publish its advice, admonition or censure.  As a protection for parties the subject of the sanction imposed by the panel, such parties will be empowered to apply to the court, and the court, following a hearing on the matter, can either confirm the decision of the panel or annul the decision and make certain orders.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is essentially a procedural section, and makes provision for a number of practical matters that will enable the panel to exercise its powers.  In the first instance, it provides for the power of the panel to conduct hearings.  Secondly, it provides that these hearings can be held otherwise than in public.  The panel is given the power to ensure the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents by such witnesses. It also provides for the position of a witness appearing before the panel.  Finally, it creates an offence for a person who fails to obey a summons of the panel.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that the panel can apply to the court to have its rulings or directions enforced.  One major difference between the preexisting code dealing with take-overs and the new regime proposed under the present legislation is the involvement of the court.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, the respect of parties involved in take-overs for the code and rulings of the London Takeover Panel derived in many respects from the international standing of the UK market.  The same could not be said to apply in the case of the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is possible that some parties the subject of rulings or directions might, for their own reasons, be prepared to defy the panel. Section 12 is designed to enable the panel to go <Col N="1607" /> into court to get the court to enforce a ruling or direction where this is being ignored by the party in question.</P>
    <P>When an application is made to the court, the court can make interim or interlocutory orders as it deems necessary.  However, the panel cannot apply to the court earlier than seven days from the making of the ruling or giving of the direction. This is designed to allow the party against whom the ruling or direction was made to consider its position and, in particular, to consider whether or not it wants to make an application to the court under section 13.</P>
    <P>In fact, the court is specifically precluded from making an order where such an application has been made.  However, the panel may apply and the court may grant interim or interlocutory relief as is considered appropriate by the court under section 13(8).  This would ensure that in particular cases, where urgency was involved, and this is likely to be the case in some take-overs, the panel would not be debarred from going into court at an early stage.</P>
    <P>While respect for the rulings and directions is a very important feature of the take-over code, inevitably circumstances will arise where a party will feel aggrieved at the rules, ruling or direction given by the panel.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is designed to provide a mechanism which will enable such parties to have their concerns examined by the court and, where necessary, obtain relief.  However, it is designed that applications to the court will not be entertained otherwise than on substantial grounds.</P>
    <P>In addition, the timeframe within which applications to the court must be made is extremely tight.  However, the court can extend the time limit in certain cases but, <i>inter alia,</i> must bear in mind the nature of the relief that can ultimately be granted.</P>
    <P>Moreover, where the High Court gives its decision, any appeal to the Supreme Court will only be possible where the High Court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance.  Of course, the right of appeal on constitutional grounds is preserved.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in relation to the previous paragraph, this section also ensures that, in particular cases, while awaiting the outcome of a judicial review, the court may grant interim or interlocutory relief as it considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>Overall, section 13 is designed to provide a balanced approach to ensure that parties can protect their interests while at the same time ensuring that take-over activity is not unduly impeded.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with provisions with respect to appeals, applications, etc., to the court.  Time is a huge factor in most take-overs.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate to try to ensure that the court will be available to deal with matters that <Col N="1608" /> arise, in particular take-overs, and deal with them as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is desirable that as far as possible, one judge should deal with all applications.  This would enable the judge to become familiar with the rules, rulings and directions of the panel and should assist the process of ensuring speedy decisions from the court.</P>
    <P>Moreover, having regard to the confidential nature of some of the information in relation to take-overs, this section also provides for the court, in particular cases, to hear the case in camera.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is designed to ensure that where transactions in relation to a take-over have been completed, the provisions of this Bill cannot be used to have them unwound.  In many cases when the take-over is concluded, the offeror will immediately move to introduce new arrangements in the company which has been taken over.  This could involve the sale of property, the rearrangement of existing facilities, the redeployment of management and so on.  It would be invidious to allow for the unscrambling of a take-over when it has been completed, having regard to such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the only circumstances in which a take-over can be unscrambled will be on the basis of an application by the takeover panel itself under section 12.  It will be recalled that under that section, where the panel considered that parties were likely to ignore their rulings, they can go into court immediately to have the ruling or direction, etc. confirmed.</P>
    <P>This would thus become all the more important having regard to section 15(a) where a party could seek to ignore a ruling or direction of the panel in the knowledge that when the take-over has been carried out, no other party other than the panel could seek to have the take-over unwound.</P>
    <P>Even where a take-over has been carried out in accordance with a rule, ruling or direction, even though this is subsequently declared invalid or quashed, it cannot result in the unwinding of the take-over, again, save for the action that can be taken by the panel.  For the panel to take such action, it would be of the view that the circumstances justified the unscrambling of the take-over, and the fair treatment of all the shareholders involved.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the panel will be self-financing and it is not proposed that Central Government funds will be used to meet any of the expenses of the panel.  In the circumstances, it is necessary to give the panel the power to defray the expenses incurred in performing its functions and section 16 does this.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that, subject to the consent of the Minister, the panel will impose a levy on relevant companies and other parties which are involved in a take-over.  Before agreeing to any charges, the Minister will consult any persons or parties considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> Since the Minister's announcement of his intention to legislate for a takeover panel, an interim panel has been in operation.  While it is not yet involved in vetting any take-overs, much preparatory work has been undertaken.  This involved extensive consultations with the Department in the preparation of the draft legislation, and then the preparation of draft memorandum and articles for approval by the Minister as well as the preparation of the draft rules and code with explanatory notes.</P>
    <P>The interim panel also has close contact with the UK panel and has benefited from training and other information provided by the UK panel.  It is intended that the expenses incurred by the interim panel can be defrayed by the panel when it becomes operational.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is designed to ensure information obtained by parties directly or indirectly involved in the work of the takeover panel will be regarded as confidential and will not be disclosed other than in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  In this regard, it is provided that: disclosure can be made where this is necessary to explain why a ruling or direction was given or where disclosures are made to certain parties to facilitate their operation, e.g., to the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This section also provides a penalty for failure to observe confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Section 18 will ensure that confidential information that would not normally be disclosable in legal proceedings will have the same benefit under this legislation.  This could be important in ensuring the privacy of confidential communications between the client and his legal adviser in particular.</P>
    <P>Given that it is now proposed to legislate for the operation of the panel, it is considered appropriate that an annual report should be submitted on its activities and in turn the Minister should arrange for the publication of the report. Section 19 provides accordingly.  It also provides that the Minister can prescribe the matters and information that he wants to see addressed in the report but there is the proviso that information which could materially injure or unfairly prejudice the legitimate interests of any person should not be disclosed in the annual report.</P>
    <P>The panel will operate in a particularly sensitive area.  It will issue rulings and give directions.  There is always a possibility that certain parties would feel aggrieved.  Provided the panel and the members, directors and so on do not act in bad faith, section 20 will give them protection against being held liable for damages. Separately, the section makes provision that will enable the panel to indemnify any member, director, officer or employee of the panel in respect of their activities on behalf of the panel. The section provides for the inclusion, in the Defamation Act, 1961, of a provision that would ensure that any report of the activities of the panel will benefit from qualified privilege as provided for under that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> Because of the interest of the panel in matters in the corporate area, it is considered appropriate that the panel should be specifically identified as a party which has access to reports of investigations carried out under Part 11 of the Companies Act, 1990, or reports of relevant authorities of a recognised stock exchange under Part IV of the Companies Act, 1990, dealing with insider dealing.</P>
    <P>These reports could relate to areas in respect of which the panel will have a particular interest. The primary legislation already provides for the availability of those reports to other interested parties.  Now that we will have an Irish takeover panel, it is considered appropriate that it should be specified as a party to whom access to the reports should be made available.  Section 21 provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>In a number of provisions, there is reference to prescribed matters.  &ldquo;Prescribed&rdquo; means prescribed by the Minister by way of regulations. Section 22 deals with the manner in which such regulations are made.  In certain instances, it will be sufficient for the Minister to lay the regulations before the House.  However, in two instances &mdash; those in section 2 (1) (c), where the Minister could extend the companies to which the panel's remit applies and section 7 (3), where the Minister would effectively change the scheduled principles &mdash; it is provided that the regulations made by the Minister should have positive approval by the Oireachtas.  The other circumstances where the Minister would exercise his power to make regulations would involve the prescription of a recognised stock exchange or the threshold at which mandatory offers must be made.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is a reasonably standard provision included in legislation where reference is made to a particular body, and it simply provides that any document sealed with the seal of the panel will be accepted by a court in evidence unless proof to the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>One of the central features of the activities of the takeover panel will be the issuing of notices, directions and other rulings to parties involved in a takeover.</P>
    <P>Section 24 makes provision on the manner in which the information is to be conveyed.  It also provides that in the case of a company registered under the Companies Acts, the registered office will be the residence of the company.</P>
    <P>Sections 11(5) and 17(3) provide for an offence. Section 25 provides for penalties for persons found guilty of an offence under these sections. It also provides that in the case of offences under-section 11(5) the proceedings may be prosecuted by the panel, while in the case of proceedings for an offence under section 17, these may be prosecuted by the Minister.  In addition, the time limit within which proceedings can be brought is two years.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is also a standard provision that ensures that any expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act will be <Col N="1611" /> ment out of general funds.  As mentioned in relation to section 16, it is not proposed that the Minister or the Central Government funds will be involved in providing any funding to the activities of the Irish takeover panel.</P>
    <P>Section 27 contains the short title as well as the manner in which the Act can be commenced.  The Schedule to the Act contains the principles which will be applicable to the conduct of takeovers.</P>
    <P>Essentially the principles are a general expression of the matters that will govern the activities and rules of the panel in ensuring that all takeovers are operated in a fair and reasonable manner.  Principle 1 simply provides that all shareholders of the same class will receive equal treatment.  Principle 2 provides that all shareholders of the company which is the subject of the offer will obtain equal information. Principle 3 is designed to ensure that the parties making the offer will be able to implement the offer.  Principle 4 is designed to ensure that appropriate information and advice should be made available to the shareholders and in a timely fashion.  Principle 5 is designed to prevent the creation of false markets by making misleading statements or engaging in inappropriate conduct which could mislead the market or shareholder.  Principle 6 provides that the directors of a company which is likely to be the subject of an offer should refrain from taking any action which could prevent the offeror completing his offer, unless approved by shareholders in a general meeting.  Principle 7 provides that the directors of the offeree company should ensure they do not compromise their position by entering into any commitments with an offeror.  Principle 8 provides that the directors on all sides should act in the general interests of the shareholders as a whole.  Principle 9 is designed to prevent the oppression of minority shareholders.  Principle 10 is designed to ensure that the offeror makes certain they will be able to complete an offer.  Principle 11 provides that the affairs of the offeree company should not be disrupted by any unreasonable length of time. Principle 12 provides that a substantial acquisition of securities, for example, where control will not result, should only take place at an acceptable speed and that there should be adequate disclosure.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of my colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for presenting the Bill to the House.  This legislation becomes necessary as a result of the separation of the Irish unit from the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited.  The Irish exchange is now incorporated as the Irish Stock Exchange Limited.  For many years it was felt in certain quarters that it was not appropriate for major transactions in this country to come under the <Col N="1612" /> effective control and guidance of a London takeover panel when the Irish and UK stock exchanges were combined.  The London panel was firm when firmness was required, it was strong when strength was necessary, it had recourse to the necessary expertise and showed a capacity to respond quickly and give recognition, where appropriate, to the fact that Ireland is a different geographical area and differs enormously in size from the United Kingdom. Above all the London takeover panel was, and was perceived to be, independent.  This last quality is always of particular value but was especially important for us in the relatively small size of our economy with the inevitability of individuals having to wear more than one hat.</P>
      <P>It is entirely appropriate that this country should have its own separate takeover panel and for that reason alone I welcome the Bill.  The Bill defines &ldquo;control&rdquo; as being &ldquo;... not less than 30 per cent (or such other percentage as may be prescribed) of the voting rights ...&ldquo;.  While I am in favour of the 30 per cent level, which represents a continuation of the <i>status quo</i>, I have some concerns that the Bill prescribes that the Minister alone may alter this percentage by ministerial regulation.  I am not happy with legislation which has been extensively discussed in the House and signed by the President being subsequently altered solely by ministerial regulation.  The figure of 30 per cent is an important trigger in the legislation and it should not be altered without reference to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers companies trading on the Stock Exchange now or who have done so in the last two years.  This provision should be extended to cover companies which have a listing on the exchange, although suspended, irrespective of the duration.</P>
      <P>Two major challenges presented themselves in the drafting of the Bill.  One is the establishment of a truly independent body and the other is the establishment of a statutory body with power and authority in a country where there is ready access to the courts and constitutional protections.  The takeover panel in London, while not a statutory body, did not have to worry about constitutional challenges and derived its effective authority from the fact that any party which did not accept its rulings found it difficult to do business in the UK.  This was effected through voluntary regulation, a system much favoured in the UK and one which operates well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the issue of independence, in a merger or takeover it would not be unusual to have three or more firms of stockbrokers, lawyers, merchant banks, reporting accountants, PR consultants, etc. acting for the various parties, including minority interests.  Other firms may be precluded due to conflicts of interest, perceived or otherwise.  In the stockbrokers' profession this would greatly reduce the options in choosing an independent stockbroker to act as a representative of the Irish Stock Exchange on the <Col N="1613" /> proposed panel.  The same applies to a lesser extent to accountants, lawyers, investment managers and bankers.</P>
    <P>The proposed panel will comprise five persons from the bodies mentioned and a chairperson and deputy chairperson nominated by the Governor of the Central Bank.  These seven directors may nominate up to three further persons giving a maximum complement of ten.  At least one or two of these places should be reserved for professionals residing outside the State.  The Judiciary has traditionally led the way in showing how independence can be practised and preserved.</P>
    <P>We can secure and enjoy the services of a truly independent takeover panel.  However, one should consider that the chairperson and deputy chairperson will be appointed by a person nominated by the Minister for Finance.  I wish to make no reflection on the Minister for Finance or the Governor, the Central Bank or any already designated panel chairperson but I wonder if it is in the best interests of the State to have its appointees as chairperson or deputy chairperson of the panel.  After an initial period of two years the panel should have the power to appoint its own chairperson for a fixed term of, for example, three or four years, subject to a maximum of two terms.</P>
    <P>Owing to the contraction in the number of companies listed on the Stock Exchange which is only partly offset by new entrants, the proposed takeover panel will have periods of inactivity and will not be able to benefit from experience gained from regular involvement in takeover transactions.  Therefore, it is of prime importance that the panel be properly constituted from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the powers of the panel and the issue of effective sanctions.  In this Bill the panel gets its power from the courts.  I do not see a ready alternative to this solution which is by no means perfect because it is possible to envisage fair and reasonable bids being thwarted by contrived delays in the legal system which do not require a great degree of expertise to attain.  The Bill could be improved through a provision whereby parties seeking a judicial review of the panel's findings would be required to make a substantial deposit of £50,000 or more before seeking access to the courts.  In the event of the court deciding that a judicial review was not appropriate the moneys would be forfeit to the panel.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with the power of the panel to impose charges.  I estimate the cost of maintaining the takeover panel for five years at over £1 million.  In the absence of takeover activity for a prolonged period funding will be a problem for the panel.  There are about 75 companies quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange &mdash; we have one of the smallest exchanges in the EU.  There are many plc companies which are not quoted and I do not understand what makes it so unattractive for them to go on the market.  However, only 20 <Col N="1614" /> or less of those quoted are actively trading and the number likely to be involved in contested takeovers with a consequent involvement of the panel will not be great.  The London stock exchange, one of the world's leading markets, has an enormous level of activity when compared to the Irish Stock Exchange.  It fell substantially yesterday due to interest rate movements.  Any undue levies on Irish companies may encourage them to seek their primary listing in London rather than Dublin.  A number of companies already have listings in Dublin and London.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that the Minister shall cause copies of the panel's annual report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There should be a stipulation that this should be done by 30 September of each year at the latest.  A period of nine months should be more than adequate.  The long delays before some State companies' accounts are placed before the Oireachtas are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out the principles applicable to the conduct of takeovers.  This is an excellent set of principles.  Company directors should direct their attention to the sixth principle which states:</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the directors of an offeree when an offer is made or when they have reason to believe that the making of an offer is imminent to refrain from doing anything as respects the conduct of the affairs of the offeree which might frustrate that offer or deprive shareholders of the opportunity of considering the merits of the offer, except upon the authority of those shareholders given in general meeting.</P>
    <P>The eighth principle reminds the directors in laudable terms of their duties to the respective shareholders thus:</P>
    <P>... to act in disregard to personal interest when giving advice and furnishing information in relation to the offer; in discharging that duty the said directors shall be bound to consider the interests of the shareholders as a whole.</P>
    <P>The eleventh and twelfth principles seem to have been tacked on and their deletion would improve the thrust of the first ten principles.  The eleventh principle refers to &ldquo;... beyond a reasonable time... &ldquo; without trying to define this and the twelfth principle makes reference to &ldquo;acceptable speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;adequate and timely disclosure&rdquo; which are also matters of opinion.</P>
    <P>During the time the London Takeover Panel had jurisdiction over the Irish Stock Exchange it worked well and there was little abuse in the financial area.  The only problem in modern times which comes to mind is the one involving stockbrokers and Greencore which had to be investigated by the London Takeover Panel.  The Minister was in Opposition at that time and he was very vocal about the matter, but he is in charge now.  The findings of the panel in that case were in the best interests of investors and <Col N="1615" /> shareholders.  This company is now one of the flagships on the Irish Stock Exchange and has traded on the London Stock Exchange.  The Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, which have been flagships for Irish investors, are internationally renowned, are quoted on the London and Irish Stock Exchanges and have traded successfully.  The takeovers in this area in the past have not created any problems for the economy or the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister, his officials and all concerned in drafting legislation to deal with this difficult area.  Only time will tell whether the legislation fulfils the task required of it and assists all those involved in business.  It is understandable why such a small number of companies are trading on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  The press and public galleries are empty and people do not really know what the legislation is about.  I am glad the Minister, who has different views, is taking this very important legislation.  I have no doubt he will encourage further privatisation which will lead to a more developed Stock Exchange.  Many large companies would benefit from extra capital from a cheaper source.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy O'Keeffe in congratulating the Minister in bringing this measure before the House.  I identify with all the sentiments expressed by him in his excellent contribution.  I do not propose to go through the legislation on a line by line basis but I intend to make a number of remarks which ought to be considered at the very least and if, on consideration are deemed to have some weight, should be taken on board.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe on the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; in section 1.  If control is to be varied from a 30 per cent figure to, say, 20 per cent, 25 per cent or 40 per cent this is a matter of such significant import that the regulation making such a change should also belong to the category of regulations which requires a positive resolution of this House to bring it about.  The concept of control is central to the entire takeovers code and this House should not simply delegate to a Minister the process of determining what amounts to control.  Control will be a central concept of the legislation after its enactment and we should not say a central concept means whatever a Minister says it means at a given time.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting we should freeze the figure of 30 per cent in stone and make it immutable thereafter.  There should be a capacity to change the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; if there are good reasons for so doing, but it is not desirable for Members to wake up one morning and find that somebody has passed a statutory instrument which says control now means 35 per cent, 20 per cent or whatever.  The effect and meaning of the legislation will be changed considerably by a regulation of that kind made in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> I strongly urge that the provision in section 22(3) which requires a positive decision of the House &mdash; this already applies to matters dealt with in sections 2 and 7 &mdash; be extended to the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; if regulations are made under section 1.  The term &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;, where it is used in the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; in section 1(1), should be subject to the same requirement as the matters specified in sections 2 and 7 and identified in section 22(3).  There is a minor misprint in section 22(3) which refers to section 2(1)(c).  There is no subsection (1) in section 2 and perhaps this can be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister it is desirable that the cost of supervising takeovers and the expenses of the panel should not be defrayed by the ordinary taxpayer who has enough calls on his or her wages in the form of tax, levies, etc.  The Minister said he envisages that the panel will be self-financing by means of the imposition of charges under section 16 which states: &ldquo;The Panel may, for the purpose of defraying the expenses incurred by it in performing its functions under this Act, impose charges at such rates as are from time to time determined by it with the consent of the Minister...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In other words, the panel will put forward the proposal and the Minister will consent to it.  The charges will be (a) on relevant companies; (b) on a person, not being a relevant company, in respect of an offer made by that person; (c) on any person in respect of a dealing he or she has in the securities of a relevant company and (d) on any person in respect of a document furnished by him or her to the panel in accordance with rules under section 8 in relation to a takeover or other relevant transaction or in relation to any proceedings of the panel concerning a takeover or other relevant transaction.</P>
    <P>A series of charges can be imposed under section 16 but I am not clear whether the term &ldquo;charge&rdquo; implies that there must be a transaction in relation to the panel to which the charge relates or whether it will be a standing levy on every quoted company on the Stock Exchange. Under section 2 &ldquo;relevant company&rdquo; means a public limited company or other body incorporated in the State, the securities of which are for the time being traded on a market regulated by a recognised Stock Exchange.  Will there be a general power to levy the expenses of the panel on the companies quoted on the Stock Exchange by way of an annual levy or will the charges be imposed in respect of a particular transaction relating to a particular company?  In other words, is this a general power of levy or is it confined to specific transaction-related levies?</P>
    <P>I do not mind which it is but if the takeover panel has a predictable budget &mdash; the panel not only has a chairman but also a director general &mdash; then presumably it will have some expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> No budget has been laid before the House as to the level of expenses the company is envisaged to have in any given year.  If its expenditure amounts to many thousands of pounds &mdash; it will vary from time to time depending on the volume of attempted takeovers &mdash; and it is proposed to recoup those expenses by reference to a varying volume of takeovers, will the annual overheads of the body be visited on the one or two poor idiots who come to the attention of the panel in a given year?  Will they be required to pay charges or will the panel take a long-term view of what would be necessary to make it self-financing?  Will it take the view that even though there were no chargeable transactions in a given year, there could be some the following year?  The expenditure of the panel could vary dramatically from year to year, but its income, unless it is entirely transaction related, would not necessarily vary correspondingly.  Will the Minister elaborate on that matter?</P>
    <P>Section 11 gives the panel the power to compel people to attend a hearing, to examine them on oath and to produce documents.  This section suffers from a deficiency which is common when such provisions are incorporated in legislation.  If a person does not conform with the direction given by the panel he or she will be guilty of an offence under section 11(5).  To bring such a prosecution procedure into effect, a file must be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, his office must consider it and the person must be summoned to appear before the District Court, with the right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  Given the length of time involved in this procedure the person concerned may decide that the nature of the proceedings and possible penalties make it worthwhile to take a risk rather than comply with an obligation under the legislation.  The Minister should provide that the panel can apply to the High Court on motion for an order directing people to comply in its behaviour and thereby invoke the contempt of court procedures on the basis that if they fail to do what they are required to do under the other provisions of section 11, they will be liable to be attached and committed by the High Court for contempt.  That sensible strengthening procedure would make up for some of the weaknesses which arise from simply penalising in a criminal manner disobedient or non-co-operative behaviour under section 11(5).</P>
    <P>Section 6(2) states, &ldquo;The Panel may perform any of its functions through or by any of its officers or employees or any other person duly appointed by the Panel in that behalf.&rdquo;  Is the Minister suggesting that an employee can perform any function of the panel?  I do not believe that is what he wants.  I am in favour of the panel being able to carry out its day to day functions through its staff, but important functions should not be discharged by employees. This is a quasi-judicial body and that provision is equivalent to saying that the Registrar of the <Col N="1618" /> Supreme Court can perform any of the functions of that court.  I am unhappy with this provision. It should be re-examined to ascertain if we are using inappropriate language.  The purpose of the provision is to enable the panel direct a member of its staff to summon a person before it, but the term &ldquo;any of its functions&rdquo; is so widely cast that it includes functions of admonition.  Perhaps the Minister could reassure me that there is some other provision in the Bill which ensures that is not the case.  The provision is overly widely cast as it stands.</P>
    <P>In general, for an orderly stock market to exist it is desirable that takeovers should be conducted in a manner in which every shareholder is guaranteed equity both in regard to the value of his or her shares and in the way in which his or her directors and the directors of the offeror company deal with that person.  The reason is to create an artificially but fair market in which everybody is accorded equal treatment.  This means a person with a 25 per cent shareholding should not be given a better offer for his or her shares than a smaller shareholder, that inside information or behind the scenes deals are not done in a way to make shares with a certain value less valuable or that a shareholder is not prevented from getting added value on a transaction to which the panel's activities relate.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill has been introduced. However, it highlights the virtual drought of investment opportunities here, the blame for which lies chiefly with the Labour Party.  We do not have an enterprise culture.  The Labour Party is committed to preventing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I always accord them the benefit of the doubt.  They have not been strident opponents of any form of disengagement from the State.  Deputy Rabbitte could be converted to these points of view.  Some of his benighted colleagues on the so-called left of the Irish political spectrum are incorrigible in this regard.  Some of them are adamantly opposed to the proposition that there should be any decent opportunities to invest in many areas where Irish pension funds and small Irish shareholders and investors would be willing to invest if they could.  For example, why should Irish pension funds and investors not be in a position to invest in Irish airports and capitalise on them when Irish airports, in the form of the Aer Rianta monopoly, have taken advantage of English and Australian laws in privatising airport control to compete and purchase assets in those jurisdictions?  Why do we allow State monopolies take advantage of other countries' privatisation arrangements and not offer shareholders the right to invest funds in similar activities here?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Dempsey on 30 October 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the £1.5 billion contribution made by motorists to the Exchequer,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the fact that taxpayers in Ireland and Europe have already paid for the provision of a proper road network,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the huge social and environmental consequences for local residents, calls on the Government to clearly state its opposition to the imposition of tolls on the remainder of the Dublin C Ring and the Lee Tunnel.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann noting</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, sets out guidelines on the tolling of national roads which are similar to those adopted by successive Governments since 1985;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that these guidelines were endorsed in the Operational Programme for Transport, which was launched on 9 November 1994 by Deputy Michael Smith, then Minister for the Environment, and Deputy Brian Cowen, then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the Operational Programme for Transport indicated that it was anticipated that up to £100 million might be raised from tolling national roads;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the initiative in deciding which national roads, if any, might be subject to tolls rests with the National Roads Authority;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the procedures which must be complied with before a toll can be imposed on any road include the making of a toll scheme, the giving of public notice and the submission of the scheme for the approval of the Minister for the Environment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that where there are objections to a scheme, a public inquiry must be held before a final decision can be taken on the scheme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the Minister for the Environment, because of his quasi-judicial role in making the final decision under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993 on toll road proposals, is not free to comment on particular proposals in advance of such decision; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the concerns expressed by the Minister in <Col N="1620" /> his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 108 of 27 March 1996 in relation to any scheme to toll the Dublin C Ring Road and the range of issues to which he will have regard in the assessment of toll proposals;</P>
    <P>&mdash;endorses the Minister's view that the submissions made in the public consultation process provided for under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993 and the effects of traffic diversion on residential and other areas, should bear heavily on any decision which he may be called upon to make should toll proposals be presented to him for decision.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I strongly support the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil on the tolling of roads. There is a dearth of ideas from Government whenever Fianna Fáil puts forward proposals.  It trawls through past records to see what Fianna Fáil said on different dates and times.  I find that a pathetic form of Government.  The Government should share its thinking and ideas, if it has any, rather than adopting this ridiculous, negative approach towards every idea put forward by my party in this House.</P>
      <P>I warn the Minister that motorists will not accept more tolls on the Dublin ring road. Motorists currently pay more than £1,700 million per annum in the form of taxes and duties on vehicles, parts and fuel.  The investment of even a quarter of this money each year in maintenance and improvements will give a first class road network.  Instead the European taxpayer is depended on for most of our national road improvements despite the massive taxation on our motorists.  It is time to call a halt to toll proposals as the case for imposing an additional fine for using motorways for which motorists have paid many times does not stand up.</P>
      <P>Work on the continuation of the western ring road southwards is due to start next year and the Minister should make it clear that he will not approve a toll scheme for this new road.  He should give a clear message to the National Roads Authority rather than putting down this nonsense of an amendment which means nothing. Attacking Fianna Fáil for the sake of doing so is a serious neglect of his responsibilities.  The EU has given us funding for national roads in order to provide us with a more effective and efficient road network, not to provide the State with a taxing mechanism.  Tolling motorways means that the EU will give less financial support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister Howlin said in the past that he would consider tolling schemes where there was an alternative route.  I suggest that the southern ring <Col N="1621" /> route is being constructed to take traffic out of the city and away from residential suburban areas.  Placing a toll on this ring road will send thousands of motorists back into these congested routes.  Recently my party leader, Deputy Ahern, visited my constituency of Dublin South and we agreed that the most important issue was traffic. When the northern cross route is constructed additional traffic will enter the southern parts of Dublin city and county.  The residents of South Dublin have waited over 20 years for this vital relief road and are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Why does the National Roads Authority have the right to introduce toll schemes?  It is the Minister for the Environment's reserve function to approve such a scheme.  He should not approve the tolling of that route in the interests of the safety of local residents, the environment, an efficient and free flowing system and hard pressed motorists.  The presence of a highwayman will not be accepted on this vital relief road.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, for putting this motion before the House.  That it is a matter of concern to many is evidenced by the number who have contributed and I ask the Minister to give a clear message to the NRA.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghabhaíl leis an dTeachtaire Kitt as do chuid ama a roinnt.  I wish to remember the family, friends and relatives of the 17 million people who have been killed on our roads since the introduction of the motor car.  A ridiculous proposal has been mooted on the tolling of the Dublin C Ring and I support the motion in so far as it tackles this.  It would be a completely counter productive measure, tantamount to tolling a by-pass. The idea of a by-pass is to prevent traffic going through a town or city.  Tolling would simply drive traffic through residential areas and exacerbate present problems.  However, in opposing the toll road, the Government has a role to play.  It is engaging in rhetoric on what guidelines are there and on what is already in place but it has no proposals.  This is not sufficient and I hope the Government recognises that before it is too late.</P>
      <P>There is a need for traffic calming measures on the ancillary roads off the C ring and the Lee tunnel to ensure the residents on these roads who have suffered far too long will not suffer more from people who will drive on them regardless of the opening of new roads.  The Government needs to put in place, with the space that is available from reduced traffic measures, a proper cycle network and bus routes for commuters to ensure public transport is run efficiently.</P>
      <P>The northern cross route has been ready to open for a long time but it is not open.  Is that because the official opening of the road is to tie in with a Christmas party for county or city councillors as was mentioned at a meeting of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce?  There is need to open this road.  Will the Government indicate why it has not been opened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> It is time to look at other cities for solutions to our problems.  Singapore and Oslo have bitten the bullet on tolling and do not toll ring roads.  They provide park and ride facilities to encourage people not to take their cars through built up areas that were never designed for cars.  They also toll non essential vehicles going through those cities.  It is a matter of looking at the radial routes coming into the city, not at the ring roads, if money is to be clawed back on that type of venture.  This is a piecemeal exercise in looking at tolling.  Taxation should be reviewed and a tax on labour should be replaced with a comprehensive carbon tax so that we would be paying for damage rather than paying for labour which is in vast supply.  Finite resources should be taxed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, outlined in classic style yesterday the catalogue of legislation and regulation introduced by Fianna Fáil to establish the toll concept.  For example, the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979 was introduced by Sylvester Barrett when he was Minister for the Environment.  The operational programme on peripherality, 1990 <Col N="1623" /> was introduced by Fianna Fáil Ministers under Deputy Séamus Brennan when he was Minister for transport.  The national plan of October 1993 and the community support framework, 1994 were submitted and promoted by the Minister of Finance of the day, none other than the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Ahern.  The operational programme 1994-9 submitted by the then Ministers Cowen and Smith in 1994 envisaged a massive £100 million being raised by the imposition of tolls on various roads.  After that catalogue of legislation, statements and programmes introduced by Fianna Fáil when it was in Government, it is nothing short of breathtaking political hypocrisy for that party to now seek to do the complete opposite.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and various Ministers for the Environment in the past number of years have neglected roads.  That is why when this Government took office it had to introduce a ten year programme with substantially increased funds, particularly in regard to non-national roads, to give political priority to a matter that had been left lying in dormant political style by Fianna Fáil for many years.  Local authorities were starved of finance to carry out the essential job of improving our county road network. People living in rural areas and close to county roads are entitled to a decent standard of living. Those involved in agriculture and tourism are entitled to a good road network comparable to our national road network, which has been substantially improved over the years, principally sourced from European Union funds.  I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil is now saying that the National Roads Authority should not at any time introduce the concept of tolling by raising private sector finance</P>

      <P>Many improvements have been carried out to our national roads network during the past number of years, principally sourced from European Union funds, but a good deal still remains to be done.  I am sure that all Members <Col N="1624" /> will examine their constituencies closely in regard to work required to bring our national roads network up to a better standard.  I acknowledge that successive Ministers through the European Union implemented various programmes of expenditure which have brought our national roads network into line with the 21st century and closer to our expectations of what would be required by our national roads network.</P>
      <P>I draw to the Minister's attention the glaring omission from the last national plan of various proposals from the south east regional development authority, which deals mainly with roads traversing County Kilkenny.  At that time the various proposals made seem to have been ignored by the Department of Finance.  I hope that proposals regarding roads made at that time, principally in regard to roads from Kilkenny and Dublin to Waterford, will be closely examined in the context of the mid-term review.  It would be not be helpful to anybody for a Deputy from a constituency in that area or any part of the southeast to block a source of funds from the private sector, which is what is intended under this motion.  It reflects a change of mind and direction by Fianna Fáil on mobilising private sector finance for road development.  It would have made leaders of Fianna Fáil like Seán Lemass unhappy.  I do not believe that he or successive leaders would have engaged in this type of charade of political opportunism.  I am disappointed that Deputy Dempsey and his party considered it necessary to table this motion, in the context of gathering sources of finance for the development of our national roads network at a time when we have a unique opportunity with available finance and a degree of additionality from European Union as well as Exchequer sources to bring our national roads network up to a required standard to meet the transport challenges of the future.  This is even more essential around major urban centres, such as Dublin and Cork.  I reject the motion as an opportunity for political point-scoring.  The motion put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party is a political U-turn and it does not befit the dignity of this House.  I now hand over to my colleague, Deputy Broughan.</P>

      <P>I am utterly opposed to any tolling of the Lee tunnel or the C ring.  This is a hypocritical motion tabled by Fianna Fáil who are the toll masters supreme.  As my ministerial colleague, Deputy Howlin, outlined graphically last night, Fianna Fáil laid down the structures for the private tolling of public infrastructure over the past 25 years.  That party and some of the shadowy vested interests it represents over the past 20 years, through the 1979 Act introduced by the former Minister, Sylvester Barrett, laid the framework for this and now Fianna Fáil want this motion passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the 1980s the same spectre hung over us.  The House will remember that in 1989 the former Minister, Pádraig Flynn, invited a toll based investment in the C ring on an EU-wide basis.  I am not sure if other speakers pointed out that Fianna Fáil has already tolled the C ring at the Western Parkway.  That is the essence of the hypocrisy of the motion before us. They are now shedding crocodile tears about the proposal to toll further stretches of that motorway.  It is complete and utter nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, I have in my possession a letter from our famous Commissioner, Mr. Flynn &mdash; dated 10 January 1991, when he was Minister for <Col N="1626" /> the Environment &mdash; in which he demanded the then Dublin County Council to change its recent vote against the principle of tolling the C ring, specifically the Northern Cross.</P>

This document shows what arrant hypocrisy has been displayed last night and this morning.  The tollmasters supreme are those who want us to think they are against tolling.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only recently we saw the same general trends, originally encouraged by Fianna Fáil, in the Community Support Framework and the Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>I am against tolling of the C ring and the Cork tunnel for two fundamental reasons.  Deputy Dempsey alluded to the first one last night &mdash; the Northern Cross, which goes through my constituency, has already been paid for by taxpayers and motorists.  It is outrageous that someone should demand that we pay for it a second time.  My colleague from the Green Party may feel we should have higher energy taxes but our levels of VRT and motor taxation are already among the highest in the world.  We have paid extensively through our motor taxation for the development which is now, at long last, taking place.  We should not be forced to pay for it a second time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Dublin C ring was to divert heavy traffic &mdash; particularly port traffic, following the building of the tunnel &mdash; away from our city centre.  I have been a member of the Dublin Transportation Initiative for four years and chairperson of the Dublin Corporation general purposes committee for the same period.  We have laid down a series of traffic management measures for Dublin city, in which the 12 wards were divided on a cell-type basis to enable major traffic to be diverted out of those areas.  They have not been sufficiently successful, particularly in the inner city, and we are awaiting extra development and public transport.  However, were any proposal to toll the C ring to go ahead, it would inevitably wreck our traffic management strategy, which is struggling to succeed.  Any move to toll the C ring would be a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>Dublin needs more infrastructure in public transport and roads.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Howlin, for the tremendous work he has done.  In the past few years, his record on national primary roads is second to none in the history of the Department.  The targets he has set&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like that development to continue in such a way that the Dublin region will receive an adequate share of future resources.</P>
      <P>There may be a shortage of investment in some developments around the country.  Some schemes in which the private sector would be interested may not have received deep thought as yet.  For example, our local authority received a presentation on the east-west tunnel from a private consortium which was prepared to finance it and receive the stream of income from any traffic through it, had it been built.  Under the guidelines in the Act, if private interests wish to undertake schemes they feel will provide a reasonable stream of income in future years, such proposals should be taken to the NRA and the relevant local authority.  However, the schemes mentioned in this motion were dearly paid for from public money and will play a crucial role in the traffic management of our first and second cities.  I think I speak for all Dublin Deputies in stating my bitter opposition to any such development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion refers to the Northern Cross route and the Lee tunnel in Cork.  Is Fianna Fáil still in favour of tolling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> This is an important issue, not only for my constituents but for all of Dublin.  There is a consensus in my constituency &mdash; among businessmen, hauliers and local residents &mdash; in opposition to the tolling of the Northern Cross route.  Our concern is that tolling of the road will undermine the reason for building it.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that there is no proposal before him to toll this road and his confirmation that if and when such a proposal is made by the NRA, he will subject it to rigorous examination. I hope he will reject it.</P>
    <P>All experts recognise that tolling a link road will force people off it, and this would spell disaster for the surrounding communities.  &ldquo;Rat-running&rdquo; is already a problem in many Dublin estates, including towns in Fingal such as Swords, and undoubtedly the same is true in Cork.  We cannot afford to compound the problem.  Tolling will only serve to delay traffic on the link road and in so doing increase the attractiveness of &ldquo;rat-running&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Woods said last night, we will have to deal with the philosophy behind tolling at some stage.  The Minister is correct to point out that it is an option in further road funding and that improvements to our roads must continue.  It may also encourage more frequent use of public transport as against other road transport.  The Labour party has always encouraged further finance for public transport &mdash; we went to Brussels to lobby about the light rail system and obtained the finance required to enable it to go ahead.  However, judging by these criteria, tolling link roads is counter-productive.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also correct to point out Fianna Fáil's hypocrisy on this issue.  Week after week in Private Members' time, its Members queue up to reject positions they previously advocated when in Government.</P>

Notwithstanding the statements by the former Ministers, Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy Harney that they were prepared to work together on local government funding, they fudged the issue and ran when the opportunity arose.

      <P>This issue highlights the fact that Fianna Fáil is shooting itself in the foot.  Speaker after speaker highlighted the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil.  It is amazing that a party as large, famous and supposedly talented as Fianna Fáil should come in here with this incredibly silly motion. The acrobatics of Fianna Fáil never cease to amaze me.  For years it merrily accepted and promoted tolling.  It had no problem accepting private sector capital to finance road development or cementing the statutory foundations for road tolls.  Nobody knows better than Fianna Fáil that private sector finance comes with a price, and in this case the price is tolls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1978 Fianna Fáil introduced the Local Government (Toll Roads) Bill and in 1989 in a European Union operational programme submission it noted that four roads might be candidates for tolling.  They included the Dublin ring road and the river Lee downstream crossing. Now however Fianna Fáil, in the guise of Deputy Dempsey who projects the wide-eyed bushy-haired innocence of Opposition, weeps crocodile tears at the toll burden on motorists and voices indignant opposition to tolls on the remainder of <Col N="1630" /> the Dublin C Ring and Lee tunnel.

      <P>Deputy Dempsey made a particularly interesting point last night that motorists should not pay tolls because they already pay for roads through taxes.  That point has been consistently made by Democratic Left in terms of the unsatisfactory means of collecting taxes by way of water charges.  I would have been delighted if Fianna Fáil during its years in Government applied the same logic to water taxes as it now applies to tolls.  In Opposition it did not have a problem with that form of double taxation.</P>

While we are once again focusing largely on facilitating private motorists, it is particularly depressing that cities are grinding to a halt with endless traffic congestion caused by one-occupant cars.  This problem must be addressed.  Instead of this silly motion from Fianna Fáil I would have welcomed an attempt to address that more complex issue.</P>
      <P>The focus of the debate should be transferred from private motorists to alternatives in the area of public transport.  In Dublin the Luas proposal has for the first time triggered meaningful debate in this regard.  Whatever the outcome of that proposal many people in Dublin will still be without an efficient and environmentally friendly public transport system.  That is the real challenge facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies will probably remember the incredible waste of public funding some years ago when the county council of which Deputy Lawlor is a member had to send in contractors with pneumatic drills and JCBs to remove from <Col N="1631" /> the C Ring the foundations of toll booths that had been put in place by the Fianna Fáil Government at the time.  An outrageous decision was made by Fianna Fáil to subvert local democracy by insisting that the C Ring be tolled.  The foundations for the toll booth, which cost a fortune &mdash; unfortunately the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is not here to tell us exactly how much it cost the taxpayer &mdash; had to be physically removed because the county council decided that the road should not be tolled.  I do not know whether Deputy Dempsey is aware of that but he should have been made aware of it before he came in here with this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of it and will give the Deputy a history lesson if he waits for my contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Byrne's comments on tolling of the C Ring.  I was probably the person responsible for preventing the then Minister, Mr. Flynn, from railroading proposals that were still in the hands of local democracy.  The Western Parkway runs through the heart of my constituency.  The Northern and Southern Cross routes are key strategic links between the various satellite towns and the diversion of traffic which would result from the tolling of the Western Parkway is, therefore, a matter of serious concern to all those who benefit from the rerouting of heavy traffic from residential areas.</P>
      <P>I fail to see how tolls will work.  The proposal put forward by Manufacteurs Hanover, involving the French concept under which one pays as one joins a motorway, was accepted.  It is already in a shambles.  It was not long before road design engineers in the Department of the Environment and at local authority level, in a predictable move, were constructing traffic lights to relieve traffic congestion on the Western Parkway on which traffic was not flowing freely.  They then tried to widen the roundabouts by reducing the size of footpaths.  This served to highlight their incompetence.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that the West Link Bridge should be linked to a roundabout but the same road engineers did not listen &mdash; this is not an unfair criticism &mdash; and constructed it near the old Navan Road.  A large roundabout was provided nearby.  In a predictable move, this had to be pulled down within two years.  There is now severe traffic congestion and long tail backs, and it is likely that traffic lights will have to be constructed at the Blanchardstown conjunction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To provide a bus lane on the Dublin-Galway dual carriageway traffic lights and islands had to be set back.  Why was this not foreseen?  It <Col N="1632" /> appears that traffic jams are being created as a direct result of investment in the road network in the Dublin region.  Deputy Molloy said that the trip to the west used to take three-and-a-half hours, last Friday it took seven hours.  There are traffic jams at the Strawberry Beds because motorists will not use the Dublin-Galway dual carriageway due to the long tail backs.  Given that the present system is already inadequate the proposal to introduce tolls is grossly unacceptable as it would result in the diversion of traffic from the motorway to residential areas.</P>
    <P>The motion is both realistic and practical.  I urge Dublin Corporation, of which Deputies Byrne and Broughan are members, to proceed with the building of the tunnel and to complete the works on Patrick Street, in the Coombe and all of the other problem areas throughout the city.  The Deputies should not make political speeches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be clear on what we are debating.  Public road tolls are a new form of taxation and that is the issue confronting us.  It is one of the most idiotic forms of taxation thought up for some time.  Those who advocate their introduction are, in effect, advocating higher Government expenditure and higher taxation.</P>
      <P>The East and West Link Bridges are tolled. When a member of Dublin Corporation I strongly supported the proposal to construct the East Link Bridge in 1978-79 and tried to convince people of the benefits to the city.  Both projects were privately funded, unlike road projects which are funded from national and European sources. I was proud to be the key negotiator in the last two rounds of Structural Funds negotiations on behalf of the Governments led by Charles Haughey in 1989 and Deputy Albert Reynolds in 1993.  There was a clear need for new roads to try, as Deputy Lawlor said, to relieve severe traffic congestion in our cities.</P>
      <P>Motorists are paying far more in taxes than is being spent on roads.  I am sure the Minister has the figures for this year but last year the Government collected £289 million in motor vehicle duties and £725 million in hydrocarbon duties, not all of which relates to motor fuel. According to the Book of Estimates, State spending in 1996 on roads will be approximately £318 million.  By any calculation, motorists are paying way in excess of what is being spent by the State on road maintenance and improvements. There is, therefore, no case, either in logic or equity, for a special tax on road use.  As we all know, some of the revenues earmarked for roads would be used to substitute existing expenditure so there would be no guarantee of additionality. Even if there was such a guarantee, I very much doubt that the economic case for an accelerated road building programme would outweigh the effect of levying a new tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two centuries ago there were formal and informal tolls throughout Ireland and the rest of Europe.  There were the official tolls and the <Col N="1633" /> highwaymen whom Barry Lydon encountered on his journey to Dublin.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, in this instance is planning a highway robbery.  If he was confident that he could get away with it, he would, probably, be tolling many of the new roads throughout the country but the crime would be committed at arm's length by the National Roads Authority.  The Minister could pretend that it was not he who made the decision and that he has no influence on the Authority.</P>
    <P>Tolls were one of the hindrances to the free movement of goods which is the reason they were got rid of.  Reintroducing tolls on public roads would be a retrograde step, damaging and senseless.  It would result in the slowing down of traffic and be an impediment to the free flow of goods and services.  That is the last thing we need. One has only to travel to this House at any time of the day to see the difficulties being encountered despite some excellent road construction work by the Department of the Environment and road planners in general.</P>
    <P>There are sound environmental reasons why bypasses around cities should not be tolled.  The purpose of a motorway bypass is to divert through traffic from the city.  Imposing tolls would simply limit the benefits.</P>
    <P>I represent the inner city.  During the years I have become aware of what truck and lorry drivers will do to dodge tolls on the East Link, they will travel the entire length of the quays and the North Circular Road to avoid paying them.  If one talks to transport managers, one will learn that people will do anything to earn an extra £20-£30 per week, even if it means longer journeys and a greater number of hours on the road.</P>
    <P>We are now going to open up the M50, an excellent road structure for which I was honoured as Minister for Finance to sign the contract, to areas in the constituencies of my colleagues, Deputies Burke, Lawlor and Dempsey.  People living in Santry, Whitehall, Finglas, Blanchardstown, Lucan, Walkinstown and Clondalkin will be affected by this and will continue to use the Navan Road, thereby defeating the object of the exercise.  That does not make any sense.</P>
    <P>There are sound environmental reasons why bypasses around cities should not be tolled.  The whole purpose is to push this traffic away.  The Lee tunnel is close to Cork city centre and if a toll is put in place traffic will simply go around it.  A toll would also lead to traffic tailbacks at certain times. The Lee tunnel would be of major benefit in opening up west Cork and providing rapid access to the port of Ringaskiddy and to Cobh on the other side of the estuary.  The use of the Lee tunnel should be encouraged, not impeded.</P>
    <P>There are many toll roads in France but some of them are lightly used, which defeats the purpose for which they were built.  I have met the mayors of many small towns and villages in <Col N="1634" /> France who have told me about the difficulties created by tolls.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil examined this issue carefully in the late 1980s on the basis of encouraging private investment in road building.  We were unable to work out any satisfactory arrangement in relation to the ring road for which we now have European money &mdash; I was involved in those negotiations. We are resolutely opposed to any new form of taxation.  The Labour Party was responsible for the introduction of residential property tax and, given half a chance, it would introduce road tolls and many other new taxes.</P>
    <P>The task of the next Government will be to reduce the tax burden.  In the past two years revenue and expenditure have risen by three times the rate of inflation.  Already we see problems building up for the future in regard to how we can fund that level of expenditure when interest rates increase, as they do on a cyclical basis, and as economic growth slows down.</P>
    <P>A vote for this motion is an opportunity to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a combination of tax and spend policies that Fine Gael denounced so strongly in Opposition but is now advocating.  The Taoiseach does not care about the level of expenditure as long as he can get money from corporation tax, private individuals or road users.  He will not mind if expenditure increases by 11 per cent if the revenues increase by 11.5 per cent.  He believes that is in order.  That strategy is so different from the one he advocated on this side of the House when we were trying to bring order to the national finances.  He opposed all our efforts to have centralised agreements.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to make it unequivocally clear to the electorate in this debate whether it will approve the levying of tolls by the National Roads Authority.  It is a matter for the Government; the National Roads Authority does not appear to have any say in this matter.  The Minister can move items up and down the agenda to suit himself.  We on this side of the House have intelligence and it is ridiculous for the Minister to say this is a matter for the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>This issue is being driven by people who simply believe in taxation.  I am shocked by my Labour colleagues in the House who may vote for this proposal.  I cannot understand how they can force people living in the vicinity of the Navan Road, Drumcondra Road, Swords and various other areas to endure continuous traffic congestion.  As one of my colleagues said yesterday, drug abuse is the biggest problem in this city but traffic congestion is the next major issue.  Traffic congestion is economically damaging to the country and to business.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Dublin Port is doing so well and that the developments we put in place in Government are working, but it is regrettable that the plan to guide traffic around the port and along the M50 will not be proceeded with.  Traffic will continue to go through the rat runs and the various proposals put forward to ease traffic <Col N="1635" /> congestion, including traffic calming measures and bus lanes, will be for nought if this measure goes ahead.</P>
    <P>I hope that between now and 1.30 p.m. the Minister of State will do an about-turn on this issue.  She need not worry about doing that because her colleagues are doing about-turns on every issue.</P>

      <P>My amendment states: To delete all words after &ldquo;the £1.5 billion contribution made by motorists to the Exchequer,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;recognises the lack of progress in improving our national roads and accepts the need for a major programme of private-sector involvement in the provision of public infrastructure, as recommended in the Forfás Report `Shaping our Future'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion which gives us an opportunity to debate the tolls issue and to report the progress or otherwise of the National Roads Authority.  For several weeks I have asked that the annual report of the NRA be debated in this House.  In 1994 the Government published a national roads programme to take this country up to the end of the century.  That programme was couched in fancy language.  There was talk of economic corridors, inter-urban networks and integrated network improvement.  In practice, however, that has not turned out to be a strategic plan for upgrading our roads system but rather a collection of by-pass projects for individual towns.</P>
      <P>One is tempted to ask if we have a roads policy or just a roundabouts policy because the collection of roundabouts on our roads would puzzle the ordinary motorist.  It is now apparent that even the relatively modest targets set in 1994 will not be met and that many of the projects outlined in that programme will not be built before the end of the century.  Unfortunately, some of them will never be built.</P>
      <P>Work was due to start on the Kildare by-pass in 1995 but not a sod has yet been turned.  We are told the project will go to tender early next year. Work was due to start on the Nenagh by-pass in 1995 but, yet again, not a sod has been turned. All we have are tentative indications that this project may get under way some time in the next few years.  Work was due to start on the Loughrea by-pass in 1995 but a construction date has not yet been settled for the completion of that project.  The list is long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> Kinnegad is one of the major bottlenecks in our primary roads system.  It causes major problems for motorists travelling through Dublin and on to the west.  This bank holiday weekend saw three mile tailbacks around that town and yesterday in the House Deputy Molloy said it took seven hours to make the journey from Galway to Dublin last weekend.</P>
    <P>Completion of this project ought to be a major national priority yet it is only at the preliminary design stage and there is little or no possibility of its getting under way before the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Drogheda, County Louth, is another major bottleneck on the country's busiest primary route, the Dublin-Belfast N1 route.  This ought to be a priority project but no progress has been made and construction is unlikely to commence before the end of the century.</P>
    <P>In my Cork constituency the Blackpool by-pass, long since promised and planned to become a key link in the city's infrastructure, has not yet commenced.  The proposed 1.25 mile road was planned to connect the new Mallow dual-carriageway with the centre of Cork and the rest of the national primary route network.  At present the situation is ludicrous.  A four lane super highway finishes at the borough boundary and then feeds into a tangle of small city streets in Blackpool.  This has caused huge environmental problems.  It makes no commercial sense that this situation should have been allowed to developed.  The city of Cork will not fulfil its true economic potential until this road is built nor will any job-generating investment be put into the northside of Cork city, an area starved of jobs, until the Blackpool by-pass is in place.  The IDA industrial estate at Kilbarry continues to suffer from poor road access and it is grossly under developed in terms of the provision of job-generating outlets.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the Blackpool by-pass is £15 million.  The EU will foot 75 per cent of that bill, leaving this country to find about £900,000 per year for four years to complete the project. To put this figure in context, it is roughly half the annual cost of running the office of the Tánaiste. The project was scheduled for completion by the year 2000.  At the present rate of progress, it is very unlikely the project will have even commenced by then.</P>
    <P>We are missing a once in a lifetime opportunity to bring our roads up to European standards.  The EU is giving us billions of pounds to do the job. It is putting up 75 per cent of the funding for individual projects.  We have been warned many times that other mid-European countries less developed than Ireland will qualify for the next tranche of funding and will have a stronger claim on the level of funding which Ireland received in the past.  Ireland is not likely to get that level of funding in the future.  I will return to the need the Progressive Democrats see for private investment in road construction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> With regard to the main subject of this motion, the tolling of roads, the experience of East Link and West Link has shown that people are willing to pay tolls where private funds have been used to put new roads in place.  What people are not willing to do is pay tolls on roads which have already been built with their money because that smacks of double or even treble taxation in a country where even modest incomes are heavily hit by the taxman and car buyers face some of the highest tax rates in Europe.  The motorist contributes about £1.6 billion annually to the Exchequer.  Of that, only about 25 per cent is ploughed back into the improvement of roads.  By any standards motorists are bled to the bone by the taxman and until there is sizeable tax reform and tax reduction we should not consider imposing any further tax on motorists.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice in any other developed country to put tolls on ring roads around major cities because it is counterproductive.  The purpose for which the ring roads were constructed in the first place stands to be defeated because the traffic for which they were planned doubles back if tolls are charged. Attempts are made to rat run through busy city streets and small urban estates.  That defeats the purpose of expenditure on ring-roads in the first instance.</P>
    <P>If there is an attempt to impose tolls on the Lee tunnel, people living in Tivoli and Glanmire who could use that tunnel twice a day to get to and from work will not use it.  Instead they will use busy city streets and cause enormous congestion and grave environmental damage.</P>
    <P>These two points must be taken on board by the Government and I look forward to the Minister's response to these two specific issues. We must use our judgment on these matters. People will not pay tolls on roads which have been constructed with revenue from their taxation.  Privately funded roads need not necessarily require direct toll charging either.</P>
    <P>The approach to date to the road building programme shows slow progress and greatly increases the length of time it takes to complete projects.  It will take longer to build the Portlaoise by-pass, for instance, than it took to build the Channel Tunnel.  Part of the reason is the level and extent of bureaucracy.  There are at least four layers, each of which is involved in major road building projects: the Department of the Environment; the newly appointed semi-State body, the National Roads Authority, the local authorities and the contractors who carry out the work.  The bureaucracy in any given project is multiplied by four before work can commence and be completed.  This is part of the reason the roads programme has been so slow.  In Northern Ireland, for example, the Department of the Environment oversees the building of all major roads.  Only one agency is involved in getting road building projects under way and completed.  Of course, Northern Ireland's road building programme is carried out more speedily and <Col N="1638" /> successfully than ours.  We would do well to emulate that example.</P>
    <P>We would also do well to seek private investment in road building projects without further delay.  The way of the future is to seek out a partnership between the State and private investors to carry out the road building projects which are needed urgently if this country is to compete successfully with European rivals.  This Government has failed to examine, explore and exploit that area for ideologically reasons.  If and when we succeed in doing so, the public will have a different attitude to tolling roads because the public is nothing if not fair-minded and it will understand that roads built with private capital will make a contribution, whether direct or otherwise.  As matters stand, the public does not intend to pay for tolls on roads which have been built with money from its pocket.</P>
    <P>I appeal to this Government to examine the Forfás report Shaping our Future.  That report sets out, clearly and cogently, the direction we ought to take and I ask the Government to consider it as a matter of urgency.  At a number of meetings of the Whips I asked that the annual report of the National Roads Authority be fully debated in this House because there is an unsatisfactory rate of progress under its road building programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will briefly comment on the motion before the House from my perspective as a Dublin based Deputy.  Part of the C ring road is in my constituency and I am concerned about its effects on my area.  The ring road will form an important part of the infrastructure of the road network in west Dublin and will also ensure that unsuitable traffic is removed from suburban roads.  I am totally opposed to the tolling of the ring road because it would result in shifting traffic to suburban roads.</P>
      <P>However, tolling cannot be totally dismissed. Its use was suggested by the Dublin Transport Organisation as a means of ensuring that traffic is directed to the correct road networks.  The DTO's contributions to the review of Dublin's traffic problems stressed that we may be obliged to consider blocking roads to certain types of traffic at particular times of the day to ensure that the appropriate roads are used.  I know of no other method which could be used, but we must consider all methods of road management relevant to traffic control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, motorists are using unsuitable distributary, suburban and small commuter roads. If some penalty is not introduced for the inappropriate use of roads, there will be no instrument available to force traffic to use the correct roads.  Tolling is an unfortunate instrument to use in certain ways because it raises finance.  Whereas the objective may be to move traffic on to more appropriate roads, tolling may be inappropriately used by authorities that wish to raise finance.  Tolling of roads is an issue for the Dublin Transport Organisation, the National <Col N="1639" /> Roads Authority and the Minister to decide upon.  However, the tolling of the C ring road would be inappropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose tolling and have no problem in stating that.  However, it is apparent that Fianna Fáil, given the past contributions of its Members, is not opposed to tolling roads. Fianna Fáil introduced tolling and supports the principle because the National Roads Authority Act was passed when that party was in Government.  That legislation makes provision for the National Roads Authority to examine the possibility of introducing tolling.  I merely suggest it would be inappropriate to introduce a toll on the C ring road in Dublin because it was built for a particular reason.</P>
      <P>Controlling traffic is an essential part of traffic management.  My contribution will ensure the Minister is aware of my position.  The appropriate mechanisms put in place by the legislation will be used to ensure that tolls are not introduced on the ring road.  I do not trust the motion because Fianna Fáil will probably change its view on another occasion and bring forward a motion in support of the tolling of roads.  Therefore, I support the strategy put in place by the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <P>This issue is of major concern in my constituency in view of the December opening of the Northern Cross Route.  I support the motion and congratulate Deputy Dempsey for establishing a firm Fianna Fáil policy against the tolling of the ring road.  Deputy Eric Byrne earlier stated this is a silly issue.  Since his scripts are supplied by the Democratic Left press office, the Deputy is obviously speaking on behalf of his party Leader, Deputy De Rossa.  I will be glad to inform my constituents that Democratic Left regards this as a stupid, silly and irrelevant issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> I was amused to hear Deputy Seán Ryan claim credit for the Northern Cross Route on behalf of the Labour Party.  Thank God this matter was decided upon and approved when Fianna Fáil was in power because action would not be taken if we had to wait for the Labour Party to make a decision.  I am a member of the city council and have witnessed the actions and behaviour of Labour councillors in connection with the Dublin Port Tunnel.  The only suggestion they continually make is that action should be deferred.  They are obviously scared to make a decision.  This is typical behaviour among Labour Party Members who have decided they have one year remaining in Government and should keep their heads down, avoid making foolish decisions, and hope the people vote them back into office.</P>
    <P>There is a similar situation with regard to tolling.  Why will the Minister not inform the NRA of the action he desires it to take?  He has delayed in the hope that, when the decision must be made, he will not be in office.  What sort of leadership is that?  I do not necessarily oppose all tolls, particularly in the case of private sector involvement or the proposed port tunnel.  These involve completely different roadways to that envisaged for the ring road.  When motorists enter the proposed port tunnel they will use it for three to four miles.  However, people will not drive on to the ring road at Cloughran and travel around the city.  They will enter the road at Cloughran, Ballymun, Finglas, the Navan Road, etc., and travel for one to two miles.  Tolling cannot be introduced in that instance because it will merely drive the traffic back into residential areas.  It would also betray the relationship we have tried to build up with residential groups in connection with the proposed tunnel.  We inform people about what will happen and ask them to believe us.  If we change our minds and introduce tolling where it was not originally suggested, it will damage our relationship with the people and destroy our hopes for instigating other major infrastructural developments.</P>

      <P>It is evident, from their contributions, that Government backbenchers use the same script writer.  The common thread of their arguments is that Fianna Fáil was in Government for many years and is responsible for everything that was or was not done. However, it must be remembered that the Labour Party has been in Government for 13 of the past 26 years.  It is difficult to understand how its members can make pronouncements about the actions taken during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of cars and other vehicles on our roads is part and parcel of today's lifestyle.  Provision of an efficient system to allow for the smooth flow of traffic is essential.  During the past ten years there has been massive expenditure in my constituency, Cork East, and the adjoining constituency, Cork North Central.  There is an excellent road system running from Fermoy and Midleton into Cork city but problems arise at the <Col N="1641" /> Dunkettle roundabout, where the two roads meet.  From that point, there are massive problems for traffic entering and leaving the city. The Lee tunnel is proposed as the solution to alleviate such problems but I fear that if a toll is imposed motorists will ignore the tunnel and continue to clog the city with traffic.  The purpose of the tunnel is to open up the south side of the city but this will be defeated if a toll is imposed.</P>
    <P>This toll system is a new form of taxation and it gives the lie to the Government's assertion that it is interested in real tax reform and tax equity. Their tax reform policy is a three card trick &mdash;&ldquo;now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;&mdash; but people will recognise that and will give the Government its answer in the next couple of months.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank those who contributed to the debate, particularly the Labour Party Deputies who, I expect, will live up to what they said in the House and vote for the motion. We heard six Labour Party speakers, including the Minister, who was not as clear as some of his backbenchers about the fact that he opposes tolls. Nevertheless, he gave the impression that everything would work out well at the end of the day.  The six Labour Deputies spoke against the concept of tolls, and they will have an opportunity to show how sincere they are when it is time to vote, considering they were levelling charges of hypocrisy across the floor of the House last night and today.</P>
      <P>The amendment tabled by the Progressive Democrats relates to a major policy issue worthy of a separate debate.  It refers not just to roads but to all public infrastructure.  Perhaps they would consider withdrawing that amendment for debate at a later time.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to matters raised by Deputies over the past three hours.  Deputy Hogan, notably the only Fine Gael Deputy to speak on this motion, attempted to distort it and to mislead the public as to its intent.  He had much to say about county roads.  As he was the only Fine Gael Deputy to speak, and spoke in favour of tolls, I have to take it that he has spoken on behalf of the Fine Gael Party in favour of the idea of tolling these roads.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Ahern says, he is chairman of the Fine Gael Party, so my assumption is a safe one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was amusing to hear Labour Party Deputies accuse Fianna Fáil of being hypocritical and of shedding crocodile tears.  Deputy Broughan referred to the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979 which was passed when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  Labour have been in power for the past 13 years and have not rescinded or repealed that legislation.  It is a bit rich for them to delve into history for evidence that Fianna Fáil <Col N="1642" /> is in favour of tolling the Dublin C Ring Road or the Lee tunnel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Ryan referred to U-turns by Fianna Fáil.  If there is anyone in this House who should not talk about U-turns, it is Deputy Ryan who swore on his life's blood that he would never vote for service charges in Fingal County Council, yet when he was chairman of Fingal County Council he proposed the estimates and the service charges.  Perhaps the fact that he wanted to hold on to the Chair of that local authority had something to do with it.  If that is the depth of his commitment and his principle, we can take what he says on this matter with a grain of salt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eric Byrne seems to think this debate is silly.  He went back into the history of Fianna Fáil, something he always does when he makes a speech here.  He is the last man in the world who should do that.  If I were to mention his party's support of Ceausescu and the eastern communist dictators down through the years he would claim it was grossly unfair to go so far back into history. Nevertheless, that is where his roots are.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his very generous tribute to his Fianna Fáil predecessors.  He spent 25 to 30 per cent of his time outlining the enormous contribution made by Fianna Fáil Ministers to the road network and roads policy over the years.  It was a very generous tribute, even if it was not intended, and was very much appreciated by me and the Fianna Fáil Party.  I regret, though, that he was a little shy in acknowledging that all the money he is currently spending on the national road network results from the efforts of a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Ministers when they secured the money for the road network and other infrastructure at Edinburgh many years ago.  I also regret that the Minister attempted to distort the motion and mislead people as to its intent. Fianna Fáil's motion is consistent with the guidelines set down by previous Fianna Fáil Ministers and with their stance on tolls and investments in roads.  One of the criteria mentioned in the list of conditions to be met is that there must be private funding before any road will be tolled.  There is no private funding for the roads mentioned in this motion, and for that reason we tabled it.  The motion is specific. It relates to the remaining sections of the M50 and the Lee tunnel.  It is not a political gimmick, as the Minister implied.  The Minister attempted to denigrate this party for highlighting the serious concerns being expressed by many people and to distort the genuine concerns we are articulating as an Opposition party on behalf of thousands of people around this city, to whom the Labour Deputies paid lip service during this debate.  The Minister attempted to portray our motion as a political gimmick and described Fianna Fáil as a party going down a cul-de-sac, simply because we represent the views of many thousands of people in the areas that will be affected by tolling.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years the Minister and his party have made a virtue of taking the high moral <Col N="1643" /> ground, lecturing the lesser mortals in other parties, especially people in Fianna Fáil.  Most of the lecturing has been to indicate how virtuous the Labour Party Members are and how committed they are to openness, transparency and accountability.  The Minister's contribution showed that the virtues the Labour Party preach so consistently are those the Labour Party believes should apply to everybody but themselves.  They believe they are so virtuous that they do not need to apply these rules to themselves.  I say that because last night the Minister accused Fianna Fáil of attempting to fool the plain people of Cork and Dublin, and motorists generally but that charge was simply a smokescreen to hide his own attempts to fool everybody including, it appears, his own backbenchers.  He took a nod and wink approach to the motion by saying he would consider every aspect of any proposal brought to him, but that we knew how he felt about the matter and it would be all right on the night.</P>
    <P>Who does the Minister think he is fooling?  He is not fooling anybody on this side of the House. During his speech, which was all bluff and bluster, he threw in a few red herrings to avoid <Col N="1644" /> responsibility &mdash; he could not speak specifically on the routes to which the motion refers because of his quasi-judicial role, but he was seriously concerned and would consider everything carefully.  The Minister knows the consequences of tolling these roads.  He is aware of the huge diversion and the environmental damage that will occur.  He is aware also of the dangers that will arise in the residential areas and the terrors that will be caused to residents who will fear for the safety of their children.  The Minister knows also that no European country allows ring roads to be tolled around their cities and of the taxation levels being paid by motorists already.  While the Minister is aware of all this it appears he is prepared to allow the National Roads Authority to continue to waste public money in putting a proposal to him that should be rejected by him and by this House.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unable to listen to the Minister of State's contribution but I have read his speech and studied the Bill.  Fianna Fáil supports the Bill although we have a number of concerns about it.</P>
      <P>This Bill follows the break between the Irish and London stock exchanges.  A separate Irish takeover panel is being established in law.  There is no similar legislation in Britain and its takeover panel does not have a statutory basis.  Although I do not disagree with our panel being given a statutory basis, I would like to know why this is being done.  In general it is more beneficial to underpin such bodies with legislation.  The statutory basis being accorded may be related to the Constitution and the difficulty in delegating judicial powers.  In his reply, perhaps the Minister of State would indicate if this is the Attorney General's advice.</P>
      <P>If the argument for legislation is that a judicial review of the takeover panel's decisions might have resulted otherwise, judicial reviews may still take place.  Section 13 makes specific provision for persons to challenge rulings of the takeover panel by way of judicial review.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the issue of the need for legislation, I have two other concerns.  The first is that the Bill is being brought forward at a time when the EU is finalising a directive on this subject.  Second, the legislation has been introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment even though the legislation on the Stock Exchange was introduced by the Minister for Finance.  I do not know the reason for this.  The Department of Finance is very good at talking about Bills but when the work has to be done it hives them off to other Departments.  It does not seem to want the burden of implementing, explaining and monitoring the legislation or of mopping up when things go wrong.  This Bill was announced by the Department of Finance to great fanfare but it has been introduced by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>I understand a directive on take-overs is being drafted in Brussels.  This directive will set out the Union-wide rules governing take-overs and standardise practices.  Once the directive is finalised there is a strong likelihood another Bill will be required to implement its provisions in the next year or two.  I have argued on many occasions that Ministers need to assess whether a Bill is being introduced at the appropriate time. Before we agree EU directives there should be discussions with the relevant interest groups. There is often no consultation in advance and the first we hear about many regulations is when they become law.  There is an urgent need to establish a monitoring group on EU directives under the auspices of the national agreement currently being debated.  We need greater spotlight on new proposals during the embryonic stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment I frequently visited Brussels to discuss labour law. During the intervening period between the first meeting in, say, November and the second meeting in January or February, COREPER and the very competent officials continued their work. <Col N="1647" /> However, the files on the positions arrived at do not have a political slant as the relevant Minister is not kept up to date on developments.  When I asked the reasons behind certain decisions the very fine official dealing with the directive took it upon himself to brief me between meetings on the progress being made.  While I found this very useful.  I was frustrated by the lack of direct political input into the directive.  On one occasion when I refused to accept the beautifully prepared words set out in the dossier I got into hot water with the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, but I got my way in the end.</P>
    <P>I was involved in the discussions on the directive dealing with working hours which will soon be implemented by way of legislation.  In November 1993 we provided for the option of a voluntary opt out.  This option has disappeared and I do not know why.  I have been contacted by many workers who do not want to lose out on much needed overtime.</P>
    <P>Directives are conceived behind closed doors in Brussels and most people only hear about them after they have been signed.  There is no proper consultation in advance on the measures being adopted by Ministers.  The attitude is that because Europe has said so it must be right.  This procedure needs to be changed so that there is full appraisal of the proposals in advance.  There is no consultation in this Chamber.  Matters can be raised at a committee but this has no effect. During my three years as Minister I was not requested to appear before the Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which was supposed to check proposals from Brussels.  Large employers, unions, small businesses, consumers and other interested parties should come together under the auspices of the national agreement and form a monitoring committee on EU directives.</P>
    <P>Given that there will be a directive on take-overs, should this Bill have been introduced now? Would it not have been possible to proceed with the interim take-over panel which includes such eminent people as John Cooke, Senior Counsel, who is chairman, Leo Conway, chief executive, Danny Kitchen, Leonard Abrahamson, Caitríona Murphy, Brian O'Connor and Ann Fitzgerald? Will the Minister ensure this directive will not require further legislation, that it is in keeping with what operates efficiently here and that it does not give rise to more bureaucracy?  Perhaps he should argue there is no real need for another directive as we have our own legislation.  I am concerned the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is steering this legislation through the House, given that it was the Minister for Finance who introduced the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.  This reminds me of the scenario involving the investment intermediaries legislation introduced by the Minister for Finance but implemented by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I am worried that the same scenario may arise in regard to this Bill.  It does <Col N="1648" /> not make sense for the Minister for Finance to be responsible for the separation of the exchanges while the take-over legislation comes under the ambit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  These demarcations of power are a throw back to a much less complicated time. Making different Departments responsible for various elements of the same function leads to difficulties, as we saw in the Taylor affair.</P>
    <P>There is a relationship between the Stock Exchange legislation and this Bill and it would be preferable if the same Minister was responsible for both of them.  One would have expected some of the many Government advisers to examine these anomalies and seek to update the responsibilities of various Departments.  This second guessing and buck passing between the parties in Government is particularly relevant in other areas.  Approximately ten days ago panic erupted over the Channel Tunnel and officials in the Department of the Marine said it had nothing to do with the matter even though correspondence relating to it was on a desk in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Ceann Comhairle's business, not the Minister of State's.  This type of buck passing is presented as being extraordinarily complicated.  I am referring to Departments refusing to accept responsibility for certain matters.  What happened in regard to the Channel Tunnel will also happen with the Takeover Panel Bill.  There will be no communication between the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment on Stock Exchange developments.</P>
      <P>As well as raising concerns about the Bill coming in advance of an EU directive, I want the Minister to clarify whether the legislation on company law and the Stock Exchange will be consolidated.  This Bill follows two major statutory instruments on company law which were introduced this year, including a detailed one on dematerialising securities.  It also follows the Competition (Amendment) Act.  I was delighted to note that many of the concerns I expressed, including several sentences I used, when that Bill was going through Committee Stage were reported in an article in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> Because of the mess made of the Competition (Amendment) Act, it will have to be followed by another competition Bill when the mergers review group reports.  I said at the time it was daft to introduce a Bill to set up a review group when it would have to be followed by another Bill.  There is an urgent necessity to consolidate all such company and Stock Exchange law.  When a small country such as Luxembourg can do so on an annual basis, surely with the aid of technology it should be possible here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> An article in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 5 January 1995 referred to &ldquo;The Take-over Tangle&rdquo; and stated:</P>
    <P>When the Irish Stock Exchange splits from its London parent, probably about mid year, the London Takeover Panel will cease to arbitrate on Irish takeovers.  But legislation setting up an Irish Takeover Panel is running behind schedule.</P>
    <P>I will not carp about running behind schedule because we too easily accept EU directives.  Will the Minister give his views on the political vetting of EU directives before they are implemented?</P>
    <P>Do the intervention powers apply to this Bill? May I politely ask the Minister?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate. Having regard to the scope such a measure offers for debate, it is surprising that we did not have greater participation.  Perhaps this is seen as a purely technical measure, but it is a complex one. The work of my officials required assiduous attention to detail.  I thought it would have provided an opportunity for a wider discussion on the role of the Irish Stock Exchange and its capacity to be a source of investment funds for industry and business as well as on the more ideological questions raised by Deputy McDowell.</P>
      <P>My task is to reply to the questions raised.  The measure received a general welcome from all sides.  Deputy O'Keeffe raised a central question, to which Deputy McDowell lent his voice, about the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; in section 1.  It is a central concept to the purpose of the legislation. I must confess that intuitively I am persuaded by the arguments advanced by the Deputies in this regard.  It would be a serious matter if a Minister were to arbitrarily change that control figure and it is probably correct that the House should have an opportunity to express its view on it.  I have not had an opportunity to take expert advice on the matter, but I will do so.</P>
      <P>I do not know if it would be necessary, as suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe, to reserve two of the seven places for professionals practising outside the State.  Deputy O'Rourke asked if it were necessary to establish the panel on a statutory footing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken care to ensure that we are appraised of the likely contents, trend and direction of the directive.  In so far as possible, provision is made to anticipate it.  In my introductory speech I pointed out that the working party, after consideration, came to the <Col N="1650" /> conclusion that it was necessary to establish the panel on a statutory basis.  Essentially, the purpose of this is to avoid uncertainty in takeover and merger activity following the separation of the two exchanges.  At heart, it is a question of confidence and credibility.  The point was well made that one cannot easily compare the amount of activity on the Irish Stock Exchange with the Stock Exchange in London.  We must do everything reasonable to ensure that confidence and credibility is not damaged.</P>
      <P>Deputies O'Keeffe and McDowell raised a number of questions about cost and charges. Their fears in this regard are unfounded.  It is unlikely that the takeover panel will be called into action once a week.  Deputies referred to the extent of such activity in the past but it is not likely to vary in the future.  Deputy McDowell explicitly addressed whether charges will be levied on companies listed on the stock exchange or on companies concerned with a specific transaction.  That is being considered in detail but there will be a charge on the companies that are publicly quoted and on the transaction which is the subject of the takeover panel's attention.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to section 16(1) which gives the panel, subject to the consent of the Minister, the right to impose charges on specified parties with a view to defraying its expenses.  The first group on which the levies can be charged are relevant companies listed on the stock exchange. While no details have been completed yet, it may be possible to impose this charge via the stock exchange.  The second group expected to make a contribution are companies other than those listed which make takeover offers.  Given that some companies which make takeover bids will be located outside this jurisdiction it is considered appropriate that these companies should contribute to the operation of the takeover panel. The third group of charges will be levied on the securities dealings of a relevant company.  This can be imposed as a small charge on the dealings which take place on the stock exchange.  The panel will be able to impose charges on documentation forwarded to it for perusal and opinions and where guidance is sought on proposals.</P>
      <P>This is based on the principle that the industry should be required to fund its minimal costs and it should not be a charge on the taxpayer.  Nobody argued that it should be and it is not likely to become a matter of serious contention.  The panel will consider the question of charges in more detail.</P>

      <P>The principle is fair and is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised questions about the appointment of the chairman by the Governor of the Central Bank.  He queried whether that was right and whether it could be influenced by the Minister of the day.  It will not break any moulds <Col N="1651" /> in Ireland if the Minister of the day exerts influence in the appointment of a chairman to such a body, but that is not envisaged here.  A limited company structure has been deliberately chosen rather than that of a semi-State organisation.  The Governor of the Central Bank is the appropriate person to make the appointment and nobody will bring his probity into question.  The Governor at the time will have everyone's confidence in making this decision and I have no reservations on that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned that the business of litigation may be such that in certain circumstances it could invite the transgressor to tempt fate and it would be worth his while attempting to get away with the transaction because of the amount of time required to initiate prosecution in the preparation of files, referral to the DPP and the issuance of summons.  He suggested that it would be better if the panel had the option to go the High Court on foot of a motion.  It is a technical point and relates to section 11(5).  In most takeover situations time is of the essence.  The concerns he raised will be considered but may not prove as big an obstacle as feared.  The panel could, in the absence of co-operation, still press ahead with a ruling and the panel or the party, subject to the ruling, could then apply to the court as provided for in sections 12 and 13.  I appreciate that the Deputy will reserve the right to come back to this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke raised the question of the draft EU Directive No. 13 on takeovers.  In 1988 the Commission published a proposal for a draft takeover directive.  Following consultation it was clear the original proposal was not likely to prove acceptable to member states.  Earlier this year a revised proposal, which was more a framework directive than a detailed proposal similar to the original, was published by the Commission and is at present under consideration by the European Parliament.  It is important to note that irrespective of whether the European proposal is eventually adopted, the perceived wisdom in the Irish market is that an Irish takeover panel is needed now and it is not appropriate to wait until the EU proposal is discussed and adopted.  In the circumstances I am satisfied it is appropriate to go ahead with the present proposal.  Attention has been paid to the likely content of the EU proposal in preparing this.  I am satisfied there will be need for a small change to make our statutory proposal compatible with the EU proposal in its present form.  All interests relevant to the EU proposal have been consulted and this will be taken into account in defining our attitude.</P>
    <P>This raises the question referred to by Deputy O'Rourke of why the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, was introduced by the Minister for Finance and why I am introducing this Bill.  Who am I to query why the Department of Finance should decree that it be done this way?  I will never do that.  This <Col N="1652" /> measure is concerned with protecting the interests of shareholders, whereas the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, is concerned with the supervision and regulation of the stock exchange and its members.</P>

At the time the Minister for Finance made reference to the fact that this Bill would follow on logically and, in so far as we could gel the dates, it would be introduced at the same time.  We have not managed to keep to that timetable, but the interim situation is in safe hands and I hope we can conclude progress through this House reasonably speedily.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke wants to know why we do not attempt to consolidate company and other law in the area of corporate management.  The Deputy probably knows that would be an enormous task.  Legislation appears to be more complex in the area of corporate company law and in the commerce area generally.  I would think that the business of consolidating the legislation is an enormous one.  I am sure many practitioners would welcome it, but it is not something that should intrude between now and the passage of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Those were the main matters raised and we will have an opportunity to discuss them in more detail on Committee Stage.  There has been a general welcome for the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised a point that goes to the heart of how European legislation has progressed since the European Union was founded.  It is a huge bureaucracy and serious questions must be asked about whether there is sufficient democratic assertion of control.  There is a necessity for expertise in most of these measures.  The enormity of the task is such that without that professional expertise it would be extremely difficult for the Council of Ministers to do its business.  I share the sentiment expressed by Deputy O'Rourke that sometimes one finds that matters have progressed to such a stage that one cannot unravel them or backtrack and is presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> From my direct experience of some matters that have been progressing, I would like to have been persuaded in advance of the merit of a particular direction. The Deputy is correct.  It is primarily a matter for the legislative assemblies of the domestic parliaments of the member states.  Each member state should make adequate provision to ensure that these measures are thrashed out in the domestic parliament.  I was under the impression that our committee system had improved the opportunity for that input.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the First Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago the national establishment and system of Government woke up to the existence of a national drugs crisis.  That drugs crisis was largely concentrated in Dublin, mainly in deprived working class areas, and was essentially a heroin problem.  The nation woke up to the problem briefly and then it turned a blind eye to a nasty but safely concentrated problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Today the nation has woken up to what it sees as a new drugs crisis, but it is not a new drugs crisis.  As I said, it never went away.  Individual Deputies from both sides of the House and across the party political spectrum, mainly representing certain Dublin constituencies, grappled daily with the problem.</P>
    <P>The regional health and social services engaged in fire fighting with inadequate resources.  Local administration could have done more but, unfortunately, too often chose to be the absentee landlord.  The Drugs Squad fought alone, the need for more extensive community policing was ignored and the prison system, which might have been part of the solution, became in the eyes of many critics part of the problem.  One could be forgiven for thinking that it is almost as if the nation turned a blind eye to the addiction, crime, crime lords, drug barons, deaths, destruction of human lives and urban communities, social decay and economic disintegration.  I am glad to say this Government has not engaged in the blind eye approach.</P>
    <P>The causes and consequences of the drug problem are closely intertwined.  The sources of the problem are external and internal.  There are international and national dimensions to it.  There are economic forces at work.  The response must be multi-dimensional.  Despite the absence of comprehensive data there is no doubt that the areas in which the heroin problem is most acute and those which are most socially economically deprived very much coincide.</P>
    <P>We must not seek refuge in the observation that this is a worldwide phenomenon.  Most of us are familiar to some degree with the situation in the inner cities in the United States, in big British cities like Glasgow and in certain continental European cities, such as Paris and Amsterdam. The factors at work in all these cities are not the same.  However, there is one major theme &mdash; the strong correlation between drug abuse and social, economic and physical marginalisation of working class communities.  That is the story in the United States where race, of course, is also a factor.  It is also the situation, for example, in Paris and Glasgow.  It is without doubt the predominant theme in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We do not have a census of drug addiction, but we can count the numbers presenting for treatment, the addicts who have finally decided to seek help, treatment and rehabilitation to overcome their addiction.  The greatest numbers presenting for treatment for heroin addiction in the greater Dublin area in 1995 were from the areas designated by objective criteria as being socially and economically disadvantaged under the current local development programme.  These areas are characterised by chronic levels of unemployment, often poor living conditions, high rates of early school leaving, high levels of family breakdown and a general lack of recreational facilities and other supports.</P>
    <P>This fact is also fully supported in submissions received by the task force from over 120 <Col N="1655" /> organisations and individuals who responded to our invitation to make their views known on how the drugs crisis might best be tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of participation in the multi-party talks were first set out by the two Governments in the communiqué of 28 February. They were restated in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules published on 16 April, which in turn were referred to in the Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations) Act, which, for British purposes, forms the legal basis of the present negotiations. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Ground Rules read as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.  Negotiations will involve the participation, in the appropriate strands, of representatives of both Governments and all those political parties operating in Northern Ireland ... which achieve representation through an elective process and which, as set out in the Communiqué of 28 February 1996, establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" />&ldquo;9.  In the Communiqué of 28 February, both Governments expressed the hope that all political parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations. However, both Governments are also agreed that the resumption of Ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin, and their participation in negotiations, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those remain the conditions for entry to negotiations.  In addition, as was also set out in the February communiqué and the ground rules, it is required as a confidence-building measure that all participants make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the international body.  This was done at the start of negotiations in June by the two Governments and the nine parties currently participating in the talks.  It will also be required of Sinn Féin if, as a result of an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire, it is to enter the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Government wishes to see Sinn Féin participate in the negotiations as it remains its view that fully inclusive negotiations offer the best prospect of achieving a fully durable and comprehensive agreement.  However, it must be acknowledged that the atrocities perpetrated by the IRA since February and other evidence of its continuing activity have called into question the credibility of the republican movement as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that the two Governments have emphasised that we will need to be satisfied a restoration of the ceasefire is unequivocal. There is an onus on both Sinn Féin and the IRA to ensure that neither their words nor their actions would be in contradiction of a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and to abide by the democratic process.  It is for the IRA, not for the two Governments, to take the decision unequivocally to restore its ceasefire and thus make possible the entry of Sinn Féin to the multi-party talks.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the two Governments must continue to work to ensure that, as was also stipulated in the February communiqué and the ground rules, all parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.  I believe the current all-party negotiations proceeding in Belfast have the potential to provide such reassurance, in particular once the way is clear to launch substantive negotiations in the three strands.  I am confident that, with the necessary political will on all sides, the negotiations can be made truly meaningful and can lead to a lasting political settlement. However, it is up to the IRA to determine whether it can also become truly inclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his reply.  Does he agree there are basically two alternatives in the North &mdash; violence or dialogue? If we all agree that violence must cease, we must open the way to dialogue.  Does he agree that the ground rules document while correct in principle, is far too vague?  Should the Government not state clearly that, if violence is brought to an end for good, Sinn Féin will be brought into the talks within weeks, as the Tánaiste said last night?  Is it true, as a Government spokesman claimed, that the two Governments are completely united in their approach?  Specifically, is there agreement between the two Governments on the criteria to be applied for entry to the talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes clear the choices confronting us.  One can have either violence or dialogue but they are incompatible. Both Governments have made clear that there can be no departure from the basic rules of democracy and non-violence.  There is no question of the admission of Sinn Féin to negotiations before an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  In the first instance, Sinn Féin would have to make clear its total and absolute commitment to the six Mitchell principles, including the complete renunciation of all violence and the total and verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.  It is for the IRA to take the decision unequivocally to restore its ceasefire and make possible the entry of Sinn Féin to the multi-party talks.  As the communiqué of February 28 stipulates, the two Governments will continue to work to ensure that all parties have reassurances that an inclusive process will take place but it is for Sinn Féin and the IRA to restore the ceasefire to make possible their entry to the talks.  The Governments are working closely together.  The Deputy knows from his own experience that without absolute agreement between and determination on the part of the two Governments, there will not be a successful process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is up to the IRA. However, does the Tánaiste agree that the British Government and other parties should try, without concession of principle, to make an end to violence attractive rather than unattractive?  Does he agree it is essential on this occasion to make clear when Sinn Féin can expect to enter talks, following a satisfactory ceasefire declaration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should encourage the positive changes which have taken place in republican thinking by keeping open the path which leads from the wilderness of violence to the democratic arena.  I think it must also be acknowledged &mdash; and the Deputy will have no difficulty accepting this &mdash; that the atrocities perpetrated by the IRA since February and other evidence of continuing activity have called into question the credibility of the republican movement as a whole.  In that respect we are at <Col N="1658" /> pains to emphasise that we want an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire.  We want to move into an inclusive process of all-party talks as quickly as possible and to ensure there are opportunities because it is only in the context of such talks, with people sitting down together around the table, that we will bring about the settlement we are all trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>We all want to see people sitting around the table.  I remind the Minister of his words of last night that it is deeply frustrating that not one minute has been devoted to discussions on the substantive political issues in the talks process.  Will the Minister agree that what is needed at this stage is clarity on when the talks will start in the event of an IRA ceasefire, for which we all hope?  The Taoiseach's statement yesterday was less definitive than the Minister's statement last night in terms of the entry of Sinn Féin into talks.  It is important for people outside the House to know exactly where the Government stands on this issue.  Is it at one with the British Government on when the talks will commence?  There are apparent contradictions between the position of the Taoiseach, the Minister and Sir Patrick Mayhew in terms of the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <P>There is no change in the Government's position on the conditions and what is necessary.  The Deputy asked for clarity, but the most important clarity would be a demonstration by the republican movement that a renewed ceasefire is for real.  There must be no contradictions between words and deeds.  That is the most important aspect in terms of the prospects for the peace process.  We urge that the ceasefire be restored so that we can move to get the parties around the table for all-party talks. The Governments are working together to bring that about.  The Government's position is set out very clearly in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules.</P>

Clarity is required but what we see at present is a fog.  The Minister should make a clear statement on when talks will commence in the event of a permanent cessation of violence.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy thinks there are apparent differences, that is a matter for him. There are no differences.  The Government is working as a team in advancing the talks process. It would be difficult to set out an absolutely watertight and detailed scenario in circumstances in which there are inevitably many uncertainties and imponderables.  The process in which we are engaged, as the Deputy well knows from his experience, is extremely complex and difficult and setting down rigid conditions apart from those on which we are all agreed &mdash; a restored ceasefire and signing up to the Mitchell principles &mdash; would be counterproductive.  In the event of a ceasefire the Governments would seek to apply constructively and in good faith the principles we have set out.  They would of course have to take account of the terms of any ceasefire as an important and decisive factor.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 45 on 23 October last.</P>
      <P>On my instructions, the Irish Ambassador to Belarus has been in contact with the Belarussian authorities regarding the media reports of possible military exercises in the region close to where the Chernobyl accident occurred and to express our serious concern at the potential ecological dangers in any such activities.  The Belarussian authorities indicated that no decisions had been taken regarding such exercises although the idea had been mooted.  As I indicated in my earlier reply, if it is decided to proceed with such activities, this would be a matter of serious concern to Ireland and other countries in Europe.  The Belarussian Ambassador to Ireland, who was in Dublin yesterday, was informed of my concern.  We are also in contact with EU partners on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> With regard to EU assistance for the areas affected by the Chernobyl accident, the European Union has been to the forefront of the international effort to address the consequences of the disaster which occurred there ten years ago.  The disaster at Chernobyl had consequences far beyond the immediate contamination of the surrounding region and seriously affected the local population.  Today, as for many years to come, the site will need continual attention to ensure safe shutdown of the nuclear power plant, treatment and disposal of nuclear waste as well as clearing of the site.  However, the immediate priority is to ensure that the remaining plants at Chernobyl are closed down and that the damaged reactor is entombed permanently.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the European Commission initiated an agreement with Russia, the Ukraine and Belarus to carry out a number of collaboration projects which aim to contribute to a better understanding of the effects of large scale radioactive pollution of the environment and quantifying the impact on the health of the public concerned.</P>
    <P>Under the TACIS programme of technical assistance for the countries of the former Soviet Union, the EU has been active in promoting a comprehensive programme of financial, technical and practical support to aid the rehabilitation and decontamination of the areas most affected by the Chernobyl disaster.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was involved in a project which is funded under TACIS entitled Food Quality and Technical Support for Chernobyl Affected Areas in the Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.  European Community Humanitarian Aid has also been sent to Belarus and Ukraine.</P>
    <P>In 1994 the EU's concerns about nuclear safety in the Ukraine led it to propose, in co-operation with its partners in the G7, an action plan to be agreed with Ukraine for (i) the definitive closure of Chernobyl as soon as possible; (ii) the reform of Ukraine's energy sector including the development of alternative energy sources; (iii) the upgrading of construction and operating standards in its nuclear sub-sector; and (iv) ratification by Ukraine of the Vienna Convention on nuclear liability.  The plan involves financial effort from the international financial institutions, with the EU for its part willing to raise 500 MECU in EURATOM loans and TACIS grants.</P>
    <P>On 20 December 1995 the &ldquo;Memorandum of Understanding on the closure of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plants was signed by the G7 and Ukraine.  The MoU is a political agreement which commits the G7 and Ukraine to work jointly towards the closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000.  Much of the MoU focuses on replacing Chernobyl as a source of power and generally improving the provision and use of energy in the Ukraine.  The MoU covers four main areas of future work: restructuring of the power sector; an energy investment programme which is principally concerned with replacing Chernobyl as a power source; decommissioning of <Col N="1661" /> Chernobyl's reactors 1 and 2; and the social costs not only of the disaster itself, but also of the closure of Chernobyl.  The MoU includes a list of projects to be prepared and implemented over the coming years.</P>
    <P>There has been progress.  At the meeting in Moscow on nuclear safety, on 20 April this year, President Kuchma of Ukraine confirmed that the Chernobyl plant would be shut down completely by the year 2000.  I have referred above to the provision of the EU action plan which sought ratification by Ukraine of the Vienna Convention on nuclear liability.  I am pleased to advise that Ukraine lodged the instruments of ratification to the Convention on 19 September this year.  At the follow-up meeting to the Memorandum of Understanding, held in Paris on 11 October, it was generally acknowledged that the implementation of the MoU is well under way and that all parties feel committed to its full success.</P>
    <P>The Union is also aware of the serious situation arising from the contamination of land as a result of the accident.  While the emphasis in the Union's efforts is being placed on the immediate need to ensure closure of Chernobyl, the making safe of the destroyed reactor, and the accompanying measures to ensure safety in the nuclear sector in Ukraine, the Union has also made a financial allocation to help deal with the problem of waste treatment in the 30 km zone around Chernobyl.  In addition the Union initiated, in 1993, the Chernobyl Remedial Programme to assist the local population in recovering from the effects of the accident.  The programme, which is supported under the TACIS programme of technical assistance for the countries of the former Soviet Union, provides for assistance in relation to drugs, iodised salt, abstraction of ground water, local economic recovery efforts and the housing of Chernobyl evacuees.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Is he aware that radiation levels in the exclusion zone have increased due to several forest and bush fires and recent accidents at and continuing emissions from the deteriorating sarcophagus at the Chernobyl plant?  Is he also aware that the death rate among children in the Gomel area is now estimated to be 15 per 1,000?  Leaving aside the proposed military exercises, the situation is deteriorating.  What action can the European Union specifically take to help children in the area?</P>

      <P>I am aware of these reports.  The damaged reactor was discussed at the recent meeting in Paris in the context of the follow up to the memorandum of understanding on which I was elaborating and at the meeting of the G7. The view, shared by international and Ukrainian experts, was that the issue of fuel within the damaged reactor should be addressed in the project conclusions.  The question of <Col N="1662" /> decontamination has also to be addressed but the immediate priorities are the closure of the plant and ensuring there is not another disaster.</P>
      <P>Assistance has been offered, both on a bilateral basis and from the European Union, to help the children most affected by the disaster.  In 1995 the Government disbursed a total of £150,000 for medical programmes in the Chernobyl region. This was channelled through the World Health Organisation and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  The first grant of £75,000 was allocated to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to support a medical programme for early identification and treatment of children with thyroid cancer in Chernobyl.</P>
      <P>In August 1995 we responded to the World Health Organisation's appeal to contain the diphtheria epidemic which had broken out in the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and other newly independent states.  Our donation of £75,000 was targeted at the worst affected areas in Belarus and the Ukraine.</P>
      <P>I am aware, as I am sure every Deputy in this House is, of the excellent work of voluntary groups in Ireland, set up in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear power station explosion, which focus on the special needs of children in the area.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in commending the efforts of Irish voluntary agencies and individuals who have done so much good work in the area to which they continue to travel bringing badly needed aid.  Will he avail of the unique opportunity presented by our Presidency of the European Union to force concerted action on environmental issues such as the proposed violation of the 30 kilometre exclusion zone which is of concern not just to those in the Chernobyl area but to all Europeans? Will the Minister comment on the political instability in the area?  A referendum will be held on 7 November to greatly expand the powers of the President.  This cannot be in the best interests of the rest of Europe given his record and his proposals for the exclusion zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is concern in the European Union about the political uncertainty in Belarus arising from the President's proposals to introduce constitutional changes.  This concern was expressed at the special European Council in Dublin on 5 October.  The matter was also discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Tuesday and particularly at the meeting of the Association Council with Central and Eastern European countries.  I conveyed our concerns to the Belarus Foreign Minister when I discussed the matter with him at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  We are hopeful that changes will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also expressed our concerns about the violation of the 30 kilometre exclusion zone and <Col N="1663" /> will continue to monitor what is a difficult situation to ensure, on the basis of the memorandum of understanding, that all obligations are fully complied with by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I accept the good intentions of the Minister and European Union leaders who have had various discussions about the matter but this is a humanitarian disaster, it is about children, many of whom we meet when they visit our constituencies during the summer to stay with host families.  I met some of them on one occasion in Kerry.  We should be concerned about their future.  Political manoeuvring in their own country should not be seen to damage them further.  Constructive and positive measures, rather than well meaning resolutions, should be taken to ensure that their rights and future are protected.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy in dealing with this tragic humanitarian disaster of ten years ago. Both the European Union and the G7 countries are doing a considerable amount in tackling the matter.  The European Union is committed to making 500 million ECU available in Euratom loans and grants under the TACIS Programme.  I have had discussions with the Ukrainian authorities and the priority is the closure of the Chernobyl plant, making the sarcophagus safe and upgrading nuclear facilities to the highest possible safety levels.  This will cost enormous amounts of money.  There is also a requirement to avail of alternative energy sources.  These priorities are to be achieved in co-operation with the European Union and the G7 countries.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he and the European Union will take in the Great Lakes region of Africa to protect refugees in view of the serious unrest in Zaire and the danger posed to Rwanda refugees.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20190/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to be gravely concerned about the disastrous situation in Eastern Zaire which is threatening to destabilise further the Great Lakes region.  Over half a million people, including Rwandan refugees and local Zaireans have been forced to leave refugee camps in Bukaw and Uvira in Eastern Zaire.  The situation remains very tense and reliable information from the area is difficult to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a direct consequence of the conflict, almost all international humanitarian staff have had to be evacuated from most of Eastern Zaire.  While this evacuation is clearly regrettable, humanitarian staff had little choice in view of the violence and looting which they had encountered. <Col N="1664" /> The evacuation has made it increasingly difficult to gain reliable information on the movements of numerous Rwandan Hutu refugees and displaced Zaireans.  UN agencies, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, are unable to gain access to the areas and assess the needs of the refugee population.  On the humanitarian front my Department remains in close consultation with the United Nations in Geneva and New York, and is working in co-operation with the Irish aid agencies in the region.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers of the European Union discussed the situation in detail last Monday at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg with a view to preventing a further humanitarian catastrophe and possible wider conflict in the region.  On that occasion, recalling the European Union's Declarations of 21 and 25 October, we reiterated the Union's concern at the escalation in fighting in the Kivu region and called on all parties to exercise restraint and in particular to have regard to the safety of civilians.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards preventing any further escalation in violence and unrest, the Council called for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire and, in the firm conviction that the complex problems at issue can only be resolved through early and substantive dialogue, called on all parties concerned to begin such a process as soon as possible.  Taking into account the regional role of the Organisation of African Unity, the Council also appealed to that organisation's member states to make urgent efforts to contribute to the settlement of the conflict.  It believes that a particular responsibility in this regard devolves on Zaire and Rwanda, while at the same time welcoming the stated readiness of the authorities of both to pursue and reinforce the process of dialogue between their two countries.</P>
    <P>To facilitate this process of dialogue between Zaire and Rwanda, the European Union has mandated its Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, to travel immediately to the region.  Mr. Ajello, who departed for the region last Monday, will be assisted in his efforts by the Troikas of EU Heads of Mission in Kinshasa and Kigali.  Mr. Ajello has made himself available to attend a conference of regional leaders to address the situation in Eastern Zaire which it is hoped will take place in Arusha, Tanzania, this weekend.</P>
    <P>As Presidency, Ireland has been fully engaged with partners and Special Envoy Ajello in seeking to address the growing crisis in Eastern Zaire. During his previous mission to countries of the Great Lakes region Mr. Ajello had initial discussions about the situation in South Kivu with the Prime Minister of Zaire in Arusha on 12 October and had also been engaged in ongoing consultations with the Government of Rwanda. In carrying out his current mission, which is specifically aimed at promoting a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Eastern Zaire, Mr. <Col N="1665" /> Ajello will co-ordinate closely with the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other interested parties.  In addition, we have had direct contacts with the Rwandan Government in recent days in which we have reinforced the messages being delivered by Mr. Ajello.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, met the Foreign Minister of Rwanda yesterday and discussed these issues.</P>
    <P>The increasingly volatile situation in Eastern Zaire and the danger of the conflict spreading across national boundaries pose a very real threat to any prospect for long-term peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.  As such, it calls for the immediate and substantive engagement of all parties in the search for an agreed political solution.  However, in more immediate terms we are already witnessing the appalling and growing human cost of the violence and displacement of the population in South Kivu and beyond.  With our EU partners, the Irish Presidency is seeking ways to prevent a further worsening of the already serious humanitarian situation in the region and to impact further on its local and refugee populations.  Last Monday's Council has, therefore, requested the European Commission to report urgently on the situation and to make proposals for action by the Union to assist actively in the process of getting supplies to those in need.  This action will be co-ordinated closely with the national efforts of member states, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>As confirmed to the House by Deputy Burton, Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for development co-operation, in the Adjournment statement which she made on South Kivu last Thursday, the Government is examining the current situation very closely from a humanitarian perspective.  We have spent almost £10 million since 1994 in the region and we will continue to play our part in alleviating the plight of those affected in the current fighting. Further aid to the region, and specifically to Eastern Zaire, will be considered in the light of developments and any appeals for funding from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and NGOs will be given sympathetic consideration.  As Presidency, Ireland has placed the situation in the Great Lakes region on the agenda of this week's meeting of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). Humanitarian agencies are reallocating resources to Rwanda and are setting up temporary transit stations to help deal with the further displacement of the refugee population.</P>
    <P>In addressing the current crisis in Eastern Zaire in these terms, we are strongly reminded of the pressing need to deal effectively with the enormous problems posed by the presence of over one million refugees and displaced persons in the Great Lakes region following the conflict in Rwanda in 1994.  This unresolved issue, which affects the entire region, has resulted in <Col N="1666" /> initially localised conflict having far-reaching humanitarian and political repercussions.  The European Union is, therefore, prepared to work closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Governments in question and international donors to bring about an agreed and effective strategy to deal with this pervasive issue.  It further believes that such a strategy will be paramount in devising a framework to create a comprehensive, durable settlement of the problems of the region as a whole.  The European Union remains strongly of the view that a regional conference on peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region, under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity, has a central role to play in the establishment of a regional settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that within the last 48 hours the conflict in Eastern Zaire has become internationalised in the sense that the Rwandan army has invaded Zaire and is fighting the Zairean army on Zairean territory?  In view of that, will he agree that the reluctance of the United Nations to become involved militarily up to now on the grounds, allegedly, that it was a civil war is no longer valid, that this is now an international conflict and that the United Nations should intervene militarily to put a stop to the extensive fighting taking place which, if it is not stopped, is likely to escalate further and to involve other countries?  Will he agree it is impossible for NGOs, the UNHCR or anybody else to deliver food or other humanitarian assistance when extensive fighting is taking place, that the first priority must be to stop the fighting and that the United Nations should send in a peacemaking force to come between the two sides?  Will the European Union play its part in doing this given that the United States has indicated its reluctance to become involved?  Will the European Union provide troops for this purpose because failure to stop this war will mean we are facing the possibility of another million people dying, as a million died in Rwanda in 1994?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt we are facing the potential for a human catastrophe in this region. As we speak the situation is unfolding.  Rwandan troops have now engaged with Zairean troops and there is a danger of an escalation to all out war between Zaire and Rwanda.  When the Minister of State met the Rwandan Foreign Minister yesterday she reiterated the view of the European Union that these issues can only be resolved around the negotiating table.  The European Union Special Envoy has been in touch with us this morning from Kinshasa.  He will be having talks with the Zairean Government over the next 24 hours having just arrived there from Kigali.  He is carrying the same message of the urgent need for dialogue.  It is unlikely that the United Nations or the European Union under whatever mandate will be sending troops to this <Col N="1667" /> region.  We are in contact with the Organisation of African Unity.  There may well be a question of funding from the United Nations, the European Union and the United States but the strong view is that what is required is an all-African force funded by the European Union, the United Nations and the United States in particular.  If it were possible to put that together I am sure we would have no difficulty in getting support for it. In all honesty, however, I do not see European member states offering troops for a mission to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that if there is a failure to put in a strong, effective military force to stop this war in its early stages it will escalate and that having talks, for example, with the Zairean Government in Kinshasa is not much use when Zaire is in the process of breaking up?  The President is in Europe suffering apparently from a serious illness and Zaire is facing a post-Tito situation akin to what happened to the former Yugoslavia and is likely to disintegrate in the weeks and months to come. Is it not a fact that the potential for enormous numbers of deaths there is far greater than it is in other parts of the world where the United Nations and the European Union are prepared to go to great lengths to prevent or avoid conflict? In this instance a million people or more could die, as a million have died already.  Is there not an obligation, therefore, to use military force since there is no alternative in this conflict and since humanitarian acts, no matter how well intended, cannot be put into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept there is potential for catastrophe.  In our discussions in Luxembourg on Monday night with Commissioner Bonino, who described the situation to us, we were given the best information available and I have described that in my reply to the Deputy's question.  In the past number of days half a million people have been displaced but the first difficulty is getting information and access to the region where these people are now located.  We are trying to organise a meeting for next Tuesday &mdash; I cannot guarantee it will take place &mdash; of all the Heads of State in the region.  We hope the Special Envoy from the European Union, the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity will be in attendance.  We need to put together an international response and it behoves all of us to do everything that is necessary in that regard.  As is the case in most of these crises around the world, the European Union undoubtedly will be the major donor but the European countries which have been involved in this region in the past are not willing to consider sending a military operation to the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree, from a European point of view, that the principal <Col N="1668" /> responsibility lies with the Belgian and French Governments, which did extremely well out of this region in the past and now have certain responsibilities, and it is not enough to say we will provide money if we are not prepared to provide troops to stop what is happening and what will undoubtedly get much worse?  Why are the United Nations and EU member states prepared to provide troops elsewhere in situations which are not comparable to this in seriousness and not here?</P>
      <P>There is enough food left in some of these areas for seven days.  Once that food is consumed, there is no way of supplying more.  Apart from those being killed in the fighting, up to one million people could die from starvation within the next few weeks.  Calling meetings and expressing concerns is of no value in this kind of situation.  It requires immediate military intervention and nothing else is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must disagree with the Deputy's suggestions.  What is most important is that we prepare the international response and that can only be done through summoning the regional leaders, in conjunction with the Organisation of African Unity, the United Nations, the European Union, and the United States in particular, and setting out to see if, in the first instance, we can get access for humanitarian aid.  We are looking for a humanitarian corridor and zones to get access to people to whom we do not yet have access.  The Deputy should be aware of that, it was in the report we were given on Monday evening. However, we are getting what I would call a favourable response from the region in relation to creating humanitarian corridors.  Before one can send in people we must be able to guarantee their safety.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, who has been around this House for many years, may well understand that the idea of sending French and Belgian troops into this region might not be totally accepted by the region for many historical reasons.</P>

      <P>At national level, Ireland's official development assistance is at its highest level ever, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GNP.  The first priority of the Irish aid programme is to provide assistance to the poorer countries of sub-Saharan Africa and, in targeting basic needs, assist the poorest people of those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> At European Union level, as indicated in my reply of 24 October to Deputy Broughan, I am fully aware of the proposed cuts in some EU development co-operation budget lines and of the concern expressed by NGOs, MEPs and others in this regard.  This concern has been brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance and will be taken into account in preparations for the next meeting of the Budget Council on 19 November.</P>
    <P>The budget allocations for 1997 have not yet been finalised.  As the spending under these budget lines is classified as `non-compulsory' the final decision on the appropriations will rest with the European Parliament at its second reading of the draft budget in December.</P>

      <P>This is another classic example of Europe playing politics with the agenda of the EU on aid for Mediterranean countries along north Africa rather than sub-Saharan Africa at a time of great need.  It brings us back to the question Deputy O'Malley asked.  I put down a private notice question on this matter yesterday which, unfortunately, was ruled out because of today's questions.  I called on the Government to use its influence as President of the EU to ensure the Union takes action to protect the vulnerable population of eastern Zaire by immediately sending a UN force into the region to prevent a humanitarian disaster.  We are talking about humanitarian disasters in these poorer regions and it is not sufficient to talk about national contributions; we are talking about Europe as a whole.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree it is hypocritical in the unfolding tragedy within Zaire and Rwanda that we talk of aid while some countries sell arms to these countries involving themselves in international disputes with the potential to cause the deaths of one million people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's Irish Government aid is at its highest level ever, that is, £106 million.  I do not want to be partisan about the matter but I recall that the Deputy's party, in the brief period of Fianna Fáil Government, proposed cuts in the aid budget amounting to about £14 million.  If we want to compare records, let us do so.</P>
      <P>I also recall that at one stage the Deputy suggested aid to the Government of Rwanda be cut.  He did not proceed too far with the proposal, and he and I had a long discussion about what was appropriate in terms of rebuilding Rwandan society after the genocide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the EU budget, in the context of Ireland's Presidency and membership of the EU, we want to see the emphasis in terms of development assistance being put on the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  I brought the proposed budget cuts to the Minister's attention. I expect the aid to be very substantially, if not totally, restored.  We would not support some of <Col N="1670" /> the proposed cuts in budget lines because, for instance, they would have curtailed assistance to women and extremely vulnerable and poor groups in sub-Saharan Africa.  I am confident the European Parliament through the budgetary process will seek the reversal of these regrettable cuts.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the current crisis in Zaire will result in a call for even more assistance from the EU.  In recent days I have been in close contact with all our partners in the Union on the issue, including Commissioner Bonino, and the EU is ready, as the Tánaiste said, to provide humanitarian assistance.  To provide it we must establish access to the refugees.</P>
    <P>In Rwanda about seven separate points have been set up along the western border involving the international aid agencies, including the two Irish agencies in the region, Concern and Trócaire, who are ready to offer succour and food to the refugees, but that depends on corridors being cleared so that the refugees can return.  It also depends not only on the goodwill of the Rwandan authorities but on that of the Zairean authorities.  Our information is that the Zairean authorities have prevented refugees from recrossing the border.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of rebuilding refugees' confidence so that they feel they can return.  The situation is extremely complex and dangerous.  The EU is standing by and is ready to contribute as much as possible to the process of giving assistance to those refugees.</P>

The discussion on cuts in aid to Rwanda, to which she referred, occurred in this House with regard to her insistence on the aid being internal to Rwanda and my concern for those Rwandans who were outside the boundaries of Rwanda.  As things have unfolded in recent days, my concerns about the needs of those outside Rwanda have been proved correct.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State seems to be very friendly with the administration in Rwanda as I have heard her speak on many occasions about the number of times she has visited that country, its prisons, etc.  Will she use her influence with the Rwandans and ask them to desist from engaging in attacks across the border into Zaire?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">

      <P>The Deputy should be aware that low level fighting has been ongoing for the past six months.  It originated with people of ethnic Tutsi origin, the Banymulenge, who have lived in what is now Zaire for approximately 300 years. <Col N="1671" /> The current crisis was brought about by the arbitrary withdrawal of their citizenship by the Zaireans.  In the north, near Goma, there were widespread killings of ethnic Tutsis, the Banyrwanda, during the summer in the Massisi region.  One of the conditions for creating a ceasefire, which Zaire has been asked to do, would be to withdraw threats to withdraw the citizenship of people who have lived in the country for 300 to 400 years.</P>
      <P>We continue to press the Government of Rwanda to improve the justice system, which it is currently in the process of doing.  With regard to yesterday's events, the Rwandan Foreign Minister confirmed that his country is ready to take part in an international conference.  We asked that the Rwandans not merely be party to the peace process, which it is hoped will take place in East Africa next week, but that they actively seek to discuss with the Zaireans ways to decrease tensions in the region.  The views of the Irish Government were made known to the Rwandans in a forceful manner on a number of occasions.  However, a solution to the problem will only be achieved when the various countries in the region negotiate with each other and offer some degree of stability to the ethnic groups whose homelands stretch across the borders of different countries in an extremely complex pattern.  The European Union envoy, Mr. Ajello, who visited Kigali earlier in the week and who has now travelled to Kinshasa, is conveying not only Ireland's views but those of the other member states in connection with this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy made clear that the Government would explore further the benefits which Ireland might derive from participation in Partnership for Peace.  In line with my reply on 30 May to questions from Deputies Burke and Clohessy, officials from my Department and the Department of Defence had consultations with NATO on 20 June to explore further the benefits which Ireland could derive from Partnership for Peace.  Those consultations <Col N="1672" /> were entirely satisfactory and confirmed our understanding that each participating state can determine the terms and scope of its contribution, that participation would have no implications for our policy of military neutrality and that Partnership for Peace has already proven itself as a key forum for peacekeeping co-operation involving almost all of the major peacekeeping countries.  The NATO side expressed appreciation of Ireland's peacekeeping role and its achievements.  It is clear that Ireland would have much to gain and to offer in this crucial area through participation in Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am situated in the middle and have no problems.  I am aware that Switzerland has decided to join Partnership for Peace which could be a case of turning the clock forward on this occasion.  There are 43 countries, all members of the OSCE, participating in Partnership for Peace.  The European states not participating include the three states of former Yugoslavia, Cyprus, an island with a complicated political situation which divides it, and the war torn former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan.  Switzerland has now decided to join but Ireland has not yet done so.  Negotiations are ongoing and I believe we should participate in Partnership for Peace. We will continue our dialogue with NATO in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter. I am not of the opinion that Ireland must join Partnership for Peace because everyone else has done so, but that sort of attitude seems to be prevalent in this House.  We must consider our national interests and the Irish people have a strong attachment to the principle and concept of neutrality.  Does the Tánaiste agree that, before any decision is made by a temporary majority in Leinster House, the question of joining Partnership for Peace will be put to the people in a referendum to allow them make a judgment on this issue which is fundamental to Ireland's position on neutrality?  That is the least they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter with serious implications.  There is neither a basis nor a need for a referendum on the question of participation in Partnership for Peace, particularly because it imposes no treaty obligations of any sort, involves no mutual defence commitments and has no implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Burke said on neutrality.  Given that the NATO meeting held in Malahide recently gave a very different impression from the one the Minister gave here today, and given that each party in this House, apart from the Green Party, was represented at that meeting, do the people not have grounds for believing that Irish neutrality is shifting, in spite of the Minister's declaration that there is no change and no need for a referendum?  When will the Minister arrive at the point where he will say a referendum is needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just outlined to Deputy Burke, in regard to Fianna Fáil's political view that there should be a referendum if there is a change, that a decision by the Government to join Partnership for Peace has no treaty obligations, no mutual defence commitments and no <Col N="1674" /> implications for our policy of military neutrality. That is the legal position to which the Government will adhere.  The Deputy has expressed concern about the conference that took place under the auspices of the American Embassy in Malahide.  That had no bearing on Ireland's position on military neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say in passing that I was reported to have been at that conference, but I was not.  I put it to the Minister that he cannot tell the people that a decision to join Partnership for Peace would have no implications for our neutrality when the senior party in NATO, the United States, the bedrock of NATO, has the view that Partnership for Peace is a process to be followed towards full membership, and the former president of the Soviet Union, President Gorbachev, the man who brought about the fall of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the Soviet Union, is so concerned about the move to the East by NATO and moves in NATO, whether by way of Partnership for Peace or other organisations.  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his position on it and to agree that if this fundamental question is being decided upon by a temporary majority in this House, a Government of whatever political hue, the people are entitled to the opportunity to consider the question in a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke has raised a number of points.  The requirements for referenda are clearly set out in the Constitution and any Government will abide by those requirements.  I have said, on two occasions in the past five minutes, that there is no requirement for a referendum on this occasion.  It is not for me to interpret the remarks of the US Ambassador to NATO.  They have their views and we have ours on quite a range of issues, and the views are quite different.  As to what Partnership for Peace offers, it is for us to decide, in our discussions with NATO, how we want to tailor that agreement.  It does not involve a commitment to join NATO now or in the future, and that would not be our intention.  If it were, it would warrant discussion in this House and much evaluation.  However, there is no plan by the Government to join NATO.  I believe, and I said in the White Paper outlining the reasons for it, that it is in our interests to have our discussions with Partnership for Peace and to sign up for Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <P>The Government favours a political solution to the problem of the Kurdish minority in Turkey which would allow for appropriate expression of the Kurdish cultural identity, in accordance with the wishes of the Kurdish people, in a manner consistent with respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Turkish state.</P>
      <P>We have, accordingly, encouraged the Turkish Government to seek a political solution rather than approach the situation in the Kurdish provinces in Turkey purely as a security problem. The conflict resulting from the armed campaign of violence of certain Kurdish separatist groups has lasted over twelve years and claimed the lives of over 22,000 people, including Kurdish guerrillas, members of the security forces and civilians.  A peaceful political settlement to this question would lay the basis for a lasting peace in the area and an improvement in the economic situation of the Kurdish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is important, and has the Government taken any steps as EU Presidency, to ensure that the Turkish authorities carry out whatever fight there is against terrorism in the Kurdish provinces within the law and with full respect for human rights, which is sadly missing within Turkey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had two meetings with the Turkish Foreign Minister at which these issues have been discussed.  We have raised the question of human rights.  It is also worth recalling that following the restoration of democratic government in Turkey in 1983, after a period of repression under military rule, notable progress was made by the incoming and subsequent governments towards democratisation and internal political reform.  Measures were also taken to allow greater political freedom for parties and organisations which had previously been banned under the military regime, and reforms were introduced under the penal code which relaxed restrictions on freedom of expression and political debate.  That process of reform of legislation and the full implementation of democratic freedoms and human rights is not complete.  This point was made in remarks in the European Parliament.  Further measures need to be taken to improve the situation and to ensure respect for human rights.  That is raised at every meeting we have with the Turkish authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has repeated the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to the European Parliament on 18 September when he expressed his view that notable progress had been made in the area of democratisation and internal reform since 1983 in Turkey.  This flies in the face of all <Col N="1676" /> known facts and international reports on Turkey. Does the Minister consider, for example, the reform of Article 8 of the Turkish anti-terror law, under which dissemination of separatist propaganda remains an imprisonable offence, to be notable progress in the areas of democratisation and internal reform?  Further, is the Minister aware that in 1994 more than 50 cases of disappearances were submitted to the UN working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances from Turkey, that in 1995 a further 35 disappearances were reported by Amnesty International, that in March 1995 22 people were shot dead by police during disturbances in Istanbul, that in the same year there were approximately 100 political killings, many of them extrajudicial, and that the police officers and gendarmes who commit such human rights violations remain immune to prosecution under the law on the prosecution of civil servants which permits local governors to block prosecutions of security forces personnel?  With that record, would the Minister like to consider his statement that notable progress has been made in the area of democratisation and internal reform and on human rights questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have continued to make clear to the Turkish Government that the observance of the rule of law and respect for human rights and basic freedoms in Turkey will underpin the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.  We remain concerned, as has been indicated in the reports cited by the Deputy, that the process of full implementation of respect for human rights in Turkey requires the serious and immediate attention of the Turkish Government. I welcome the recent statement by the Foreign Minister of Turkey that the Turkish Government intends to take further measures to improve human rights in Turkey and we will continue to urge the authorities to take early steps to introduce further reform.</P>
      <P>I have set the background for the Deputy in relation to the situation that existed in 1983.  The situation has changed.  It is not perfect, and I would never attempt to say that it is, but they have advanced significantly on the road to establishing proper respect for human rights and democracy in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government support the European Parliament's resolution to enter a reserve on all credits provided by the EU (Turkey) Financial Regulation, and call on the European Commission to block immediately all appropriations set aside under the MEDA programme for projects in Turkey except those concerning the promotion of democracy, human rights and civil society until such time as Turkey fulfils the conditions that have been set during the vote on the European Parliament's assent to the customs union?  Does the Minister support the European Parliament on this measure?  If he does, and if he accepts the reports of Amnesty <Col N="1677" /> International and other international reports, the fact that appalling anti-terrorist legislation is in place and the rules in relation to the roles of the governors in protecting security personnel, how can he support the statement of the Minister of State that notable progress has been made in the area of democratisation and internal reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Deputy is turning a blind eye to the situation that existed prior to 1983 and the improvements since then. The Turkish political parties have just had a series of elections and a coalition Government has been formed as a means of working towards democratisation.  We wish to see positive developments in our relationship with Turkey, particularly within the framework of the customs union, approved by the European Parliament last year.  A central element of the European Union's strategy is to support the process of democratisation and internal reform in Turkey.  A closer relationship with Turkey, which the customs union entails, is the best way of enhancing the European Union's capacity to exercise a positive influence on developments in that country.  I trust the Deputy is not suggesting we isolate Turkey because that would be a disaster.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of trade missions that have taken place or are planned between Ireland and Turkey?  Can he ensure that the message goes out to Turkey, regardless of what arrangements might be made, that such trade missions are not an endorsement of breaches of human rights in that country?  Is he involved in deciding whether a trade mission goes ahead on the basis of Department of Foreign Affairs policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think I have any function in relation to trade missions to Turkey.

      <P>I have not yet had an opportunity to make an official visit to Iran.  However, I have had several meetings with my Iranian colleague and counterpart, Foreign Minister Velyati.  We met in Dublin in 1994 and have had other meetings at the UN in New York in September 1995 and again last month.</P>
      <P>The Joint Commission for Economic, Industrial, Scientific and Technical Co-operation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Ireland last met in Dublin in 1994.  Since then, there have been some scheduling difficulties on both sides in fixing mutually convenient dates for a next meeting of the joint commission, which is to be held in Iran, but arrangements are being kept under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there had been some scheduling difficulties on both sides. The reality is that the Minister is being ruled by EU views while other members of the EU have experienced no difficulty in doing business in Iran.  This question is directly related to the problems experienced by our farmers with the beef trade and the potential of the Iranian market.  It is incumbent on the Minister to forget the diplomatic niceties in relation to the EU and use his position as Minister for Foreign Affairs to be in Iran where political influence is crucial to ensure that market is opened again to our beef farmers.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, I do not wish to disobey the Chair but Deputy Burke has had his say.  Nobody will deny that the beef trade with Iran is extremely important.  It has been affected as is the case in other countries by the consequences of the BSE crisis.  In all such cases we should be clear that the concerns of the countries involved have been about public health and the wholesomeness of our beef.  It is by satisfying our customers and not by political coaxing that these markets have been kept open. For example, our beef trade markets with Egypt and Saudi Arabia were kept open by the combined efforts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and by our embassies in those countries.  The Governments of the countries to which we export beef and beef products respond very negatively to the implication or suggestion that public health or consumer concerns might be subordinate to political considerations or set aside by irrelevant political gestures or pressure. It does scant service to the image of our beef exports or to the task of ensuring full confidence in their quality or wholesomeness to suggest otherwise.  Public opinion in the countries concerned and in Ireland is unlikely to be impressed by the links which Deputy Burke is trying to establish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite apart from beef, in which the Minister does not seem to want to get involved, is he aware that in the past Iran, as a large country, has been a major market for Irish goods generally and it is unsatisfactory that a period of two and a half years has elapsed since this joint trade commission met?  On the Irish side it cannot be called by anyone except the Minister because he is the co-chairman.  He does have a trade function.  The particular country concerned is one of several throughout the world that tend to do business only through these joint trade commissions.  It is difficult to get any substantial business in beef or otherwise outside this structure.  The structure is unusual for us but it is one we have to accept when we are trying to do business with certain countries.  In view of Iran's relatively large size and its importance, on occasions at least in the past as a major market, will he arrange to overcome his scheduling difficulties and call a meeting of the joint commission?  If he calls it, as joint chairman, presumably the Iranian authorities will be glad to comply with the request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many organisations and individuals are working at the coalface in combating the drugs problem, so their views are particularly relevant.  I take this opportunity to thank them for making submissions and to assure them that their views were taken fully into consideration by the task force in preparing its report.  The correlation between addiction and social and economic marginalisation means that economic policy must have a role in defeating the scourge.</P>
      <P>We must ensure a fair spread of the present growth dividend, particularly in respect of employment and the spread of economic activity. The drug priority areas are also economic and unemployment priority areas.  These three problems &mdash; drugs, the lack of jobs and the absence of economic activity &mdash; feed off and reinforce each other.</P>
      <P>This Government, through initiatives such as the local employment service, the strengthening of the partnerships, budgetary, tax and welfare policies, is concentrating significant resources on the urban economic and unemployment priority areas.  To the extent that these policies prove successful they undermine the mutually reinforcing causes of the downward spiral of which drug &ldquo;blackspots&rdquo; are another manifestation.</P>
      <P>In making a connection between these policies, initiatives and efforts and the war against drugs, community and voluntary groups and the partnerships have a key role to play in conjunction with the State &mdash; as is recognised by the ministerial task force in its first report.  The focus of the task force is demand reduction policies and measures.  However, as I have said, the overall approach must be integrated, comprehensive and multi-dimensional.</P>
      <P>As our first report points out, illegal drug production, manufacture, trafficking and distribution is a gigantic global business.  The response of governments to this huge, logistically well-organised, financially well-endowed and also well-armed, global criminal conspiracy calls for concentrated co-ordinated international measures and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's position as the gateway to Europe, with a coastline which it is virtually impossible to police fully, is particularly vulnerable and we have an enormous responsibility and critical role in this context.  It is for this reason that the Irish Presidency of the European Union has sought to <Col N="1682" /> prioritise action at EU and global levels.  We have seen some major successes on this front in the past few years and months.</P>
    <P>This Government has also accompanied international co-operation with necessary national supply side measures in areas such as money laundering, criminal assets seizure and putting the squeeze on local distribution and pushers.  Legislative and administrative measures have been introduced.  The newly established Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda have scored major successes in recent months.  Not only have large consignments of drugs been confiscated but we are now able to hit the crime lords where it hurts them most &mdash; through the seizure of their ill-gotten wealth.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has responded positively to appeals to redeploy more gardaí into the worst affected areas, to squeeze and pressurise local drug distribution and pushing and to fight drug-related crime.  He will similarly address the specific proposal in this report that a comprehensive community policing strategy be developed in the priority areas.</P>
    <P>Additional judges have been appointed to ensure that the pushers are brought to justice swiftly, while extra prison places are being made available to ensure that they do not escape their just punishment by default.  I am sure Deputies will agree that these measures, which are being co-ordinated by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, are already having a positive effect in reducing the availability of drugs on our streets.</P>
    <P>It is argued in some quarters that the prohibitionist approach has not worked and that drugs should be legalised.  This, it is suggested, would have the effect of making the illegal manufacture and distribution of these drugs no longer profitable, thus putting the godfathers of crime out of business.  The question of liberalising our existing drugs laws was not considered by the task force.  This was because we acted within the framework set by the Government decision which, in adopting a range of measures last February to provide a more effective response to the drugs problem, decided that the legalising of even so-called soft drugs, such as cannabis and marijuana, was not an option.  This is the predominant approach by governments throughout the world.  Liberalising the drugs laws has been tried in some countries, most notably in the Netherlands and Switzerland.  The approaches adopted in both countries are different and the jury is still out on whether legalisation and/or decriminalisation has a role to play in achieving an effective solution.</P>
    <P>Those who argue in favour of legalisation draw an analogy with prohibition in the United States and its connection with the origins of modern organised crime in that country.  While there is no doubt such a connection exists organised crime not only continued but thrived following the end of prohibition.  Therefore, while the legalising of drugs would undoubtedly lead to a reduction in much of the petty drug-related crime which takes <Col N="1683" /> place in our capital on a daily basis, history suggests that it would not eliminate serious organised crime.  The drug barons can be extremely innovative and clever when it comes to creating new ways of making crime pay.  They simply turn their attentions elsewhere into some new line of business.</P>
    <P>Every concerned citizen, no matter what side of the prohibition or legalisation debate he or she supports, agrees that it is a priority that organised crime is put out of business permanently. Therefore, any solution which merely moves this particular problem sideways will not work.  Nor is the case for legalising soft drugs, such as cannabis or marijuana, convincing.  In many ways this is just a side issue.</P>
    <P>Our main drugs problem is heroin abuse, which is also the cause of most petty drug-related crime and is a major cause in Ireland of the incidence of AIDS and other blood-related diseases.  While many young people who experiment in &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs do not progress to the nightmare which is heroin addiction, there is no evidence to suggest that legalising these soft drugs would make any impact on the heroin problem.</P>
    <P>Available evidence also confirms that the majority, though not all, of the people who become addicted to heroin in Ireland and in most other countries come from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  In the final analysis, an effective response to the drugs problem must address the underlying reasons people become addicted to drugs.  The Government recognises that the positive action it has taken to put the drug barons out of business must be supported by an equally determined effort to devise strategies which address the reasons people become addicted to drugs.</P>
    <P>This is the reason the ministerial task force was established.  I am glad to have been afforded the opportunity to chair the task force whose remit was to review existing arrangements to ensure a co-ordinated approach to drugs demand reduction and, in the light of that review, to identify for governmental action any changes or additional measures needed to provide a more effective response.</P>
    <P>The task force decided at an early stage there was a need to prepare two separate reports.  The first report concentrates on the problem of heroin abuse, the aspect of the drugs crisis requiring the most urgent and immediate response.  While heroin abuse is almost exclusively a Dublin problem, abuse of ecstasy and cannabis is occurring on a nationwide basis.  This is also a cause for concern.  The pattern and extent of drug misuse can alter quickly and there is a real risk that use of these so-called &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; drugs can in time lead to a heroin problem in areas where it does not currently exist.  In view of this, we will prepare a separate report on this issue.  In our second report we will look at the demand for drugs in prisons and the treatment of prisoners <Col N="1684" /> who misuse drugs, a vital aspect of the problem which also needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>In attempting to analyse the extent not only of the heroin problem but of the misuse of drugs generally, the task force was struck by the lack of concrete data available on the subject.  This problem is common to all countries with a drugs problem, reflecting the illegality of the activity.  It is absolutely essential that we have valid, definitive information on the scale and prevalence of drug misuse.  This data is necessary to accurately quantify the extent of the problem, to assist in targeting the drugs services, thereby ensuring an appropriate mix is provided, to monitor the progress and effectiveness of these services, to undertake epidemiological research and to help determine the appropriate level of Exchequer funding for the drugs services.</P>
    <P>We are tackling the data problem and each health board is setting up an information database in its area of operation.  In our report we strongly recommend that these databases be put in place as quickly as possible and that they be compatible with each other.  An effective exchange of information between health boards is particularly important in the context of establishing early warning systems on new or emerging trends of drugs misuse.  The immediate problem is large scale, yet localised and area based, and the immediate response must also be a prioritised area based one.</P>
    <P>Based on the data available to us and the information provided by statutory, voluntary and community agencies the task force has identified a number of areas where it considers the heroin problem to be particularly acute.  Almost all of these areas are in the greater Dublin region &mdash; the exception being north Cork city &mdash; where the potential exists for a serious heroin problem to develop.  Preventative measures have been recommended.  The demand for heroin in these areas, while obviously related to the pattern of supply, is primarily a reflection of the underlying pattern of disadvantage and social exclusion which characterises these areas.  Those who are poor, who often have limited educational aspirations and very limited employment prospects and who live in a depressing physical environment are likely to be vulnerable to drugs which, at least initially, may seem to offer escape and excitement.  This is particularly the case when family and personal difficulties compound the social problems.  Given a ready supply of drugs, such communities are likely to produce a number of heroin abusers who, in turn, are likely to become small time suppliers to finance their habit.  A cycle of drug abuse is likely to stem from this, thereby further compounding the employment and environmental difficulties of these communities.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the majority of families and young people living in even the most seriously drug affected areas are not drug misusers.  In the vast majority of cases the people living in these areas are seeking better lives for <Col N="1685" /> themselves and their children and take legitimate pride in the strengths of their communities.  This is enhanced by the vast range of voluntary and community efforts in these areas.  However, it is easy to understand how a community may feel overwhelmed by the scale of the drugs problem and the threat which it poses to its young people.</P>
    <P>Many of these communities have felt compelled to take direct action to deal with the drugs problem in their areas.  Given what has been perceived as the absence of a clear and convincing response from the public authorities to date, it is understandable that communities may tend to find heart in resorting to such action. However, by leaving the root causes of drug addiction untouched this action is ultimately futile.  Given the firm commitment of the Government to tackle the problem, we need the full support and involvement of communities in implementing the findings of this report.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I welcome the recent initiative by the Garda Commissioner in redeploying extra gardaí in the worst drugs affected areas.  It is important that local communities and the Garda work in partnership to deal with the problem of pushers in their area, many of whom are the victims of drugs and are only engaging in this activity to feed their habit.</P>
    <P>The Government has adopted all of the recommendations made in the first report and has allocated an additional £14 million towards their implementation.  A sum of £10 million has been earmarked for service development in the 11 selected areas where the drugs crisis, particularly the problem of heroin abuse, is most acute.  A sum of £3 million is being allocated towards local estate improvement measures as set out in the report while a further £1 million is being set aside for specific anti-drug projects in health board regions outside of the priority areas in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>In addition, new structures are being developed to ensure that the drugs problem is tackled in a more coherent and integrated manner.  A Cabinet drugs committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, will give overall political leadership in the fight against drugs.  A new national drugs strategy team will report directly to the Cabinet committee and will be responsible for ensuring that the Government's anti-drugs strategy is implemented effectively.  Structures are being put in place in the areas most ravaged by the drugs menace. They are being designed to ensure the relevant statutory agencies work in partnership with voluntary and community groups in delivering the most appropriate mix of services to tackle the drugs problem in priority areas.</P>
    <P>It is essential for communities to be positively involved in all aspects of the fight against drug abuse.  The task force is particularly anxious that they play a full role in the demand reduction strategies developed in our report.  Community involvement was referred to in many of the submissions received by the task force and this is perhaps best reflected in the submission from the <Col N="1686" /> Combat Poverty Agency, an extract from which has been reproduced on page 13 of our report.  In its submission the Combat Poverty Agency emphasised that local groups and individuals have a very valuable contribution to make to the development of a national drugs policy.  Having being involved in tackling the drugs problem in their respective areas for a number of years they have built up considerable and valuable experience which should be tapped as a resource. The task force wholeheartedly endorses this view.</P>
    <P>There is unanimous agreement among all those involved in fighting the drugs scourge that programmes to reduce the demand for drugs must consist of a comprehensive and co-ordinated package, comprising treatment, rehabilitation and prevention.  The task force has made concrete and practical recommendations in all of these areas.  It has set the ambitious target of eliminating the waiting lists for methadone maintenance during 1997.  It is estimated there are approximately 2,500 heroin addicts who need and are willing to undergo methadone maintenance. The target of eliminating the waiting list is an ambitious one but, having discussed the matter with a team of key officials from the Eastern Health Board, the task force is confident it is achievable on current estimates of the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>Increased availability of a service can uncover a latent demand for it.  The success the Eastern Health Board is achieving in treating those presenting may well lead to an increase in the number of people seeking that service.  While this would naturally have implications for the target of eliminating waiting lists by the end of 1997, I would welcome such a development.  Any increase in the numbers presenting for and receiving treatment must signify a corresponding decrease in the number of &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo; addicts on our streets.  The target is the elimination of waiting lists and I am determined that this target will be achieved.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in resources &mdash; in financial and staffing terms &mdash; in the Eastern Health Board's drugs service in recent years.  A total of £9 million has been allocated in the current year, compared with £4.5 million last year.  In 1992, only £1 million was made available.  During the same period the number of staff involved in the drugs service increased from 53 to 230.  In the current year alone, the board expects to place in excess of 1,000 drug misusers on methadone maintenance.</P>
    <P>Communities can and must play an important role in the treatment of addicts.  The task force has concluded that locally based treatment and outreach programmes provide the most effective response to the needs of addicts.  There have, of course, been difficulties in establishing such treatment clinics.  In many instances, this may have resulted from the understandable, but unfounded, fears of local communities about what is involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> These communities need to be reassured that locally based clinics will operate to the highest professional standards, that they will form part of a coherent, overall strategy to deal with the drugs problem in the area and that they will be involved in its design and delivery.  The task force has been assured by the Eastern Health Board that it will fully consult and involve local communities in planning any proposed treatment facilities in their localities.</P>
    <P>As well as bringing the treatment waiting lists under control, we must also assist stabilised misusers in their rehabilitation and reintegration into the community.  The success achieved to date in treating drug misusers means that this is an issue which needs to be addressed in the short rather than the long term.  The Eastern Health Board has drawn the task force's attention to the success of the Soilse and Saol projects which operate in Dublin's north inner city and which the board believes should be replicated in other areas.  The task force fully endorses this view.</P>
    <P>I am delighted my Department has taken a specific initiative in assisting in the rehabilitation of stabilised or former misusers back into the community.  In future, priority status will be given to community employment applications offering work experience or training for recovering or former addicts and, in this regard, FÁS and the local employment service will work closely with voluntary and community organisations to develop suitable projects.  There is no doubt that prevention is an area we must address vigorously if we are to successfully overcome our drugs problem.  During this debate, my colleagues on the task force, Ministers of State, Deputies Allen, O'Shea, Currie, Mitchell, McManus and Durkan, will have an opportunity to show how prevention measures in areas such as estate management, local development, youth and sports programmes can contribute to a reduction in the demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>I will draw the House's attention to the measures recommended in our report which deal with education.  The Government supports these recommendations, which place particular emphasis on early intervention and envisage the education partners &mdash; the boards of management, teachers and parents &mdash; working together in the design and delivery of fully piloted and properly evaluated anti-drugs programmes in our schools. Our proposals further envisage the appointment of additional home-school liaison officers and teacher counsellors, an expansion of that scheme and the provision of appropriate training for those delivering the anti-drugs programmes.  I am particularly hopeful that these measures will make a significant impact on the problem, especially in the areas we have identified for priority action.</P>
    <P>The commitment to overcome the drugs problem must extend to the highest political level.  For this reason we recommended the establishment of a Cabinet drugs committee, <Col N="1688" /> chaired by the Taoiseach, to give overall political leadership in the fight against drugs.  This committee has been established and comprises the Ministers for Health, Justice, Education and the Environment, as well as myself.  The Cabinet committee will oversee implementation of the proposals in this report, review trends in the drugs problem, assess progress in the strategy to deal with its supply and demand aspects and resolve policy or organisational problems which may inhibit an effective response from the statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy team, the majority of whose membership was approved by Government yesterday, will report directly to the Cabinet committee.  It will be cross-departmental, the type envisaged in the Strategic Management Initiative.  It will comprise key personnel from the main Departments involved in drugs reduction strategies, as well as representatives from the relevant statutory agencies.  Persons with a suitable background in voluntary and community work in the drugs area are also being invited to participate in the team.</P>
    <P>While responsibility for implementing the individual elements of the Government's anti-drugs strategy will remain with the relevant Ministers and their Departments, the team will ensure that the overall strategy is implemented effectively and in line with Government policy. While members of the team will remain officers of their existing Departments, they will be instructed to take an overview of the requirements of the Government's strategy.</P>
    <P>Apart from ensuring that the structures at national level are ready to meet the challenges presented by drug misuse, the task force was anxious to ensure that appropriate structures were put in place at regional and local levels.  At regional level, the co-ordinating committees which are being established in each health board area are the most appropriate structure to ensure a coherent anti-drugs strategy.  At local level, a new approach is needed.  Special emphasis must be placed on those areas worst affected by the drugs problem, and in particular the heroin problem.  The approach must bring together all relevant local agencies &mdash; statutory, voluntary and community &mdash; to ensure they work in tandem in fighting the drugs problem in their respective areas.  For this reason, we recommended the establishment of local drugs task forces in each of the identified priority areas.  These task forces will comprise representatives of relevant agencies, such as the health board, the gardaí, the probation and welfare service and the relevant local authority, with community representatives and a chairperson to be nominated by the local partnership company.  The relevant health boards have already been requested to nominate co-ordinators, whose job it will be to convene the first meeting of the task forces and assist them in their work thereafter.</P>
    <P>The days of turning a blind eye to a serious national problem are over.  We now have a <Col N="1689" /> Government and a policy that acknowledges the problem, recognises its seriousness, is committed to fighting it, has put enormous public resources at the disposal of the relevant authorities and has put new structures in place to ensure that we will never again turn a blind eye to marginalised communities, leaving them to fend for themselves.  I am firmly convinced that effective State action, in partnership with the local communities affected, can seriously tackle the drugs problem over time, can help rebuild these communities, enhance and improve their physical and social infrastructures and revitalise them economically.  We are now in a position to pursue the great purpose of politics, to tackle underprivilege and marginalisation, equalise opportunity and enhance the lives of all our citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent months the spotlight has shone on the subculture of organised crime and the drugs trade to which it is inextricably linked.  Over decades we have come to believe that horrific deeds are carried out in other jurisdictions and that major tragedies linked to organised crime occur in the big cities of the world.  We have become accustomed to expecting such crimes to happen everywhere but at home.  Times have changed.  We live in a time when drugs are regarded by many as an acceptable form of social evil.  Organised gangs, particularly in Dublin, are increasingly well armed.  Contract killings have spiralled in Dublin over the past two years.  Heroin, ecstasy, LSD, cannabis and cocaine generate big money for drug barons and dealers, are a source of addiction for the users and have become a scourge on society, specifically on victims of crime.  It is estimated that there are in excess of 5,000 heroin addicts in Dublin, although the Minister of State puts the figure at around 8,000.  It is an incidence of addiction which is higher per person than in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drug dealing and drug use is not solely an urban phenomenon.  Rural communities have not escaped the tentacles of the drugs problem and its many consequences.  The drug scene is a network of needs &mdash; peer pressure which creates a code of silence, ruthless exploitation and constant criminal pressure to maintain profitable areas or gain new turf.  It is connected to every age group and social class.  Courts are compelled daily to release on bail heroin addicts whose addiction costs them upwards of £200 per day. Approximately 80 per cent of serious crime in Dublin city is drug-related.  The 1995 Garda Síochána annual report clearly illustrates the scale of the drugs problem.  Seizures included 95 kilograms of cannabis in Cork, two tonnes of cannabis resin in Dublin Port, 40,000 ecstasy tablets in Santry and 13 tonnes of cannabis in Urlingford.  These are startling statistics, especially when one takes into account that only between 10 and 15 per cent of imported illegal drugs are seized annually.  The vast majority of <Col N="1690" /> addictions can only be fed through theft, violence and robbery.  It is estimated that an addict would have to steal upwards of £500 worth of goods in order to secure £100 for drugs.  Crime, the inseparable by-product of addiction, has become endemic.  Directly or indirectly everyone has been affected.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne can impress the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in the rarefied atmosphere of the DL meeting rooms.</P>
      <P>This is not an exaggeration.  In a fanfare of publicity in July 1995, the Government announced a so-called comprehensive drugs package.  A year later it has produced this document having muddled around behind closed doors for a considerable period.  Only the horrific murders of a garda and a journalist galvanised this Government into a semblance of action. When the Minister for Justice finally announced her long awaited intention to introduce legislation to deal with drug traffickers and stepped away from being photographed at various launches and Garda finds, Fianna Fáil indicated its support, long before the Labour Party or Democratic Left gave their reluctant and begrudging assent.</P>
      <P>When it comes to fighting drugs the attitude adopted on these benches is governed by the question &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;.  Why not give the Garda new powers of arrest and detention?  Why not have a court system to facilitate the speedy disposal of drugs cases?  Why not have an effective system to seize the proceeds of drug trafficking?  While the Government failed to show any serious intent in the fight against crime and drugs, Fianna Fáil introduced ten Bills in this House with a view to allaying the genuine fears of people in the face of what is seen as an alarming drugs and crime wave and clear deficiencies in the criminal justice system.</P>

      <P>This Government has not facilitated those addicts who wish to pursue a course of voluntary detoxification.  It has not provided residential and treatment facilities or attempted to properly educate young people about the danger of drugs.  It has singularly failed to provide training and retraining facilities for recovering addicts and has not improved or refined existing laws or instituted new reforming legislation.  It has not provided for sufficient prison capacity, reformed the bail laws or provided adequate resources.  The list goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inadequate, poorly funded, ill thought out and managed methadone maintenance treatment centre, for example, is not a sufficient response. The seriousness of the problem is best illustrated by evidence given before the sub-committee on drugs of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security by Dr. John O'Connor of the National Drug Treatment Centre.  He appeared before the <Col N="1692" /> sub-committee on 15 May 1996 and presented statistics on the operation of the treatment centre since 1995.  He said the total number of patients in July 1995 was 494 and the total number of new patients at that date was 96.  He advised the committee that the majority of patients treated by the centre were teenagers or in their early twenties.  He stated categorically that HIV entered the drug abusing population in the mid-1980s and of the 1,589 who tested HIV positive in September 1995 more than 48 per cent, 773 individuals, were drug misusers.  That gives some idea of the scale of the problem with which we are now faced.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was extremely critical of some individual who described this Government as being long on aspirations but short on specifics. There is credence to that argument.  Those afflicted with drug addiction cannot hope to escape from the cycle of death unless they are taught and encouraged to assume responsibility for their actions.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis methadone maintenance and harm minimisation are secondary and residual approaches.  An inter-agency approach to drug abuse must stress to each individual throughout the treatment provided the absolute necessity for them to accept responsibility for their actions and lives.  In the search to help addicts escape from their addiction it must be recognised that without acceptance of some personal responsibility for their recovery, the best help is unlikely to succeed.</P>
    <P>My party is at a very advanced stage in formulating the mechanics to achieve the objective of making the individual, his self-worth, self-esteem, dignity and responsibility perennial in the fight against addiction.  Our approach will involve a radical interlocking approach to drug abuse to provide a continuous and seamless national programme in the fight against drug abuse.  The overriding Fianna Fáil approach will put the emphasis on prevention, detoxification, rehabilitation, training and retraining.</P>
    <P>The current methadone maintenance treatment programme is voluntary and unreliable.  As recommended by many experts in the field, there should be a central compulsory notification system to which every doctor treating an addict must subscribe under law.  There is unquestionably a clear need for greater co-operation, co-ordination and an expansion of the rehabilitative services.  A replication of the co-operation, which exists, for example, in Dublin's north inner city and throughout the city, would make a major contribution to tackling drug addiction, not only from a health but a social viewpoint.</P>
    <P>While genuinely welcoming the first report of the ministerial task force announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the debate it has generated, the level of funding outlined in the Government report lends credence to the view that the entire exercise is more cosmetic than real.  The Government's fire <Col N="1693" /> brigade response to a problem which is escalating out of control will come as no surprise to those of us who daily monitor the hop, skip and jump approach of the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>If there comes a time when the citizens feel obliged to take the law into their own hands, then the State has failed the people. Vigilantism is something every democrat and every person who upholds the rule of law and due process must condemn but, unfortunately, it is becoming a feature of the city of Dublin.  That is something to be deplored.  It also serves as a very serious warning to all democrats.  People believe the Government is failing and because of that they will take the law into their own hands.  That is an extremely serious challenge to every democratic institution in this State and it requires a serious response.  It should not have come to this, but it has.  There must be recognition across the political spectrum at local and national level that we are facing a problem which is beginning to escalate out of control and we require serious and radical measures to combat it.</P>
      <P>That is why in July of this year I introduced on behalf of my party one of the most draconian Bills ever to come before the House.  It provided that the court could freeze assets, and subsequently dispose of them if, in the opinion of a Revenue Commissioner or a Chief Superintendent of the Garda Síochána, they were the proceeds of crime.  That was unquestionably an interference with the right to private property. It was a delimitation of the right to private property in the interests of the common good. There may well be a need for further radical draconian measures which will delimit rights, once regarded as sacrosanct, in the interests of the common good.  I take no pleasure in having to say that but recent events here oblige me to say it.</P>
      <P>Who, in this Government of so-called openness, transparency and accountability, will accept responsibility for the unhindered open dealing in illicit drugs which appears to take place on every second street corner?  Who will accept responsibility for the chronic waiting lists at drug treatment clinics?  Who will accept responsibility for the &ldquo;head in the sand&rdquo; policy the Government has pursued in our escalating drugs problem during the last two years?</P>

      <P>A Government which is out of touch is the last thing the country needs in this struggle against an appalling problem which threatens to engulf the fabric of our society.  In his address to the Dáil the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, proclaimed that not only had huge consignments of drugs been confiscated but we are now able to hit the crime lords where it hurts them most, through the seizure of their ill-gotten wealth.  The Minister must be still dozing behind the darkened windows of his State Mercedes because he is actually boasting about and claiming credit for Fianna Fail legislation.  We have become accustomed to the Government's plagiarisation programme but it should at least acknowledge our lead.</P>
      <P>We agree with the Minister that there is no case for the legalisation of drugs.  Claims that legalisation will reduce crime are false; the Netherlands, which decriminalised penal possession of drugs, now has the highest drug-related rate of criminality in Europe.  Drugs are illegal because they are dangerous.  They are not dangerous because they are illegal.</P>

      <P>...it is for this reason that the Irish Presidency of the European Union has sought to prioritise action at EU and local levels.  We have seen some major successes on this front in the last few years and months.</P>
      <P>Only last week his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, derided the amount of funds being made available for the fight against drugs by the EU.  Will someone in this lacklustre Government say which of them is talking gibberish?  Not for the first time &mdash; nor, I predict, for the last &mdash; the evidence points at Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; the roulette ball stops at this Minister.  No progress has been made in the formation of a European coastguard and the Minister does not list the major successes at EU level.  Small wonder that he does not, for there were none.</P>
      <P>In short, the Government has failed dismally and abysmally to make drugs a central issue in the course of its Presidency of the European Union.  This is another broken promise and another jaded monument to the penury of a Government which is on its last legs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to make whatever changes are necessary in the rules of the national lottery to avoid a position similar to last Saturday, when £1 million was added to an already obscenely large jackpot of £3.8 million, which has since risen to £7 million.  Many small clubs and organisations are in the extremely difficult position of having to raise funds against a major national body.  On the bank holiday, the national lottery unnecessarily added £1 million to its prize fund.  If the jackpot had been £500,000 one could have excused the addition of extra money to encourage punters, but when it was £3.826 million there was no excuse.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago many clubs and community groups were looking forward to support from the small sports allocations.  County Monaghan received the massive sum of £23,000; four clubs benefited and many others were disappointed.  If the Minister of State responsible for sport had been given £1 million to spread nationally, at least four more clubs in Monaghan could have been supported.</P>
      <P>The Phoenix leisure centre in Carrickmacross has been under construction for donkeys' years. It received two small national lottery allocations but it is a white elephant, in a town which is trying to do well in the Tidy Towns competition and provide sports facilities for its young people. What would £250,000 &mdash; one quarter of the extra £1 million &mdash; have meant for that centre?  Sister celine has ten flats and a number of houses to provide shelter for the homeless in Castleblayney. When she looks for national lottery funds there are always reasons she does not meet the criteria. Yet the national lottery adds £1 million to the already inflated jackpot.  What difference would it make to win £4.82 million as opposed to £3.82 million?  The extra £1 million would not make much difference to the winner but it could make a difference to many projects.</P>
      <P>Other groups try to raise funds through ticket sales.  Rehab, for example, provides an excellent service in giving training to the handicapped and others, but its lottery is capped.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Finance to remove the cap from the other charities which need the freedom to give proper prize money to fund their much needed projects?  Perhaps she could do so herself, which would be all the better. Representatives of Rehab and many other organisations try to sell lottery or raffle tickets but they must compete against the national lottery.  We want a common sense approach but there is none at present.</P>
      <P>This coming weekend, many people will spend money from social welfare and other sources which is needed for their families, with the idea that the jackpot will solve their problems.  I hope that whoever wins the £7 million gives at least some of it to worthy causes and makes proper use of the rest of it does not do him or her any harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national lottery was established to raise money for a large number of socially desirable programmes in areas such as youth and sport, the arts, health and welfare and the Irish language.  The Government is anxious to ensure the ongoing viability of the national lottery to safeguard this important source of income and the projects assisted by lottery moneys.  National lottery funded expenditure will amount to approximately £88 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>Research carried out by the national lottery company has shown that occasional large jackpots are popular with players.  They help to sustain player interest in lotto and encourage new players to participate.  They thus help to ensure the ongoing success of the game.</P>
      <P>Approximately one third of lottery turnover goes directly to the beneficiary fund.  Occasional large jackpots lead to increased sales and these sales are ultimately reflected in the resources available for the many community, sporting and other groups which are in receipt of lottery funds. Accordingly, any increased buoyancy in lottery sales has an impact also on the returns to the community from the beneficiary fund.  For the current roll-over sequence the national lottery has had total sales up to yesterday Wednesday, 30 October of £19.7 million.  This sequence alone will have added more than £6 million to the beneficiary fund.</P>
      <P>The national lottery, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, supplements the natural jackpot at regular intervals throughout the year in a number of ways, including adding £1 million to the jackpot or offering a free second draw with a total prize fund of £1 million.  This variety adds to the appeal of the game.  The enhanced jackpots are offered for the main bank holiday weekends.</P>
      <P>In regard to the £1 million added to the jackpot last Saturday, owing to the scheduling constraints of advertising and other practical considerations it is necessary for the national lottery company to arrange for publicity for the enhanced jackpots before the results of the draw on the Wednesday immediately preceding the holiday draw are known.  In the case of the enhanced jackpot on Saturday, 26 October posters were designed, distributed and on display in national lottery retail outlets from Monday, 21 October.  It would have been impractical to inform players efficiently of the details of the Saturday draw if the lottery company had to wait until after the results of the Wednesday draw were known.  It may be of interest to Deputies to know that from a statistical point of view there was a 75 per cent chance of finding a winner for the draw on Wednesday, 23 October, the draw immediately preceding the addition of the £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that another underlying issue of concern to the Deputy is the question of the desirability of capping the jackpot.  There is essentially no difference between a roll-over <Col N="1698" /> sequence producing a large jackpot and the same jackpot being produced as a result of the addition of £1 million for a holiday weekend.  Roll-overs and super jackpots are elements of the 6/42 lotto game.  The question of capping the jackpot has been considered from time to time.  It is important to appreciate that the lotto game is by its nature jackpot driven.  While a £6 million jackpot represents a significant amount of money, universal lottery experience proves that the bigger the size of the jackpot the greater the number of players.  In the run up to the previous record jackpot five weeks ago the national lottery had an estimated 1.7 million players for a £3.5 million jackpot.  To put a cap or ceiling on the size of lotto jackpots would run the risk of undermining public interest in participation and could well jeopardise the long-term success of the game.  There is little doubt that such a policy would lead to significantly lower sales and a consequently reduced amount available for the beneficiary funds.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the national lottery reviews the prize structure of the lotto game on an ongoing basis in the light of experience, market research on player preferences and public opinion generally.  The Deputy's views have been conveyed by me to the company.  In view of the position as outlined however I do not think it would be appropriate for me to request the national lottery company to change the existing practice in regard to occasional supplements to the lotto jackpots or to seek to cap the jackpot.</P>
    <P>On the point referred to by the Deputy relating to the capping of other charitable lotteries, I would draw his attention to the recent debate in this House on that matter and the amount received from the beneficiary fund in County Monaghan, a matter which prefixed the Deputy's remarks.  The Minister for Finance is about to issue clearer, more transparent guidelines on applying for and allocating of funds under the lottery rules &mdash; an announcement was made in that regard in recent days.  That should help clarify the basis of success in some cases and lack of success in others in terms of applying for money from the beneficiary fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Advances in medicine and in preventative health care have made important differences to health and health care, and none more so than cervical screening for women. Today we are able to prevent a disease which has been the silent killer of many women in the past. From the records of the national cancer registry, 170 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1994, a salutary reminder of the number of women affected by this avoidable disease in just one year.  Cervical cancer is the third most important health concern for women, the first being breast cancer and the second pregnancy and child birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> Cervical screening is a relatively new concept and it has taken time to bring home to women the message that a painless, simple test can save their lives.  Lack of information, squeamishness or embarrassment have inhibited the take-up by women of screening services, but one of the major inhibitors in the past has been cost.  It is very welcome that women now have access to screening without having to pay for it, or having to pay only for the taking of the smear.  This is a wise long-term investment in women's health.  In the context of the forthcoming national women's health plan I hope it is the forerunner of many similar initiatives which will give women more opportunities to protect their health.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at recent reports that the cervical screening system is experiencing long delays in delivering results to women.  Perhaps this is a result of the success of the initiative, with a greater number of women coming forward for screening because it is free.  There is however little point in taking such initiatives if investment is not made to deal with the consequence.  I am very concerned that women coming forward for screening, with a certain amount of understandable trepidation, have to wait up to 12 weeks for their results.  Is this a phenomenon that applies to all screening?  I hope a two tiered system has not evolved in such a new service where women who continue to pay for screening can get results quickly while results for women screened through the free service are delayed. There should be no such distinction.  Since women without resources were those least likely to have smears in the past, bringing them into the screening process is vitally important for their health care.</P>
    <P>If delays continue or the position deteriorates further the numbers coming forward will drop because of anxiety about the screening process allied with the long delay in getting results.  We have a long way to go to ensure that all women as a matter of course are screened regularly.  It is essential that adequate facilities are in place for trained personnel to give speedy and accurate test results.  I do not know whether targets are set by the Department of Health or the medical profession, but as a consumer I believe that women should not have to wait longer than two weeks for their results.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the delays as a matter of urgency and ensure that steps are taken to reduce the time period.  I also ask that the Department set a standard so that consumers are clear when they go for screening that they will receive their results within a reasonable time. These steps are necessary to ensure that we build an effective screening service which is structured in such a way that women have great confidence in it and see it as accessible and supportive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this very important issue and giving me <Col N="1700" /> the opportunity to respond.  I am aware that there is a delay in the reporting of cervical smear tests in St. Luke's hospital.  A backlog of smears has built up since January 1995 when the cervical smear laboratory charge was removed.  At present an opportunistic, as opposed to an organised, cervical screening service is available to all women through their general practitioners, family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and special clinics in health boards.  This has resulted in a demand-led service and, in the case of St. Luke's hospital, an increase in smears being analysed. This has brought the overall volume of smears for analysis well over the limit which is manageable under present staffing and resource levels.  The capacity of the laboratory is approximately 30,000 and this year it is expected that the number of smears to be analysed will be in the region of 40,000.</P>
      <P>The backlog in St. Luke's hospital is, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, approximately 12 weeks for routine screening.  The hospital management has stressed, however, that urgent or special cases are dealt with immediately.  The hospital has reached agreement with staff to carry out additional work to reduce the backlog by at least 50 per cent by the end of the year.  It is also looking at other options in the short term to eliminate the backlog and intends to provide additional space and facilities so that it will be in a position to cope with additional smear test workloads in the future.</P>
      <P>My Department carried out an analysis of the cervical screening system in 1995 and there has been a notable increase in the number of smear tests being analysed in most publicly funded laboratories relative to previous years.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to address specific issues in relation to cancer services.  Cancer was identified in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, as one of the three major causes of mortality in the under 65 age group. The strategy set a target of reducing the death rate from cancer in this age group by 15 per cent in the ten year period from 1994.  The Minister is preparing a national cancer strategy which will be published as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I hope to receive a commitment from my political colleagues, statutory bodies and the Government in particular to support my call for the establishment of a task force, comprising elected public representatives, community workers and representatives of voluntary and statutory agencies, to address in a cohesive way the economic and social problems confronting residential communities in Dublin's north and south inner city.  All that divides them is the river Liffey, what unites them is concentrated long-term unemployment, widespread drug abuse, environmental degradation and physical decay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For far too long an integrated response to these <Col N="1701" /> problems has been hampered by artificial divisions between communities in north and south inner city areas.  What I am proposing is the establishment of a task force, comprising elected public representatives in the constituencies of Dublin South Central, Dublin South East, Dublin Central and Dublin North Central as well as community workers and activists and representatives of the relevant statutory and voluntary agencies, which would be mandated to develop an integrated response to the problems confronting these areas which include Cork Street and Dolphin's Barn on the south side and Summerhill and Sheriff Street on the north side. It would focus primarily on combating long-term unemployment with the help of programmes such as the local employment service programmes and similar initiatives.  It would also be mandated to make recommendations on matters such as urban renewal, environmental improvements and so on.</P>
    <P>The time has come to view the inner city as being at the centre of our capital city rather than on its economic and social margins.  Much has been done in the sphere of urban renewal.  I pay particular tribute to my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus.  Far more must be done however.  Cork Street, in my constituency of Dublin South Central, is, as everybody knows, in an advanced state of decay and has been left in a planning limbo for over four decades.  The same applies to large parts of North King Street on the other side of the Liffey, although the development of Smithfield Village may help reverse this.</P>
    <P>While gigantic shopping centres modelled on the American mall style continue to spring up in areas such as Tallaght and Blanchardstown, there is a need to regenerate traditional shopping areas such as Thomas Street, Meath Street and Capel Street.  The welcome developments on the quays need to be consolidated and integrated into the economic and social life of Dublin's inner city.</P>
    <P>The inner city has much going for it.  It has vibrant and creative communities with a built environment which has not yet gone beyond the point of rescue.  Co-operation may be the key to combating the problems confronting these areas.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for making the case on behalf of Dublin's inner city areas about which he expressed concern.  I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's approach to tackling the unemployment problem and how it will relate to these areas.</P>
      <P>Long-term unemployment is a major problem. While other OECD countries are also experiencing this problem, it is true that Ireland suffers from an exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment and had the highest long-term unemployment rate in the OECD in 1991. This scenario was the background to the report of the National Economic and Social Forum in June 1994, entitled <i>Ending Long-Term Unemployment.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> That report considered in detail the problem of long-term unemployment which has beset this country for several years.  It also presented a number of submissions and examples as to how the problem might be addressed.  It was a significant contribution to the debate, particularly on two fronts.  The forum concluded that the only appropriate target with respect to long-term unemployment was its elimination.  It put forward a central recommendation that a national, comprehensive, locally-based employment service should be put in place.  The service would have particular responsibility for implementing the two strategies of preventing long-term unemployment and reintegrating the long-term unemployed back into employment.</P>
    <P>I accept that Dublin's north and south inner city areas have suffered serious disadvantages going back several years.  Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, is a serious problem.  The Government is aware of the effects of this problem on the communities concerned. Long-term unemployment holds back any chance of the communities developing while individuals and families suffering long-term unemployment experience obstacles in gaining access to opportunities in education, work and an adequate income.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the reality has prompted action on a number of fronts to attack the problem.  The Dublin Inner City Partnership was set up in 1991 to address the problems of Dublin's inner city.  The partnership draws together the social partners, local communities and State agencies.  It was one of the first partnerships to be established and has drawn up an action plan to the year 2000 aimed at improving the inner city's environment, investment prospects and job opportunities for the residents.  It is one of the areas chosen for the implementation of a local employment service.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in February 1995 to establish the local employment service in 14 key areas.  The details of how the service would operate were set out in the interim report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment in February 1995.  This service for the unemployed in Dublin's inner city, covering an area roughly between the Royal and Grand Canals, will be an important contribution to the efforts to alleviate the problem of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the service will aim to plug the following gaps where they arise in services for the unemployed: the absence of an effective guidance and counselling service; an information deficit on the range of services available; a comprehensive registration service and database; an active placement service to liaise with employers; an after placement assistance service; a planned progression path and effective co-ordination of services combining a clear delineation of roles with effective co-operation and delivery.</P>
    <P>The service is now up and running in Dublin's inner city.  While it is early days yet in the <Col N="1703" /> provision of the various services, I am confident that it is the best way forward to assist the unemployed and in keeping with the recommendation of the National Economic and Social Forum.  The area is fortunate in having many professional and dedicated individuals involved in this service.</P>
    <P>In addition to the local employment service, there are a number of measures specifically aimed at assisting the unemployed to return to the labour force.  Community employment projects are making significant improvements in Dublin's inner city through a wide range of work areas such as the environment, community and caring services, schools, community placement services, arts, heritage, tourism and sports.  The community employment scheme is acting as an important vehicle for economic and social development within the inner city area where there is an agreed annual plan drawn up between FÁS and the Dublin Inner City Partnership.</P>
    <P>Arising from recommendations in the Task Force Report on Long-Term Unemployment it has been decided that community employment will become more focused on the long-term unemployed.  This move will benefit many such persons in the Dublin inner city area.  Since April of this year community employment has taken the form of two options, the integration option and the work option.</P>
    <P>The job initiative programme was launched in July 1996.  It will provide full-time work for three years at the going rate of pay with local &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo; sponsors.  The objective of the job initiative is to provide direct employment to those among the long-term unemployed for whom access to the labour market is extremely limited now and in the foreseeable future.  At the same time it is to provide useful work which can have a significant impact on local development in confined urban areas which have extremely weak local labour markets.  Persons eligible for the job initiative include those living in the Dublin Inner City Partnership as well as four other partnerships in Dublin-Tallaght, Ballymun, Coolock-Darndale-Kilbarrack and Finglas-Cabra.</P>
    <P>Workplace was launched at the end of May 1996 and is a work experience programme which provides up to five weeks placement with employers in the private, public, voluntary or community sectors.  It focuses on persons who are six months unemployed and who are considered &ldquo;employment ready&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Jobstart is a recruitment subsidy for employers which was launched at the end of May 1996.  A Jobstart subsidy of £80 per week is paid to the employer in respect of 52 weeks continuous employment of eligible Jobstart participants.</P>
    <P>Other FÁS activities include developmental training, employment support services and industry training for the unemployed.  In addition, the Government has introduced special measures for 18 to 19 year olds and various schemes which <Col N="1704" /> allow for the retention of certain benefits for those returning to work.</P>
    <P>The job creation agencies have performed very well in recent years and during 1995 IDA Ireland, Forbairt and the county enterprise boards created approximately 8,500 jobs in the Dublin City and county area.  These opportunities are most welcome and make the training/labour market schemes all the more vital so that the long-term unemployed can be helped to compete for these jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government decided in April 1996 that the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development should be asked to prepare a report for the Government which would identify those areas of Dublin where long-term unemployment is most severe; establish the present employment opportunities arising in these areas and their immediate vicinity; recommend how the range of incentives to support the transition to work might be promoted to encourage employment creation and recruitment in these blackspots; and recommend other measures which might be taken to encourage employment creation benefiting such areas.  Work is continuing towards finalising that report.</P>
    <P>I mention all of these initiatives to illustrate the seriousness with which the Government views the problem of long-term unemployment.  There is no real need for yet another special task force as sought by the Deputy.  The practical, on the ground assistance being given to the unemployed by a range of State agencies in the labour market and job creation areas and by voluntary groups, in addition to the action taken by the Government which I have just outlined, will improve the outlook for the unemployed nationally, including Dublin's inner city.  The Government has a clear, strategic approach to dealing with the unemployment problem which is now beginning to bear fruit.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a special plea in the House this evening. I want to talk about a small rural village in the Slievefelim hills which was designated as severely handicapped in the EU schemes in the early 1980s but which is now facing an enormous crisis.  A small saw milling industry was set up in the village which until recently employed 55 people, thirty of them were informed last week that their employment would terminate because of difficulties being faced by the industry.</P>
      <P>This small industry produces wages of £8,500 per week, has a turnover of £50,000 and has purchased £3.3 million worth of timber from Coillte since 1993.  It takes the timber products from Upperchurch in Kilcommin, Rear Cross, Hollyford, Rossmore and all the surrounding areas and it is the only forestry enterprise for a very long distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> Job losses are merely statistics when they are written down on paper but in reality they affect individuals and families.  Loans cannot be repaid and problems experienced by children in school cannot be addressed.  I appeal to the Minister of State for some changes in the way job creation agencies operate to ensure this industry will survive.</P>
    <P>The challenges of new technology are facing this industry.  There is not a great deal of money involved.  This village has virtually no chance of a replacement industry.  The Hollyford district is not far from Tipperary town, already decimated by recent job losses.  The Minister of State is aware that the prospects for many people living in this area of getting any kind of alternative employment are nil.</P>
    <P>This problem will not be solved unless the employment creation agencies are directed to give small grants to fledgling saw milling industries of this kind when they experience difficulties.  It will be necessary to cut out the red tape that can strangle small developments of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I do not have any desire to politicise this matter.  I merely want to help this industry survive and I ask the Minister of State to do whatever is necessary to hold on to an industry that is precious to so many people who struggle to survive in the midst of depopulation and <Col N="1706" /> agricultural crises.  These people are a long distance from universities, hospitals and schools and they are waiting for some sign of hope that this industry will be rescued.  This should not be a deserted village.  It is a small place which has survived many struggles.  I appeal to the agencies of the State to remove their cold hands from the levers which tighten the belts around these areas and help this industry to survive.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Neither I nor the Minister was aware of any difficulties at the company referred to by the Deputy.  We share his concern for the workforce and the impact such problems will have on the local community.  I have made inquiries into the matter with Forbairt and I have been advised that Forbairt has not received any approach from the company.  I have asked Forbairt to pursue inquiries with the company to see if it can offer any assistance in the difficulties outlined by the Deputy.  The Deputy may be assured that Forbairt will provide any advice or assistance it can to the company.  I should point out, however, that neither I nor the Minister has any function in relation to the decisions of the company in the running of its business or in the decisions of the industrial development agencies in relation to any individual company.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 27 and 33 together in so far as they refer to the International Fund for Ireland.  Questions concerning other funds are being answered separately by other Ministers.</P>
      <P>The mandate of the International Fund of Ireland, which was set up in 1986 by the Irish and British Governments, is &ldquo;to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The work of the fund, by the nature of its mandate, involves cross-Border activity. However, since the fund is an independent body, operational matters, including decisions on identifying suitable programmes, their extent and duration, are the responsibility of the board of the fund.  The Deputies might like therefore to pursue any more detailed inquiries directly with the fund.</P>
      <P>As regards the effects of fund moneys on the Border counties since 1994, the total sum involved would come to around £15 million.  This money has been spent across the wide range of programmes which the fund operates.  These include, for example, support for community economic initiatives in disadvantaged towns and villages or on assistance with the development of tourism marketing skills.</P>
      <P>One of the most striking examples of the fund's involvement with cross-Border work is the Shannon-Erne Waterway, now a thriving success, but a project where fund support was crucial from the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this good work of the fund is only possible because its donors &mdash; the EU, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand &mdash; continue to believe in what it is achieving.  A great debt of gratitude is owed to these countries by the people <Col N="1708" /> of Ireland, North and South, for their generous support for the fund over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The Government regard the work of the International Fund for Ireland with the highest esteem.  If confirmation were needed, following a recent lengthy investigation of the fund by a committee of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, the body concluded that it was &ldquo;impressed by the operation and performance of the IFI and the unique and distinctive role it has developed for itself in promoting reconciliation and economic regeneration in the region&rdquo;.  This committee encouraged the two Governments and donors to continue their support for the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning of the peace process the Government has acted on the assumption that substantial elements within Sinn Féin realise that the political differences dividing the people of this island can be resolved only by exclusively peaceful means, and that they are attempting to persuade the remainder of the republican movement to abandon violence as a political tool and espouse an exclusively political path.  That is why we have sought to offer the republican movement an honourable course away from violence and into democratic politics.  It is clear, unfortunately, that there are others within the republican movement who still fail to understand that political violence, apart from being morally indefensible, is totally counter-productive, even in terms of their own objectives.  Any attempt to revert to it or to mix politics and violence will be self-defeating and lead to the isolation which is inevitable for any group which ignores the clear and unmistakable wishes of the people.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the ceasefire was an irresponsible and profoundly mistaken act, and the same applies with cumulative force to all the subsequent atrocities and attempted atrocities. The renewed violence was also a betrayal of all those, including no doubt many honourable individuals within Sinn Féin, who had taken political risks to enable the republican movement as a whole to move away from such actions and to take the peaceful path.  The two Governments have made clear that an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994 and a total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence are needed before Sinn Féin can share in negotiations on the way ahead.  That is the responsible and honourable course for all concerned.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of the &ldquo;Charter for Aid&rdquo; prepared by the El Salvador Support Committee as its contribution to the ongoing debate on the delivery and impact of aid programmes in developing countries.</P>
      <P>The Government's own approach to this subject is outlined in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, Challenges and Opportunities Abroad, and in the strategy plan, Irish Aid Consolidation and Growth.  There is much common ground between the Government's policy document and the Charter for Aid produced by the Irish El Salvador Support Committee.  There is a common concern to ensure that aid contributes to a process of self-reliant development in poor countries.</P>
      <P>The Government encouraged the maximum possible level of public participation in the process leading up to the publication of the white Paper.  Public seminars were held at a number of locations throughout the country.  Written submissions were received from many individuals and organisations, including the Irish El Salvador Support Committee.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the aid policy outlined in the White Paper benefits from recommendations and advice from a wide variety of sources, both domestic and international.  For example, the Government must take account of the results of major international conferences and of the operational aid guidelines of the Development Assistance Committee, DAC, of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  Domestically, we must take account of advice offered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on Developing Countries, the Irish Aid Advisory Committee, IAAC, and nongovernmental organisations, NGOs.  The annual Irish Aid Forum provides a framework to enable all interested parties to become involved in that process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some localised boycotts of business premises have occurred in parts of Northern Ireland, largely in reaction to the widespread blocking of public roads which took place in the period leading up to the Drumcree march.  While there remains a degree of understandable anger in the Nationalist community over the events surrounding Drumcree, such boycotts can only serve to add to the sense of division and distrust which already existed between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  The Government deplores the use of boycotting in Northern Ireland which has a destructive effect on community relations and only serves to damage the economic interests of both sides of the community.  We have repeatedly called for an end to them and I repeat that appeal again.</P>
      <P>There may have been some exaggeration in media reports on the extent and scope of boycotting in Northern Ireland and I am glad to say that there is now some evidence that the boycotts appear to be diminishing.  The Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland, which represents about 1,400 small and medium-sized business concerns, stated on 24 October in the Northern Ireland forum that the boycotts were &ldquo;dying away&rdquo;.  This followed a survey of some of their Border members.  I am sure that an organisation such as the federation, with a large and representative membership, is familiar with what is happening on the ground in relation to the boycotts.  I welcome the federation's finding.</P>
      <P>The Government places a high priority on the need for greater reconciliation between the two communities in Northern Ireland and on the establishment of conditions which will facilitate better cross-community co-operation and agreement.  The unfortunate events of this summer, and their aftermath, have made the promotion of reconciliation even more difficult.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I ask all those who have influence in these matters to use that influence to bring an end to any remaining boycotts of business.  The two main parties in Northern Ireland, the SDLP and the UUP, have called for an end to boycotting and I fully endorse their appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> On the question of any threat to cross-Border trade, I understand there is no evidence to date of any such boycott.  I welcome the strong position taken by the umbrella organisation for businesses in Northern Ireland, CBI (Northern Ireland), against any possible cross-Border boycott.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have supported greater North-South business links in areas such as trade and investment.  I condemn any activity which attempts to hamper the development of greater North-South economic links.  I am delighted at the growing level of North-South trade which rose by 13 per cent last year.  This increased trade has brought economic benefits and increased employment to both sides of the Border and to all sections of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The European Union remains fully committed to the principles outlined in Article 130u of the Treaty on European Union.  The EU's commitment to these principles was clearly stated in the Horizon 2000 Declaration adopted by EU Development Ministers in December 1992.  Title XVII of the Treaty, which deals with development co-operation and includes Article 130u, continues to be a primary point of reference for all EU development policies and programmes.</P>
      <P>Article 130v of the Treaty requires that the objectives referred to in Article 130u shall be taken into account in policies likely to affect developing countries.  In this way the needs of developing countries are recognised and taken into account in the wider policies of the Union.</P>
      <P>The Union budget for 1997 has not yet been finalised, and it is not possible, at this stage, to make exact predictions of the allocations to each budget line.  The final allocations to different regions cannot, therefore, yet be calculated.  This holds true also for successive budget years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest part of Union aid for the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific comes from the European Development Fund.  The amounts to be allocated through this fund are fixed for the next five years, and so funds committed cannot be diverted to other geographical areas.  The funding allocated <Col N="1712" /> under the eighth EDF, from 1996-2000, represents an increase, in ECU terms, of 22 per cent over the allocation under the seventh EDF for the period 1990-95.</P>

      <P>All Deputies have received copies of the document <i>Priorities for the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union</i> which was published at the start of the Presidency last July. This document details the priorities of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union for each Council formation and outlines the programme of issues which we face during our term.  Copies of this document, together with draft agendas for Council meetings, have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>With regard to the programme of events, as I indicated to the House in response to questions on 6 February, 25 March, 30 May, 4 July and 25 July, and in my statement on the Florence European Council and on the Irish Presidency of the European Union on 26 June, three documents have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.  These are: a calendar detailing meetings of the European Council, the Council of Ministers, plenary sessions of the European Parliament, informal meetings of the Council of Ministers and meetings of the Committee of Permanent Representatives; a list of Presidency related meetings in Ireland, identifying the subject matter of each meeting and its location; and the schedule for Intergovernmental Conference related meetings during our Presidency.  These documents are updated regularly and I will continue to lodge updates in the Oireachtas Library on a regular basis during the course of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main priorities of the Irish Presidency remain the Intergovermental Conference, IGC, economic and monetary union, European Monetary Union, EMU, employment and <Col N="1713" /> growth, the fight against crime and the range of external relations issues facing the Union.  All these issues are of direct concern to the citizen.</P>
    <P>For example, the Intergovernmental Conference, for which I have direct competence, aims to bring the European Union closer to its citizens.  The conference is considering strengthening Treaty provisions in areas such as employment and the environment and, in the Justice and Home Affairs area, particular emphasis is being given to the fight against international crime and drug trafficking. Providing for greater transparency and openness in the work of the Union is also being considered. The general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties which the Presidency will submit to the European Council in December will address these concerns in a direct and effective way.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference, European Monetary Union, employment and growth, the fight against crime and external relations issues will be all on the agenda of the Dublin European Council in December.  I am confident that significant progress on the full range of the priorities for the Irish Presidency will be recorded there.  As far as the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, we are on target to provide a general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties as requested by the Florence European Council last June.</P>

      <P>The Government welcomes the ceasefire in northern Iraq between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, PUK, and the Kurdish Democratic Party, KDP, which came into force on 25 October, and the announcement of negotiations between representatives of the two factions which are due to commence in Ankara later this week.  The Government believes that the ceasefire helps to create the conditions that are essential to allow both Kurdish parties to resolve their differences on their own.  We hope the talks will be successful in restoring security and stability to Northern Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined the European Union's position on the situation in northern Iraq in my reply to Deputy Burke's written questions No. 64 of 22 October.  The Union is willing to pursue contacts with the neighbouring countries in the region with a view to reducing tensions in northern Iraq. Partners are also all agreed on the need to ensure that steps are taken to relieve the suffering of the <Col N="1714" /> Iraqi civilian population, and children in particular, through the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 986 which would allow the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for food and medical supplies, and which it is envisaged will enter into force shortly.</P>
    <P>The Union has also been concerned that hostilities between the Kurdish parties will lead to an increase in the number of refugees fleeing northern Iraq.  The Union has undertaken steps to alleviate the humanitarian plight of those refugees who have had to flee their homes as a result of the recent fighting.  The Presidency will continue to monitor closely the humanitarian situation and co-ordinate with its EU partners, and NGOs operating in the area, to assist in alleviating the situation of the Kurdish population.  Ireland's priority, as Presidency of the EU, will be to seek to ensure that the Union's influence leads to the restoration of peace and stability in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 23, 30, 45 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I first wish to repeat my congratulations, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, to Bishop Belo and Mr. Ramos-Horta, on winning the Nobel Prize for Peace.  This award must send a strong signal to the people of East Timor that they are not being forgotten by the international community and be a source of great hope to them that their situation can be improved.</P>
      <P>The policy of the European Union on East Timor is based on the Common Position adopted by the Council of Ministers on 25 June 1996.  In accordance with the terms of that Common Position, Ireland, as Presidency, is actively supporting international efforts to promote respect for human rights and a just and peaceful solution to the East Timor question, which fully respects the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people.</P>
      <P>Ireland has designated East Timor as a priority issue for our Presidency and we are considering with our EU partners appropriate follow-up action on foot of the Common Position.  Such action would largely focus on support for the continuing talks, under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General, between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers, who are due to meet again in December, and on the all-inclusive intra-Timorese dialogue, which is to be convened for a third round early next year. Efforts to promote progress towards a settlement, however, continue to be hampered by serious obstacles.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as President of the Council of Ministers, I have availed of appropriate opportunities, in particular the meetings with Asia and ASEAN countries in Jakarta last July, to focus international attention on the issue of East Timor, and the EU Common Position on the subject.  I have stressed, in particular, the EU's call on the Indonesian Government to adopt effective measures leading to a significant improvement in the human rights situation in East Timor, especially by implementing fully the relevant decisions adopted in this connection by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>The question of an arms embargo on Indonesia by EU member states, for which consensus would be required, will be kept under continuing review by the Irish Presidency in the light of developments in East Timor.  To be effective, an arms embargo would need to be applied universally on the basis of a United Nations resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question about the Norwegian initiative to facilitate talks between the Indonesian Government and the proindependence movement in East Timor, I <Col N="1716" /> understand this refers to the indication by Norway that it would be willing to facilitate the holding of the third round of the intra-Timorese dialogue.  Ireland and its partners in the European Union welcome the continuation of this dialogue.  We are awaiting further information about this meeting, the date of which has not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to a question on 4 July, the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation at my Department, Deputy Joan Burton, has indicated the Government's willingness to make a financial contribution available for further intra-Timorese meetings.</P>

      <Quest>whether the Government supports the Chinese strike-hard campaign which has resulted in the arbitrary detention and disappearance of at least ten dissidents, the closure of several monasteries, mosques and religious schools in Tibet and the large scale, arbitrary arrest of Tibetan splittists, including several monks; and the action, if any, which is being taken by the Government during its Presidency of the EU to ensure the correction of such abuses.</Quest>

      <P>The stated aim of the &ldquo;strike hard campaign&rdquo;, instituted by the Chinese Government in April 1996, is to combat criminality and corruption.  It is a nationwide campaign and does not appear to be aimed specifically at the suppression of political dissent or at specific areas such as Tibet.  It has resulted in the arrest and conviction of large numbers of people on charges under China's criminal code and there is concern about the duration and intensity of the campaign and its potentially harmful impact on the efforts to promote the rule of law throughout China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is concerned about the human rights situation in China, including Tibet, and in particular the treatment of political dissidents and the fate of the Panchen Lama.  On 23 September 1996, I led the EU ministerial Troika at a meeting in New York with the Chinese Vice-Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Qian Qichen.  I availed of this opportunity to pursue the question of human rights in the People's Republic of China, which I have raised consistently in previous meetings with the Vice-Premier.  The EU has urged China to implement legislation and other positive measures in the human rights field, particularly the early accession to and ratification of the international covenants on civil and political <Col N="1717" /> rights and on economic, social and cultural rights. The Irish Presidency is pursuing these concerns actively.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 17 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>For a comprehensive account of Government actions in relation to the situation in Burma I refer to my reply to Question No. 60 of 22 October, and Questions Nos. 46 to 62 inclusive of 23 October 1996.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency has already raised the deteriorating political and human rights situation in Burma on a number of occasions.  I myself have expressed EU concerns in a forthright manner to the Burmese Foreign Minister, Ohn Gyaw, in meetings with him in Jakarta in July and in New York in September.  I have also expressed the concerns of the Union at meetings with the ASEAN countries in Jakarta last July.  We have also discussed the situation in Burma at the highest levels with other influential countries including Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that the Burmese authorities have failed to make any significant response to the strong representations made by the European Union.  In view of this, and given the degree of concern in the EU at the absence of progress towards democratisation and the continuing violation of human rights in Burma, the Council of the European Union adopted, on 28 October, a Common Position with a view to intensifying its efforts to promote progress towards democratisation and securing the immediate and unconditional release of detained prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> The Common Position reaffirms the following measures already adopted against Burma: the expulsion of all military personnel attached to the diplomatic representations of Burma in member states of the EU and withdrawal of all military personnel attached to diplomatic representations of the member states of the EU in Burma; an embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment and; suspension of non-humanitarian aid or development programmes.</P>
    <P>The Common Position introduces the following additional restrictions in relation to Burma: ban on entry visas for senior members of the SLORC and families; ban on entry visas for senior members of the military who formulate, implement or benefit from policies that impede Burma's transition to democracy, and their families; and suspension of high level bilateral governmental visits to Burma.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the call made by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for the imposition of trade and investment sanctions on the SLORC regime. Provision has been made for review of the Common Position and consideration of possible further measures against Burma in the light of developments there.  To this end, the Irish Presidency will monitor implementation of the Common Position and report regularly to Council on the matter.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Burma Action Group have recently met the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Joan Burton.  A separate meeting was also held with a senior official at the Department.</P>

      <P>The Special European Council in Dublin on 5 October instructed the General Affairs Council, at its meeting on 28-29 October, to consider a mandate for the position of a European Union envoy to the Middle East.  At its meeting in Luxembourg on 28 October, the Council appointed a Spanish diplomat, Mr. Miguel-Angel Moratinos, as EU Envoy to the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Moratinos has wide experience of the region and is well respected by all parties.  He served for many years as Director of Middle East Affairs in the Spanish Foreign Ministry and in that capacity was deeply involved in the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference, and subsequent work <Col N="1719" /> on the Middle East peace process.  He is currently Spanish ambassador to Israel.</P>
    <P>The Union has given Mr. Moratinos a wide-ranging mandate.  His role will be to establish and maintain close contact with all parties to the peace process, other countries of the region, the United States and relevant international organisations in order to work with them in strengthening the peace process.  He will observe peace negotiations between the parties and be ready to offer the EU's advice and good offices should the parties request this.  On behalf of the Union he will also monitor actions by either side which might prejudice the outcome of the Permanent Status Negotiations.  Where requested, the envoy will contribute to the implementation of international agreements reached between parties and will engage with them diplomatically in the event of noncompliance with the terms of these agreements.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of the peace process the envoy will engage constructively with signatories to agreements in order to promote compliance with the basic norms of democracy, including respect for human rights and the rule of law.  Mr. Moratinos will report to the Union on the possibilities for EU interventions in the peace process and on the best way of pursuing EU initiatives and ongoing Middle East peace process-related EU business, including the political aspects of relevant EU development projects.</P>

      <P>The World Food Summit will take place in Rome from the 13-17 November this year.  The summit has been organised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the FAO. The summit is taking place at a time of growing international concern about declining world cereal production, stocks and food aid supplies, as well as rising cereal prices.  The FAO has projected that world food production will have to increase by more than 75 per cent over the next 30 years to keep pace with population growth. Some 800 million people, 200 million of them children, are chronically undernourished in the developing world alone.  One out of five people in the developing world cannot get enough food to meet their daily needs.  In sub-saharan Africa, two out of five people do not have adequate food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The summit, bringing together Heads of State and Government, has been convened to seek commitment at the highest political level to the <Col N="1720" /> goal of global food security and to the eradication of world hunger.  Through the agreement of a policy statement and a plan of action, world leaders will seek a global consensus on ending hunger and promoting food security at local, national and international levels.</P>
    <P>Ireland has extensive involvement in the World Food Summit event and preparations.  The Taoiseach will attend the Heads of Government Session of the summit and will address the summit on the 15 November, presenting the Presidency statement on behalf of the EU.  In preparations for the summit, the Presidency has chaired EU coordination meetings, and has represented the EU in discussions of the draft summit texts with other regional groups.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to alleviating world hunger is also illustrated in our Overseas Development and Emergency Aid expenditure. Ireland's contribution to the UN Food and Agriculture organisations in 1995 was over IR£2.16 million.  Food security and agricultural development projects form important aspects of our bilateral project aid programmes, and food aid is provided from our emergency and humanitarian assistance fund to refugees and vulnerable people affected by natural disasters, famine and conflict.</P>
    <P>The UN food aid organisation, the World Food Programme, issues frequent reports outlining developments in its operations and identifying areas that are threatened by famine, or where serious threats to food security exist.  Its most recent reports detail food insecurity relief measures in Burundi, Zaire, Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Tajikistan and Former Yugoslavia.  The worsening situation in Zaire has led to the cut-off of humanitarian supplies which, according to the World Food Programme, could result in a hunger crisis affecting over one million Rwandan and Burundian refugees.  Recent FAO reports also outline serious food supply difficulties requiring emergency food aid in Sudan and Somalia, as well as the development of pockets of famine in Liberia, due to the disruption of relief distributions caused by civil strife.</P>

      <P>My Italian colleague paid an official visit to China from 11 to 16 October.  During his visit he met with Chinese Premier Li Peng and with the Vice Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen.  This was primarily a bilateral visit to promote ties between China and Italy.  In so far as matters of common concern to partners within the European Union arose, including human rights and Tibet, I am confident that my Italian colleague, in his meetings, followed our well established common position.  In particular I am assured that there is no basis for the reports that Foreign Minister Dini expressed dissatisfaction to his Chinese hosts about the EU's support for the Geneva Resolution on Human Rights in China.</P>
      <P>The next session of the Commission on Human Rights will take place in March-April 1997 by which time I will of course no longer be President of the EU General Affairs Council.  A decision on the introduction of a resolution on China will be taken closer to the date of the Commission in the light of the human rights situation obtaining at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy on arms exports, as set out in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, is the basis of the approach which we are pursuing in the EU and in relevant multilateral fora, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement and the UN General Assembly.  We are particularly concerned about the need to strengthen controls on exports to repressive regimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pursuant to the Luxembourg and Lisbon common criteria on arms exports, member states are encouraged, under the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, to inform and consult each other increasingly on matters of arms export control policy.  These common <Col N="1723" /> criteria include the respect of human rights in the country of final destination and the internal situation as a function of the existance of tensions or internal armed conflicts.  This ongoing process is intended to develop a common approach leading to a harmonisation of national policies.  In this framework, the Irish Presidency is working for agreement on initial elements of interpretation of particular criteria and some practical measures for application of the criteria for internal use by arms export licensing authorities.</P>
    <P>As anticipated in my reply to a question in this House on 4 July, full consensus on the Initial Elements of the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual Use Goods and Technologies was reached at a resumed Plenary meeting in Vienna on 10-12 July.  The relevant Export Control Lists will enter into force next month.  The 33 participants in this arrangement include the EU Fifteen but also all other major exporters of conventional arms and dual use goods and technologies, with the exception of China.  This is important because, as indicated in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, individual arms-exporting countries are generally unwilling to exercise restraint unilaterally, at the risk of losing export markets to competitors.  In view of its membership, the Wassenaar Arrangement has the potential to play an important role in developing international restraint in exports of arms and related dual-use goods and technologies, through the mechanisms of information exchange and peer review.</P>
    <P>We are keen to see the Wassenaar Arrangement in place and operational at the earliest possible date.  As Presidency, Ireland is seeking to ensure that the EU helps to achieve this.  I am pleased to report that the Irish Presidency secured approval on 22 October of the necessary amendment to the lists incorporated in EU Council Regulation (EC) No. 3381/94 of 19 December 1994 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use goods.  The Presidency has thus ensured that the EU will control exports of all items on the List of Dual Use Goods and Technologies of the Wassenaar Arrangement with effect from 15 November.  As arms exports, on the other hand, remain subject to national export controls, it is for each member state nationally to take any necessary steps to control exports of all items on the Munitions List of the Wessenaar Arrangement.  For Ireland's part, these steps are in hand.</P>
    <P>In the Disarmament Committee of the UN General Assembly, which is currently in session, Ireland has joined a representative group, including delevoping countries, as an original cosponsor of a new German initiative concerned with consolidating peace through practical disarmament.  This reflects our longstanding <Col N="1724" /> concerns in the area of small arms and the need for restraint in arms production and procurement.</P>

      <P>The current financial perspectives, which provide a long-term framework for the European Union budget, were agreed at the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1993, and run <Col N="1725" /> from 1994 to 1999.  It has been agreed at European Council level that the negotiations on the next round of financial perspectives, which will run from 2000, will not commence until the current Intergovernmental Conference on the revision of the Treaties has reached a conclusion. Present indications are that this is likely to occur at the end of the forthcoming Netherlands Presidency, in June 1997.  Consequently, negotiations on the next round of financial perspectives are not likely to commence until the beginning of the Luxembourg Presidency in the second half of 1997, at the earliest.  They are not therefore a matter for the current Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Government and the EU attach importance to early ratification by the Russian Federation of the START-2 treaty.  Through the START treaties, the two nuclear weapons states with the largest arsenals are engaged on a process which will reduce those arsenals by some two thirds.  The EU memorandum, which accompanied my statement of 24 September as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Union to the 51st session of the UN General Assembly, described the entry into force of the START-1 treaty as a milestone in the process of reducing existing nuclear arsenals.  It recalled the ratification of START-2 by the United States Senate on 26 January 1996 and looked forward to early ratification by the Russian Federation.  Ratification of START-2 by the Russian Federation is vitally important for the continuation of the process of nuclear arms reductions.  At the UN General Assembly on 24 September, President Clinton announced that, when Russia ratified, President Yeltsin and he would be ready to discuss the possibility of further cuts which sold help to make deep reductions irreversible.</P>
      <P>There were reports earlier this month that certain authorities in the Russian Federation considered the year 2003 too early to implement the nuclear arms reductions required under START-2 and were seeking a deferral.  However, there has been no formal indication that the Russian Federation is reconsidering its commitment to ratification and accordingly the European Union has not commented on these reports.  It is my understanding that the United States remains committed to the implementation of this bilateral treaty as negotiated.</P>

      <P>The Irish Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union on 28 October on the situation in Afghanistan.  This reflected the common approach resulting from consultations amongst EU partners over recent weeks.  The declaration expresses the European Union's deep concern at the intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan, and calls for the immediate cessation of these hostilities to prevent further destruction and loss of life.  The EU strongly urges all parties to seek a peaceful settlement through negotiation that will ultimately result in a political solution that would bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.  The EU fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan and calls upon all Afghan parties to co-operate closely with the UN Special Mission which is uniquely placed to act as an impartial mediator in the search for peace.  In this context, the EU welcomes the continuation of <Col N="1728" /> consultations by the UN Mission with neighbouring and other countries and regional institutions.</P>
      <P>The EU reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan, and urges all states to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.  In particular the flow of arms and ammunition into Afghanistan from outside its borders must end without delay.  It also appeals to the Afghan parties to stop the use of landmines in view of the high number of innocent civilians falling victim to these weapons.</P>
      <P>Of particular concern to the EU is the widespread violation of human rights in Afghanistan, especially discrimination against women and girls.  The EU recalls, in this context, the UN Security Council Resolution on Afghanistan of 22 October 1996, which denounced such discrimination as well as other violations of human rights.  The EU strongly urges the leaders of the various factions in Afghanistan to respect and act in accordance with the principles laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter, as well as all the other conventions on human rights to which Afghanistan is a signatory.</P>
      <P>As one of the leading contributors of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, the EU is concerned about the possible repercussions of human rights violations on the beneficiaries of EU relief programmes in Afghanistan.  The EU looks forward to a dialogue with all the parties concerned on cooperation modalities that aim to ensure the delivery of aid whilst maintaining the quality of support already provided to the people of Afghanistan, irrespective of their gender and ethnic background.  The EU has also noted with concern that the continuation of the conflict in Afghanistan increases the potential for international terrorism and drug trafficking with destabilising effects for the region and beyond. The EU therefore calls upon all parties in Afghanistan to halt such activities on Afghan soil.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 49 together.  The primary objective of EU and Irish Government policy in relation to Bosnia and Hercegovina is to ensure the continuing existence of that country as a single multi-ethnic and democratic State in its internationally recognized borders, consisting of two entities; and founded on respect for the human person and the rule of law.  With this objective in mind, the European Union continues to fully support the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Hercegovina as the basis for lasting peace and self-sustaining stability in that country.  The Union, and the Government, will continue to insist on full implementation by all parties of the terms of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The elections of 14 September represented an important step in the process of implementation of the agreement, and they were welcomed as such by the EU.  While conditions for those elections were not ideal, they were conducted in a reasonably democratic manner and the electoral process, and the results, have been validated by the OSCE.  These polls are important in that they pave the way for the full implementation of the new Constitution of the State of Bosnia and Hercegovina &mdash; a constitution which necessitates genuine power-sharing between the main ethnic groups in Bosnia and Hercegovina and which provides a framework for integration rather than separation.  The EU fully supports the strategy of the High Representative, Mr. Carl Bildt, in his efforts on behalf of the international community to facilitate the establishment of the power-sharing institutions of the country.  All three members of the collective Presidency have now signed the Solemn Declaration of allegiance to the Bosnian Constitution, and are participating in the meetings of the Presidency, where the formation of the national institutions, in particular the Council of Ministers, is under discussion.  The Union is determined to continue to make a significant contribution to the development of lasting peace and stability in Bosnia and Hercegovina and is committed to a strategy aimed at consolidating the peace process over a two-year period.  A marked improvement in co-operation by the parties with the International Criminal Tribunal is a key priority for the EU in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of compliance with the tribunal has featured prominently in discussions within the <Col N="1730" /> Union under the Irish Presidency.  In the formal conclusions adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers on 1 October, the Union's strong and unequivocal support for the work of the tribunal was reiterated and it was stressed that full co-operation by all parties with the tribunal in the effort to bring war criminals to justice is a fundamental obligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and lasting peace is to be consolidated.  Achieving progress in this area is more important than ever following the elections in Bosnia and Hercegovina.  The Council stressed that the Governments of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as the central government and entity administration in Bosnia and Hercegovina, must abide by the commitments which they have made to hand over indicted suspects.  They also agreed that international organisations and agencies active on the ground should examine how they can make a more effective contribution to the efforts of the tribunal in this regard.  Ireland, nationally and in its capacity as EU Presidency, will continue to support actively the work of the tribunal.  To this end, the Government recently made a further voluntary donation of US $100,000 to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The European Union continues to closely monitor the human rights situation in Turkey and has made it clear repeatedly that <Col N="1731" /> observance of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms is an essential element for closer relations between Turkey and the European Union.  It is clear from recent reports that the overall situation with regard to human rights and democratic reform is a matter of serious concern. The Union is very conscious of the concerns of the European Parliament in this regard, and will continue to impress upon the Turkish Government the need to make further progress in these areas.</P>
      <P>Since the restoration of democratic government in Turkey in 1983, following a period of repression under military rule, progress had been made in certain areas of democratisation and internal reform.  This included for example greater political freedom for parties and organisations previously banned, and reforms in the penal code to relax restrictions on freedom of expression and political debate.  However, this process of reform of legislation and the full implementation of democratic freedoms and human rights is still not complete.  I welcome the recent statement by the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, Mrs. Tansu Ciller, that the Turkish Government intends to take further initiatives to promote human rights in Turkey.  I will continue to urge the Turkish authorities to make early progress to adopt and implement the measures necessary to ensure respect for human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Partnership for Peace is a co-operative security initiative which has now attracted the participation of almost all members of the OSCE. Forty-three states are participants in PfP, including the sixteen members of NATO; all of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe including the Baltic States; Russia and all but one of the newly independent states (war-torn Tajikistan); and three countries whose policy it is to remain outside military alliances &mdash; Finland, Sweden and Austria.  Following a recent change in Government, Malta, a participant in PfP, has reportedly indicated its intention to withdraw from PfP and to reconsider its application to join the European Union.  Apart from micro-states such as the Holy See, Andorra, San Marino and Liechtenstein, on the one hand; and Cyprus and three ex-belligerent states of the Former Yugoslavia on the other, Switzerland and Ireland are the only two remaining European states <Col N="1732" /> which have not yet joined.  Yesterday, the Swiss Government formally announced its decision to participate in PfP.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Polocy contains a full account of Partnership for Peace and sets out some of the important advantages that participation could have for Ireland.  The White Paper also states that the Government would explore further the benefits that Ireland might derive from participation in PfP and that a decision on participation will only be taken by the Government in the light of consultations, including with the relevant committees of the Oireachtas, and subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I had useful consultations with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in April last. Subsequently, in line with my reply on 30 May to questions from Deputy Ray Burke and Deputy Clohessy, officials of my Department and the Department of Defence had consultations with NATO on 20 June to explore further the benefits which Ireland could derive from PfP.  Those consultations were entirely satisfactory and confirmed our understanding that each participating state can determine the terms and scope of its contribution; that participation would have no implications for our policy of military neutrality; and that PfP has already proven itself as a key forum for peacekeeping co-operation involving almost all of the major peacekeeping countries.  The NATO side also expressed appreciation of Ireland's peacekeeping role and achievements.  It is clear that Ireland would have much to gain and indeed to offer in this crucial area through participation in PfP.</P>
      <P>A decision to participate in PfP would be subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is neither a basis nor a need for a referendum on participation in PfP, which imposes no Treaty obligations of any sort, no mutual defence commitments and which has no implications for our policy of military neutrality.  With regard to the declaration of the four party leaders before the Maastricht Referendum, this declaration, as the House will recall, focussed on the issue of the Maastricht Treaty.  It contained a commitment of the four party leaders confirming that any decision arising from the EU's 1996 Intergovernmental Conference on defence for the EU would require a further referendum.  This commitment is contained in the current Programme for Government, and is repeated in the White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>

In the aftermath of the events surrounding Drumcree the Government made its views known fully to the British Government at the special meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 18 July 1996.  This meeting was convened at the request of the Government.  Matters relating to those events were also raised through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>Central to the concerns we expressed regarding the events of the week prior to 12 July were the implications for Nationalist confidence in the RUC and the rule of law.  I assure the Deputy that these concerns continue to form an important item of discussion with the British Government within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The issue goes well beyond the alleged involvement of any one individual, and I would prefer to treat it on that broader basis.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern locally that this crossing point has not been fully and permanently reopened and of traffic difficulties resulting from the seweratge scheme referred to by the Deputy.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The British authorities have now responded through the Secretariat that, since this crossing was formally opened on 7 May 1996, an attempt has been made to block the road on the Northern side of the Border.  The British authorities further state that they consider that responsibility to <Col N="1734" /> enforce the public right of way under law now lies with Derry City Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria which must be met in order that a disabled person can qualify for tax relief are set out in Regulation 3 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  Six different types of disability are listed and a qualifying person must meet at least one of them.  The disabilities relating to hands and arms include: persons without both hands or without both arms, persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg.</P>
      <P>On that basis, only those who satisfy these conditions with regard to hand and arm disabilities would qualify medically for entry into the scheme.</P>
      <P>These regulations were drawn up after consultation with a range of interested parties including organisations representing the disabled. The purpose of the disabled drivers scheme is to target what are costly reliefs on those clearly severely and permanently disabled.  There will always be difficulties in defining these categories in a satisfactory manner without opening the scheme too widely.  The scheme is kept under periodic review and the Deputy's request will be taken into account in that regard.</P>

      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an (unmarried) cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> In relation to taxation, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance, and double tax bands, is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances.  The expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, on which my Department and the Department of Social Welfare were represented, looked at, <i>inter alia,</i> the position of cohabiting couples generally. The group's report was published on 27 June 1996.  The group's recommendations are being studied at present.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> There is an agreed protocol for the prescribing of methadone by general practitioners whereby addicts who have been stabilised in a drug treatment centre are referred to a general practitioner &mdash; preferably their own family doctor &mdash; for ongoing methadone maintenance.  Addicts who do not abide by the protocol can be referred back to the centre.  I am satisfied that the risks to general practitioners in these situations are minimal and the experience to date would bear this out.  A number of practitioners have been treating addicts outside of the protocol and I am aware that a number of these doctors have been attacked from time to time.  This problem can best be overcome by a greater number of doctors becoming involved in the protocol so that each doctor will only have a small number of addicts <Col N="1741" /> on his or her list.

    <P>I have been concerned that waiting lists for hospital treatment have risen over the past 12 months and I have made available an additional allocation of £5 million to tackle this problem. This brings to £12 million the total funding provided in 1996 for the waiting list initiative.  The activity carried out under the initiative is in addition to the baseline workload of the hospitals involved and will enable those hospitals to undertake further work to reduce the waiting lists for treatment.  The funding will be of significant benefit in allowing more procedures to be carried out and in further improving access to hospital services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 77 together.  Allergies arise from a very wide variety of causes and affect individuals in many different ways.  Therefore, beyond advising sufferers to keep in close contact with their general practitioners or hospital consultants about their particular situation, it is difficult to set down a policy position which would adequately reflect the full range of situations which can arise. Consequently, I have no plans at present to produce a national policy on allergies. Anaphylaxis is associated most often with an allergy to peanuts and products containing peanuts.  My Department has written to the health boards and voluntary hospitals alerting them to the problem of food allergies, in particular, to the problem of peanut allergy and advising them to raise the awareness of all appropriate medical personnel including general practitioners.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Automatic pen injectors containing adrenaline are intended for self-administration in the emergency treatment of allergic conditions. Medicinal products are provided free of charge to persons covered by medical cards under the general medical services scheme.  Products included in the scheme must conform to certain published criteria.  A key criterion is that the product must be the subject of a current product authorisation.  The granting and continuation in force of such an authorisation indicates that the Irish Medicines Board has been satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product concerned.  To date no product authorisations have been issued in respect of automatic pen injectors containing adrenaline.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate to reimburse this product under the GMS scheme until such time as an authorised product becomes available on the Irish market.  I understand, however that automatic pen injectors remain available on a &ldquo;named patient&rdquo; basis to those for whom the product is deemed essential.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The appointment of a second consultant orthopaedic surgeon to Letterkenny General Hospital is the North Western Health Board's top consultant appointment priority.  This post was approved by my Department and Comhairle na nOspideal earlier this year.  The Local Appointments Commission advertised this post in September 1996 with a closing date for applications of 24 October 1996.  It is hoped that the board will have a recommendation for appointment to this post from the Local Appointments Commission early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elective orthopaedic services are available on a continuous basis in Letterkenny General Hospital.  The orthopaedic trauma service is at present provided on a week-on/week-off basis <Col N="1746" /> with Sligo General Hospital.  However, the appointment of a second consultant orthopaedic surgeon is part of the ongoing development of a comprehensive orthopaedic service in the board's catchment area and will result in the provision of a comprehensive orthopaedic service at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>

      <P>Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in September 1992 and is fully committed to its implementation.  In regard to Article 7 and the right of a child to know, as far as possible, his or her parents, the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for post-adoption contact between birth parents and adopted persons and access to birth records is a priority of the Government.  It is my firm intention that the necessary enabling legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible after the Supreme Court determines a case stated to it by the Circuit Court which will have a direct bearing on the nature and scope of the framework that will be put in place.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the extent of the problem of anti-social behaviour, including under age drinking and drug abuse, in some areas of Dublin city.  Certainly, alcohol and other drug abuse is a problem on certain stretches of the canals which are open for public amenity use. Individuals engaging in substance abuse on canal property present a danger to themselves with perhaps the risk of drowning, and they may also cause a nuisance or threat to local residents, walkers and other canal users.  However, since the Waterways Service does not have the resources to provide full-time patrols on canal property, the assistance of the Garda is sought whenever a public order problem is reported.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have the full co-operation of the Waterways Service of my Department in carrying out the full and effective exercise of their duties and functions.  I would ask members of the public to report any public order disturbance on canal property to the Garda in the first instance.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 87 agus Uimh. 88 le chéile.</P>
      <P>The Burren National Park study, which was commissioned by me, was set in the context of a strategy for the wider north Clare area and published in February last as a discussion document for public consultation over a 12 week period in which a wide range of views were welcomed and received.  The report addresses the issues raised by the Deputy in his questions.</P>
      <P>This study recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that visitors to the Burren be encouraged to disperse throughout the area in order to gain first-hand experience of the natural and cultural environment.  The integration of the various elements that contribute to the wholeness of north Clare should be emphasised and interaction with the host community encouraged.</P>
      <P>Interpretation, however and wherever presented, should reflect the interconnectedness and integrity of the area.  While this presentation of the wholeness of the north Clare story is recommended, it does not preclude the placing of emphasis on particular characteristics or attributes of any area where presentation is so provided.  The study goes on to point out that in the interests of retaining the visitor for a longer period in the north Clare area, the visitor should not be given the same view at each experience, centre or facility.  Rather, different pieces of the overall story should be conveyed at each experience or location, albeit placed in the overall context.  This should allow the visitor to assemble the overall story of the natural and cultural environment of the area from the various pieces provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This approach allows for a variety/combination of presentation methods, for example, built centres, guides, printed material, tapes, etc.  Such a provision of information and interpretation, in <Col N="1749" /> whatever format, should be of appropriate scale to each specific location.  Furthermore, the study recognises that Kilfenora, Corofin and Ballyvaughan have been identified as the best locations in terms of their position on the road network.</P>
    <P>At present, various options for the development of facilities at these locations are under investigation, including the question of available funding, and a final decision will be made in due course.</P>

      <P>Administration of the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes is the responsibility of local authorities and I have no information on the number of groups who may have disbanded. Under these schemes, loans are advanced by the local authority to the approved body undertaking the project and ownership of the housing remains with the body.  It is open to the local authority, without recourse to my Department, to exercise the normal powers of a mortgagee in the event of a breach of any of the conditions of the loan and to make appropriate arrangements.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for local authorities to assess the balance of advantage in terms of getting value for money between constructing a new house and purchasing a private house.  The prior approval of my Department is not required where the cost of the acquisition can be met from a local authority's capital allocation and where the acquisition represents a cost-effective and economical means by which the authority can meet the housing needs of a person who has been included in the last assessment made by the authority under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, or who has been accepted for inclusion in the next assessment.</P>

      <P>The Crumlin multi-denominational school was given recognition from September 1994.  This is the third year of operation and the current enrolment is 30 pupils.  The school has been asked to vacate its current temporary accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> As with all new multi-denominational or all-Irish schools, initial recognition was granted to the Crumlin school on a provisional basis.  When such schools have been in operation for a number of years and can satisfy my Department with regard to their conduct and future viability, permanent recognition may be granted.</P>
    <P>During the period of temporary recognition, it is the responsibility of school management to provide temporary premises to house the school. It is only when permanent recognition has been granted that such schools claim capital grant-aid from my Department.  Crumlin multi-denominational school has temporary recognition at present and, accordingly, does not qualify for grant-aid for capital works.</P>
    <P>The school has applied for permanent recognition and this application is being processed by my Department at present as a matter of urgency.  Officials from my Department met with a deputation from the management of the school and Educate Together on 16 October 1996 to discuss the issues.  The views put forward by the deputation will be taken into account in the examination of the application for permanent recognition.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there will be no undue delay in processing the application and that the accommodation problem will be reviewed immediately in the light of that decision.</P>

      <P>Reckonable income for the purpose of the third level student support schemes is normally the income of the candidate and his or her parents or guardians in the tax year ending 5 April of the year of entry to college.</P>
      <P>In cases where there is a change of circumstances income is assessed on a current basis.  This is done by annualising the revised weekly income to arrive at the earnings for the current year.</P>
      <P>Most cases of this nature occur when there is an unfavourable change in circumstances.  For example, if a person becomes unemployed the reckonable income for grants purposes is calculated by annualising the weekly social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>In such instances the 1996 student support schemes provide that the change in the award of grant takes effect in the college term in which the change in circumstances occurs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the long-term plan for Bray Garda Station is to refurbish and extend it. While it is not possible to say at this stage when work on this project might commence, it will be progressed as quickly as possible having regard to overall priorities and the availability of finance.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, in order to alleviate the accommodation difficulties at the station, it is proposed to locate portacabins there.  I am informed by the Office of Public Works that the required site works will commence this week and that the portacabins will be in place by the end of November.  I also understand from the Garda Authorities that showering and locker facilities for the female members of the station party will be provided with the installation of these units.  I should like to emphasise that they are being installed as a temporary measure only, pending the completion of the main works proposed for the existing station building.</P>

    <P>In addition to the funding provided by my Department for the youth diversion schemes and the juvenile liaison schemes, funding is also provided in respect of a number of projects run by or on behalf of the probation and welfare service.  Many of these projects provide training and facilities for young people on probation or at risk of offending.  It is not possible to quantify the proportion of expenditure on the youth element of these schemes for the years in question. Likewise, every operational member of the Garda Síochána would work with young people as part of his/her normal policing duties and this element of the work is not separately costed.</P>
    <P>The total Justice budget is comprised of five Votes &mdash; Justice, Garda, Prisons, Courts and Land Registry.  The proportion of expenditure from the total Justice budget for the years 1991 to 1996 on these schemes is set out in the following table.</P>

      <Col N="1764" /> It would, however, be more appropriate to relate this direct expenditure exclusively to the Garda Vote.

      <P>At present the household budgeting scheme is available to people receiving unemployment payments through the Post Office network by means of postdraft payment.  This requires the full computerisation of the client base at the local social welfare office.  Where services to the unemployed are provided through a social welfare branch office, such as Killarney, the necessary degree of computerisation has not yet been achieved to allow household budgeting to be offered to customers.  Further computerisation of social welfare branch offices is contingent on discussions with the branch managers' association on the future role of these offices.  These discussions will commence in the near future and, pending the outcome, it is not possible to indicate when the introduction of the household budgeting scheme in the area in question will be implemented.</P>

      <P>In general, the tax system treats cohabiting couples as two single people, while the social welfare system regards them as a couple. The current social welfare arrangements reflect the Supreme Court judgement in the Hyland case in May 1989.  Mr. Hyland challenged provisions in the social welfare code which gave him, as a married man, a lower rate of unemployment assistance than he would have received if he was cohabiting.  The Supreme Court ruled that these provisions were unconstitutional, in view of the State's pledge in the Constitution to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to <Col N="1765" /> protect it against attack.  Following the Supreme Court judgment, the Government introduced legislation to extend the relevant provisions to cohabiting couples, so that all couples now receive the same treatment under the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>However, the different treatment of married and cohabiting couples in the tax and social welfare systems causes problems for those affected by it.  This question was examined in some detail by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems. The group considered that, in the light of the constitutional protection for the family, it would not be possible to treat cohabiting couples as single people for social welfare purposes, unless the same treatment was extended to married couples as well.  The group rejected such an approach for a number of reasons; it would be costly, ill-targeted, involving considerable redistribution between different types of households, and could have undesirable social effects.</P>
      <P>The alternative approach would be to change the tax treatment of cohabiting couples.  The expert group noted that, if this were done on the basis of a broad definition of cohabitation, it could pose problems of control, and it would be necessary to lay down strict conditions to define &ldquo;cohabiting couples&rdquo;.  The group recommended that consideration be given to the possibility of allowing for the joint taxation of cohabiting couples, in cases where such a couple have a child mainly resident with them, who is maintained wholly or mainly by the couple concerned.  The findings of the group are being examined by the relevant Ministers, with a view to putting forward specific proposals for a structured implementation of the report.</P>

      <P>On foot of a recommendation of the task force for the elderly which I set up earlier this year, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána, issued a mailshot to over 320,000 households throughout the country.  The purpose of this was to provide practical advice on security measures, <Col N="1766" /> information on how savings may affect pensions and generally to allay fears among elderly people. The total cost to my Department in respect of production, printing and postage was £136,600.</P>
      <P>I am aware of one particular case where a person received two copies of this information pack.  This arose because the individual concerned was in the process of transferring from one pension type to another and the details were temporarily held on two files.  It is possible that a small number of people in similar circumstances may have received a second copy of the information pack.</P>

      <P>My Department provides support to Irish inventors through the State agency, Forbairt.  The intellectual property unit in Forbairt operates the inventions assistance scheme which provides inventors with general advice on protection, development and commercialisation of inventions and funding for patent applications.  Forbairt also operates a number of schemes, some on behalf of the office of science and technology, which is part of my Department, which support research, <Col N="1768" /> development and other forms of innovation. These schemes can be categorised as, first, support for research and development and technology transfer in firms; and second, funding for research in third level colleges.</P>
      <P>With a view to minimising the financial burden on small inventors and enterprises, the fees payable to the Patents Office, which comes under the aegis of the Department, to obtain short-term patents have been set at specially low levels.

      <P>Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which dates in some cases from 1893, are well advanced.  The scope of the Bill has necessarily required detailed attention on the part of both my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  However, I am pleased to say that a first draft of the Bill, which involves up to 200 sections, has been received from the parliamentary draftsman, and is at present being examined in detail by my Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of credit unions.  The text of the Bill will be finalised in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman in the coming weeks, after which Government approval to publish the Bill will be sought.  The Credit Union Bill is my priority for legislative action, and while I am not able to give a precise date for publication at present, I assure Deputies that every effort is being made to have the Bill published during the current Dáil session.</P>

      <P>The Holidays (Employees) Acts, 1973 and 1991 provide a statutory minimum entitlement to annual leave and public holidays for eligible employees.  In general, this &mdash; and other employment protection legislation &mdash; covers persons employed under a contract of employment, that is, a contract &ldquo;of service&rdquo; as distinct from a contract &ldquo;for services&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have arisen in this particular case because of the disputed nature of the employment.  The individual concerned contends that he is employed through a contract of service whereas his employer maintains that their relationship is in the nature of a contract for services, in their view, he is self-employed.  I am arranging for an inspection of the employer's records, following which a statement will be taken from the complainant in the case.  If the matter is not resolved satisfactorily through this means the case will be referred to my legal advisers for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings, if appropriate.  My Department will endeavour to have the matter expedited as quickly as possible and will keep the complainant informed of developments as they arise.</P>

      <P>I have indicated my intention of having all animal location data at present available to my Department or which is amenable to being readily inputted to a computer, centralised on one computer file known as ALF &mdash; Animal Location File.  That file will be completed and made available for use by the Department's veterinary certification service around the end of the year.  The file will include animal information for all counties, including Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I have also announced my aim of introducing a comprehensive animal tracing system.  That will involve the collection of a wide range of both location and movement information on all cattle. The sources will include disease scheme records, premium and headage scheme records, calf birth registrations, movements off farm, movements into and out of marts and disposal for slaughter or export.  Such a system, which will go well beyond the animal location file, will require considerable investment and development effort. It will be put in place as speedily as possible but it will be some time before this fully comprehensive system becomes operational.</P>
