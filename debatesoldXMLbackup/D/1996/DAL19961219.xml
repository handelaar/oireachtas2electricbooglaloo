    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the honour as President in office of chairing the meeting of the European Council which took place in Dublin Castle on 13 and 14 December.  I was accompanied at the European Council by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State responsible for European affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The outcome of the Dublin European Council is set out in detail in the conclusions, copies of which I have had placed in the Library of the House.  Prior to the meeting I met each of the other Heads of State or Government who are members of the European Council and the President of the European Commission to discuss the agenda which we faced.  These discussions contributed in no small way to the meeting's success.</P>
      <P>The Dublin European Council represented the culmination of what has been acknowledged by all sides to have been an outstanding Irish Presidency. When I spoke in this House on 20 June last on the outcome of the Florence European Council I stated that the Government was determined that our Presidency would be viewed as significant in terms of a substantive response to the challenges facing the Union.  We have delivered on our promise in this regard.  In particular, the Dublin European Council gave a decisive further impetus to economic and monetary Union by agreeing the principles under which the stability and growth pact will operate, the modalities of a new exchange rate mechanism when economic and monetary union commences and the legal framework of the euro.  It reaffirmed that unemployment was the key problem facing the Union and adopted the Dublin Declaration on Employment which sets out the policy framework for increased employment in Europe.  It endorsed significant new measures in the fight against drug trafficking and abuse and against organised crime.  It also approved the general outline for a draft revision of the Treaties submitted by the Presidency as a good basis for the work which lies ahead in the context of its reaffirmation of the importance of completing the conference and the treaty at Amsterdam in June 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before outlining what we have done to tackle the major challenges facing the European Union we should also recall the effectiveness and efficiency of the Irish Presidency on a whole host of other issues across Ministerial Councils which do not generally attract public attention.  The feedback in regard to the Presidency's handling of these issues has been positive.  This excellent stewardship was a result of careful planning and complete commitment by relevant Ministers and officials.  The management and organisation of <Col N="600" /> the European Council and the management of the many other events which took place during the Irish Presidency demonstrates that small countries can run successful, substantive and significant Presidencies.</P>
    <P>At the commencement of the Presidency I set out four priorities which would drive our policy agenda.  These were secure jobs, safer streets, sound money and a peaceful Europe.  These priorities are the kernel of the challenges facing the European Union.  They are the issues that concern the citizens of Europe.  In setting them out as I did, I was also anxious that they constitute a simple and understandable message, stripped of &ldquo;Euro-verbiage&rdquo;, which citizens could understand.  The conclusions of the Dublin European Council reflect the success of our Presidency in addressing these four core concerns.</P>
    <P>On secure jobs, the Council has adopted The Dublin Declaration on Employment: <i>The Jobs Challenge.</i> The declaration itself will not of course create jobs.  It is, however, a tangible sign of the priority which the European Union attaches to tackling the totally unacceptable level of unemployment in Europe.  While recognising that the primary responsibility in the fight against unemployment rests with the member states the European Council, on the initiative of the Irish Presidency, has committed itself to supporting the efforts of member states through the implementation of an integrated employment strategy covering macroeconomic policy and structural reform.</P>
    <P>The declaration, which is included in the Annex to the Presidency conclusions, sets out the elements which must be put in place if we are to provide sustainable employment for our citizens. These elements include sound and stable macroeconomic policies oriented towards growth &mdash; adherence to the conditions for economic and monetary union is acknowledged as particularly important in this regard; the improvement of the efficiency of the way in which the labour market helps people to find jobs and increased investment in the training and education of the people themselves for jobs; special efforts to assist the particularly vulnerable groups of unemployed women, unemployed youth and the long-term unemployed; the reform of taxation and social protection systems to make them more employment friendly; modernisation of the markets for goods and services and the exploitation of new sources of employment in areas such as environmental protection and social services; enhancing European competitiveness in the global economy; and the promotion of local development.</P>
    <P>It is highly appropriate that this should be called the Dublin Declaration on Employment. The policy prescription set out in the declaration accords with that which has been followed with such success by the Government and social partners in Ireland in recent years, and which has led to significant increases in employment here.  The strategy in the Dublin declaration is supplemented by some useful initiatives in the conclusions <Col N="601" /> proper, notably the commitment to regulatory simplification and the extension of simpler legislation for the internal market, or SLIM, which will reduce the costs of SMEs in particular. An especially welcome development is the mandate given by the European Council to the Commission to report before the Amsterdam summit on all necessary measures that must be taken to ensure that the full potential benefit of the internal market is achieved before the beginning of the third stage of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The second priority we set for ourselves was safer streets.  There has in recent decades been a rapid increase in the rate of crime and particularly in both the scope and sophistication of organised crime.  Ruthless drug barons now prey on the weak and vulnerable in every member state.  The Presidency set out to energise Europe's response to organised crime and drugs trafficking. It is clear from the conclusions that we have been successful in this.</P>
    <P>Many new initiatives have been agreed under the Irish Presidency, notably the agreement on a resolution on sentencing for serious illicit drug trafficking; the agreement which has been reached on the joint action on the approximation of laws, and practices of police, customs services and administrative authorities in the fight against drug addiction and illegal drug trafficking; the agreement to promote co-operation between customs and business in the fight against drug trafficking and to improve co-operation between police and customs authorities; the agreement to measures to address the drug tourism problem and to counter actively drug cultivation within the EU; of crucial importance was the agreement on the demand side of the problem to a five year programme on drug dependency; and finally a joint action programme which has been agreed on the exchange of information on the chemical profiling of drugs.</P>
    <P>The European Council stressed that the momentum achieved in regard to the fight against drugs during our Presidency which has been considerable, must be further developed.  Particular stress was laid on considering harmonisation of drugs legislation; more intensified co-operation between the law enforcement agencies; full application of the money laundering directive and further development on a co-operative basis of the fight against drugs and crime in Latin America, North America, Asia, central and eastern Europe and Russia.  I am satisfied that the Netherlands Presidency will ensure that the groundbreaking work of the Irish Presidency in this area will be built upon.</P>
    <P>Drugs are only one aspect of the problem.  The key fight is the fight against organised crime.  As I said on many occasions, crime does not respect borders.  This underlines the need for the closest possible co-operation to fight organised crime. The modern organised criminal has access to vast amounts of financial resources and is making use of the latest technologies.  It is important that <Col N="602" /> Europe and the member states respond to these developments in an organised and coherent fashion.  The European Council decided in Dublin, on foot of a proposal from the Irish Presidency, to create a high level group to draw up a comprehensive European action plan for the fight against organised crime.  This group is to report by March-April 1997.</P>
    <P>The fight against organised crime must also be fought at an international level.  The meeting in Dublin of the European Council with the 11 applicant states focused on the problem of organised crime.  Arising from this I am determined there will be much closer co-operation, across all Europe, to counter what constitutes the greatest threat to the security of its citizens.  I am glad to report that the EU-US summit in Washington on 16 December also laid great stress on co-operation in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking. Both the European Union and the United States are committed to intensifying their efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the light of the horrific events in Belgium the European Council in Dublin also expressed its abhorrence at the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings and committed itself to taking all necessary action to protect the most vulnerable in society.  The agreement on a joint action in relation to offences against children and improving judicial co-operation in this area was welcomed as was the extension of the competencies of the EUROPOL drugs unit to such crimes.</P>
    <P>It is important to act now.  While clearly EU treaty revisions in this area will be necessary, we should not await these treaty provisions before we pursue further measures across the range of areas I have just mentioned &mdash; drug abuse, drug trafficking, crime, trafficking in children and organised crime.  The European Council has set out an ambitious programme of practical measures which can be put in place in a short period and I have no doubt future Presidencies will continue to accord priority to this area of work.</P>
    <P>The third key priority we set ourselves was sound money.  The Dublin European Council has been a major success in paving the way towards economic and monetary union.  The agreement of the structure of the new exchange rate mechanism will regulate the relationship between the ins and the outs, the endorsement of the two regulations that will constitute the legal framework for the use of the euro, and the agreement of the principles and main elements of the Stability and Growth Pact for ensuring budgetary discipline under economic and monetary union are all major achievements that further enhance the momentum towards the single currency.</P>
    <P>The importance of the agreement on the Stability and Growth Pact has quite rightly been emphasised.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, deserves special praise for his handling of this issue and I also acknowledge the key role <Col N="603" /> played at the European Council in this matter by my colleague, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker.</P>
    <P>The agreement reached will require the adoption of sound public finance policies by all member states participating in economic and monetary union.  It also recognises, however, that deep recessions may on occasion temporarily cause deficits above the reference value for member states, despite the fact that these states are following the correct fiscal policies.</P>
    <P>The importance of the major progress made at the Dublin Council on the new exchange rate mechanism and the legal framework for the euro should also be underlined.  The new ERM will regulate the relationship between those in and out of the economic and monetary union single currency and, with enhanced surveillance of economic policies, will help to avoid competitive distortions between the member states of the Union and ensure the proper operation of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The work on the legal framework for the euro was advanced beyond the target set; it is now virtually complete.  This framework will give financial institutions, investors and the general public the legal certainty they need as to the effect the euro will have on investment and other decisions made in the various currencies prior to its introduction. Deputies will recognise the absolute importance of this certainty for the transition if continued investment and private and public sector funding are to be ensured for all types of purpose.</P>
    <P>The Dublin summit also saw the unveiling of the new design for the euro notes.  I regret I did not bring copies for each Member.  Overall, Dublin clearly marked another significant milestone on the road to economic and monetary union and the introduction of the single currency.</P>
    <P>Our fourth priority was a peaceful Europe. European integration has been the main force for peace and stability in Europe over the past 50 years.  Since 1945, western Europe has enjoyed the longest period of peace in recorded history and that is directly linked to the existence of the European Union.  It is essential for Europe that this process of integration within the European Union continues with a successful outcome to the current Intergovernmental Conference.  The Intergovernmental Conference was, therefore, one of the major items on the agenda of the European Council and the Tánaiste will be reporting on this in greater detail.  The Intergovernmental Conference outcome will address many of the other key priorities of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency had submitted to the European Council an outline draft treaty requested in Florence and I am pleased to say it was warmly welcomed by Heads of State or Government and accepted by all member states as a good basis for further negotiations.  This means that the conference remains on target to <Col N="604" /> conclude in Amsterdam in June next year.  It also means there is a coherent and balanced basis for further work which at the same time maintains the level of ambition of the conference with a view to equipping the Union to address the most direct concerns of its citizens and to face the challenges of a new century.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that in many respects the progress made at the Intergovernmental Conference contributes to the key priorities identified for the Irish Presidency as a whole.  Our draft of the treaty would incorporate a new title on employment in the treaty which would permit better co-ordination at European level in the fight against unemployment.  The Irish Presidency draft treaty would introduce significantly strengthened provisions to the treaty to enable the Union to pursue more effectively the fight against international crime, including drug trafficking, etc.  It would also give the Union a more coherent and effective basis for foreign policy and would equip it to contribute to peace.</P>
    <P>We seek not only a peaceful Europe but a stable and peaceful Europe acting as a source of stability and peace in the world.  The Dublin Council has advanced Europe's foreign policy perspective in a significant way and progress was made on a wide range of foreign relations issues. The Tánaiste will deal with these in his statement. I ask the House to note in particular the reaffirmation of our deep concern about developments in regard to democracy in Belarus &mdash; we offered to send a fact finding mission to Belarus and we urge its President to accept this offer &mdash; and a recognition of the importance of the Council of Europe in upholding human rights standards and supporting pluralist democracy.  We look forward to co-operation with the Council of Europe in this important ask.</P>
    <P>Given the very heavy workload associated with chairing the Council it was not possible to hold any bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Major or any other Head of State or Government during the European Council.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the EU-US and EU-Canada summits which I attended this week.  In Washington the EU and the US were able to record substantive progress on a whole range of headings &mdash; political, economic, trade and justice. Of particular importance was the information technology agreement reached primarily on the initiative of the US and the EU under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation which will liberalise over $500 billion in trade annually in a sector in which Ireland has a major interest.  We also reached agreement in principle on mutual recognition of standards covering key sectors representing tens of billions of pounds of two-way trade across the Atlantic between here and the US.  The economic benefit for Europe and Ireland of these agreements will be enormous.</P>
    <P>I also signed a joint action programme between the EU and Canada in Ottawa on Tuesday.  This programme will act as a framework within which relations between the EU and Canada are to be <Col N="605" /> developed and deepened.  I had detailed bilateral discussions with President Clinton and Prime Minister Chretien in Washington and Ottawa respectively.  Overall, therefore, it has been an exceptional week for Ireland on the world stage.</P>
    <P>The message from the European Council will be particularly gratifying to the citizens of Europe.  The message is that Europe is working. Europe is committed to remaining at the very forefront of the global economy.  It is committed to building a society where the individual citizen enjoys freedom, security and justice.  Europe will have a sound currency which will act as an engine for economic growth.  Europe aims to be both peaceful and stable in itself and an influence for global peace and stability.  Europe looks forward to the 21st century with pride in its achievements and confidence in its future.  Last, but by no means lest, the message is that Ireland will be at the heart of Europe in achieving all these objectives.</P>
    <P>Eighteen months ago in Paris I was asked the priority for the Irish Presidency which was then 12 months away and I said it would be to deal with the problems of drug abuse and organised crime.  I am glad that in addition to doing the normal work which fell to our responsibility, such as finalising the Stability and Growth Pact and moving the single currency forward, the Irish Presidency gave a distinctive push, which would not have occurred without our initiative, to the Europe-wide battle against organised crime and drug abuse, not only within the European Union but also as a result of our discussions with the eastern European countries.  That work is now extended to include them.  It is also included as a major part of the work we are doing in common with the United States and Canada.  The Irish Presidency ought to be marked as one during which the Union became tangibly involved with a major concern of its citizens, the problem of crime.  In showing that it can deal with crime the Union has increased its level of support among the people of Europe, even in countries where scepticism about Europe may be a feature.  That European union is necessary to deal with crime is a reason for all of us to support the Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government on the successful conclusion of the 1996 European Presidency. Great tribute is due to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who dealt with the parliamentary base. I spoke yesterday to the leader of our group, Gerard Collins, MEP, and conveyed the Taoiseach's kind remarks to him, which he appreciated.  We promised at the start of the Presidency that, through our Whip, we would co-operate totally with the Irish Presidency here and in Europe, and we are glad we did that.  Great tribute should also be paid to the hard work of Irish officials at home and abroad.  Particularly valuable work was carried out by Mr. Noel Dorr in preparing the draft <Col N="606" /> treaty text to push forward the work on the intergovernmental conference.</P>
      <P>An efficient and effective Presidency is important for the functioning of the European Union.  It is also important to the country which holds the Presidency for that period, particularly a small country such as Ireland.  Some people in the European Union would like to downgrade the role of small countries and always take the opportunity to do so.  However, the Government is entitled to be proud of its achievement, just as Fianna Fáil remains very proud of the 1990 Presidency which was a time of historic changes in Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Both Irish Presidencies gave a decisive push forward to the European Union.  In 1990 we settled the Maastricht criteria and agreed on the goal of political union, and the establishment of the intergovernmental conference leading, in 1992, to the Maastricht Treaty.  In 1996 Ireland was in the chair when the stability and growth pact, which is vital to monetary union, was agreed and when a first consideration was given to the text of the treaty amendments.</P>
      <P>I could not help feeling some pride when the Taoiseach at his press conference in Dublin Castle announced the united political will of the European continent.  This contrasted with the rather forlorn figure of the British Prime Minister standing in the second row of a group photograph in Dublin Castle, once the seat of British rule, now transformed into the temporary seat of European power.</P>
      <P>Achieving agreement on the stability and growth pact was vital to maintain confidence in the monetary union time table.  The markets have responded very positively to the news.  I have always recognised the necessity for supplementary rules to cover exceptional economic circumstances and, thus, to make the normal operation of the Maastricht criteria credible.  There has to be leeway during a period of international recession.  If member states are to keep to the 3 per cent GDP ceiling on borrowing, then in good times they should run a deficit no higher than 1 per cent of GDP and, indeed, preferably they should be in balance of surplus.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the Dublin European Council reiterate:</P>
      <P>Each member state will commit itself to aim for a medium term budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus.  This work allows the automatic stabilisers to work over the whole business cycle without heading the 3 per cent reference value for the deficit.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister for Finance outlining a strategy for keeping to that commitment, either today or on budget day.  During the last downturn, in the early 1990s, Ireland lived within the Maastricht criteria.  We need to be sure we will also achieve that in the future so that there is no question of our ever having to face EU financial sanctions, as was agreed last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final agreement was a good compromise <Col N="607" /> between the German and French positions, which another small country, Luxembourg, helped to broker.  It is important to have pro-active economic policy co-ordination and not just the monetarist approach.</P>
    <P>The Summit agreement also addressed the issue of most immediate concern to Ireland, the relationship between countries participating in monetary union and those remaining outside.  An ERM 2 is provided, which those member states are expected to join, although Britain is reserving the right to opt out of that as well.  The key point, already in the Treaty, is that each member state shall treat its exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest.  If any country, such as Britain, were to attempt a policy of competitive devaluation it would be of grave concern, not just to us but to our other EU partners.  If, on the other hand, the British economy rose against the economic and monetary union, this could create inflationary pressures.  We have policy instruments, including indirect taxes, which could, if necessity required, help us cope with that situation. The uncertainty of the situation, when what investors require and demand most is certainty, will not be particularly helpful to the British economy, despite the competitive advantage they are promising themselves.</P>
    <P>Like former Taoiseach Charles Haughey in 1990, the Taoiseach did not afford the British Prime Minister much opportunity to stage the usual 14 to one grandstand to impress the Euro sceptics back home.  Despite British efforts to rubbish the Dublin European Council in advance as a non event, it did a great deal of good work and was one of the most substantial European Councils, which will be remembered.  It is difficult for us to have much sympathy with British postimperial stress disorder, with its national phobias about sovereignty and foreigners.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with the same forces in relation to Northern Ireland, and it is no wonder we have some difficulties.  Sections of the British media actively foster the most ignorant attitudes. I trust they will not succeed in intimidating the next British Government from doing what is necessary.  I, nevertheless, maintain the hope that we will be able to have a much more constructive and positive partnership in Europe with a new British Government, even if it is not able to go all the way immediately.  A positive British attitude to Europe would, paradoxically, remove a great deal of strain from Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see draft specimens of the Euro bank notes produced at the Dublin Summit. This will help establish in the public mind that monetary union is proceeding on schedule.  I know that was the intention behind it and it was a good idea.</P>
    <P>The other major set piece of the Summit was the tabling of a draft treaty text drawn up by a committee of personal representatives under the chairmanship of Mr. Noel Dorr, whose particular diplomatic skills and intellectual grasp, and the <Col N="608" /> wide respect in which he is held, made him ideal for the job.</P>
    <P>I very much approve of the ambition to make new treaty texts easily comprehensible.  One of the flaws of the Maastricht Treaty was its obscure and technical language.  We have to bring the people with us, and when we consult them to be able to put meaningful propositions to them.</P>
    <P>There are many valuable proposals in the draft treaty, such as the outlawing of all forms of discrimination; the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice; co-ordination on drugs; and a freedom of information clause.  It is a good idea to write in a new title on employment, setting the objective of a high level of employment to be taken into consideration in the formulation and implementation of Community policies.  This builds on the work of the Essen European Council in December 1994, just before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>Part B of the document is a list of ideas put forward by different member states.  One of these on nuclear safety was tabled by Ireland on the strengthening of the safety provisions of the EURATOM Treaty, which, of course, we support, However, we should also consider supporting proposals for island regions tabled by Greece and the fishing quota hopping proposals tabled by the UK, as well as the initiatives on religion and cultural diversity and the Belgian proposals on public health, related to surveillance of food and blood products.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned at the first comment on chapter 3, whereby no member state shall grant asylum or refugee status to anyone from another member state.  There are unresolved minority problems within the EU, and while we do not approve of violence, the right of self determination is not recognised everywhere as freely as it is in these islands The Union will enlarge over the next few years and may take in states which have no lengthy track record of democracy in respect of human rights.  Ireland should oppose a blanket clause of the type suggested.</P>
    <P>I do not have a major problem with the main text on security and defence.  I signalled some time ago, following discussions which Deputy Ray Burke and I had with Commission President Santer, our willingness that Ireland should participate in the humanitarian and peacekeeping Petersberg Tasks under EU direction, in <i>ad hoc</i> co-ordination with the Western European Union, to which we are observers.  We do not want to see the EU/WEU amalgamation or the incorporation in the Treaty of alliance obligations or nuclear doctrines.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to a Commission file note of 8 October on a meeting of the Dorr group, which refers to &ldquo;ex-neutral members states&rdquo; participating in the Petersberg Tasks.  As far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, Ireland is not &ldquo;an ex-neutral state&rdquo;.  It is precisely to prevent that kind of misunderstanding that we are opposed to participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> There is a sensible approach adopted in the enhanced co-operation &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; section. Maintaining the right balance between the more rapid progress which some member states wish to make together and the coherence of the Union will remain vital.</P>
    <P>Many of the difficult institutional issues have been held over.  Many European Governments have between 25 and 35 Cabinet members.  There seems little reason the European Commission should not have the same number.  In practice, much of the real work will be done in committee. If there is a problem of coherence with, say, 25 Commissioners, will that not equally arise with 20 or 25 Council members?  Are we really saying that we cannot give full membership to new applicants, or that we are withdrawing it from existing ones?  I would leave the present formula alone, at least for the moment.  The larger states will want to keep their two members, and are entitled to them, as it helps them to keep European policy issues on a bipartisan basis at home.  I would support an extension of qualified majority voting. The appointment of special EU envoys has much to recommend it.</P>
    <P>The European Union is a union of nation states, not just of populated regions.  It is the democratic nation states that give the Union its political mandate and it legitimacy.  I was disturbed to read at the weekend in the <i>Sunday Times</i> a German banker from Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt quoted as saying with regard to the economic and monetary union, &ldquo;Ireland does not matter&rdquo;, and that if Italy were excluded, Ireland almost certainly would be as well. I know that does not represent the view of the German Government, but I would warn against arrogance in larger countries.  The attitude that small countries do not matter caused two world wars.  It proved the undoing of empires.  Even superpowers have come to grief in small countries.  The larger countries in the European Union must not make that mistake again.  Equally, smaller countries have to behave responsibly and respect the legitimate interests of larger countries and recognise the weight of the population that they represent.  All countries, large and small, like sometimes to punch above their weight, as Douglas Hurd once put it.  While it may be necessary from time to time to correct the balance, we should not try to fundamentally alter a formula that has proved successful.</P>
    <P>I am glad there has been further intensification of international co-operation against drugs both at the EU Council and at US-EU summit which the Taoiseach attended in Washington.  I also approve of the strong declaration on the Middle East peace process.  At present, it is on course for disaster.</P>
    <P>A six-month European Presidency is a bit like Macbeth's actor who &ldquo;struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more&rdquo;.  As Chancellor Kohl said, &ldquo;the caravan moves on&rdquo;.  A good presidency which is additional to the normal tasks of Government is its own reward.  The electorate <Col N="610" /> judge Governments on their ability to handle the issues of direct and immediate relevance to them, not on their prowess on the European or world stage.  That is a reality that applies to all Governments past and present.  We have all derived some benefit, and all have suffered, but that should not deprive this Government of deserved satisfaction in a job well done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The major achievement of the Dublin summit was the progress made towards the establishment of a European single currency. I congratulate the Government, not just on its handling of the summit but also on the way in which it has handled the Irish Presidency over the past six months.  I also congratulate all the civil servants involved in this effort, particularly those from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance.  The professionalism with which they carried out their task has reflected great credit on this country.  In particular I would like to mention Mr. Noel Dorr although he is not, strictly speaking, a public servant at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the single currency, a stability pact for participating countries has been agreed by the heads of government and economic and monetary union would appear to be on course for launch on 1 January 1999, just two years from now.  There appears to be an unquestioning acceptance in this country that the single currency is a good thing.  We hear some arguments put forward that border on the trivial &mdash; the single currency will save the average family a few pounds in foreign exchange costs on the annual holiday in Spain.  We hear other arguments that are little short of irrational &mdash; the British are staying out of the single currency, so we can demonstrate our maturity as a nation by going in.  We regard the Euro-sceptics in the British Conservative Party as nothing more than a bunch of right-wing eccentrics, but we should never dismiss political views out of hand just because we do not like or agree with the people who are promoting them.</P>
      <P>We are about to make one of the most momentous decisions in the history of the State with a minimum of political debate, a minimum of public information and a minimum of consideration of the long-term implications.  I am sure that we would all be in favour of Ireland's participation in the single currency if we thought that all the member states of the Union would join.  That is not the case, however.  If the British decide to stay out and we go into the single currency, the implications for this country are serious and it is vitally important that we weight them up very carefully indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge, there has been only one in-depth study of the impact of the proposed single currency on the Irish economy, and that was published in July of this year.  The ESRI report concluded that membership of economic and monetary union would boost the numbers employed in the Irish economy by about 25,000 within the first five years.  This might seem like a very impressive figure at first sight.  However, it <Col N="611" /> represents an increase in national employment of just 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Compare this with what has happened over the past five years.  The total number of people at work in this country increased by 150,000 between 1991 and 1996, even though many of those jobs are part-time.  On the face of it, it seems remarkable that employment should have risen by 13 per cent during a period which saw the most incredible turbulence in our exchange rate, yet employment will only rise at one sixth of that rate in the stable certainty of the new economic and monetary union, according to the ESRI. The question we in Ireland should be asking is this: if the gains are so small, is it worth taking the risk?  Let us not underestimate those risks.</P>
    <P>It is now apparent that, regardless of which party is in government, the UK is not going to join economic and monetary union in the socalled first wave.  It may not even join economic and monetary union during the second wave.  We like to proclaim our political independence from the British, but we cannot ignore the very close economic links that exist between this economy and the British economy.  In many ways the markets perceive these two islands as forming a kind of regional economic union within the European economic union.  The UK is our largest trading partner.  We do more trade with the UK than with all of the prospective first-wave members of economic and monetary union put together &mdash; France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria.  Our total trade with the English-speaking countries of the North Atlantic &mdash; the UK, the US and Canada &mdash; is almost twice the size of our trade with the economic and monetary union core group.</P>
    <P>We should also look closely at the composition of our trade with the continental European countries. Our export trade with the UK is widely spread across every area of industrial activity.  It is a labour-intensive trade that supports many thousands of jobs in the Irish economy.  By contrast, computers and cola concentrates account for two thirds of our total exports to Germany. There must be a reasonable suspicion that a good deal of this latter trade is hot air and that the figures are artificially puffed up by transfer pricing activities by the big transnational corporations.</P>
    <P>The current level of imports and exports is not an adequate basis on which to assess our vulnerability to a sharp movement in the sterling/punt exchange rate.  Irish industry competes with its UK counterpart not only on the export but on the home market.  There is virtually no product currently being produced and for sale in this country that could not be imported from the UK if the price was right.  A steep fall in the value of sterling could see Irish supermarket shelves filling up with products from Britain and Northern Ireland, such as meat, dairy products, biscuits, confectionery, beer, spirits and soft drinks.</P>
    <P>The vulnerability will be all the greater if the <Col N="612" /> major British supermarket chains make a determined move south of the Border in the next few years.  They show signs of planning this.  With improvements in transport, product from Belfast can reach most of the Irish population quicker than product from Cork.  If that product is cheaper because of currency devaluation, the impact on employment here will be severe. Unable to devalue, as we did in January 1993, we could be forced to withdraw ignominiously from the single currency to protect jobs and prevent the effective meltdown of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the benefits accruing from membership of the single currency are largely ascribed to lower interest rates.  The ESRI expects economic and monetary union to close the gap between Irish and German rates, with a reduction of approximately 1 per cent in Irish lending rates.  Not all commentators agree with this prediction.  For a start, international long-term interest rates are notoriously difficult to predict. Also some commentators have highlighted the possibility that the all powerful financial markets may give the euro a baptism of fire.  They could launch an immediate speculative attack on the new currency as a means of testing the resolve of economic and monetary union Governments to pursue hard policies to protect a hard currency. A speculative attack would see interest rates in the single currency area rising sharply to prevent the euro from falling.  After the events of recent years, nobody can doubt the power of the financial markets to test the resolve of central bankers and elected politicians.</P>
    <P>Such a scenario is all the more likely to happen if the Germans and the French continue to approach the issue from what appear to be totally different perspectives.  The French want a soft euro that does not hit their exports while the Germany want a hard euro that will command the same respect as the deutchmark.  This kind of fundamental disagreement does not auger well for the future success of the single currency.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to adopt a careful and cautious approach to the economic and monetary union venture.  By all means let us continue to manage our economy with sufficient fiscal prudence to satisfy the Maastricht convergence criteria; we should be doing that anyway.  However, let us be fully aware of the potential problems that this country could face if we enter a single currency without the British.</P>
    <P>If there has been little debate in the country about economic and monetary union there has been even less debate about the future direction of the EU.  Europe is now at a crossroads.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, highlighted this at his post summit press conference when he said that the EU was approaching &ldquo;a moment of truth on the nature of Europe&rdquo;.  Is the EU going to develop into a federation, a United States of Europe governed from Brussels, or is it going to develop into a looser grouping of nation states, bound together in an economic free trade area? The economic and monetary union project points <Col N="613" /> in the direction of an ever closer union.  Indeed, many supporters of a single currency believe the introduction of a euro is an essential step on the road to the creation of a full federation.  The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, said after the Dublin summit:</P>
    <P>There is no alternative to a united Europe. The European House will be built and it will be built now.</P>
    <P>The Italian finance minister, speaking after the summit said:</P>
    <P>European unity is the <i>sine qua non</i> for the creation of a structure which can take Europe and Europeans down the road to winning the economic and commercial confrontation with Japan and the USA.</P>
    <P>These are forthright statements of enthusiasm for the Euro-federalist ideal.  Yet the imminent enlargement of the union to 20 or 25 members could lead one to the opposite conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is probably feasible to integrate the current 15 member states into a federation.  However, what about countries such as Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia or Cyprus, with their different historical, political and economic backgrounds?  Is there any realistic prospect of grafting these states, and several others like them, into a United States of Europe within the next ten years?</P>
    <P>We should also not underestimate the problems closer integration will cause for the existing member states, with neighbouring countries holding diametrically opposite views on a range of important question.  For example, the Germans are in favour of a greater military role for the EU while their neighbours in Denmark are against it; the French are in favour of greater regulation of the labour market while their neighbours in Britain are against it; the Dutch are in favour of a liberal attitude to the sale of drugs while their neighbours in France are against it.  Reconciling such divergent attitudes will be difficult, not just on these issues but on a host of other areas.</P>
    <P>There must be an increasing likelihood, therefore, of the emergence of a two speed Europe, with different groups of countries opting for different levels of commitment, similar, for example, to the present Schengen arrangement. It is even suggested that we should have a kind of <i>à la carte</i> European Union.  John Major has suggested the possibility of member states choosing whether to participate in individual projects on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>The tensions between those who want to promote closer European integration and those who want to preserve national sovereignty are already evident.  We should not delude ourselves into thinking that only the truculent British have difficulty with the current European agenda.  The Danes, for example, have displayed little enthusiasm for closer integration, especially with regard to security.</P>
    <P>The European issue is currently being debated with great vigour across the water.  However, the <Col N="614" /> Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has not addressed this momentous issue meaningfully. We in Ireland regard ourselves as having a positive attitude to Europe, but how much depth is there to this view?  We are glad of the funding from Brussels for road building, tourism development, farm subsidies and training grants and are proud to see the country play an important role on the international stage, for example in taking on the Presidency of the European Union.  There is no doubt that the economy has done exceptionally well as a result of EU membership.  Living standards have risen dramatically in the past 25 years and we have succeeded in narrowing the wealth gap between ourselves and the continental European countries.</P>
    <P>However, what is our real attitude to Europe and to nationalism?  In most countries nationalists would be opposed to closer European integration. Does our Anglophobic version of nationalism dictate that we are in favour of European integration if the British are against it?</P>
    <P>These are no longer mere philosophical questions. Despite the difficulties I have mentioned there is a powerful dynamic in European affairs which is pushing the EU towards closer integration. There are understandable proposals to abolish the national veto on certain issues and there are necessary proposals for joint action on crime, the ultimate logic of which is the creation of a European police force with supranational powers.  There are proposals for a greater security and military dimension to the Union.  This could force us in Ireland to face up to some stark choices in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to accept huge cash transfers from the taxpayers of Germany and the Netherlands but would we be prepared to assist in their defence?  At present, we seem to be neither in favour of closer integration nor opposed to it.  We are content to drift with the crowd without any clear idea of where we are going.</P>
    <P>The nature of our relationship with Europe is set to change fairly dramatically over the next five to ten years regardless of what decisions we make in this country.  Freer world trade, combined with the pressures of enlargement, will probably result in a fall in the value of agricultural subsidies, with obvious implications for the farming sector here. Enlargement will alter the poverty profile of the European Union.  The new poor will be the Czechs and the Slovaks, the Poles and the Cypriots, not the Irish.  Instead of receiving billions of pounds from Brussels to build roads in Ireland, we could, conceivably, find ourselves contributing to the cost of building roads in some underdeveloped part of eastern Europe.  It will be very interesting to see if our much-vaunted enthusiasm for the European ideal will survive the fall-off in funding which is inevitable over the next few years.  It is now time that we had a proper debate on our future role in the European Union.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to initiate that debate.  He could do so by having his Department publish a discussion paper setting <Col N="615" /> out in straightforward language the broad options facing Ireland in Europe over the next ten years. That paper should clearly state for the first time the Government's own preferences in terms of the European options.  Does the Government want to see Ireland as a member of a full European federation, a United States of Europe? Does it favour a looser arrangement based on a free trade area or, does it want to see something in between?</P>
    <P>A great opportunity was missed with the publication earlier this year of the White Paper on Foreign Policy, &ldquo;Challenges and Opportunities Abroad&rdquo;.  That document devotes almost 60 pages to Ireland's relationship with the European Union.  It deals in detail with issues such as agricultural subsidies, fisheries policy, technology programmes and improvements in transport infrastructure.  Yet, nowhere does the document set out the basis principles on which our whole European policy is based.  The whole paper is tediously bland and uninteresting.  It says very little.  This situation has to be rectified.  It is up to the Government to lead and inform public opinion on this issue.  I wish it would now start.</P>

      <P>I applaud the achievements of the Dublin summit and the Irish Presidency across a whole range of issues.  We have heard from the Taoiseach and later we will hear from the Tánaiste on the successful outcome of measures brought forward to the Council for conclusion but I will focus on the progress made in the areas of social protection and social exclusion during the Presidency.  I refer to the Council's Declaration on Employment &mdash; The Jobs Challenge &mdash; at the Dublin summit and to the outline draft of a new treaty which was presented to the Council and in particular to the section on social policy, including the fight against social exclusion.</P>
      <P>Last year the Commission issued a communication entitled &ldquo;The Future of Social Protection&rdquo; and called for a debate on the common challenges facing all member states.  A wide range of issues was raised: how to address the ageing population, how to finance social insurance and assistance systems against a background of tight public budgets and how to cope with changes in work patterns and society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue stood out as being of great urgency and importance, not only for this country but for Europe as a whole, namely, the need to ensure that social protection systems contribute positively to the fight against unemployment.  To that end the Minister for Social Welfare hosted an informal meeting of Ministers responsible for social welfare in Dublin in July.  It was a fruitful discussion.  Agreement was achieved there that social welfare systems should, without deviating from their primary aim of providing an adequate replacement income to people suffering unemployment, take on new objectives and develop new positive supports.  Ministers discussed how to <Col N="616" /> ensure clear incentives to take up work; how to minimise the burden of social contributions which might inhibit employers from taking on workers; how to develop &ldquo;active&rdquo; measures to help reintegrate the unemployed; and the provision of supports to the long-term unemployed and marginalised groups.</P>
    <P>There was also a vigorous affirmation of the value of the well-developed European systems of social welfare.  Ministers were adamant that their response to problems such as high unemployment and the ageing population would not be to dismantle their comprehensive social security systems. They indicated clearly they favoured an agenda of reform, modernisation and development of the European social model, not its destruction as some commentators wedded to a blinkered world view seem to favour.</P>
    <P>Drawing on these views, the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, secured agreement at Council on 2 December to the adoption of a resolution which sets out the broad principles which social welfare systems should apply in the fight against unemployment. Ministers throughout the Union have affirmed their commitment to develop new approaches aimed at helping to prevent people falling into unemployment and to reintegrate those experiencing unemployment, particularly the long-term unemployed and those in marginalised groups.  Ministers also indicated they would co-operate, under the aegis of the Commission, in the exchange of information between member states on practices and policies in this area.</P>
    <P>This agreement at European level ties in with the strategies pursued on the domestic level by this Government in social welfare and employment policy.  A concern with the incentive to take up and stay in work has underlain the improvements we have made to child and income support and to the family income supplement.  In the area of active measures aimed at helping people reintegrate with the world of work, we have had successes with the back-to-work allowance and the second chance education schemes.  However there is much more we can do and learn from our European partners.  Denmark has taken the delivery of &ldquo;active measures&rdquo; to its long-term unemployed to a new level of development.</P>
    <P>This new commitment on the part of the social welfare Ministers of Europe is reflected in the Declaration on Employment adopted by the heads of Government last weekend in Dublin Castle.  I welcome the Declaration on Employment policy.  One of the most important achievements of the Irish Presidency has been to deepen and make more meaningful the involvement of the European Union with the issue of unemployment. For several years it has been part of the rhetoric of European summits to refer to unemployment as being the greatest problem facing the Union and its individual member states.  Our citizens might be forgiven if they felt cynical about this succession of fine statements.  Gradually the Union has been developing mechanisms which <Col N="617" /> have the potential to give substance to these commitments. Under the Irish Presidency, we have made progress to this end on several important fronts.  For instance, the completion of the second joint report on unemployment under the Essen process, coupled with the establishment of an employment committee, represents a significant achievement.  The Irish Presidency has overseen the inclusion in the draft revised treaty of the outline of a new employment chapter which holds out the prospect of further and deeper engagement by the Union with this problem.  Under the Irish Presidency, Europe has finally begun to put some flesh on the bones of its commitment to mobilise against unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that at the behest of the Irish Presidency we were able to agree that special attention should be given to the needs of those citizens who are most marginalised and alienated from the world of work.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House will know that action at EU level on social exclusion and poverty has been thwarted by the continued blocking by two member states of the Poverty 4 Programme which has been proposed by Commissioner Flynn.  In the face of this and in the light of the clear signals that there was no likelihood of these objections being lifted, the Irish Presidency had two objectives in relation to action against exclusion during its six months term.</P>
    <P>First, we wanted to address the issue of the competence of the Union to undertake actions in this area.  This was because, at least in part, those member states opposing action have been able to cite a lack of clear authority in this area.  In response to this, our aim is to seek clear language in the revised treaty establishing both the right and the duty of the Union to act in favour of Europe's most marginalised citizens.  To this end Ireland proposed a net treaty provision in this area within the Intergovernmental Conference. Our proposal sets out how members states should co-operate and exchange information and how the Commission can act to supplement national policies.  It is important to stress what we are proposing would not absolve national Governments of the primary responsibility to act to better the lives of their poorest citizens.  In explaining our position to ministerial colleagues and other interested parties, we referred to our National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  Many of the ideas and approaches embodied in the strategy grew out of what we learned from the three earlier EU poverty programmes.  We want that process of learning, exchange of ideas and new practice to continue. We also want to send out a signal that the great European agenda is meant to include all of Europe's citizens.</P>
    <P>The second strand of our approach to this issue has been to take every opportunity presented by the Presidency to impress on all sectors in Europe the importance of this issue and to urge that, if we cannot have the Poverty 4 Programme as proposed, we should develop other mechanisms to address it.  The European Parliament strongly <Col N="618" /> supports this stance and the Parliament's delegates to the Intergovernmental Conference have submitted their proposals for a new Treaty provision to address social exclusion which draws heavily on the earlier Irish text.</P>
    <P>The work of the Intergovernmental Conference will continue beyond the end of the Irish Presidency.  I am very pleased to note in the draft Treaty sent to the Dublin Summit, the firm commitment to address the issue of social exclusion at a later stage of the Intergovernmental Conference in the context of consideration of a new fully integrated social chapter.  It has to be admitted that not all member states are enthusiastic about our proposals.  However, we have received strong support for our approach from several member states, from the Commission and from the European Parliament.  I also know from my contacts during the Presidency that this approach commands widespread support from interest groups involved with poverty and exclusion right across Europe.  There is every incentive for us to continue seeking support for this initiative as the Intergovernmental Conference continues under the Dutch Presidency.</P>
    <P>A uni-dimensional European agenda whose main or only drive is towards the creation of a single market and monetary union carries not only great potential benefits but also certain dangers, for example, the danger that certain inequalities might be exacerbated, the danger that even in the face of general economic progress which benefits the majority the poorest citizens may lose out and the danger of increasing alienation from European ideals.</P>
    <P>The Union needs a strengthened social dimension if it is to counter such dangers.  At the end of six months of intensive involvement in action and debate on European issues, I remain convinced of this.  I also feel heartened that we have made progress in certain areas &mdash; for example, in relation to mobilising all forces against unemployment &mdash; and this is reflected in the Declaration on Employment adopted at the Summit last weekend.  There is still much to be done in other areas such as the fight against exclusion.  The draft Treaty produced for the Summit and the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference at which it will be fleshed out provide us with a platform from which to continue this work.</P>

      <P>I intend to focus on some of the <Col N="619" /> key foreign policy issues discussed at the European Council.  It is not possible in the time available to cover comprehensively all of the issues raised.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference was one of the main issues on the European Council's agenda.  The House will be aware that the Florence European Council had asked the Irish Presidency to produce an outline draft Treaty.  We have done this and I am very pleased to say it was welcomed by Heads of State and Government and accepted by the European Council as a good basis for the work which lies ahead.  The Presidency's complex task involved taking account of the views and priorities of all delegations. It is clear that during the remaining negotiations delegations, including the Irish delegation, are free to advocate their proposals and press their concerns.</P>
      <P>The Presidency's outline draft Treaty was also welcomed because it manages to maintain the level of ambition of the Conference despite what in many cases are widely differing views of member states.  It is a measure of the achievement of the Irish Presidency that the shape of the final outcome of the Conference is now clear, with the emergence of a Treaty which will equip the Union to address the challenges ahead and to respond to the aspirations of its citizens.  In this context, the Presidency sought to produce an outline draft Treaty which is clear and comprehensible to the public, having made very effort to explain the issues involved and to encourage public debate, believing that the process of explaining the Intergovernmental Conference is not one to be reserved for the end of the conference.</P>
      <P>The European Council had a very useful and constructive discussion on the basis of the Presidency's outline draft Treaty.  It also took note of the recent letter from the German Chancellor and the French President which represents an important contribution to the further work of the conference.  The European Council reaffirmed that the conference must, as it moves into its decisive phase, seek to achieve a balanced outcome in all areas which will measure up to the aims and ambitions set by it.  It recognised the importance of equipping the Union to face the challenges ahead as it prepares for the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The European Council noted with approval the progress made at the conference in identifying Treaty changes which would make the Union more responsive to the concerns of its citizens.  In this context, the most significant elements in the Presidency's document are the proposal for a new Treaty title on employment and strengthened provisions on the environment, consumer protection, subsidiarity and transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of employment, there appears to be growing agreement that Treaty changes cannot create jobs on their own and the provisions on employment should be strengthened to provide a coherent basis for member states to co-operate <Col N="620" /> and to provide mutual support for their respective national efforts to promote employment. On the question of the environment, there is considerable support for strengthening the Treaty provisions as suggested by the Presidency by, for example, the inclusion of the objective of sustainable development and better integration of environmental considerations into other Union policies.  There is also growing agreement that the Union should be more transparent in its operation and its commitment to transparency should be reflected explicitly in the Treaty as proposed in the Presidency document.</P>
    <P>The European Council also welcomed the importance the Presidency document attaches to the area of Justice and Home Affairs and, notably, the proposals designed to strengthen significantly the Union's capacity for action in the fight against drugs and international crime, including terrorism, offences against children and trafficking in persons.  It reaffirmed the aim of developing the external action of the Union and recognised that the Union must enhance its capacity to ensure that its external action is coherent and effective in all aspects if it is to play a role in the world commensurate with its responsibilities and economic capacity.  The Presidency's document will serve as a basis for further negotiations in relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Union's external economic relations.  On the question of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the document puts forward proposals for streamlining procedures in respect of the three, interconnected phases of the foreign policy process &mdash; preparation, adoption and implementation of decisions.</P>
    <P>On the question of external economic relations, we have proposed a limited extension of the Union's external competence to ensure that the Union can defend effectively, notably in the World Trade Organisation, the interests of member states and of its economic operators on services, intellectual property and direct foreign investment.  The European Council also recognised, as the Presidency made clear in its outline draft Treaty, that institutional issues will be central to the next phase of the negotiations and that the Union needs to improve its ability to take decisions and to act.  The Presidency text, responding to the views of many delegations that certain sensitive institutional issues could only be settled definitively at a later stage of the conference, did not include a text in Treaty form on those issues.  Rather it offered a clear analysis of the issues and identified options with a view to the further work of the conference.</P>
    <P>The European Council noted progress in examining proposals for Treaty provisions to permit more flexible approaches leading to enhanced co-operation in appropriate areas, subject to agreed <Col N="621" /> conditions, and emphasised the importance of this issue.</P>

      <P>I said at the outset that I could not cover every aspect.  There are 1,256 suggestions in regard to the Intergovernmental Conference and we will have an opportunity of going through these in detail at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and in the House.  The Government stated clearly both inside and outside the House that the retention of a Commissioner is very important for a country like Ireland.</P>
      <P>The review at the Intergovernmental Conference of the European Union's structures and procedures is being undertaken in the perspective of future enlargement of the Union.  The European Union has recognised that enlargement is both a political necessity and a historic opportunity for peace and prosperity in Europe.  The momentum of the enlargement process has been successfully maintained during our Presidency, with confirmation by the European Council of the timetable for the enlargement process as set out at Madrid. The European Council welcomed also the Commission's intention to present proposals for an overall reinforcement of the pre-accession strategy.</P>
      <P>The ongoing process of developing the EU's relations with the applicant countries has been an important priority of our Presidency, in the lead up to the accession negotiations.  As is traditional at the European Council, a meeting was held in the context of the structured dialogue with the Heads of State and Government and Foreign Ministers of the associated states.  This provided an opportunity to brief them on the European Council and to review relations between the Union and the associated states.  In addition, the structured dialogue on this occasion, as the Taoiseach has mentioned, included a discussion of the common threat posed by organised crime, including drug trafficking and trafficking in persons. Discussion of a topic of this kind between member states of the Union and the applicant states <i>en marge</i> of a European Council was an important innovation of our Presidency and well received by all participants as a practical step in furthering co-operation between the Union and the associated states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council had a discussion on Russia and Ukraine, both of which were priorities <Col N="622" /> of our Presidency.  In relation to Russia, progress has been made on ratifying the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement which provides the essential framework for developing relations between the Union and Russia.  In addition, the Presidency has made progress in implementing the EU Russia Action Plan, a report on which was made to the General Affairs Council on 6 December.</P>
    <P>Recent positive developments in Chechnya, including the withdrawal of Russian troops, the agreement on a framework for relations and the forthcoming local elections have been sadly overshadowed by the brutal murder on 17 December of six International Red Cross humanitarian aid workers.  I have requested the President of the ICRC to convey to the families and friends of the victims the profound sympathy of the Government and the Irish people.  It is of the utmost importance, however, that the crime should not derail the considerable efforts currently under way to achieve a lasting, negotiated settlement to the conflict in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>The adoption by the General Affairs Council on 6 December of an EU-Ukraine Action Plan demonstrates the importance which the EU attaches to its relations with Ukraine.  The European Council took note of the plan and reinforced the Union's desire to develop closer co-operation with this important partner. Members will also be aware that the situation in Belarus is of serious concern to the European Union.  Our concerns have been conveyed to the Belarussian authorities and the EU has proposed to President Lukashenko that a factfinding mission to Belarus should take place to investigate the position there.</P>
    <P>The European Council met exactly one year after the signing in Paris of the peace agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and marked the occasion with a comprehensive and substantive declaration on the peace process in former Yugoslavia. The European Council fully endorsed the outcome of the ministerial meetings held in Paris on 14 November 1996 and in London on 4 and 5 December 1996.  It supported the guiding principles of the Civilian Consolidation Plan for a two-year period as well as the detailed action plans which elaborate the activities and obligations of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the international community for 1997.</P>
    <P>The European Council underlined the importance which it attaches to effective co-ordination of civilian aspects of implementation during the consolidation period and reiterated the Union's strong support for the activities of the High Representative, Carl Bildt, whose co-ordinating role has been strengthened for 1997.  The European Council also expressed its support for the continuing role of the OSCE, notably in supervising municipal elections in 1997 and in relation to the Royaumont Stability Process.  In addition, the Union's support for the International Criminal Tribunal was stressed.</P>
    <P>Economic recovery and the return of refugees <Col N="623" /> will be priority areas during the consolidation period.  The EU is committed to continue to make a substantial contribution to the economic reconstruction effort on condition that the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrate their commitment to the reconstruction effort and comply fully with the provisions of the peace agreement.  In this context, the European Council welcomed the plans of the European Commission and the World Bank for the convening of a further International Donors' Conference in early 1997.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Middle East, the European Council represented the culmination of very intense activity by the Irish Presidency on this issue.  Against a background of deteriorating relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours, we tried to enhance the Union's role in the region so that the EU could play a full part, alongside the US, in restoring momentum to the peace process. It is generally recognised that we succeeded in these aims and in empowering the Union to respond effectively during this critical phase.  We did so through my visit to the region on 6 and 7 October, through the visit of the Troika to the region the following month, by the establishment of a special envoy, through public statements such as the Declaration on the Middle East adopted by the General Affairs Council on 1 October last and by the talks we had with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Arafat, the Lebanese Prime Minister and the Secretary General of the Arab League during their visits to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Dublin European Council, therefore, convened against the background of a worsening situation in the Middle East peace process, but one which the Union was in a position to address constructively and even handedly as a friend of all the parties involved.  It reaffirmed the Union's support for the principles of a just and lasting peace, notably land-for-peace and self-determination for the Palestinians, with all that this implies.  In addition, the Council outlined a number of areas where concrete action is necessary, calling for an early resolution of the deadlock over Hebron, for Israel to remove all restrictions regarding the blockade of Palestinian territories, except where its security interests were clearly involved, and for negotiations to proceed on the basis of international agreements already concluded between the parties.  The issue of Israeli settlements was also addressed by the Council, which stated that these settlements contravene international law and are a major obstacle to peace.</P>
    <P>The European Council reaffirmed the high priority attached by the European Union to its relations with its Mediterranean partner countries and expressed satisfaction with the significant and positive developments in all aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.  The adoption of the MEDA regulation which provides the means for financial co-operation with the Mediterranean partner countries was a particular achievement of <Col N="624" /> the Irish Presidency.  Recalling the objectives set out in the Barcelona Declaration regarding the creation of a Euro Mediterranean Free Trade area, the Council reiterated its commitment to complete a network of association agreements with the Mediterranean partners as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Following the practice set at the Madrid and Florence summits, I hosted a working dinner for Mrs. Tansu Ciller, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Turkey, at which we had a frank and useful exchange of views on the current state and future development of EU-Turkey relations.  It was emphasised to Mrs. Ciller that the European Union attached value and importance to relations with Turkey and wished to see this relationship develop in a positive and constructive manner.  I and my fellow Ministers underlined the serious concerns within the European Union on the human rights situation in Turkey and impressed on Foreign Minister Ciller the need for the Turkish Government to take measures to ensure the highest standards of human rights.  The tensions between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean were also discussed at some length.</P>
    <P>Foreign Minister Ciller conveyed the strong wish of Turkey to have close and constructive relations with the Union, leading eventually to full membership of the European Union.  The Customs Union Agreement between the EU and Turkey represented a unique and close partnership between Turkey and the Union and Mrs. Ciller stressed the serious concern within Turkey that the European Union had not fully implemented its obligations under the Customs Union Agreement.  On human rights, Mrs. Ciller indicated that improvement in this area was a priority for her and she was committed to achieving progress on the issue.  As regards tensions between Greece and Turkey, she emphasised that Turkey wanted and was fully ready to discuss these issues in bilateral talks with Greece to resolve their disputes peacefully.  Along with my fellow Ministers, I took the opportunity to stress that Turkey could make a constructive contribution to international efforts to encourage a political settlement to the Cyprus question and urged the Turkish side to use their influence to assist the search for a solution.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the European Council should have focused on Africa and we welcome the election of the first ever Secretary General of the UN from Sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
    <P>The Great Lakes region has been a major focus for Ireland throughout the Presidency and one to which we have devoted very considerable time. This is also reflected in the extensive discussions by the Council on this issue.  Focusing on the humanitarian situation, the European Council stressed the need for fast and decisive action to address the continuing humanitarian emergency in the region, particularly in eastern Zaire.  We also recognised that the rapid pace of developments there required a flexible approach.  In <Col N="625" /> addition, bearing in mind the decision of Canada &mdash; announced at the same time as our meeting was taking place &mdash; to withdraw from the temporary multinational force for eastern Zaire with effect from 31 December, the summit stressed the urgent need for the Security Council to address the implications of these developments for the implementation of UN Resolutions 1078 and 1080 of 1996.  Recalling the enormous contribution the EU had already made to meeting the humanitarian needs of the region, the summit reaffirmed the commitment of the Union to continue to play its full part in this regard.</P>
    <P>Consultations are now taking place in New York on the implications of the Canadian decision.  Canada's view is that the stated mission for which the multinational force was deployed is now in large part accomplished and that the conditions in the Great Lakes region are now such as to allow civilian leadership and agencies to carry out the remaining humanitarian tasks themselves.  The evidence from the humanitarian agencies does seem to suggest that access for them, while still problematic in places, is improving.  The technical position is that UN Resolution 1080 of 15 November which sanctioned the multinational force is still in place and it is a matter for the Security Council to decide on how to proceed in light of Canada's withdrawal as lead country.</P>
    <P>A major consideration for the Government &mdash; and I am sure this is a concern shared throughout the House &mdash; is the safety and security of aid workers.  For the Government's part, therefore, I want to make clear to the House that should the judgment of the Security Council be that a force of some kind, or an operation involving military and logistical support to civilian humanitarian efforts, remain necessary, our offer of a contingent of troops fully stands.  I am sure this is a position shared also by the House.  As we have said throughout, the central challenge continues to be how best and most efficiently to get help to those still in need and that will remain our focus.  The European Union, with Ireland playing its full part, has been the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the region and will continue, as the Summit Conclusions make explicit, to contribute fully and urgently to the efforts ahead in this regard.  The Irish Presidency will remain in close collaboration with the humanitarian agencies about how that can best be done.</P>
    <P>The Council also reflected the Union's consistent assessment that a humanitarian response alone is not sufficient and must be accompanied by political action.  The summit welcomed the initiative of the Heads of State of the region to resolve the problems in eastern Zaire by peaceful means.  The outcome of the Nairobi Summit of Heads of State on Monday represents a further important development, particularly with the engagement of President Mandela on this issue. This is a significant initiative which, taken with the arrival back in Kinshasa of President Mobutu, holds considerable potential.  The Union also supports <Col N="626" /> the early convening of an international conference under the joint auspices of the UN and the Organisation of African Unity to address within a global approach the root causes of the crisis and thus bring about a peaceful and comprehensive resolution to the conflicts of the region.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to discuss in detail the range of issues on which achievement has been made during the Irish Presidency.  I mention Hong Kong where the Council noted the Union's interest in its future peace and prosperity and the right of its people to representative democratic institutions. I should also mention the development of a common position on Cuba, the conclusion of an Action Plan in respect of Canada and the elaboration of further measures in relation to East Timor.  The range of activity undertaken under the Irish Presidency demonstrates the real contribution which the European Union can make to international peace and stability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the Government's 1997 spending Estimates presented last week.  I welcome also the opportunity to reject some of the misleading and unjustified criticism of Government spending policy since the Estimates were published.  Some of that criticism extended beyond the Estimates and called into question the soundness of the Government's management of the public finances and the economy.  It has gone so far as to have us believe the Government's budgetary policy will lead us into economic crisis.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The public finances and the economy have never been in a healthier state. I intend today to set the record straight on the facts.</P>
      <P>I will deal with spending in 1996.  The estimated outturn for gross current expenditure in 1996 is £12,268 million, an increase of £181 million over the budget estimate of £12,087 million.  This outturn represents an increase of 6.7 per cent in nominal terms or 4.8 per cent in real terms over the 1995 base figure of £11,502 million, the 1995 actual outturn of £11,642 million less the £140 million exceptional equal treatment payments which we decided to exclude from the base.  The figure of £12,268 million takes account of all the Supplementary Estimates voted by the Dáil. However, it is quite likely that, as usual, savings in departmental spending will emerge by end year.  Taking those into account the increase in spending could be half a percentage point lower than the figures I quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statement on the publication of the 1997 Estimates, I dealt comprehensively with the reasons spending overruns occurred this year. The circumstances which caused the greatest part of the excess spending in 1996 were exceptional and unavoidable.  I give the House a categorical assurance that the spending overruns this year do <Col N="627" /> not signal any diminution in the Government's commitment to control public spending.</P>
    <P>The single biggest increases in current spending have been for the EU agricultural disallowances, or beef fines as they are known, and for additional spending due to the BSE crisis.  Neither this Government nor any other Government could have avoided this spending.  Those two items alone have added £113 million to gross current spending this year, more than half of the total estimated excess of £181 million.  The actual budgetary impact is reduced since I provided for £50 million for the beef fines in my original budget.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the Government's ability to contain spending has been curtailed by events which were outside its control.  That is not an excuse, it is a fact.  I challenge anyone, particularly those critics on the Opposition benches, to tell me how they would have avoided incurring this expenditure.  The allocation of additional resources to deal effectively with these problems was unavoidable.  If we had not done so on BSE, for example, I am sure those critics who are now accusing us of reckless spending would be the first to accuse us of failing to deal with a major threat to the economy.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for the Government's decision to increase spending this year in a limited number of other areas where there was an overwhelming case for so doing.  An example is the anti-crime package.  I do not recall anyone on the Opposition benches criticising the extra spending involved when that package was launched.  If anything the Government was accused of not having done enough.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to pay the Christmas bonus to social welfare recipients at a cost of £38 million.  We can hardly be accused of reckless spending here.  Are the Opposition parties prepared to say the Government should have refused to pay the bonus this year?  Every Government since 1980, when the bonus was first introduced, has paid it, even when the economy and the public finances were nowhere near as healthy as they are now.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to deal with 1997 expenditure. I stated on the publication of the 1997 Abridged Estimates and Summary Public Capital Programme that the Government had agreed a provision of £13,014 million for gross non-capital supply services expenditure post-budget.  The principal ways in which additional resources provided for in the Abridged Estimates will be used is as follows.  Significant additional resources have been allocated for FÁS training and employment schemes.  This reflects the measures announced in the 1996 budget, including improved targeting of the community employment scheme at the long-term unemployed, the special jobs initiative which provides a whole-time jobs option for 1,000 places on the scheme and an increased level of training in projects supported by the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Community employment will provide 40,000 parttime places and 1,000 whole-time places in 1997.</P>
    <P>Turning to education, the 1997 Estimate provides for a £70 million increase over the expected 1996 outturn.  This provides for the cost of advances in the sector as well as for a number of recent initiatives.  At primary level provision is made for the continuation of several important measures including the early start and breaking the cycle pilot initiatives for disadvantaged areas and the substance abuse programme.  The primary pupil-teacher ratio will be reduced to 22:1 from 1 September 1997.  At second level provision is made for extra participation in the restructured and improved senior cycle.  A third level provision is made for additional participation in third level courses and the establishment of new third level institutions including Dun Laoghaire regional technical college and Tipperary Rural and Business Development Initiative.</P>
    <P>Gross current spending on health will increase by £115 million in 1997 over the 1996 expected outturn.  Provision is made for the full cost of developments phased in over 1995 and 1996.  This will enable health agencies to continue with a wide range of programmes approved by Government including action on mental handicap, physical disability, psychiatric services, the elderly, child care and AIDS-HIV.</P>
    <P>Gross current spending on social welfare is set to increase by £127 million over 1996.  The additional resources provide for the full year cost of 1996 budget improvements, an easing of the qualifying criteria for some programmes and a response to the increased demand for certain programmes and services mainly caused by demographic factors.  Those additional costs are partly offset by a projected fall in the live register.  Provision of £39 million is also included for the payment of a Christmas bonus in 1997.  This is being included in the Abridged Estimates Volume for the first time.  If I had followed practice up to now, the increase in spending in 1997 shown in the Estimates would, as a consequence, have been less.</P>
    <P>Ireland's total official development assistance spending in 1997 is estimated to amount to approximately £122 million or 0.31 per cent of GNP, a very significant increase on the 1996 figure of £107 million.</P>
    <P>Turning to agriculture, increased resources for agriculture show the Government's commitment to taking the necessary measures to minimise the impact of BSE.  To help tackle BSE better, the Government has provided the necessary finance including provision for the introduction of a cattle tracing system.  There are also substantial increases in the provisions for restructuring agriculture through farmers' early retirement, the rural environment protection scheme and forestry development.</P>
    <P>I made clear when the Estimates were presented that they did not include a provision for any further increase in public service pay costs beyond those provided under the current PCW <Col N="629" /> agreement.  Neither did they include any additional provision for the social inclusion dimension of a new national partnership although it is clear from what I have said that they provide more resources for measures which will help in some way in achieving social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Since then, proposals for a new public service pay agreement have been negotiated.  They involve an additional cost of £24 million in 1997. The negotiations towards a new national programme and, in particular, its social inclusion dimension have been complex and wide-ranging. They have been carried out with maximum commitment and dispatch by the Government and the social partners.  The additional cost of the social inclusion dimension remains to be finally settled. I will provide for the additional costs of social inclusion in my 1997 Budget.  I stress that I will not announce massive additional spending in 1997.</P>
    <P>A major element of the social inclusion dimension will be the costs of the social welfare measures to be included in the next three budgets. A substantial provision towards the cost of the 1997 budget social welfare package, greater than the £80 million provided in my 1996 budget, is already included in the figure of £13,014 million. To that figure falls to be added the £24 million cost of the new public service pay agreement, giving a figure of £13,038 million.  The final budget day figure will be somewhat higher than this, when the additional 1997 provision for social inclusion is decided.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to be able to announce now what the post-budget figure will be, as I did this time last year but, for the reasons stated, clearly I am unable to do so.  However, the House can rest assured that the figure I will announce in my budget will not be inconsistent with the overall 1997 budgetary framework already decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>In 1997, Exchequer capital expenditure will amount to £1,574 million, all of which is allocated in the Abridged Estimates and Public Capital Programme, which I announced on 9 December.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the 1997 Public Capital Programme reflect the ongoing investment needs of the economy and are in line with the Government's priorities in these areas: in Environment, an additional £55 million is allocated to national and county roads; £25 million extra to the local authority housing programme and following the Government's decision on the anti-crime package, £30 million extra is being allocated to the prisons building programme in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer-funded Public Capital Programme will increase by 6.5 per cent in nominal terms and 3.6 per cent in real terms over the 1996 outturn, when Supplementary Estimates have been taken into account.  It is estimated that, overall, the 1997 Public Capital Programme will result in volume growth of 9 per cent in publicly funded construction projects, which should help to sustain the healthy level of activity and employment in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I also stated last week that the Government has decided the overall framework within which my 1997 budget will be prepared.  That framework is centred on a general Government deficit which will be significantly lower than the target of 2.6 per cent of GDP set in my 1996 budget &mdash; itself comfortably within the Maastricht guidelines. The level of the general Government deficit is the crucial measure of economic and budgetary performance. All other measures are secondary to it and 1997 will be a most important year as next year's outturn on the general Government deficit will be used to determine our eligibility to participate in economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The fact that I can confidently predict that in both 1996 and 1997 the general Government deficit will be significantly below the Maastricht Treaty guideline of 3 per cent of GDP shows that the public finances are firmly under control. Deputy Bertie Ahern, on publication of the Estimates, remarked it is generally agreed that prudent management of the economy requires a substantial safety margin, given the Maastricht guideline of 3 per cent.  I agree; the Government's programme stated two years ago it is appropriate in the case of Ireland that the deficit be maintained at a level comfortably within the Maastricht benchmark.  The Deputy need not fear that the 1996 outturn, or indeed my 1997 budget, will fail to meet that Government aim.</P>
    <P>The decided 1997 budget framework also allows for significant tax reductions, as promised in our Government programme.  It is not the case, as some have argued, that spending increases are being allowed to crowd out tax reductions.</P>
    <P>In my 1996 budget I announced tax measures with a full-year cost of £266 million, of which £225 million was for income tax and employee PRSI measures.</P>
    <P>The concerns expressed inside and outside this House about the &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; increase in planned spending in 1997 are overstated.  Certainly, taking 1996 and 1997 together, the increase in gross current spending in real terms will exceed the target of an annual average rate of 2 per cent for those years.  However, the 2 per cent target should not be taken out of the context in which it was set in our Government programme.  That programme said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...the Government is committed to firm management of the public finances throughout its period of office.  In particular we accept the public debt philosophy and targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>...the implementation and phasing of all commitments in this programme will depend on their consistency with the requirements that the Exchequer borrowing requirement be kept prudently below 3% of GNP and the debt/GDP ratio be steadily reduced towards 60%.</P>
    <P>These are the most important budgetary targets set in our programme.  They have been, and will continue to be met.  However, this does not imply <Col N="631" /> any complacency on the Government's part about the level of spending.  We remain resolutely committed to firm control of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is important not to lose sight of the fact that the amount of national output absorbed by public expenditure remains well below the levels of the early 1980s.  Gross current supply services spending now accounts for approximately 34 per cent of GNP compared to about 40 per cent in the early 1980s.  Moreover, the percentage increase in real gross non-capital supply services expenditure in 1997 will be less than the real projected increase in GNP.  Therefore, that spending will actually fall as a proportion of GNP next year as it did this year and last.</P>
    <P>The Government is alert to the dangers of allowing spending to rise too quickly in times of fast economic growth, as we are now experiencing. We are very conscious of the danger of building up an unsustainable expenditure base on the back of the exceptional economic growth and revenue buoyancy which we have achieved in recent years.  The Government is satisfied, however, that the level of increase in public spending it plans for 1997 will not add excessively to the existing expenditure base.  As I said, the 1997 Estimates largely reflect the cost of continuing the existing level of departmental services with some limited improvements in certain services to reflect the Government's policy priorities.</P>
    <P>We are determined that the benefits of the current record economic growth will be shared by all sections of our society, especially those in greatest need.  Our Government programme is not simply about budgetary policy.  It contains clear statements of policy on areas such as education, health, welfare, housing, and economic development measures.  Implementing these policies requires additional resources.  For that reason I have no difficulty defending the increase in spending provided in the 1997 Estimates and the modest, targeted improvement in public services consistent with our programme which it reflects.</P>
    <P>Since the Abridged Estimates were presented, proposals for a new public service pay agreement have been negotiated.  The Abridged Estimates Volume includes provisions for PCW commitments on general rounds and local bargaining increases.  General round increases will add £131 million to the pay bill in 1997 as a result of the carry-over cost of the general rounds paid in 1996 and the 1 per cent payable from 1 January 1997. A sum of £110 million is provided in the Vote for Remuneration for the cost of the outcome of local bargaining discussions with teachers, nurses and other groups who have not yet completed negotiations.  Overall, these commitments will add £241 millon or approximately 5 per cent to the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1997.</P>
    <P>The pace of settlements in the PCW local bargaining negotiations throughout the public service in 1996 was slow.  I hope these negotiations can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion at an early date.  I need hardly remind all concerned <Col N="632" /> that settlements must be within the cost parameters set out in the PCW, as this is what underlies the Estimates provision.</P>
    <P>The new pay agreement, which will form part of the new national partnership, if accepted by all the parties, is intended to provide certainty on pay costs in the public service to the end of September 2000.  The pay agreement will result in a 9.25 per cent increase in pay rates over 39 months.  The increases will be the same as those in the private sector.  However, in the case of the public service, there has been some recognition of the difficult position which the Government faces with the carry-over costs from the PCW.  Instead of the full 2.5 per cent first phase applying from the end of the current agreement, the increase will apply in the public service only to the first £200 per week from 1 July 1997.  This will secure savings of £36 million in 1997 while protecting the position of lower paid public servants.  They will receive the full 2.5 per cent increase from 1 July 1997 on earnings up to £200 per week, that is approximately £5 per week.  The balance of the increase, on income above £200 per week, will be paid in April 1998.  Furthermore, the local level negotiations provision of 2 per cent, which applies from the middle of the second year in the private sector, applies in the third year of the agreement in the public service and is linked to the agreed process for delivery of the public service modernisation programme.  As I remarked earlier, the additional cost in 1997 of the new pay agreement will be approximately £24 million.</P>
    <P>I stress that the pay terms in the new partnership form only one part of the overall package on pay, taxation and public service modernisation. The public service has a vital contribution to make to our national economic and social wellbeing. To maximise this contribution, it will need to strengthen its capacity to manage strategically, to respond more flexibly to changing service needs, to deploy resources to best effect and to operate cost effectively.  Underpinning these high-level aims, we need to develop new and more effective approaches to performance management appropriate to the particular needs of each sector of the public service.</P>
    <P>The positive commitment by all sides to the modernisation of the public service as part of the new partnership is very welcome.  The Government places great importance on securing delivery of its plans for reform in the various parts of the public service.  With the other social partners, we are committed to developing the necessary action programmes in an open and participative manner.</P>
    <P>When presenting my Estimates for 1996 this time last year, I expressed concern at the growth in the size of the public service in recent years. Since then we have succeeded in keeping numbers growth to levels consistent with the Estimates provisions taking account of priority social and economic needs.  Increases have been sanctioned by the Government only where there is an overriding social and economic need.  Obviously <Col N="633" /> we cannot provide improved services in the health and education sectors without having some increases in numbers.  Numbers in education have increased by an estimated 350 during 1996 and in health by approximately 600.  We have also provided for the recruitment of extra gardaí in 1996 and 1997, as part of the anti-crime package. Garda numbers increased in 1996 by about 140. However, numbers have fallen in other sectors in 1996, for example in the Defence Forces, in line with planned restructuring of the forces, which involves voluntary early retirement and recruitment.</P>
    <P>The number of civil servants has also fallen by about 250.  The overall increase in numbers in the public service in 1996 is estimated at about 600, which compares favourably with an average increase of approximately 3,700 per annum in the preceding two years.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have linked the Estimates to the state of the economy.  That presents no problem for me since the economy is and will remain remarkably buoyant.  Indeed, some alarmist comments forecasting that economic disaster could result from the policies reflected in the 1997 Estimates are unfounded.  It would be useful to briefly remind the House of some facts that show the current robust state of the economy under this Government's stewardship.</P>
    <P>The economic background to this debate remains positive.  While all the data for 1996 is not yet in, GNP is expected to grow by about 6 per cent this year&mdash;considerably in excess of the average for our EU or OECD partners.  This is the third successive year of high growth, which contrasts with the rather sluggish performance in the industrial countries generally over the same period.  In contrast to earlier years, domestic demand has been the major contributor to overall growth.  Personal consumption has been particularly strong.  Low interest rates, improved labour market conditions and increases in real disposable income have contributed to buoyant consumer confidence, which is reflected in consumer spending.  Retail sales in the first eight months of 1996 were nearly 7 per cent higher in volume terms than in same period of 1995.  Car sales have been particularly strong, with new car registrations estimated to have grown by 32 per cent over 1996 as a whole.</P>
    <P>Investment has recorded a further substantial increase this year, stimulated by a combination of low interest rates, foreign direct investment, EU Structural Funds and the general economic upswing. Capital goods imports in the first seven months have been buoyant, while the available indicators for the building and construction sector point to a further acceleration of activity this year.  This is not a pattern of growth driven by higher public spending.</P>
    <P>Price stability is a cornerstone of sustainable growth, and the economy's recent inflation performance has been satisfactory.  The consumer price index rose by 1.6 per cent on average in 1996.  The underlying inflation rate, which <Col N="634" /> excludes mortgage interest payments, averaged 1.9 per cent in 1996 &mdash; the lowest rate recorded since 1960.  Manufacturing output prices have also been quite subdued, falling by 0.3 per cent in the 12 months to October.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a trading nation and the health of the external sector is essential to our overall economic well-being.  Export growth has moderated this year, reflecting the sharp slowdown in some of our main European markets in the first half of this year, and also the impact of the BSE crisis on agricultural exports.  As a result, export growth will be somewhat lower than in 1996, at over 10 per cent in real terms.  Import growth will also be over 10 per cent in volume.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding economic performance over the last number of years has led to a significant rise in employment.  Over the past three years, non-agricultural employment, excluding schemes, has increased by an average of 42,000 per year.  In 1996 alone, some 50,000 new jobs are estimated to have been created.  The increase has been strongest in the services sector while industry has also recorded appreciable job gains, particularly in high-technology areas of manufacturing.</P>
      <P>The strong performance of the economy this year has laid the foundation for continued growth over the coming years.  Looking ahead, the prospects for 1997 to 1999 remain bright.  Members will be familiar with the broad details of the outlook from presentations given by me and by officials of my Department during the past few months.  This outlook is drawn from my Department's most recent medium-term benchmark projection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international economic environment underlying this projection is expected to be broadly favourable.  Growth in the European economy is expected to be of the order of 2.5 per cent on average over the next three years, which is in line with EU Commission forecasts.  Inflation in our main trading partners is expected to remain relatively subdued, so that there will be little externally generated inflation impetus. Given this background, we can expect a continuation of growth rates well above the EU or OECD average, but with some moderation from the truly exceptional increases seen in recent years.  GNP growth is expected to be around 5.5 per cent in 1997 and 4.5 per cent on average in 1998 and 1999.  Inflation is expected to remain subdued, at slightly over 2 per cent.  Employment <Col N="635" /> growth is expected to average 38,000 per year, with the increase next year somewhat higher than this average.</P>
    <P>While the outlook remains positive, there are domestic and external risks to this outlook.  Domestically, failure to maintain the combination of wage moderation and low budget deficits, which have underpinned our performance for a decade now, would have negative consequences for business and consumer confidence, interest rates, investment and economic activity.  However, the obvious success of our current approach underlines the need for continuation and consolidation of these policies, a course which the Government is determined to follow.  The principal external risk is that the recovery of growth in our main trading partners would be slower than expected, although the forecasts currently available could not be considered to be excessively optimistic.  In fact, they suggest no more than a return to the long-term average rate of growth in Europe.</P>
    <P>As regards inflation, our performance this year has been encouraging.  However, we are no longer among the best inflation performers in Europe and we do not have any scope for complacency in this regard if we wish to meet the Maastricht criterion on inflation in 1997.</P>
    <P>I would like to address concerns which have recently been expressed regarding inflationary pressures.  Particular attention has focused on the Central Bank's recommendations in its recently published winter bulletin, where it noted that low inflation requires a firm exchange rate and modest wage increases.  It recommended that fiscal policy should not be expansionary with any tax reductions being matched by spending restraint. It also adverted to the need to plan for the requirements of the Stability Pact within economic and monetary union and the future reduction of Structural Funds.  I agree with these recommendations from the Central Bank because they reflect my concerns.  Developments this year have been consistent with the Central Bank's prescription. In line with the policy stance set out by the Central Bank in its 1996 monetary policy statement, the exchange rate has been firm.  The effective exchange rate has appreciated.  Its average to the end of November this year was 1.8 per cent higher than the annual average for 1995.</P>
    <P>As regards wage developments, the pay element of the draft agreement with the social partners represents a continuation of the wage moderation of the past decade, which has been such an important contributor to our current economic buoyancy.</P>
    <P>The fiscal position this year has tightened with the general Government deficit now expected to be around 1.5 per cent of GDP, which is less than last year's outturn, despite slower growth.  Looking to the 1997 fiscal policy stance, the proposed changes in taxation, which have been discussed with the social partners, will underpin moderate wage developments, as recommended by the <Col N="636" /> Central Bank and reflected in the proposed pay provisions in the new national programme.</P>
    <P>Taking the longer term perspective, I have been conscious for some time of the need to provide for the requirements of the Stability Pact and also the possible reduction of Structural Funds post 1999.  The new system of planning the budget in a multi-year framework, which I announced in the 1996 budget, is aimed at putting the public finances into this longer term perspective.  Fiscal strategy for the medium term will take explicit account of the need to meet the requirements of the Stability Pact and of the post 1999 Structural Funds position.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Estimates do not signal any weakening of the Government's commitment to fiscal discipline.  On the contrary, they are part of an overall budgetary framework which provides for a level of general Government deficit comfortably within the Maastricht guidelines.  This framework will build on the significant progress already achieved in the prudent management of the public finances and will help to sustain the confidence which has been a major factor in the impressive performance of the economy in recent years.</P>
    <P>I commend the 1997 Abridged Estimates Volume and Public Capital Programme to the House.</P>

      <P>The Estimates debate is sometimes an occasion for a more general review of Government performance but having had the opportunity to speak on Northern Ireland in the decommissioning debate and on Europe earlier this morning, I intend to devote my contribution to what I consider to be the Government's serious mismanagement of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Government's complacency and self-satisfaction over the state of the economy are misplaced. It has done little either to create or sustain the boom, which started in 1993-94.  The Government simply inherited it, managed it, and is in danger of squandering it.  With economic and monetary union looming, this economy is on a tightrope.  We cannot afford any mistakes.  If the course of the economy is not corrected soon, we will head for the rocks because of the utter political recklessness of this Government as an election approaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes much of Ireland's adherence to the Maastricht criteria.  I am sure he is aware from the Report on Convergence in the European Union in 1996 of 6 November that the cyclically adjusted deficit was estimated by the Commission Services at 3.6 per cent.  This year's budget target was much too high in an underlying sense.  The Minister can say in his defence that the budget outcome will be much below target, and therefore the 3.6 per cent figure will be revised downwards.  That may be true, but it shows that the management of the national finances is not as prudent as he makes out.  It sends out a bad message when a Government sets itself targets and consistently fails to meet them. Between 1987 and 1989, the Fianna Fáil minority Government not only kept to the ceiling on public <Col N="637" /> expenditure it set itself, it went far below that. Every year, post-budget targets were consistently undershot.  This Government has done the exact opposite.</P>
    <P>In its first year, 1995, the Government initially sought to remain within its own 6 per cent target. Within a couple of months that was cast aside and it ended up with an overrun of £177 million which was out by 1 per cent.  In 1996, current expenditure should have risen by only 4 per cent.  Instead, it has risen by 5.3 per cent, with an overrun of £181 million.  The 1997 Book of Estimates, unlike its two predecessors, does not even pretend to live within the original target.  The provisional ceiling in the Book of Estimates at £13,014 million post-budget is already 6.1 per cent.  The pretence that there was no more money in 1997 for public service pay did not even last a week.  If there are further overruns of a similar order to the last two years, then we will end up with an expenditure increase of 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The programme, A Government of Renewal, set out broadly speaking what was right and appropriate for a booming but also heavily indebted economy.  The failure of the Government to stick to its targets is a serious indictment of its economic management.  While there were special factors, much of the additional expenditure is discretionary.  One of the primary jobs of a Minister for Finance is to control public expenditure. It is clear that in this Government it is impossible to do that.  Comparisons with the early 1990s, when we were affected by an international downturn, are not relevant.  It is correct anti-cyclical policy to increase public expenditure in such circumstances and to constrain it in a boom.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the consequences of the Government's fiscal policy since 1995.  The first consequence is that people end up paying more tax, over £500 million.  There was no worthwhile tax relief in the 1996 budget.  The trade unions complained correctly that the Government had failed to honour the tax provisions of the PCW. As Minister for Finance, I honoured them in 1994.  In 1995 and 1996, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and his Government failed to do so, especially the promise to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute a growing proportion of total revenue.  Labour and Democratic Left like to present themselves as champions of the PAYE worker.  They are no such thing.  In reality they are engaged in policies which will result in the ordinary PAYE taxpayer paying heavy taxes indefinitely.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest disincentives to employment is that on virtually any level of income workers in this State pay far more tax than workers in the North or in Britain.  We may disdain a low pay economy, but many low paid workers in Britain have higher take home pay than higher paid workers here.  The Minister is perpetrating a foolish deceit on the Irish people in pretending that living standards have overtaken those in the North and are about to overtake those in Britain. That is palpable rubbish, and the Minister knows <Col N="638" /> it.  It is a gross misuse of the EU's GDP <i>per capita</i> statistics which ignore the UK subvention, multinational repatriations and debt repayments and different tax rates.  The only income that matters to people is their after tax disposable income.  Up to date figures are not available.  In 1993, personal disposable income per head was about 75 per cent of that in the North.  It may be around, or a little over 80 per cent today.  We will never catch up with or overtake either the North or Britain, unless we do something serious about our income tax rates and bands, and employers' PRSI.</P>
    <P>No one will be impressed by a once off giveaway election budget.  For economic reasons, tax reductions should be evenly spread, and not all given in an election year.  No one will be taken in. Headline figures in national programmes about the nominal level of tax reductions are deceptive. In the 1996 budget, the difference between preand post-budget revenue showed that budget changes cost the Exchequer £12 million net.  In the 1995 budget, the tax changes involved a revenue gain of £3 million.  It is clear to any taxpayer what they have received under this Minister for Finance.  Over his two years in office, the gain has been £9 million and we talk about wage packages of £200 and £300 today.  This time next year it will be the same old story; the big giveaway budget with all the tricks, swings and roundabouts and little in it for the taxpayer.  The only year in which there was any real tax giveaway was in 1990.  In the budgets I introduced, particularly in 1992 and 1994, there was tax reform and a rebalancing of the tax system through a widening of the tax base. The last two years represent a missed opportunity to build on that and move beyond it, with only token moves in the right direction.</P>
    <P>If we had a more attractive tax system, I have no doubt we could soak up unemployment much more quickly.  Our highest and best qualified people would be more tempted to stay, rather than seek the higher salaries and take home pay they can earn abroad.  The usual plausible defence of our situation is that more money needs to be spent on education, fighting crime, social exclusion, housing etc., as well as county roads and other essential infrastructure.  I do not deny any of that.  Fianna Fáil has never advocated that the State should shrug off its social responsibilities. It is a question of ordering our priorities in a way that maximises national welfare and social equity.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that increased employment is the best overall way of improving social conditions.  A more competitive tax system is needed among other things to increase employment more rapidly.  That is only possible if expenditure is kept under control.  One way is to eliminate Exchequer borrowing so that we can readily reduce the proportion of tax revenue pre-empted by debt servicing which amounted to £2.3 billion in 1996.  On the late night news on new year's eve the public will be told the national debt/GDP ratio for the year has improved.  However, the figure to watch out for is the national debt and it <Col N="639" /> will be seen to have increased substantially.  The national debt will top £30 billion for the first time. Not long ago, we asked if we could keep it in and around £20 billion.  This indebtedness is being wrapped around future generations.  It is unrealistic to think that at our stage of development we can freeze expenditure the way the British Labour Party proposes, but if we keep the annual rise tight &mdash; which was implemented Fianna Fáil policy &mdash; to about 2 per cent in real terms, as this Government originally proposed in the draft document prepared by Deputies Cowen, Dempsey and myself, we would have enough additional resources for special priorities, and we could eliminate Exchequer borrowing by 1999 as the ESRI recommends, and the EU stability and growth pact effectively now demands.</P>
    <P>I am also extremely concerned about the effects of rising expenditure on our ability to participate or prosper in economic and monetary union.  Current spending will have risen by 20 per cent in three years, with an inflation rate of little more than 6 per cent.  The markets were unsettled by the Book of Estimates last week, with the possibility that an interest rate rise in the new year might claw back some of the economic benefits of increased expenditure.  Fortunately for the country, this was overtaken by the weekend agreement on the stability and growth pact, which sent interest rates in the opposite direction but the issue will arise again at the time of the budget, when the markets consider the combined impact of expenditure increases and tax reductions.  The Minister gave a figure of £13,038 million which represents a 6.3 per cent increase.  There will be further social measures in the budget which will bring it up to a six per cent increase and even that would be tight for him to achieve.  The Minister stated that expenditure for 1996 may be a little lower than outlined in the Book of Estimates. The increase is likely to be in the order of 6.9 or 7 per cent, about five percentage points higher than inflation in a year when we have a so-called booming economy, with no strains on welfare or other issues.</P>
    <P>In its winter bulletin last week, the Central Bank issued a specific warning three times against an expansionary budget in 1997.  It stated:</P>
    <P>It is especially important that fiscal policy should not be expansionary.  The present buoyant disposition of the economy does not warrant an expansionary fiscal stance which could only serve to increase inflation dangers which may already be present.</P>
    <P>Any stimulus to demand from fiscal policy would risk an acceleration in inflation, against the very strong growth in recent years.</P>
    <P>In the current context of strong economic growth, however, any tax reductions would have to be made only in conjunction with more stringent control of expenditure.</P>
    <P>That amounts to a clear warning to the Minister. In recent years the country has listened to the <Col N="640" /> Central Bank, the people responsible for maintaining the country within economic and monetary union, and by ignoring that bank the Minister is going against everything favoured by the EMI.</P>
    <P>This morning's editorial in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> by Matt Dempsey states that the Government privately acknowledges there is a lot of pent-up inflation in the system, particularly in the housing market.  There is not the slightest evidence the Minister is paying attention to the Central Bank's advice.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, in his budget was very concerned about avoiding giving any push to inflation and, to his credit, was not prepared to play politics with the health of the British economy. Our irresponsible and reckless rainbow coalition Government has, in contrast, every intention of playing politics in the most brazen manner with the economy.  It hopes to buy back the election by playing around with taxpayers' money.  If the economy is seriously damaged as a result, it will no doubt be safely back on the Opposition benches to criticise our efforts to pick up the pieces once again.</P>
    <P>If the 1997 budget triggers a rise in interest rates, it will claw back most of the benefit of tax concessions and will be utterly self-defeating.  Perhaps the country is getting ready for Christmas and is not listening to what we are saying, but this will be on the record.  The Minister will give a little in the budget to make things look good. That will create inflationary pressures and interest rates will drift upwards with the result that the tax concessions will amount to a misnomer and taxpayers will be worse off.  Will they allow themselves to be conned by the mirage presented on 22 January?</P>
    <P>I have advice for the Minister.  If he were to adopt an EBR close to the expected outturn for 1996 of around £400 million or 1 per cent of GNP, the level recommended in the Stability and Growth Pact&mdash;the Taoiseach claimed this morning that that matter was well handled at the week-end&mdash;no one could legitimately criticise him for bringing in an imprudent, expansionary budget at a time of economic boom.  Inflation is the greatest immediate danger to our economic and monetary union membership.  Consequently, the Minister will have to be extremely careful.  He would be well advised to adjust expenditure downwards between now and budget time, which is not what he and his colleagues are doing.  They are trawling the country to see if they can find bright ideas on which to spend money in constituencies where they believe they will be decimated, but they should recognise that they will be decimated anyway. If the Minister saves money, at least in his old age he can say he did something constructive. Otherwise he will be recognised as a reckless Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The usual catch-cry of Governments on the defensive is, where would you make cuts?  We heard an extraordinarily defensive speech by the Minister for Finance this morning.  I think he knows, or at least his officials in the Department <Col N="641" /> will advise him, that what he is doing is reckless. He defended himself from start to finish &mdash; he even extended his time by 20 minutes in order to defend himself, and I will do likewise if I am allowed.  Allocating resources is something done in Government, not with incomplete information in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I am dismayed that the strategic management initiative, in the best &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; style, has not yet led to a single identifiable budget saving.  In a reply to me on Tuesday, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, told me that the primary additional administrative costs in the Taoiseach's Department arise from the strategic management initiative.  I thought the objective of that initiative was to save money, but there is a 14 per cent increase in the Department of the Taoiseach's administrative overheads, even before increases in pay are added to the figure.  That is scandalous.  It is an eloquent commentary on the Taoiseach's complete abdication of responsibility in the area of economic policy.  There is a 20 per cent increase in administration costs in the Department of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, and a trebling of expenditure on consultancies.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Dukes, will do something about this.  There is a 17 per cent increase in administrative costs in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I thought the Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, made all the decisions, that once you were from Galway you got the money and that no administration was needed.</P>
    <P>There are no satisfactory explanations for any of this in the Minister's speech this morning.  Civil Service numbers have been allowed to rise by more than 1,000 under this Government while Garda numbers have dropped.  It is a fair bet that many of the increases in the subheads are for the purpose of making a string of good news announcements around constituencies in the next few weeks rather than for tackling genuine high priority social needs.  There has been a huge escalation &mdash; 44 per cent &mdash; in the Exchequer's capital budget since 1994.  It should be clear to everyone that public spending cannot continue to increase at this rate.  There has been a 20 per cent increase in public spending during the life of this Government, which is celebrating only its second anniversary.  Those figures are not mine and are not Fianna Fáil propaganda.  They were produced by the Minister in the 1995 and 1996 budgets and in the Book of Estimates.  It is difficult to believe that with economic growth of 8 per cent there would be a 20 per cent increase in public spending. The Department of Finance must have worked extraordinarily hard to get the Book of Estimates into such a mess.  It would have been much easier to take the outturn figures and issue the book without doing any work.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's priority is to eliminate Exchequer borrowing altogether in normal times and, if possible, to start cutting the national debt so that we can concentrate the maximum resources both on improving services and making our tax system <Col N="642" /> more competitive.  We need a better balance in our economic management to prolong the economic boom which effectively began in 1987, with a slight interruption in the early 1990s.  If we eliminate borrowing, make our tax system more competitive and have more people at work, we will also generate more resources to improve public services.  All that is required is a less short-term approach.</P>
    <P>Despite my other criticisms, I am glad a new social partnership agreement, the fourth since 1987, appears to have been largely agreed.  I congratulate the Civil Service team headed by Mr. Paddy Teahon, who conducted the negotiations on behalf of the Government, and all the social partners.  Social partnership has been the key to our economic progress.  None of the three partners in Government supported the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in 1987, but they are all converts to that approach now, which is one of the most important legacies of that Fianna Fáil Government and its successors.  While the pay increases are at the upper limit of what is safe, it is worth paying some price for certainty.  I have not had time to study it, but I note from this morning's newspapers that a new ESRI study shows a major reduction in poverty between 1987 and 1994.  A major effort was made by Fianna Fáil in those years to fulfil the recommendations of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. The ESRI report will no doubt identify priorities for further action in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, on return to office in 1997, intends to make the same economic impact we achieved ten years ago, by tackling borrowing, expenditure and the tax system.  If we put public spending first, as this Government has, we will not achieve the decisive breakthrough we want.  Prohibitive tax levels will always prevent us reaching higher European living standards.  Government is about choosing priorities but this Government has none, which is why spending has increased virtually across the board.  I fervently hope nothing goes seriously wrong through bad economic decision making this side of an election.  A new Fianna Fáil-led Government will act prudently and responsibly, and that cannot come too soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Ahern said, it is ironic that a Minister for Finance who broke every commitment to keep public expenditure under control should challenge the Opposition to produce ideas as to how he could keep his commitments. When the programme, A Government of Renewal, was put in place, clear commitments on expenditure were made to the people.  These were not merely quietly abandoned but trampled on.  Regrettably, the extent of the drift in public expenditure control has now done serious damage to this country's prospects over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can argue this way or that about the real level of increase in public expenditure and I do not disagree substantially with Deputy Ahern's <Col N="643" /> assessment that it is about 7 per cent.  The best way to compare like with like is to look at the abridged Estimates for last year and the previous year, which show the increase on the estimated cost of running the country in 1997 over the 1996 Estimates, published about this time last year, was of the order of 8 per cent, and the increase over the last two years totals 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>It has been stated on a number of occasions that the justification for this was largely one-off items such as the anti-crime drive, the BSE crisis, the hepatitis C tribunal or the social welfare equality payments.  A one-off item is always used to justify not maintaining public spending at the targets set.  However, every time the one-off excuse is given, the revised increased Estimate is taken as the base point for public expenditure the following year.  The unexpected equality, BSE or hepatitis C payments are always assumed to be part of the public expenditure necessary for the following year.  That is why the growth figures are so outrageous.  These one-off items, which come to hundreds of millions of pounds between them, are built into next year's expenditure and doubtless, half way through the year &mdash; if we are not in the middle of an election &mdash; we will be told there are yet further unexpected items to increase the cost of running the country.</P>
    <P>We are on the eve of an election year and 1997 will be significant from the viewpoint that Labour will have been in office for the majority of the previous quarter century.  I mention that not because I am jealous of that party's capacity to get and keep office but to state that if a party has been in office for most of the last quarter century, it bears some responsibility for the state of play on taxation.</P>
    <P>I do not know what ideological wrangle is going on in this Government but I can see no sense in its taxation policies.  It seems Fine Gael is making the same mistake it made on the eve of its débâcles in 1977 and, even more deservedly, in 1987.  It thinks that fiddling with tax rates on the eve of an election, having done nothing for years in office, will convince some faltering voters to come back to the fold.  It did not work then and it will not work now.  If Fine Gael is going to take one penny off the income tax rate now, why was that not done in 1994 or 1995?  If it makes good sense to start changing the viciously anti-work tax system on the eve of an election, why was it not attempted over the last two years?</P>
    <P>It has been stated so often that it is probably trite to note that if a single worker earning £2,000 less than the average industrial wage is offered an extra £10 in earnings, whether through overtime, productivity or a raise, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, will take £5.70 of it in taxes and PRSI.  That is the position after Labour has been in power for most of the last 25 years. How can any party claim to represent the working man if, after a quarter century of office holding, more than half the additional earnings of a <Col N="644" /> single worker, earning below the average industrial wage, are taken in tax?  It is a sick joke for it to claim to be a party of the left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most penal and draconian tax system but Labour has always defended it and attacked those of us who tried to do something about it.  Fianna Fáil's early budget of 1989 started the process of bringing down the standard rate by reducing it from 35 per cent to 33 per cent.  It came down to 27 per cent over the succeeding three budgets and doubtless would have been reduced further but for unfortunate events.  At the time we were attacked and harried and these reductions were called tax cuts for the rich.  I will not give the Minister ideas for cuts but I make this challenge in reply to his: does he want to return to the tax system which obtained after Labour left office in 1987, when ordinary workers paid 35 per cent income tax and 7.75 per cent PRSI &mdash; a 42.75 per cent deduction rate &mdash; on the first taxable pound of their incomes?  Does anyone on the left think that was fair or just, or that the significant reforms achieved between 1989 and 1992 were not warranted?  They were derided at the time as &ldquo;mé féin&rdquo; policies for the rich in society but they were no such thing, they were for ordinary workers.  If we do not give single workers earning well below the average industrial wage a fairer tax deal, and do not give, in those circumstances, an incentive to work rather than to be on welfare, we are the authors of the social injustice which follows from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour to be invited to address the ISME conference in Killarney some weeks ago. Mr. Bill Attlee was also there as part of a prenational wage agreement propaganda exercise to announce that there was no prospect of a deal.  I was in the happy position of speaking after Mr. Attlee so I said this was nonsense &mdash; the idea that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare would end up with no agreement was out of the question, because they were bound to negotiate something.  This was simply poker playing by Mr. Attlee and everyone knew he was merely flexing his muscles.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, indicated, both publicly and through a series of leaks, that there was not enough money to meet public sector pay demands.  He was quoted as looking for a wage freeze and saying he could not and should not match the private sector deal, but he did.  He had to back down because the Government was not in a position to show to the trade union movement either in the private or public sector that it could deliver on tax reform.  Now we have the spectre of another £80 million which should be used to make Ireland a more competitive place in which to work but which will be taken out of the tax revenue by the abolition of local service charges and residential property tax.  I am in favour of getting rid of residential property tax <Col N="645" /> because it is unfair, but what is the economic effect of taking out £14 million on one front and between £65 million and £70 million on the other?  Will that enable the Government to make working more worthwhile?  I doubt that very much.</P>
    <P>There is such deep-seated confusion at the heart of this Government that I find it difficult to understand what the philosophy of its tax policies amounts to.  The Minister present strongly defends PRSI as a social insurance contribution but everybody else sees it for what it is &mdash; a tax &mdash; because our Social Insurance Fund is about as real as my overdraft in terms of its existence.  It is just one account which is used for paper purposes.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned that interest rates may not be so benign in the next two or three years. This may be of little concern to the members of the rainbow Coalition because they might feel it will not be their problem if interest rates increase, but if they increase by 1 per cent or 2 per cent in the course of the next three years our position in terms of public spending could be seriously affected.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to seriously face up to marshalling our assets and containing growth in public spending.  One does not have to subscribe to some new right Thatcherite view to say that Ireland would be wise to do what most economies in eastern and western Europe and in the developed world have done, namely, ensure we do not hold on to assets in the public sector while holding on to huge amounts of indebtedness.  It makes the Government less efficient.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a reasonable question.  What good is being served by not selling off the TSB?  Why not reduce our Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1997 by selling it off?  I fail to understand what national purpose is served by the State being the owner of Cablelink.  If it makes good sense to sell off 35 per cent of the shares of Telecom to KPN-Telia &mdash; I will not comment on the good sense of that deal or the partner chosen &mdash; what useful purpose is now being served by retaining the remaining 65 per cent?  What good is it to this country to own that 65 per cent?  There is no answer to that question.  I do not believe any Minister can say it is a good idea to keep that 65 per cent of shares because the telecommunications market will, by definition, become an open competitive market in the next two to three years on an unfolding basis.</P>
    <P>Why should the taxpayer take the risk of capitalising one player in a competitive market while encouraging other players such as Esat to come into that market and compete fairly with the company in which we have a 65 per cent share?  Why should we take a bet of that kind on one player in the market when our interest is not to act as speculative shareholders in a share market for public utilities?  Our interest is to reduce the cost of these services to the ordinary person, to minimise monopoly profits in the area and to increase <Col N="646" /> efficiency to the maximum.  That is our interest as an economy and as a society.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense for the Government to insist on owning, say, Aer Rianta at a time when it is busily buying into foreign airports which foreign governments are privatising.  Why should Aer Rianta buy Australian or English airports in circumstances where the Irish taxpayer is capitalising that purpose?  What interest do we have in owning a midlands airport in England with capital supplied by the Irish worker?  I do not understand the interest that is supposed to be served by that but I know the money tied up by way of State capital in Aer Rianta is significant, and if this country had the best interests of its workers at heart &mdash; I am talking about the generality of workers &mdash; it would try to reduce the potential debt burden on those workers, especially in the context that it is quite possible an increase in interest rates would pose a serious crisis in terms of our ability to control public expenditure in the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>Without being ideological or massively political on this matter I want to know what interests are being served by the policies this Government is following?  There is no pattern to its policies.  The Government cannot control public spending and it has broken all of its undertakings in relation to that.  It has not achieved significant tax reform and it is busily creating more reasons it cannot do that.  It is not tax reform, for instance, to get rid of local service charges, to earmark an element of motor tax and say that will be the substitute amount because the bottom line in that transaction is either that taxation centrally is rising to make up the difference or, alternatively, an opportunity to reduce tax on work is being thrown away to pay for that.  Whatever sense of direction was implicit in that policy, it was lost on me.  The Minister for Social Welfare's party attempted at one stage to make local service charges tax deductible.  That was possibly a high point of philosophical tax confusion, that one tax was made deductible against another.  The point of that still eludes me.</P>
    <P>I hope next year's budget is a successful one and significant steps towards reform of our income tax code are taken.  I see the predictions in the media the same as anybody else and it appears somebody has decided not to touch the 48 per cent tax rate which, together with PRSI, results in single people giving £5.70 to two Ministers out of every extra £10 they earn even though they do not earn the average industrial wage. That is a wall which somebody will hit at some level of income, which is indefensible in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government does not produce a vote buying budget but I fear, along with Deputy Bertie Ahern, that what we are seeing now is positioning by the Government parties to try to win back favour from the electorate.  The sad fact is that this Government is not re-electable.  Any fair-minded person would see it that way, and it is unfortunate that we will all have to pay the <Col N="647" /> price for its efforts to be re-elected, futile and hopeless though that enterprise appears to be.</P>
    <P>These Estimates have not been explained.  We have not had a clear explanation as to from where the increased expenditure will come.  We have engaged yet again in a kind of intellectual striptease. If we knew the decisions which underlay these Estimates and where the changes were, we would be well off but most of the time we are looking at increased figures which are unexplained aggregate totals.  The question we have to ask is when are we going to get serious about the Estimates process and demand that every change in a Book of Estimates should be clearly explained on an accompanying page.  What is the point of considering Estimates when one side of the House knows what they mean but refuses to tell the other side?  Are we simply to speculate on the effect of this Book of Estimates?</P>
    <P>This country has, over the lifetime of the next Government, a unique opportunity to turn itself around and make itself capable of standing on its own two feet in a post-EMU Europe.  That will not be easy.  Unless we take some hard decisions on public spending control, realising our assets, reducing public borrowing and containing the growth in national debt this year, and elect a Government which is mandated to make those decisions and has the political will and cohesion to do so, the post-EMU reality might be very different from what is being painted.  Post economic and monetary union a weak Irish economy will suffer very badly if it has not taken the necessary corrective actions between 1997 and 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal primarily with the Social Welfare Estimate.  I hope to throw some light on Deputy Michael McDowell's confusion in the course of my contribution.  I hope he will use the information I give him today to write factually about the matter in his next article in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i></P>
      <P>Total social welfare spending in 1997 is estimated at around £4.5 billion.  Of that amount, the Exchequer will contribute some £2.6 billion while the balance will be met mainly from employers, employees and the self employed by way of PRSI contributions.  The increase in the Estimates provision over 1996 is 1 per cent; the increase on gross expenditure is 2.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I recently published a social insurance discussion document which outlines options regarding the coverage, types of entitlement, levels of payment and rates of PRSI contributions.  In my two years experience as Minister, I have found that the area of debate where there is most heat and least light is that concerning PRSI.  Calls for the outright abolition of PRSI, for example, never seem to be accompanied by a coherent analysis of how benefits and pensions should be funded now and in the future.  There is much special pleading and selective comparison with the social insurance <Col N="648" /> regime in the UK and very little mention of the lower level of benefits provided to employers and employees there.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we have a clear understanding of the implications of any proposed cut in PRSI contribution rates, both from the point of view of the real competitiveness of our businesses and also the long-term effect on the social insurance fund of a recurring reduction in income.  Looking towards the future, we need to consider the possibility of expanding the PRSI system to help meet the cost of other contingencies, such as caring for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Insurance payments are made to over 410,000 people each week, about two thirds of whom are pensioners.  The pay related social insurance contributions which fund these payments now amount to over £1,800 million each year.  The point is that the social insurance fund is a dynamic framework which has to change with the changing nature of the labour force and demography. It is not a piggy bank to be raided for short-term advantage.  I firmly believe it is possible to have a PRSI system which is both socially and economically balanced, which is my purpose and aim in getting a rational and reasoned debate on this vital issue under way.</P>
    <P>The increase in my Department's Estimate for 1997 over 1996 is some £13 million.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the more significant items which account for this.  In the first instance, the carry-over costs of the 1996 budget improvements &mdash; the increases in the rates of social welfare payments combined with the targeted reductions in PRSI employer contribution rates &mdash; will amount to some £128 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>Second, additional provision of some £84 million is made in the Estimates for projected increases in the number of claimants of certain payments, for example, pensioners, widowers and lone parents, and for additional expenditure on the disability allowance following its transfer from the Department of Health to my Department earlier this year.  Third, the increasing importance of the employment support services available from my Department, notably through the back to work allowance scheme and the enhanced third level allowance scheme, is reflected in an increase of £18 million.  However, to listen to Deputy McDowell one would think there were no incentives for people to move from welfare into education and work.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Estimate also differs from the 1996 provision, and that of all previous years, in that it contains an allocation for a Christmas bonus for long-term social welfare recipients to be paid in late 1997.  This is the first time that specific provision has been made for this payment within the Estimates for my Department, allowing the bonus to be placed on a more secure footing.</P>
    <P>The additional expenditure I have outlined will be partially offset by an increase in PRSI income arising from higher earnings and employment levels, reflecting the robust health of the economy and the fact that substantial numbers of new jobs <Col N="649" /> are being created.  The sustained reductions in the numbers on the live register, as a result of the generation of new jobs allied to effective antifraud measures, will also give rise to a reduction in expenditure.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Estimates for my Department are based on the pre-budget 1997 position and, therefore, they do not provide for any additional social welfare spending that may arise in next year's budget.  The two budgets which this Government introduced in 1995 and 1996 have enabled us to achieve radical and effective improvements in the social welfare system.  We have set out to tackle the root causes of poverty, for example, through the very substantial increases in child benefit, and to make the system more work friendly so that it can act to provide both vital income support and a springboard into the active labour force.  I can assure the House that the forthcoming budget will further enhance the progress we have achieved to date.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government in its first two years in office has been one of outstanding success, particularly in the economic area.  I have already outlined some of our achievements in the social welfare area, but the impact of the sound and sensible policies being implemented by this Government can be seen in virtually every economic indicator.  More than 100,000 new jobs have been created since we came into office.  A whole new range of job creation initiatives were announced in the last budget and the numbers on the live register have fallen by almost 25,000 since August, bringing the live register down to its lowest level since November 1991.  Almost 3,500 new jobs were announced last week alone.</P>
    <P>Sustained economic growth has resulted in significant tax buoyancy, but inflation remains comfortably below the EU average.  Mortgage rates under this Government have reached their lowest levels for over a decade, leading to substantial savings for householders.  We have managed to stay comfortably within the Maastricht guidelines while maintaining and increasing spending on essential public and social services. All this is in stark contrast to the disastrous economic performance of the Fianna Fáil-PD coalition Government.</P>
    <P>However, it is not just in the economic area that the Government has been successful.  We have also delivered a wide range of social and political reforms.  Thorny issues that had been long fingered by successive Governments were tackled by this Administration.  The divorce amendment was passed and the subsequent legislation enacted.  The difficult issue of abortion information was dealt with by legislation.  The Constitution was amended to allow for reform of our bail regime and the most comprehensive anti-crime package ever undertaken by any Government is now tightening the screw on organised crime.  The gang bosses are being squeezed dry.</P>
    <P>While we can be very satisfied with what has been achieved so far, there are important problems to be tackled and further legislation to be <Col N="650" /> enacted before the life of this Dáil expires towards the end of next year.  The final details of the budget have to be worked out, but the successful negotiation of a new wage agreement in the private and public sectors offers real opportunities for continued economic growth.  For the first time, a national programme will recognise the voice of those who speak for the socially excluded.  The Community Platform has had intensive discussions with Government on how we launch a sustained assault on social exclusion over the next three years.  It is imperative that we ensure the fruits of economic growth are fairly shared around and are not hogged by any one sector of society.</P>
    <P>One of the particular successes of this Government in recent months, which I spearheaded, was the improved control measures aimed at combating social welfare abuses, particularly social welfare fraud.  These have been very successful and, with the job creation programme of the Government, have contributed to the substantial decreases in the numbers on the live register to which I referred earlier.  In addition to the 25,000 who have signed off the register, some 11,000 have had their payments suspended pending further investigation, leading to projected savings to the taxpayer of £84 million in 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>However, it is not just social welfare cheats who defraud the taxpayer.  Tax cheats place an even greater burden on the compliant taxpayer and this Government is determined to tackle the social culture which has allowed some people in the business and professional sectors to treat tax evasion as a sort of national sport.  Progress has been made under successive Ministers for Finance, but it is a constant battle for the Revenue Commissioners to stay one step ahead of the tax cheats.  In 1995 more than 500 companies and individuals were caught and compelled to make settlements and pay financial penalties amounting to more than £10 million.</P>
    <P>Corporation tax cases were pursued to prosecution for the first time in 1995 and represent 25 per cent of these cases.  Some 24,359 audits were undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners during 1995, yielding more than £140 million.</P>
    <P>These figures show quite clearly that it is not true, as some commentators tried to suggest, that the Government is pursuing social welfare fraud but turning a blind eye to tax fraud.  There is no room for complacency.  We need to turn the screw even tighter to end equivocation with regard to tax law, close off remaining loopholes, bring in all arrears and ensure the highest possible level of compliance in the future.</P>
    <P>As the 27th Dáil was elected in November 1992, we are now entering the final year of this Government.  I will be happy to go before the people on the basis of the record of this Government and particularly on the basis of what Democratic Left, a relatively small party that will only reach its fifth birthday in March, has been able to achieve.  That is not to deny that the Government has made mistakes, or that there were issues that <Col N="651" /> could, and with the benefit of hindsight, should have been tackled differently, but where mistakes have been made, the Government has moved speedily to remedy them.  The co-operative and constructive way in which the three parties in this Government have dealt with problems is in stark contrast to the infighting and political brinkmanship that made political instability the hallmark of the last two Fianna Fáil-led Governments.</P>
    <P>I will be particularly happy to go before the people and to compare the record of this Administration with that of the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats administration.  The Fianna Fáil-PD Government added 56,000 people to the live register in its term of office.  Under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats mortgage rates reached their highest level ever, almost 15 per cent, adding up to £80 per month to many families' housing bills.  In contrast, under this Government mortgage rates have reached their lowest levels in decades.  This Government has delivered real tax reform, especially for the PAYE sector, and there is more to come in the January budget.  The Progressive Democrats came to Government promising tax relief, but the reality was that the average tax take from an average PAYE worker increased by 17 per cent when they were in office.</P>
    <P>This Government has made the fight against poverty a priority, it is the first Administration to introduce a national anti-poverty strategy.  The word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; did not figure even once in the programme negotiated and agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in 1989.  This Government has increased social welfare rates steadily and in real terms.  Compare that to the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts of ill fame.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that it is time for the media to subject the Progressive Democrats, their record and policies to the same sort of scrutiny to which all the parties, including Fianna Fáil, are subjected.  The Progressive Democrats say in public that they are opposed to the principle of State funding for political parties, while privately canvassing for an increased share of the pot at the expense of their potential partners in Government, and it does not even merit a comment in the media.  Deputy &ldquo;Hong Kong&rdquo; Harney sheds crocodile tears for the Dunnes Stores workers while championing the Asian economic model of low pay and low social protection, and it passes without comment.  The Progressive Democrats produce an economic plan which would cost over £1,000 million, yet they are asked no more than cursory questions about what essential services they would cut to finance their programme.  The Progressive Democrats would have us cut the social insurance fund to an extent which would mean we could not pay old age pensions or widows' pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney may be the benign, televisionfriendly face of the Progressive Democrats, but the ideological steel, as he has shown in and out of Government, is provided by Deputy McDowell. <Col N="652" /> A potential Cabinet which would have at its ideological core, possibly as Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare, Deputies McCreevy and McDowell, the nightmare of the poor in society, will send a cold shiver of apprehension down the spines of the poorest and weakest sectors of society &mdash; the poor, the sick, the elderly, the unemployed.</P>
    <P>In his desperation to keep on side with the only party he sees as even remotely capable of propelling him back to Government, Deputy Ahern is engaged with Deputy Harney in a frantic &ldquo;riverdance&rdquo; to the right with the Fianna Fáil leader threatening wholesale privatisation of semi-State companies, calling for cutbacks in public spending, while at the same time demanding increased spending on their own favoured projects.  It would be interesting to hear whether Deputy McCreevy agrees with the privatisation list announced here today by Deputy McDowell.  There is a need for realism in public debate.  Fianna Fáil even opposes the Organisation of Working Time Bill which, among other things, will offer protection against zero hour contracts and regulate Sunday trading in the interests of employees.</P>
    <P>The battle lines are now being drawn for the next general election.  It is quite clear that the option facing the electorate is a choice between a Fianna Fáil-PD Government that would be the most right-wing for decades and the continuation of this centre-left Coalition.  This is not about an abstract choice between political ideologies.  It is about different policies that can have a real impact on lives.  It is about providing the poor and disadvantaged with the means to cope, or abandoning them to their own devices.  It is about providing real tax reform which will primarily assist those on low incomes, or providing more tax breaks for the wealthy.  It is about Government promoting job creation as a central political objective.  The alternative is a society based on dog eat dog economics.  That may suit the Progressive Democrats.  It may suit their groupies in the print media, and it may, out of desperation, suit Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The problem for them is that it will not suit the people when they realise what exactly is being offered to them.</P>

      <P>The speeches written for the Minister for Social Welfare when he was in Opposition were more entertaining.  These combination speeches, the fruits of Department and outside advisers, do not read so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was remarkably defensive about the 1997 Estimates.  It was obvious that he believes, in his heart of hearts, that they are irresponsible and that view is shared throughout his Department.  I cannot remember him being so defensive regarding comments made about the Book of Estimates.  It is quite obvious that a message has been signalled to him from within his Department and the plethora of outside comment that this is not on.  A few days after the publication of the Estimates the Central Bank <Col N="653" /> report cautioned the Minister and the Government from taking this route.</P>
    <P>In the past Democratic Left and its predecessors put forward a clear and distinctive view on how to run the economy.  Although I disagree with its fundamental ideological positions, I defend its right to espouse them and accept that they were based on a coherent philosophy. However, while it has been in Government that whole ethos has been forgotten.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years the Labour Party seems to have moved its ideological position.  The Minister for Finance knows that what is proposed in the 1997 Estimates is not in line with any type of coherent economic strategy.  No economist would suggest that increasing current spending over three years by 20 per cent at a time of unprecedented economic growth and cumulative inflation not exceeding approximately 6.5 per cent amounts to sound economics.  Nobody has advocated this approach and it has led to ultimate disaster where it has been practised.  That will be the case here.</P>
    <P>Inflation rates are low and economic growth is high.  However, we are approaching 1999, which will result in a smaller share of EU Structural Funding and reduced control over our public finances.  In addition, we are at the peak of the economic cycle.  In such circumstances nobody would advocate increasing current expenditure by 20 per cent over three years.  The Government has been shy in producing economists who support this approach.  The question is not whether the Book of Estimates is acceptable to the Dáil. The Minister has lost that debate because people with common-sense know what an increase of 20 per cent means and communicators and businessmen see their hard won advantages and opportunities sacrificed by the Government's expenditure programmes for 1995-97.</P>
    <P>Who is to blame for this sorry state of affairs? The Minister says he is ideologically driven to authorise this level of spending.  He advises that the Government is left of centre, as if this was an explanation.  This is news to the Taoiseach and his party.  Are they aware that the Government is left of centre?</P>
    <P>The budget will be a test of Fine Gael's position in the Government, when it will be clear if the party is in a position to resist the temptation to blow the rest of the revenue windfall in an appeal to the voters on the basis that they have never had it so good.  While perhaps the country has never had it so good, it could have been much better.</P>
    <P>What will be the cost of allowing Government expenditure to rise at this wanton rate in terms of the lost opportunities for tax reduction and reform?  If at the beginning of its term the Government considered it was essential to curb the level of public expenditure and to cap its growth at 2 per cent in real terms, what circumstances have changed its position?  What caused all three Government parties to abandon that <Col N="654" /> prudence and to apparently encourage public expenditure in all fields instead?</P>
    <P>Now that he has concluded his onerous EU agenda, the Minister should withdraw these Estimates and try again because the public is entitled to prudent and sensible management of the public purse.  Why is the Government apparently unable to hold expenditure constant in real terms?  There is an inbuilt, unchecked appetite by the Government for real extra expenditure above and beyond the previous years.  Processes should be in place to ensure the inverse of that phenomenon. Programmes and expenditure heads should be allowed to wither and die and be pruned on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>It is puzzling that we appear to accept as a necessity starting next year's Estimates on the basis of last year's out-turns, whether good, bad or indifferent.  Instead of this, the Minister should tell us why the Vote for his office has increased from a provisional out-turn of £20 million in 1994 to a 1997 Estimate of over £30 million?  Why has the Estimate for the Vote for the Department of the Minister for Justice, who appears to be unable to find her own correspondence, increased by a similar amount, from £23 million in 1994 to an Estimate of £32 million in 1997?  Is it the cost of photocopying letters?</P>

      <P>For the first time, the Minister for the Environment has managed to increase his expenditure over the billion pounds mark.  Does he want to be congratulated by this side of the House?  Perhaps the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is to be congratulated for managing to increase his departmental budget by just under 50 per cent in three years, from £41 million in 1994 to an Estimate of £58 million for 1997.  It must be due to the costs of unavoidable air travel. The Minister for Health has not done so well, with an increase of 12.5 per cent over three years. Has Fine Gael any clout in Cabinet?  By contrast, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has increased the Estimate for his Department for 1997 to £128 million; it was only £48 million in 1994.</P>
      <P>What is the bottom line?  On 9 December the Minister advised that the Estimates amounted to £13 billion on the basis that that there would be no provision for further increases in public sector pay.  However, what is the bottom line now, given the recent pay agreements for the private and public sectors?  The Minister told the House today that he has revised this sum upwards to £13.38 billion but, unlike last year, he cannot say what the outcome will be after the budget.  It leaves room for manoeuvre on funding the myriad proposals that will be put to him by the Government in view of the forthcoming general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was it not possible for the Government to adhere to its agreed real increase of 2 per cent per annum?  The comparable figure for 1994 is <Col N="655" /> £11 billion, or £10.892 billion on gross non-capital supply services.  However, according to the Book of Estimates, the Government proposes to spend £13.014 billion in 1997, which represents an increase of 19.5 per cent in three years.  Given the overruns of the past two years, it is reasonable to assume that Government expenditure will have increased by 20 per cent over three years.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister remember when an increase of 2 per cent per annum above inflation appeared to be sound economics?  He advised that because he would allow a little leeway above that target in 1995 he would underspend the following year. Some would say that is politics, but unfortunately the present situation amounts to more than politics.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance declares an objective, the business world, the investment managers and the world's commercial bankers take notice.  The message of sound economics was as much for them as it was for his backbenchers. When he rubbishes these objectives bankers and commentators become nervous and distrustful. The sound policy image, so carefully and painfully constructed by Fianna Fáil since the latter end of the 1980s, is now in jeopardy.  The reality of our present budgeting ratio, in the longer term, is placed in doubt.  Will the Minister tell us how this may affect our interest rates in the next 18 months or what our rates of exchange will be against the Deutschmark or sterling in six or 12 months' time?  How will he explain to an anxious monetary committee in Brussels how flexible the levels of expenditure are for the year ahead and how easy it will be to shift these downwards when storm clouds threaten?  The Minister for Finance constantly complains about how difficult it is to halt public expenditure.  In the knowledge of these difficulties, why does he allow it to spiral out of control, knowing it may have to be cut again soon?</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to borrow and spend £3.4 billion in 1997 on capital projects and infrastructure. The corresponding figure in 1994 was £2.4 billion.  Between 1995 and 1997, the Government's expenditure under this heading will amount to just over £9 billion.  What is the rate of return on that investment?  How much is that extra national debt costing every taxpayer and is he or she getting value for money?</P>
    <P>I accept a significant proportion of that investment is committed in advance as part of the Structural Fund deal committing us to an investment path from 1994 to 1999.  As for the balance, are we not simply crowding out domestic capital formation and keeping interest rates too high to allow the levels of private sector investment and the research and development on which this country will rely as the engine of future growth?</P>
    <P>The time has come, well in advance of the 1999 end-year deadline of Structural Funding at the levels negotiated by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, to give more thought to the shape and size of our public capital programme <Col N="656" /> and our national debt.  We should also think about the Maastricht convergence criterion and how our budgetary parameters will be restricted after that date.</P>
    <P>The suspicion is that we were not spending wisely and will regret this last opportunity when Structural Funding assumes a less significant input to the costings.  There is no evidence in the Book of Estimates of a clearly defined prioritisation for capital projects.  Perhaps we never had clear priorities for capital expenditure.  It is well past the time for us to sit down and decide what those priorities ought to be.</P>
    <P>The actions in the last years of this Administration in raising gross current spending to levels which will be at least 20 per cent higher in 1997 than in 1994 will make it extremely difficult for future Governments to correct and there will be a heavy price to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute.  I wish to reflect on the economic strategy being pursued by the Government. It gives me no pleasure to say that much of what I warned about in the Estimates debate last year has taken place.</P>
      <P>Current spending as a percentage of GNP is about 35 per cent; in the UK, 25 per cent; in the US, 20 per cent and in France, which boasts about its public finances, it is 25-28 per cent.  Compared to countries with socially advanced services or to countries without socially advanced services we are totally out of line in terms of public spending as a percentage of GNP.  Our present economic position is extremely vulnerable and unsustainable. The inability to control public spending is at the heart of this misplaced economic strategy. As I said in the debate last year, the whole direction of economic management is not right and I plead that it be changed before it is too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are underlying realities to what the Government regards as a sparkling economic performance. On one level it is a sparkling economic performance but the underlying realities have to be taken into account.  Those realities are that the fiscal policy being pursued by the Government is a dangerous one with public spending running at 20 per cent over the three years from 1995-7 at a time when inflation is 6 per cent; a dangerous fiscal policy of running public spending at three and a half times the rate of inflation.  No sensible Government anywhere in the western world would tolerate that type of economic madness.  I mentioned this last year and it seems the train is out of control.  Another economic reality is the reduction in EU funds.  I am informed the Minister for Finance is heading for a budget surplus in 1996.  If adjustments are made for EU funds there is a deficit.  There is no preparation for the tailing off of some £500 million of EU funding towards the end of 1999.  We are in receipt of £2 billion per year and we merrily spend it but there is no provision in the Estimates for ending those EU funds.  Another reality which is not being taken into account by the Government is that <Col N="657" /> economics and growth are cyclical.  The realities underlying the sparkling performance are the dangerous fiscal policy, the reduction in EU funds and the natural cycle.  The Government seems to totally ignore these realities and spends at the rate of four or five times above inflation.</P>
    <P>The Government missed its targets in every area since coming to office on the finance front. It set targets for 1995 and 1996 and missed them. It has set enormous targets for 1997 and if they are missed by the same rate as previous targets one is arguably talking about 24 per cent or 25 per cent.  That is a 25 per cent increase in spending in three years.  Every time we say that from this side of the House it is met by the riposte from the backbenchers opposite who ask us to name where we would make the cuts.  There is only one answer to that question.  Nobody is asking for cuts but what we are asking for, as any sensible person will know, is not to increase public spending at the rate of 20 per cent over three years.  No law specifies that must be done.  One does not have to make cuts to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, as Ray MacSharry had to do from 1987-9.  One does not have to say an application to increase spending from one's Department by 20 per cent in three years has been refused by the Cabinet.  One does not have to name cuts and slash social welfare and education.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Education on radio the other day boast that her budget was up threefold since coming to office, she seemed proud of it.  I held that post for some time and obviously sought investment and spending in a targeted way in the Department. I would not boast if my spending had increased by one-third in three years.  That is the mentality that dominates the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government has missed its financial targets for three years in a row and asks us where the cuts are to be made.  I do not ask the Government to make cuts but to draw a line in the sand and not to increase spending by more than inflation.  There are areas where funds have to be targeted because people have fallen behind, but one or two percentage points above inflation would certainly be sufficient. This is a reckless economic strategy.  I know of no Government in my time in this House which, having missed all its financial targets, would calmly set about spending three and a half times the rate of inflation and try to explain it as being good sound economic policy.</P>
    <P>As I said during the debate on last year's budget and Book of Estimates, the Government has options on what to do with the growth rate of 5-6 per cent in the economy &mdash; it can use it to reduce taxes and the national debt or spend it.  Regrettably, the Government has decided on the latter soft option in an effort to keep three parties with diametrically opposed economic philosophies around the Cabinet table.  The deal was cut to keep these parties together.  This reckless decision is a tragedy for the country.  It has been possible to camouflage because there is money available <Col N="658" /> to spend.  Any tax cuts in next year's budget will be nominal and will be funded out of the additional pent up revenue of recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, knows that we should be running a budget surplus.  His colleagues in Democratic Left and Labour should be sold that message.  I spent five years studying economics in university where it was drummed into me that the sensible way to manage an economy is to run a balanced budget or surplus during good times and it is legitimate to argue for a budget deficit during bad times.  I never heard a lecturer or economist say one should add to the demands on the economy during good times by pumping more money into it.  The Government is throwing petrol on the flames to make them higher but what will happen when the flames stop and the ashes appear, as they always do in cyclical economic terms?  It will be left with an overhang in spending and commitments in the areas of health, education and social welfare.  In order to meet these commitments it will have to make cuts in public spending and increase taxation.  In previous years Ministers used the excuse of the international recession to increase taxes or reduce spending.  That is not the case at present but this excuse will be used again in the future.</P>
    <P>The predictions I made this time last year have unfortunately come true.  I would prefer to have been wrong but unfortunately spending continued unabated, the wrong economic policies were pursued and tax cuts were minimal.  Like other economies, the rate of growth in our economy will slow down to 3 or 4 per cent.  A growth rate of 5-6 per cent is not sustainable in any economy. As the Government will not be able to fund its spending it will have to raise taxes and make cuts in health, education and social welfare.  The economic strategy being pursued by the Government is totally unsustainable.  The percentage of spending to gross national product is 35 per cent, which is substantially higher than the figure in most western developed countries.  The Government should stop adding to the demand during good times so that it does not have to make too many cuts when the slow down comes.</P>
    <P>We receive EU funding of £2 billion per year, which is a very substantial addition to the budget. When this funding falls off the Government will have to find approximately £500 million extra.  In a recent article in <i>Business and Finance</i> the economist, Moore McDowell, predicted that within five years the Government would have to find an extra £500 million.  There is no preparation for enlargement of the European Union which will enable poor East European countries to become member states.  It is obvious that in future funding from Brussels to support the economy will not be on the same scale.  How will we be able to replace £2 billion a year if we do not run up budget surpluses now in preparation for the fall off in revenue from the EU?</P>
    <P>The Government's economic strategy and the increase in the Estimates are wrong as any increase in interest rates, slow down in tax revenue <Col N="659" /> and indefinite fall off in EU funding will plunge the country into a new cycle of tax increases and cuts in spending on health, education and social welfare.  This is unfair to the public and, in particular, to young people.  The Department of Finance, advisers and the politicians who have the honour of being in Government should know better than to run riot during good times with no strategy or policy.  Any child in the street could tell them that they should not let public spending rise by 20 per cent at a time when inflation is running at 6 per cent.  This is a dangerous economic strategy.</P>
    <P>According to reports from Bloxham Stockbrokers, if total Government expenditure had increased at the rate of inflation during the year spending would have been approximately £2 billion less.  One can imagine what this could have achieved in tax cuts.  Approximately two-thirds of workers pay tax at 48 per cent.  The facts are being hidden because the economy is running well on a superficial level, but the chickens will come home to roost.  If the Government had decided to keep spending last year at the rate of inflation it would have had £2 billion to give out in tax cuts.  The left wing parties in Government often suggest that it is only the rich who are interested in tax cuts.  However, two-thirds of workers pay tax at 48 per cent and, if one adds on other taxes, the rate is probably 55 or 56 per cent.  Increased public spending is not only bad economics it is also very bad politics.  If the Government had the courage not to increase spending above the rate of inflation last year it would have been able to reduce the 48 per cent tax rate to 40 per cent.  Unfortunately it has missed the opportunity to do this.</P>
    <P>The Government had the option of providing for tax cuts and to prepare for a fall off in EU funding.  However, it took the soft option which unfortunately will have a detrimental effect on the economy in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unpalatable and difficult for the Opposition to accept that the economy is in a good position.  Our economic miracle is constantly referred to in Brussels and elsewhere, but I suppose it is too much to expect the Opposition to recognise it.</P>
      <P>We have had a period of unprecedented economic growth.  Growth rates have hovered between 6 per cent and 7 per cent for a number of years.  We have never denied we inherited from the previous Government an economy that set the foundations for much of this growth, but it is churlish of the Opposition not to accept we have enhanced its work and that our economy is justifiably the envy of other economies in the European Union and elsewhere.  To accuse us of irresponsible management of the economy is inconsistent with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the growth rate, which is comparable to the tiger economies of the Far East, we <Col N="660" /> have also managed &mdash; which is not easy in a fast growing economy &mdash; to contain inflation at below average European levels, where growth rates are less than half of those here.  We have consistently kept inflation hovering around 2 per cent.  Furthermore, most of us cannot remember when our interest rates were so low.  These achievements have had huge spin-offs for mortgage holders and small, medium and large businesses which want to borrow money to grow their businesses.  We can be justifiably proud of our record in terms of growth, inflation and interest rates.</P>
    <P>These achievements have finally begun to break the most intractable problem all Governments have faced in the past number of years, that of creating enough jobs to meet the expectations of a fast growing population.  We have begun to make worthwhile inroads into the numbers out of work.  We have created more new jobs in the last two years than ever before.  The IDA and Forbairt, which I primarily congratulate for that achievement, have had a spectacular year of growth in jobs, and this is evident in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere.  That will give great hope to school leavers wondering whether to work here or abroad.</P>
    <P>While there will be debating points about spending, overall the Government has exercised prudent management of the public finances at a time when people know there is a good deal of money around and they are entitled to funding for education, health and other such areas.  We must balance the true perception of the fastest growing economy in Europe with reasonable prudence in spending on social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I do not expect people to believe statements from the Government about its achievements, but all EU economies are currently undergoing severe examination in the run-up to economic and monetary union.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, must be commended for successfully negotiating the Maastricht criteria and the stability pact during the Irish Presidency.  The stability pact looked like derailing economic and monetary union and our summit, but the interpersonal skills the Minister brought to bear on difficult decisions enabled a compromise to be reached which put a stamp of success on the summit and, more importantly, on the long-term future of the European Union and economic and monetary union.  Apart from the UK, there is not a shortage of critics who would like economic and monetary union derailed.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht criteria present the economies of Europe with enormous problems.  Even the strongest ones will have great difficulty meeting the criteria to qualify for entry.  While it would be unrealistic to be over confident about our ability to meet the criteria, we can say with reasonable confidence that our economy is among the few that will almost undoubtedly qualify for entry to the new dimension of the European Union.  It is the Commission, not politicians, which will make this judgment and the criteria will be applied with a similar degree of force to each economy.  We <Col N="661" /> are one of the top three economies clamouring to be in the first division of economic and monetary union when it commences.</P>
    <P>While Governments may criticise one another about spending and so on, since the beginning of this decade Governments of various compositions have exercised consistent prudent management of the economy.  Last week a group of Americans who announced a major investment in Cork gave two reasons for their investment here.  They detected an economic sanity about the Irish political system in that, irrespective of Government mix, we had adopted a consistent coherent economic strategy during the past decade.  They were also influenced by our young, well educated population.  They stated that rather than grants, tax incentives and so on, our young, well educated and flexible population, hungry for work, was a main factor in their decision to invest here. IBM and other companies which have made major investments in Dublin also made that point.  That consistency, with obviously some differences, in our approach is a major factor in our economic health.  Future Governments will continue to adopt that approach and it will be a major selling point for the country.</P>
    <P>The other points I wish to make on the economy relate initially to the successor to the PCW. In Government we have recognised the value of national agreements and national partnership. There was a time in the 1980s when there was a serious dispute about it.  The leader of my party expressed reservations about it because it was seen, particularly in the 1980s, to have led to high inflation.  The last two agreements &mdash; and the one I hope will be announced shortly &mdash; have had a most stabilising effect.  Employers and representatives of employees, the trade unions, have acted responsibly and in the national interest as well as in the interests of their members, which is their job.  That valuable plank in the stability of our economy has been recognised by the Government and I hope it will lead to a new programme being announced in the next few days.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to EU funding.  Deputy Brennan made the valid point that we cannot anticipate a continuation of EU funding at the present level, but it would be very misleading, although the Deputy did not say it, to send out a message that such funding will cease in 1999.  We have a good deal of negotiating to do but, at worst, we are talking about a diminishing inflow of EU funding over a period of years after that. It will not be a sudden blow.  It is something we can and are planning for.  I do not subscribe to the view that European funding will end in 1999 or all that quickly after that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the argument about spending, people hear and read reports of economists, what is said about us in Europe and they understand a great deal of revenue is flowing into the Government's coffers.  They understand the argument that we must provide for the rainy day and pay off our debt.  We are paying it off.  It has fallen rapidly and that is a factor in the criteria for <Col N="662" /> Maastricht and economic and monetary union. People have waited a long time, some of them half their lives, for expenditures in areas about which they feel deeply.  It is all very well to say we should only spend the same amount as last year with perhaps an adjustment for inflation, but people are clamouring for new programmes.  We are putting through new legislation here week in, week out.  That costs money and nobody is saying that should not happen, they are saying the reverse and clamouring for more.</P>
    <P>In big spending Departments, such as Health, we introduced a new set of childcare provisions and there are great pressures to give additional aid to the mentally and physically disabled, with which Deputies across the floor agree, but the consequences are increased spending.</P>
    <P>The same argument holds in education.  Companies come here because successive Governments recognised that education is not only important social spending but the most important investment we could make in the future interest of this economy, particularly in regard to our large number of young people.  When a Government decides to reduce pupil-teacher ratios, to introduce free third level fees and a host of other measures, Deputies across the floor do not say it should not do that, but they do not accept the consequences that we need to spend money.</P>
    <P>The same is true in the area of social welfare. Far from the Opposition regarding the enhancement of benefits introduced by the Government as generous, they are constantly the subject of abuse and adverse comment that we are mean and not doing enough.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Nobody imagined at the start of 1996 that the greatest crisis ever to hit Irish agriculture and European and world beef was about to happen. It had nothing directly to do with us, if anyone can be blamed, it was largely the result of the failure of the British system to spot what was happening in time and to take action.  The British are probably the biggest culprits.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Government had no choice, nor should it have, in dealing with that problem, which also involved money.</P>
    <P>All Members, particularly the Opposition, have, with justification at times, been critical of the fact that more resources and efforts had not been put into the area of justice.  I can say without fear or favour that the Government in the past year has provided extra judges, courthouses and a new prison crash programme.  I am directing where we will spend £70 million to provide a third more prison places than we had last year, in approximately two years from now.  That is being done not only with the blessing of the Opposition, but with the active encouragement of the main Opposition party's articulate spokesperson on this subject.</P>
    <P>Having a business background, I recognise the arguments put forward by Deputy Brennan about the need to contain public spending, but we must have a sense of balance about it.  Our economy is <Col N="663" /> doing very well.  We will not spend all the fruits of that on some type of irrelevant public spending. We are spending some of that money on important social areas, but we are also managing the economy prudently.  That has been recognised not only by economists, the Central Bank and others here, but by our peers and judges in Europe who must make the most critical decisions about all the economies in regard to economic and monetary union within the next 12 months.  I am confident our economy will stand that test.  On that basis I can say this economy is being prudently and well managed in the interests of our people.</P>

      <P>Tógfaigh mé Ceisteanna 1, 3 agus 5 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Faoi mar atá ráite go soiléir agam cheana féin, is ar RTE a leagadh an cúram an bonneagar teicniúil riachtanach a thógáil lena chumasú do Theilifís na Gaeilge feidhmiú mar sheirbhís náisiúnta ar leith.  Is é an bun-sprioc a bhí ann ná go mbeadh sé indéanta do suas le 90 faoin gcéad de dhaonra an Stáit teacht ar Theilifís na Gaeilge ón tús.  Faoi mar a dúirt mé mar fhreagra ar Cheisteanna sa Teach seo ar 8 Deireadh Fómhair, mheas RTE ag an am sin go mbeadh teacht ag idir 93 faoin gcéad agus 95 faoin gcéad den daonra ar Theilifís na Gaeilge ón tús-dáta craolta.  Tá RTE tar éis a chinntiú go raibh a gcuid meastacháin ceart agus go bhfuil sé indéanta do 93 faoin gcéad den daonra an tseirbhís a fháil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> Chun teacht ar an tseirbhís, áfach, is féidir go mbeidh ar chuid den lucht féachana a gcuid teilifíseáin a thiúnadh isteach.  I gcásanna áirithe, go háirithe nuair atá RTE 1 agus Network 2 á bhfáil ar VHF, beidh sé riachtanach do dhaoine aeróg UHF a insealbhú.  Measann RTE go bhféadfadh sé tarlú go mbeadh ar suas le 20 faoin gcéad den daonra aeróg den chineál sin a fháil.  Ní mór dom a threisiú nach bhfuil aon rud speisialta nó neamhghnách ag baint le haeróga UHF.  Tá siad in úsáid ar fud na tíre agus, mar shampla, craoltar na cainéil theilifíse thalmhaí go léir sa Bhreatain ar UHF.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil sé ag dul dian ar dhaoine áirithe, ar chúis amháin nó ar chúis eile, na hathruithe is gá a chur i gcrích d'fhonn an tseirbhís a thiúnadh isteach, fiú i gcásanna ina bhféadfaí an tseirbhís a fháil gan aon trealamh nua a bheith riachtanach.  Ar threoir uaimse, bhí comhráití ag mo Roinnse le RTE agus le Teilifís na Gaeilge maidir le bealaí ina bhféadfaí réiteach a fháil ar na fadhbanna seo.  Tá RTE agus Teilifís na Gaeilge i mbun feachtais leanúnach chun eolas agus cúnamh a chur ar fáil d'fhonn na deacrachtaí atá ann a shárú.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an bhfáil ar Theilifís na Gaeilge i dTuaisceart Éireann, ba chóir go mbeadh sé sin ar aon dul leis an bhfáil atá ann ar RTE 1 agus Network 2 ar UHF.  Thug mé sonraí cheana féin de na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh chun an fáil ar sheirbhísí theilifíse RTE i dTuaisceart Éireann a fheabhsú agus a leathnú.  Bhí mé i dteagmháil le déanaí le Rúnaí Stáit na Breataine don Oidhreacht Náisiúnta maidir leis na cúinsí praiticiúla agus airgeadais a bhaineann le plean teicniúil chun an teacht ar sheirbhísí ó tharchuradóir RTE ag Clermont Carn i gCo Lú a leathnú.  Beidh buntáistí le gnóthú ag Teilifís na Gaeilge as an bpróiséas sin.</P>

      <P>All we have heard from the Minister today is a rambling reply, an attempt to justify the fact that he misled the House on 8 October 1996 when he said he expected the entire country, at the minimum, would have 93 per cent coverage on the first night, the remaining 7 per cent &mdash; where difficulties are located in the west &mdash; on the first night of transmission would be confined to parts of Mayo.  The Minister must be aware of the reception problems encountered nationwide in regard to Teilifís na Gaeilge. Unfortunately, in replying to similar parliamentary questions tabled on 8 October last the Minister left the impression that 93 per cent of the population would be able to avail of Teilifís na Gaeilge without the necessity to purchase specialist equipment.  Does the Minister accept that his raising unrealistic expectations about the availability of Teilifís na Gaeilge caused great disappointment, bearing in mind the recent TAM ratings? Furthermore, does he accept the view advanced by the management of Teilifís na Gaeilge that the scientific basis of the survey cannot be guaranteed given the present circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="665" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as helpful as possible.  First, there certainly was not any intention on my part to mislead this House.  My advice from RTÉ, which remains the same, relates to the availability of the signal.  The difficulties being experienced by people in receiving Teilifís na Gaeilge are a source of disappointment, as the Deputy suggests, especially to those of us who worked so hard to provide as wide a viewership as possible.  In relation to those who are experiencing difficulties at present, some are reluctant, which I accept, to retune their television sets. From our experience to date, in terms of the numbers of people involved, this represents the greater proportion of difficulties being encountered. Another source of difficulty is that some dealers, when asked to assist, suggest that people need to purchase equipment which is not always necessary.  Yet another source of difficulty is the signal available, as it were, on the roof which necessitates an adjustment to the aerial and the purchase of a UHF aerial.</P>
      <P>It is important to draw a distinction between that figure &mdash; the proportion of the population, including Northern Ireland, the new service was aimed to cover &mdash; and that representing the difficulties encountered in receipt of the signal.  New, additional, efforts will be made to overcome these problems.  For example, some of the results of the meeting that I instructed be held between my Department, RTE and Teilifís na Gaeilge were to embark on a whole set of new measures to enable people to tune in.  Members will have observed initiatives taken in relation to the <i>RTE Guide</i>, An Post and RTE which I hope will be of assistance.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera raised another matter not strictly within my ministerial responsibilities.  She appears to suggest that the discussion which took place on the adequacy of the sample, on which TAM ratings were based, was inadequate or inconclusive.  That discussion, together with a comment by the head of Teilifís na Gaeilge, were very much their prerogative.  People should give the new service a chance and allow it time to be established.  The appropriate time to assess the general public response to it will be when it has been running for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept he has done a grave injustice to Teilifís na Gaeilge, to its fine programme makers, by giving this type of misleading information to viewers nationally? Furthermore, does he accept that the need to purchase new special UHF aerials ought to have been fully pointed out to viewers before the service went on air and, because that was not done, we are now in the position that those who did not support Teilifís na Gaeilge from the outset, who would like to subvert it, have been given the requisite ammunition to do damage to this very fine service?  Does the Minister accept that, from the outset, he should have pointed out to viewers how to gain access to this very good service?</P>

    <Col N="666" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of the Deputy's questions is most irresponsible.  I certainly did not damage Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I was asked a question here on more than one occasion on the proportion of the population at which the new service was directed.  I answered that question in a straightforward manner based on the advice given to me by the national broadcaster vested with the statutory responsibility of bringing the service into being.  There is no point in trying to confuse people about this.  I must reiterate that there is a distinction between coverage on which I was asked a question and furnished the relevant information.  I have accepted that there are difficulties in relation to reception but there is nothing to be gained from seeking to confuse the separate issues of reception and the transmission itself.</P>
      <P>I might add it is still calculated by RTE that, in relation to the reception of Teilifís na Gaeilge, an adjustment of television sets would satisfy more than 90 per cent of those viewers involved.  For example, in regard to the approximate 20 per cent of people who would need to erect a new aerial, the possible need for a new UHF aerial had been in the public realm since the receipt of the technical report on the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge. In the Gaeltacht, which I have the honour to represent, aerials have been available ranging in price from £7.50 to £20.  The important thing now is for Teilifís na Gaeilge to be supported through the provision of the maximum amount of assistance to ensure that the difficulties being encountered in tuning sets and adjusting aerials can be resolved as speedily as possible.  Following a discussion with the Select Committee on Social Affairs, I instructed that a meeting be held between my Department and a team in Teilifís na Gaeilge to decide on a set of measures to urgently address this matter.</P>

Ach tá sé sin cosúil lena rá go bhfuil fáil ag formhór an phobail ar an teileafón soghluaiste agus dearmad a dhéanamh a rá leo go gcaithfidh tú an teileafón beag a bheith i do phóca agat len é a oibriú; tá an rud san aeráid, cinnte.  An nglacann an tAire leis gurb iad na ceantair is mó atá buailte ná na ceantair ó dheas agus thiar agus gurb in an dá cheantar is mó sa tír a mbeidh lucht féachana ag Teilifís na Gaeilge iontu, nuair a bheidh fáil acu air.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to be disingenuous.  I want to make as much progress and give as much information as possible.  We must be fair when trying to solve this problem. People are often reluctant to interfere with their television sets in order to get a good reception. The last time this matter was raised I said there would be a series of initiatives, involving Teilifís na Gaeilge, post offices, dealers and the <i>RTÉ Guide</i>, to provide information.</P>
      <P>There was a danger when this matter was first raised that there would be an attempt to exploit the need for an aerial.  As a result, discussions took place between my Department and others and that is why it was possible to supply aerials between the prices of £7.50 and £20.</P>

De réir na nAchtanna Craolacháin ó 1960 ar aghaidh, tá an cúram ormsa, nuair a bheadh cinneadh tógtha ag an Rialtas.  Agus chun an fhírinne a chur ar an gclár arís, an chéad chinneadh de Rialtas ar bith i leith Theilifís na Gaeilge, tógadh é in earrach 1993 agus an tarna ceann i 1995.</P>
      <P>Iad sin tógtha, bhí orm na cinní sin a chur in iúil do RTE mar de réir reachtaíocht 1960 bhí mise ag iarraidh orthu Teilifís na Gaeilge a chur i gcrích agus bunaíodh Comhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Bhí bealach eile chun é a dhéanamh: reachtaíocht a thabhairt ar aghaidh, airgead a chur ar fáil agus an tseirbhís nua a bhunú.

      <P>No proposal of the kind raised in the Deputy's question has been made to me by Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  However, in the 1995-6 review and the 1995 annual report of Bord Scannán na hÉireann which was recently published, the chair of the board posited the view that it is necessary to make a strong connection between Irish cinema and its varied audiences and suggested that a small levy on a cinema seat could provide a secure fund for film production well into the future.  The views expressed by the chair in that publication are her own.</P>
      <P>While I found the views interesting and I am open to considering any suggestions which would fund film production in the future, I have no plans at present to implement a levy on cinema seats.  It was necessary for me to appoint a new chairperson of Bord Scannán na hÉireann as, under section 13 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, the current chairperson had notified me that she wished to retire from this position on personal grounds.  I pay tribute to the inspirational leadership she gave the board and film community during her period in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A cinema seat levy is in operation in two countries &mdash; Great Britain and France.  The British one was discontinued <Col N="670" /> although in its day it provided an advantage to the British film industry.  In both cases, there are significant distinctions between, for example, the receipts from the levy and the manner in which they are distributed to the film production sector. In France, the levy avoids, for example, money going back into the treasury and having to come out again as a dedicated fund for film.  Relationships between the cultural industries, the Ministers responsible and the Department of Finance are difficult in this country and that applies to whoever may wish to introduce a levy.</P>
      <P>The circumstances are different in Ireland and that would have to be taken into account.  As to the merit of the suggestion, I am not prepared to introduce it at this time, but it is worthy of examination.  I have examined many aspects of it but I have no plans at present.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he might be able to take up some of its proposals.  What I am going to say next has nothing to do with the personalities involved whether it be the present incumbent or Dr. Lelia Doolan.  I concur with the Minister's view that she has done a great deal with regard to the arts and the film industry.  I ask this supplementary question as a matter of principle without reference to either personality.  Does the Minister agree a decision to appoint a new chairperson for the film board was sharp practice?  Is it the Minister's deliberate strategy to fill positions now as he is unlikely to be in office when they become vacant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I have to seek your guidance.  I have in recent times heard remarks from Deputy de Valera similar to those she has just made.  I take exception to the phrase &ldquo;sharp practice&rdquo;.  It reflects on my behaviour as a Minister and it suggests I am doing something that is either dishonest or untrue.  The position is that the chairperson of An Bord Scannán, Dr. Lelia Doolan, for personal and vocational reasons indicated some time ago that she wanted to move on.  I wish I did not have to give these details in the House.  She was replaced by a distinguished Irish film maker, Mr. Louis Marcus, somebody who was already a member of An Bord Scannán.  To suggest, for example, that I will not be in office in May or June is the Deputy's right; it is speculation, but to take that and construct innuendo and an allegation from which a conclusion of sharp practice is drawn reflects badly on those who suggest to her that this is her new mode of relationship to the brief for which she has responsibility.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am sure you are aware that I prefaced my remarks. This was a matter of principle which did not pertain to either of the personalities involved.  I hope the Minister still believes it is the right of the Opposition to question him on his work as Minister. Any criticism from this side of the House is based on sound principle.  I raised this matter because it is one of grave concern and public interest.  I still pose the question on the principle of nominating the chairperson of this board.  It is not the approach that should be taken by a Minister when this vacancy would normally arise in the months of April and May when the Minister is not likely to be in Government.  That is speculation, as the Minister said, but it is fair.  It is a question that has been asked openly in public and I want a genuine answer from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I reject any suggestion of failure on my part to provide adequate funding for An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  On 18 January 1996, An Chomhairle Ealaíon agreed to redesignate the arts plan to cover the five year period 1995-9 and to reorder its priorities accordingly.  It follows that <Col N="672" /> the funding targets in the arts plan now apply to this five year period.</P>
      <P>The increased provision of £20.8 million for An Chomhairle Ealaíon for 1997 means I have succeeded in more than doubling An Chomhairle's allocation since my initial appointment as Minister in 1993.  It also represents an increase of £2.4 million over An Chomhairle's allocation for 1996, or a 13 per cent increase.  Percentage increases of the same magnitude in 1998 and 1999, years four and five of the plan, will bring the resources of An Chomhairle to a level of more than £26 million, the funding target for the final year of the arts plan.</P>

      <P>When the arts plan was introduced with great pomp and ceremony we all had great hopes for it and discussed it in the House. That three year plan is, however, now a five year plan and there is already a £12 million shortfall in funding.  Will the Minister agree that demonstrates a failure on the Government's part, which has led to great disappointment and disillusionment within the arts community?  Does he accept the unbiased view of the arts editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> that a criticism-resistant climate currently pervades public cultural life?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's last remark about a criticism-resistant climate, I welcome criticism.  I have attended seminars where many aspects of the arts policy were debated.  People who make allegations should substantiate them. The Deputy spoke previously about a climate of fear.  I suggest that she be upfront and state where it is.  Criticism is most welcome, but I do not agree with the reference she quoted.</P>
      <P>In 1993 funding for the arts amounted to £10.1 million.  Under the arts plan annual funding for An Chomhairle Ealaíon is £26 million.  At present the provision is £20.6 million, more than the twice the allocation in 1993.  They are facts.  Another interesting fact is that in 1994 in the dying days of the minority Government of which I had formerly been a member, the Deputy's party leader who was then Minister for Finance and acting Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht proposed a cut in the allocation for An Chomhairle Ealaíon, from £13.2 million to £11.6 million.  It takes some neck to wonder why a Minister who has doubled funding for the Arts Council did not do in a five year plan what might have been done in three years when in the six weeks the Deputy's leader was responsible for that area, rather than an acceleration of funding for the plan there was a reduction.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  6, 7, 9, 10, 13 agus 18 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Cé go bhfuil cuid de na ceisteanna seo i nGaeilge agus cuid eile i mBéarla, tá i gceist agam an freagra a thabhairt sa chéad áit i mBéarla.  Beidh mé lán-sásta, ar ndóigh, ceisteanna forlíontacha a fhreagairt i gceachtar den dá theanga, de réir mar a oireann do Theachtaí.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the farming community about the transposition into Irish law of Directive 92/43/EEC and the subsequent designation of special areas of conservation &mdash; SACs &mdash; and I have received representations from the Connemara IFA among others in the matter. Directive 92/43/EEC was due to be implemented in Ireland in June 1994.  However, despite the fact that we are already behind schedule and because of the possible institution of legal proceedings by the EU Commission, I have undertaken not to bring the directive into effect until February 1997, to ensure adequate time is given to consultations in respect of the compensation requirements and the proposals in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before any designation of special areas of conservation occurs there will be full consultation. There has already been substantial consultation with farm organisations and this week with a number of local authorities.  All land owners and land users, identified as having land included in the sites, will be provided with a site map, site description and details of the conditions applying to the site.  There is no question of land being impounded, as suggested in one of the questions. The restrictions arising, if any, will be the minimum that will achieve the conservation of the site.  For example, the conditions applied to blanket <Col N="676" /> bogs, heaths, upland grasslands and to the Burren will be identical to those already agreed by the farming organisations for REPS in proposed natural heritage areas.  These prescriptions for environmentally friendly farming for twothirds of the areas involved have already been agreed with farming organisations.  Other prescriptions will be discussed and agreed in the same way.  Farmers who are farming their lands in a sustainable manner will not need to make changes.</P>
    <P>The sites have been selected on the criteria required under the habitats directive and the directive allows only for the consideration of scientific objections to designation.  The cost of objections will vary from case to case and the question of how these costs should be borne is the subject of ongoing discussions with the farming organisations.  Maps of the special areas of conservation will be published when the directive comes into effect.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the Government is agreeable as part of a new programme replacing the current PCW to pay a fair and proper level of compensation, having regard to the level and extent of restrictions and all reasonable losses arising as a result of the SAC designations.  I shall appoint an independent arbitrator to adjudicate on disputes in relation to the level of compensation.  In the interest of equity I will be proposing that the State should bear the cost of the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>Natural heritage areas are still only at the proposal stage.  There will be no designation until new legislation has been introduced and passed by the Oireachtas.  There will be provisions for full consultation in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1997.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread concern and anger among farmers, who live where the national heritage areas have been designated or are proposed to be designated and where the conservation areas are most likely to come into effect, about the absence of specific information relating to the individual farmer which would indicate what area of his land would be included, what restrictions would be placed on his farming practices, the likely effect on his income and the provisions to compensate him for any loss arising from the restrictions?  The anger arises from the lack of real information available to individual land owners.  In view of this point, which the Minister did not address, I ask him to postpone the transposition of this directive into Irish law until maps are made available to farmers, all these questions are adequately answered, a proper consultation process is available for individual farmers as distinct from the organisations representing them and details of compensation are supplied.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to give the maximum information to the Deputy and the public.  It is some time since I met the representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, Connemara branch, in Galway, when we discussed a number of the issues to which I referred in my reply. Today we are distributing to all Deputies, Senators and public representatives a booklet written in Irish and English called <i>Farming in Nature</i>, which sets out the basis, background and procedures taking place.</P>
      <P>I will give an example because I want to be as positive as possible about the information sought by the Deputy.  It is my hope that the maps will be distributed before February but I have to confirm how far that has progressed technically.  On objections to designation there will be an appeals mechanism &mdash; that was one point about which the farming organisations were concerned.  That will include a farming representative, a representative of conservation interests and an independent chair.  After designation, where there is disagreement on the level of compensation, for example, it will be decided by an arbitrator who will be independent of the Minister.  Then, as a gesture to make sure that mechanism of appeal for compensation will be fair, the cost will be borne by the Department.</P>
      <P>It may be helpful to note that in most cases &mdash; perhaps as many as 70 per cent &mdash; agreements already exist within the REPS mechanism.  One then comes to the remaining cases, about which there will be discussion and debate at different meetings.  Where there is no danger or where existing practices are sustainable there will be no problem.  One is then left with the smaller proportion where there is a threat to sustainability, in which case the person can use the informal mechanism of approaching the ranger, who will bring up any opinions, or he may invoke the formal appeal mechanism which we have put in place.  If there must be a change of practice and the compensation level is disputed, there will be an independent arbitrator, the cost of whom will be borne by the Department.</P>

The Minister must accept that the details of the appeals mechanism he refers to are not sufficiently clear to allay the fears of farmers. He said the appeal must be scientifically based but how can a farmer on a poor holding in Connemara afford the expense of having a scientific appeal prepared against the designation of his farm?  Will farmers have to pay for the preservation of these areas or is it not more properly a matter for society to pay through proper, adequate, permanent compensation for farmers arising out of the possible loss of the opportunity to gain an income from their holding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One must first draw a distinction between the NHAs and the SACs.  In relation to national heritage areas, enabling legislation will be the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1997, which I hope to introduce early in 1997.  On the special areas of conservation which are a subset of the larger NHAs, a number of farmers in those areas are already practising farming under the REP scheme.  I am sure the Deputy is not suggesting a division between ecological concern and farming, but farmers are anxious to practise responsible farming in a changed way.  Sustainability is under threat in the special areas of conservation.  The meetings with farmers have been useful and have been followed with meetings at which agreement was reached on stocking levels in relation to sheep in mountainous areas where whole sides of mountains had deteriorated. Proposals came from the farmers as to how they might be managed and they were accepted.</P>
      <P>The details of how the appeal scheme might work arose from talks.  I had a meeting at which I suggested that in circumstances where a farmer in an area of special conservation has trained a member of his family to farm in a particular way, and that person must now be retrained, there might be an <i>ex gratia</i> power to deal with such exceptions.  We have so far supplied all the information sought by the IFA.  I intend to have more meetings around the country and to provide all the information requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong to think we had to make a <Col N="680" /> choice between responsible ecological management, in which I believe farmers want to play a lead role as they are closest to the land, and practices that put sustainability at risk.  We will be able to provide all the information people want and we will continue to place advertisements and hold seminars and meetings.  In relation to maps and designations, I will try to ensure these are made available at local offices for consultation.</P>

      <P>I am about to put one that is more direct and better than those put by the Deputy, and in a shorter time.  As the Minister is aware, in certain circumstances where agreement cannot be reached on development in national heritage areas, the State may have to purchase the property. Will the Minister outline the criteria that will be used in the valuation?  Will the valuation be based on the existing undeveloped situation or on the potential after development?

      <P>To answer Deputy Nealon's question, the enabling legislation which I hope will be the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 1997 &mdash; I am equally confident of getting that Bill through the House before I disappear &mdash; places a minimal disadvantage in relation to designation because it is a requirement to give notice of a proposed usage, and the delay which might ensue would be approximately six months.  The difference between the special areas of conservation and the NHAs is that a special area of conservation, constructed on the legal basis of the directives, is such as to say a person may have to cease an activity if that activity contravened sustainability. It seemed reasonable, therefore, that there was a clear case for compensation for having to cease or redirect activity in special areas of conservation. The same case does not apply in relation to NHAs.  If, however, a great deal of the territory comprising NHAs already falls within State ownership, the manner in which the State would acquire property would be in accordance with the procedures that prevailed up to now.</P>

      <P>I was in Sligo last Sunday to select a candidate for the Progressive Democrats; perhaps when the new Deputy comes to the House we will have more information to convey to the people of Sligo.

Will he further accept that much of what we quite rightly seek to preserve and protect has been endangered by farming habits over generations and grazing practices?  Will he further accept that if this process is to be successful, he must enter into ongoing dialogue with the farmers because they are the custodians of our environment who are <i>in situ</i> day after day?  The success of this legislation will rest on them at the end of the day.</P>

We do not have to make a choice between farming as a practice and responsible ecological management.  We <Col N="684" /> owe a great deal to the achievement of those closest to the land.

I am trying to achieve a balanced approach towards it.  I appreciate Opposition Deputies' right to express concerns.  Such meetings as are appropriate will take place.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the valuable natural habitat, that is now considered by Commission and by everybody to be worth preserving and which is the subject of these directives, is there because of the traditional farming practices of generations of Irish farmers?  It was not the European Commission that put it there.  It was the farming community through the centuries and they have a much greater vested interest in preserving it than those who want to impose restrictions upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Dáil for this opportunity to set the record straight about a number of matters which have been the subject of intense comment in recent weeks.  I will cover the relationship with Dunnes Stores, the funding of my house in Holycross and its potential implications, the circumstances surrounding my departure from Butler Refrigeration and the establishment of my own business.  I will also cover the matter of political contributions by Dunnes Stores, my role as chairman of the Fine Gael Party and the party trustees, the awarding of the GSM licence to Esat Digifone, and other innuendoes and manufactured allegations which have been made against me.</P>
      <P>Ideally I would like to have made this statement much earlier, but it will become clear why this would not have been possible.  The matters are complex and involve others outside the House whose interests had to be considered.  As a Minister and politician I discharged my responsibilities properly; these are the matters for which I am answerable to the House.</P>
      <P>As a businessman I left unfinished commercial business behind me.  In my business life I accept that I have been culpable in that I did not fully deal with the responsibilities arising from my business affairs in a timely fashion.  When I entered Government in late 1994 I had to distance myself from my business almost without notice and in unexpected circumstances.  When anybody with a business enters Government, the process of clearing up outstanding issues is extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>I regret and I apologise to the Taoiseach for not bringing these matters to his attention before or after the formation of the Government.  On taking up the office of Minister I made a declaration to the Taoiseach to the effect that I had availed of the tax amnesty and that, in so far as I was aware, all my tax affairs were up to date and paid.  I now accept that some of my tax obligations are still outstanding.  I apologise to the Taoiseach, the House and the public for failing in that regard.  As people who make the law, politicians have a special responsibility to adhere to its letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot recall any Member of this House ever making the kind of detailed and personal statement of business affairs which I am about to make.  It is a painful and unpleasant experience <Col N="690" /> but I have chosen to make my position clear.  If I repeat myself it is only because I want the House to fully grasp the facts.</P>
    <P>Much of what I have to say concerns my business relationship with Dunnes Stores.  The relationship was formed at a time when Mr. Ben Dunne was chairman and chief executive of that company.  Mr. Dunne had a style of doing business which reflected his personality.  Since his departure from Dunnes Stores the current management, led by Margaret Heffernan and Frank Dunne, has initiated fundamental changes in the company's style and the manner in which the business of Dunnes Stores is conducted.  I propose to outline the nature and basis of my relationship with Dunnes Stores as it was agreed with Mr. Ben Dunne and how it operated.  In the interests of fairness I advise the House that the current management of Dunnes Stores dispute the validity of certain key aspects to my agreement with Dunnes Stores which predated their tenure.</P>
    <P>After I was elected to the Dáil my employer at that time, Butler Refrigeration, with whom I enjoyed an excellent business and working relationship since I was 17, felt I could not serve the company and look after my interests as a Dáil Deputy at the same time so I ceased employment with that company on 31 December 1987.  Over one year later, to my surprise as I will explain later, Mr. Ben Dunne approached me and told me he would be changing the way the refrigeration requirements of Dunnes Stores would be managed.  He would be transferring the business from my old company.  He gave me first option on this business and when I expressed reservations he told me if I did not take this opportunity it would go to another company which he named.</P>
    <P>He proposed to pay for the refrigeration services provided in two ways.  This was a dual agreement arrangement in which payment was to be made to my new company providing certain services and payment and bonuses were to be paid to me for separate professional refrigeration services. Agreement was reached on this basis and, from March 1989 to the present day, my company, Streamline Enterprises, and I provided multi-million pound services to Dunnes Stores.  It is my contention that the net effect is that Dunnes Stores still owe me and my company money up to 1994 and 1995, respectively.  No provision has been made for this in the company's accounts or in my personal tax returns as the amounts have never been established.</P>
    <P>I purchased a house at Holycross in 1992.  This house is in the joint names of my wife and myself and is mortgaged.  As I was personally owed a considerable but undetermined sum of money, Mr. Ben Dunne proposed that Dunnes Stores would undertake renovation of the house. Dunnes Stores appointed the architect.  Dunnes Stores appointed the contractor.  It may seem incredible but the truth is that the total value of this work has still not been determined to my satisfaction.  As recently as yesterday afternoon, <Col N="691" /> Dunnes Stores through their solicitors stated that payments to their contractor, Faxhill Homes Limited, in respect of alterations to my house amounted to an extraordinary £395,000.  I totally reject this figure.</P>
    <P>My house, including the extension, is less than 4,000 square feet.  Having been concerned about this matter I retained independent professional advice to assess the true value of the work done. I state emphatically it was only when I read media reports on 29 November 1996 that I became aware, for the first time, of the suggestion that charges against my house were offset internally within Dunnes Stores to the Ilac Shopping Centre. This is a matter for Dunnes Stores.</P>
    <P>In the strongest and clearest possible manner I state that any money spent on my house was income payable to me in respect of nothing other than professional refrigeration advice and service. This had nothing to do with my role as a TD or subsequently as a Minister.  It was not a loan, it was not a gift, it was not a handout, it was income. The work on the house was payment on account for professional services to Dunnes Stores.</P>
    <P>It was my understanding that the taxation consequences of this could only be dealt with when final agreement was reached with Dunnes Stores. It was not designed by me as a tax evasion measure.  It was not and never was intended to be a tax evasion measure by me.</P>
    <P>I made numerous attempts to finalise outstanding issues with Dunnes Stores.  A sequence of events within Dunnes Stores and, therefore, outside my control frustrated my efforts.  As far as I am concerned there is unfinished business but business which I have been seeking to complete. No declarations in respect of these matters have yet been made by me because the value of what I earned under the terms of the agreement with Dunnes Stores has yet to be determined.  To settle my tax affairs with the Revenue Commissioners, the value of what I received from Dunnes Stores has to be determined and the period to which it relates settled.</P>
    <P>I have paid residential property tax each year based on the purchase price of my house.  In the light of the true value of the work to my house which remains to be established I will also have to review the residential property tax returned in that regard.  The VAT aspects of these trading matters will also be addressed.</P>
    <P>Let there be absolutely no doubt that I intend to ensure that any taxation obligation is fully and promptly settled by me with the Revenue Commissioners. To ensure there is absolutely no delay in this regard, through my professional tax advisers, I have already had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners in the way open to all citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>Having been publicly criticised to an unprecedented level I ask your patience and indulgence to enable me to take you through the sequence of events which led to the formation of my company, its legitimate commercial operations, the <Col N="692" /> outline of services provided, the financial arrangements and method of payment and to the fact that despite all my efforts, I have unfinished business with Dunnes Stores and, therefore, with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Among the allegations that have been made against me is the suggestion that I treated my first employer unethically.  I began work as an apprentice refrigeration engineer with Butler Refrigeration in 1971.  At that time Mr. Butler operated from a garage at the side of his house.  I did the normal duties designated to an apprentice.  I then moved on to refrigeration maintenance and progressed from there, on my own initiative, to sales promotion.  This was an outstanding success.  I went into sales full-time and later became sales manager of the company.  The business was thriving and in the mid-70s Butler Refrigeration moved to a new extensive warehouse at Turtulla, Thurles.  At that time we pursued one of the multiple groups with a view to expanding the business. After many advances to Dunnes Stores I finally received an urgent request to complete an installation for the company at its new store at Oakville, Clonmel.  That work was completed satisfactorily.  Following that, Dunnes Stores started to conduct large volumes of business with Butler Refrigeration and for many years I worked very closely with Dunnes Stores in the design, layout, installation, maintenance of refrigeration plant and equipment.</P>
    <P>I enjoyed the confidence and trust of Dunnes Stores personnel right up to senior management. During this period I represented Butler Refrigeration on several occasions in various discussions with Mr. Ben Dunne.  In 1987 I was nominated to represent the Fine Gael Party in the general election and was duly elected a TD.  Shortly after my election it became apparent that Butler Refrigeration felt I could not serve the company and look after my interests as a Dáil Deputy at the same time.  I ceased employment on 31 December 1987 and acted as a freelance salesman for refrigeration products.  I agreed with Mr. Butler that I would retain the use of the car for a period and that whatever I sold for him would be subject to commission.  It was during this time as a freelance consultant that I was contacted by a Dunnes Stores executive who had responsibility for Northern Ireland and England.  He informed me the company was opening a number of new stores for food and textiles in England.  He requested me to prepare the design and layout for the refrigeration plant and equipment, asked me to negotiate the contracts locally in England and to oversee the installation.  I did this successfully on a consultancy basis for Dunnes Stores.  I understand that my successful work was recognised and appreciated at the time.</P>
    <P>The executive told me that previous to the opening of the Bradford store in November 1988 Mr. Ben Dunne, who had arrived on the shop floor and had seen me, asked what Butler Refrigeration was doing in England.  He informed Mr. Dunne that I was no longer with that comnise <Col N="693" /> pany but was acting as a consultant to Dunnes Stores.  Mr. Dunne called me over and said he did not realise I had left Butler Refrigeration and that he would like to see me in his office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I tried unsuccessfully a few times to contact him and then dropped the matter.  Two months later Mr. Dunne contacted me unexpectedly and arranged a meeting.  This is a meeting I will never forget.  He opened the conversation with me by saying he was very surprised I was no longer with Butler Refrigeration and that he valued the contribution I had made to Dunnes Stores.  He said that several of his senior staff had confirmed the important role I had played and the interest and commitment I had shown to Dunnes Stores.</P>
    <P>In his own inimitable style Mr. Dunne asked me the following questions in quick succession. He asked me how long I had been with Butler Refrigeration and I told him 16 years.  He asked me if I had any pension rights on leaving the company and I responded no.  He asked me if I had received any severance money and I said no.  He asked me if I had received any redundancy and I said no.  He asked me if I had received any lump sum and I said no.  He proceeded to tell me that he had made a decision to change his refrigeration supplier and contractor and that he would give me first option on that business nationwide. My reaction was genuinely one of amazement and surprise.  I said I would find it difficult because I would be competing for business against my old company Butler Refrigeration.  He responded that he was making the change anyway, he was giving me first option and if I was not interested in his proposal he would offer the business to another company which he named.</P>
    <P>After considering his proposals, and in view of the fact that the business was going from Butlers anyway, I told him I would manage some of the business and it was agreed that I would look after the Munster stores.  He then called in his chief accountant and instructed him to provide whatever assistance and funding were needed to establish the business.  I proceeded to establish the cost factors and at a later stage I returned to him for a further discussion in the presence of the Dunnes Stores' chief accountant.  Mr. Dunne said that his objective was to reduce the refrigeration overheads and costs to Dunnes Stores and he was prepared to assist me in setting up a new company to achieve the savings he felt could and should be made.  I agreed that my company would provide exclusive refrigeration services to the Dunnes Group.  I committed my company and myself to sourcing the best quality, most cost effective equipment and the most reliable systems.  I also agreed that the company would provide all refrigeration plant equipment, materials and components at cost price, I would design and arrange layout and technical detail for all new installations and major refurbishment, all installations and maintenance would be carried out by qualified engineers employed by me, a programme of preventative maintenance would be <Col N="694" /> carried out in his stores, with a 24 hour emergency service, and I would advise the group on technical advances and industry developments to ensure that the most advanced systems were available to Dunnes.</P>
    <P>In regard to remuneration, we discussed a number of options on which way to remunerate the company and me.  Mr. Dunne said that I should leave it to his judgment to make a decision on profits but clearly stated that he would put the company in profit and also remunerate me separately for my technical advice and for the project management of the various jobs.  There was also to be a performance bonus.  It was agreed that my company's costs and outlays would be calculated annually, that there would be regular payments on account and at the end of the year auditors appointed on the direction of Dunnes Stores would check income against expenditure and any outstanding moneys would be paid by Dunnes. He gave me a commitment that he would personally review the performance and agree moneys due on an annual basis.  Unfortunately for me, he never got around to doing this.</P>
    <P>As our negotiating positions were far from equal, I did not feel able to press the matter very strongly.  This inequality in the negotiating positions has been a persistent difficulty in this matter generally.  There was no written confirmation of the agreement &mdash; all the arrangements were made with Mr. Dunne verbally.  The relevant arrangements were made in the presence of the chief accountant of the Dunnes Stores Group.  I asked to have the agreement formalised but my suggestion was dismissed by Mr. Dunne as being unnecessary and he asked if I did not trust him. My failure to get this agreement in writing is central to my present difficulty.</P>
    <P>I began operations in the Munster area and it soon became evident that compared with previous years huge savings could and were being achieved.  Mr. Dunne then decided that I should at the earliest opportunity take over the service and maintenance of all the stores in the Dunnes Stores Group.  Arising from discussions with Mr. Dunne and the Dunnes Stores' chief accountant it was agreed that I should purchase a site and build a warehouse and that Dunnes would provide the necessary financial backing and credit facilities.  A loan was advanced to the company and repaid by agreement over four years.  This transaction was shown in the accounts of Streamline Enterprises.</P>
    <P>The relationship worked very well in practice. Through my agencies, I sourced a substantial amount of new equipment which was invoiced at factory prices direct to Dunnes Stores.  I initiated new policies and programmes for the Dunnes Stores Group and standardised all their installations. There was an acceptance and acknowledgement that there had been a dramatic improvement in the presentation of refrigeration and a huge reduction in the overall cost in refrigeration outlay for the Dunnes Stores Group.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the full magnitude of the savings <Col N="695" /> achieved, maintenance was the area where one would normally expect the lowest savings, yet we were able in our new enterprise to reduce the maintenance costs for Dunnes Stores nationwide by almost 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the knowledge that I was owed substantial money but in the absence of any discussion as to the amount involved, I told Mr. Dunne in early 1992 that I intended to purchase and refurbish a house at Holycross.  He said I had achieved excellent results, he was delighted with the performance and he would assist me financially in the purchase and refurbishment by way of an advance on the money owing to me which had yet to be quantified.  He told me he would give his chief accountant instructions on this matter.</P>
    <P>I was later informed that Mr. Dunne had appointed a Dunnes Stores' architect and contractor. I was advised by the Dunnes Stores chief accountant that after consultation and agreement on the plans I should leave all future arrangements, including the financial ones, to Dunnes Stores.</P>
    <P>The question of planning permission has been raised.  The work on the house at Holycross involved replacement and extension of existing structures and internal alterations.  All outbuildings were already in existence and were only restored.  I have instructed the architect to apply for retention permission for the extension portion which requires planning permission.  I regret that this permission was not sought earlier.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, Mr. Ben Dunne encountered personal problems.  This is a suitable point at which to put paid to yet another of the countless malicious rumours circulated about me.  I was not involved with Mr. Ben Dunne, not then, not ever. He was unavailable to me and to many other people for a prolonged period.  As a result, I could not get a meeting to reconcile our financial arrangements.  This was followed by Mr. Dunne's removal as chairman of the group in September-October 1992 and as chief executive in February 1993, a most traumatic and difficult time for the entire Dunne family.</P>
    <P>Some time later in 1993, and following unsuccessful attempts to resolve the outstanding issues with senior executives in Dunnes Stores, I met Mrs. Margaret Heffernan by appointment in her office.  I told her that moneys had been spent on my house by the company, with Mr. Ben Dunne's approval.  Mrs. Heffernan advised that there were many problems relating to Mr. Ben Dunne's chairmanship of the company and his time in control, that the company was trying to assess the extent of the problems and that no issue, including mine, would be dealt with in isolation. However, she said she was determined to address all outstanding issues and that new systems would be implemented to ensure that orthodox practices and procedures would apply to all future Dunnes Stores transactions.  Subsequently I heard that Price Waterhouse had been appointed to conduct <Col N="696" /> an internal examination of the company's affairs. In addition, litigation proceedings had commenced internally in the company.  As Dunnes Stores was essentially my only customer, there was nothing I could do to force the issue.</P>
    <P>When the Price Waterhouse report was being prepared nobody sought any comment from me. I wish it were otherwise, as it would have given me the opportunity to answer questions in an orderly way before the report was selectively and maliciously leaked to the press.  To this day I am in the invidious position of not having seen that report.  However, I understand, after numerous inquiries, that apart from the house transaction there are two other references to my business in that report.  The payment of £50,000 was income payable to me under my arrangement with Dunnes Stores, on which tax has been paid.  The sums of £6,000 and £6,500 were paid as bonuses by Dunnes Stores for the staff of Streamline Enterprises, not including me.  Those payments were made in cash, without deduction of tax.</P>
    <P>During 1994 I had a number of discussions with Mr. Frank Dunne, including one wide-ranging discussion during the course of which I said I was unhappy that there were outstanding issues in respect of my house and that reconciliation of the account had not taken place.  We both agreed it would be best to have a formal agreement and a new arrangement drawn up.  He assured me a new formal agreement would be drawn up for the company.  Interim changes were made which were of benefit to my company.  In March 1996 Dunnes Stores agreed the terms of a new formal agreement for Streamline Enterprises.</P>
    <P>The current management of Dunnes Stores disputes a number of aspects of this.  Yesterday evening, through their solicitors, Dunnes Stores stated that no money is due to me personally or to my company, other than liability to Streamline incurred in the normal course of business since 31 January 1996, that Dunnes Stores relationship has been with Streamline and not with me and that they consider the payments to which I referred as irregular.  Irrespective of this legal letter I have set out the agreement I negotiated with Dunnes Stores in 1989 through Mr. Ben Dunne in the presence of his chief accountant.  There is disagreement about the moneys still owed to me and to my company for work done prior to the implementation of the new arrangement and a dispute in respect of the value of the work on the house at Holycross.  In short, the moneys provided by Dunnes Stores in connection with my house in Holycross were payment on account for professional services rendered by me.  The value of this part payment has never been finally agreed with Dunnes Stores.  The extent of the moneys I believe to be owing by Dunnes Stores is obviously a contentious issue.  Until these matters are determined I cannot assess all the tax implications of my arrangement with Dunnes Stores.  When they are determined they will be met in full.</P>
    <P>I did not make any secret of the fact that Dunnes Stores paid me for professional services <Col N="697" /> by way of assistance towards my house.  If someone were trying to hide income, would he or she not be more likely to put it in an offshore account?  The last thing such a person would do would be to spend it on a very obvious structure of bricks and mortar for all the world to see.  Notwithstanding the issue in dispute between us, I welcome the determined efforts of Dunnes Stores to bring a new order to its affairs and the Price Waterhouse report is part of this response.  It allows me, and I presume many other genuine people, to put their businesses on a sure footing.</P>
    <P>This is the substantial issue on which I wanted to give the House and the public an explanation, but other matters have been raised and allegations have been hurled which I want to put to rest.  Since the issue of my house was raised the debate has moved to the topic of political funding. It is a fact, and no amount of political posturing can obscure this, that most political parties have long depended for their survival on contributions from the business and corporate sectors. It is also a fact that individual Deputies from all parties received contributions at election times to defray campaign expenses.  The only political contribution I ever received from Mr. Ben Dunne was prior to the 1992 general election when I received £5,000 towards my election campaign.  I received no other political payments of any nature from Mr. Ben Dunne or Dunnes Stores either before or since then.  The moneys referred to in respect of my house had no connection whatsoever with my role as a politician.  It was income, an entirely proper and legitimate payment, solely and exclusively received for professional refrigeration services to Dunnes Stores.  To the best of my knowledge Dunnes Stores, Ben Dunne or any company in which he had an interest did not benefit from a decision I made as Minister.</P>
    <P>In taking decisions as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, contributing to the conduct of Government business and in dealings with my colleague Ministers, I neither improperly sought nor obtained favours, exceptional treatment or benefit for anyone.  I have always conducted my affairs as a TD and as a Minister with integrity and fairness and to the best of my ability.  I have done nothing improper.  As Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I discharged my responsibilities in a scrupulously fair, impartial and objective manner.  I treated everybody with whom I dealt, irrespective of their political viewpoint or position, with equal courtesy and consideration.  My tenure as Minister was impeccable, my integrity uncompromised and I defy anyone to prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>When Deputy John Bruton took over leadership of Fine Gael he had to come to terms with the party's crippling debt.  Later he noted what I had done for the GAA in turning around an apparently hopeless financial situation.  In the face of hostility I initiated the Féile concerts which brought Semple Stadium from near bankruptcy to a healthy financial position.  He asked me, as chairman of the parliamentary party, to <Col N="698" /> take on the additional role of chairman of the Fine Gael trustees.  Like all other political parties, or at least most of them, we asked for contributions from hundreds in the corporate sector. This included, as the Fine Gael Party has already made clear, Dunnes Stores.  All moneys went towards reducing the party's debt.</P>
    <P>The Opposition and others have mischievously questioned my integrity with regard to the competition for the second GSM licence.  When I announced the competition in March 1995 my sole priority was to ensure the development of effective competition in mobile telephony in Ireland.  To achieve this I was determined to put in place a selection process that would be fair, impartial and objective.  My first and most outstanding difficulty was in assuring potential competitors there would be a genuine competition with equal opportunity for all.  There was a widespread belief the matter was already a foregone conclusion as a result of an alleged agreement between one major player and a senior member of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Clear criteria for the successful applicant were disseminated to all interested parties.  Andersen Management International, one of the most advanced and experienced international consultants in this field, were engaged following an open competitive process to provide advice.</P>
    <P>A project team led by the Department and including officials from the Department of Finance and the consultants was given the task of selecting the successful applicant in accordance with the predefined selection criteria.  The project team, of which I was not a member, included representatives with specific expertise to carry out a professional evaluation in accordance with the selection criteria.  The terms of the competition were specifically approved by the European Commission.  The entire process was executed on an arm's length basis and was hermetically sealed from any external interference.  The project team reached a clear-cut professional decision based on the selection criteria.  I was informed of the result of the competition by the secretary of the Department only on completion of the evaluation process which had been fully documented in the consultants' report.  I want to state firmly, clearly and unequivocally in the light of media speculation and allegations made in this House that I did not seek to influence the outcome of this process. The most significant input for my part was to ensure a fair and objective competition which would yield the best results in terms of developing mobile telephony.  I am confident the success of the project will be borne out when the operative service is launched early in the new year.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that my house in Carysfort, Blackrock was somehow financed in an irregular way.  I bought that house at public auction the same way as anyone else could.  It is fully mortgaged to a building society.  I bought it because it made economic sense for a serving politician to have a residence in Dublin.  In addition, I felt it <Col N="699" /> was a sensible investment for the future.  Also, I wanted somewhere private.  After the current controversy my privacy has been so invaded through newspaper photographs and sightseers that privacy is no longer possible and I will almost certainly sell the house.</P>
    <P>Similarly, arising from a saturation of publicity, my house in Holycross has become a place of pilgrimage. My family must now endure cars queuing for a gawk outside the gate.  People feel free to walk around the front garden and peer in the windows.  Some have chosen to make almost my entire life the subject of malicious comment, as if everything I have was handed to me on a plate without effort on my part.</P>
    <P>In truth, there is nothing mysterious.  I am proud of what I have achieved and I hope that I have shown that I have nothing to hide.  As a teenager, like many others, I did not take school as seriously as I might have done.  I left school without a leaving certificate.  In 1971 my father died and I was determined to make something of my life.  Without any hesitation I can say that from that day on I gave 100 per cent commitment to my business life, my life with the GAA and my political life.  Anything I have, I have achieved through my own commitment and relentless hard work.  I have never claimed to be perfect.  I am human and like all human beings I have my faults, weaknesses and failings, but I do claim one core belief.  Anything I sold was mine to sell. Anything I bought was mine to buy, bought with my money earned by me in the course of legitimate business.</P>
    <P>I read from last Saturday's newspapers that my brother has now been dragged into the frenzy because CIÉ financed a tunnel at his farm.  Quite simply the speed of trains has increased.  CIÉ, following discussion with the IFA and the ICMSA before I became a Minister, decided to do such work throughout the country to reduce the potential danger of animals crossing the lines.  My brother's farm, along with others in the area, is affected in this way.  It is perfectly obvious that this had nothing whatsoever to do with my public office.  It was just another unfounded innuendo.</P>
    <P>I enjoyed working with my colleagues in Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left.  The Government truly is working as an effective partnership. The three parties come to issues from different perspectives, but take decisive actions behind which they all loyally stand.  Within the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications I was proud to move towards the creation of a semi-State sector which is strong, viable, customer focused and ready to face the competitive challenges of the future.</P>
    <P>I was told in this House that my tenure was unremarkable.  Any fair assessment of my short tenure in office will show European Union approval for a phased injection of £120 million in equity into Bord na Móna to eliminate the company's huge debt for which I secured the Commissioner's approval, the second GSM operator <Col N="700" /> entering the market within weeks from now, the KPN-Telia-Telecom Éireann strategic alliance was put in place, we have witnessed a vast reduction in telephone charges, I was involved in the successful implementation of the cost and competitiveness programme at the ESB and I encouraged CIÉ to face up to the reality of the marketplace.  I assisted in bringing stability to the industrial relations situation at TEAM Aer Lingus.  I gave strong support to the development of our State and regional airports and I launched the public consultation process for the light rail project and publication of the draft legislation to create a legal framework for the project.  My initiative of a major strategic review of the future of An Post was completed and approved by the board.</P>
    <P>As to why I chose to resign, to fully understand why I chose this course of action the House should remember the role I played in forming the Government late in 1994.  My party had been in Opposition for more than seven years and the country was faced with the prospect of a permanent Fianna Fáil Government where the only change would be that of its coalition partner.  I was determined that this cycle be broken.  From my discussions with the Labour Party at that time I developed a deep respect for its leadership.  I became convinced that it could form a good working partnership with Fine Gael.  When Democratic Left joined those discussions I could see the potential for a competent Government based on trust, which is what the country has had for the past two years.  In Government there are three genuine parties committed to policies who have the practical courage to accommodate their partners' deeply held views, in such marked contrast to the alternative facing the people.  This is a good Government, our country is prospering and there is no clear point of principle on which the Opposition can seek to tarnish the Government. In the absence of real debate on substantial issues, politics has descended to vulgar abuse.</P>
    <P>The decision to resign was mine and mine alone.  I wanted to do the right thing by the Government.  As all in this House know, politics moves at high speed so that any procrastination or delay on my part would have damaged the Government.  As a Minister it was not possible for me to answer the plethora of questions in the charged atmosphere that prevailed that weekend. It was just not possible to provide commercial answers within that time.  I considered it would not have been possible, while a Minister, for me to explain what I genuinely believe to be a proper and legitimate transaction but nevertheless a complex one.  I was satisfied that my business relationship with Dunnes Stores would be used in a political manner to destabilise the Government, that political motivation would have led to the Opposition asking endless questions while perhaps accepting none of the answers.</P>
    <P>In addition, from my extensive involvement in the European Union Presidency, in the preparations for the highlight of our Presidency, the <Col N="701" /> Dublin Summit, I knew it was critical that the Government must not be deflected by a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>Having put so much work personally into bringing this Government together, above all people, I felt that nothing should be allowed to destabilise it or to distract public attention from its work.  It was for those reasons that on Saturday, 30 November, I chose to resign.  I rang the Taoiseach inquiring what time that day his busy schedule would permit a meeting at which I would formally tender my resignation.</P>
    <P>With regard to my political life &mdash; despite acres of newsprint and hours of radio and television coverage &mdash; nothing has emerged which demonstrates or gives actual testimony to any impropriety in carrying out my political duties, nor will it; it does not exist; there is no impropriety in my political work.</P>
    <P>Yes, I am bruised but my spirit, commitment and determination remain as strong as ever.  I acknowledge the generosity of spirit shown by many Members, including some on the Opposition benches.  In particular I greatly value the depth of support and encouragement shown me by the people of Tipperary which have provided comfort to me and my family over these past difficult weeks.</P>
    <P>I will continue to serve the people whom I am honoured to represent in as diligent and effective a manner as I can.  I look forward to offering myself for re-election to this House.  The people of North Tipperary, at the next general election, will be the final arbiters on this matter.</P>
    <P>I convey my good wishes to my successor, Deputy Dukes, in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  I have no doubt he will bring his acute intelligence and widespread ability to the benefit of Government.</P>
    <P>As I said initially, ideally I should have liked to have made this statement earlier.  Indeed, I should have liked the message to have been much simpler and, therefore, easier to communicate in this era of the soundbite and banner headline.  If required, in due course I will co-operate fully and answer questions before any committee of this House established to examine the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me assure all Members that what they have heard is the truth, plain but not simple.  I thank them for their attention.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Great Famine Commemoration.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a mistaken impression in regard to the manner in which this matter is being dealt with.  I never suggested that the Minister of State made the remarks, as suggested, in the United States.  What I am saying is that remarks were made and I wonder how she dealt with them.  I raise this matter on the Adjournment so that the Minister of State can make a full statement regarding a controversy <Col N="702" /> which appeared to have occurred in the United States while she was there and how she handled it.  I do so to ascertain how the 1845 to 1848 famine, perceived in the United States as an act of genocide by the then British authorities, was dealt with.</P>
      <P>I also wanted to ascertain how the commemoration of The Great Famine has been continuing and to inquire whether it is the Minister's intention to build a monument to the victims of that famine in our capital city.</P>
      <P>The Great Famine was a defining moment in Irish history.  If it had not occurred, Ireland probably would be a much different place, when a much larger population probably would have forced the early development of an industrial base and an enterprise culture would have been fostered here.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to Breandáin Ó Cathaír of <i>The Irish Times</i> on his weekly Famine Diary.  It has done a lot for me personally, for what I believe to be the appropriate approach to this terrible time in our history.  I find quite unacceptable revisionists' attempts to blame the people of Ireland for starving themselves to death, while of course, discharging the British authorities from any obligation for what occurred between 1845 and 1849.  That is the reason I look forward to that weekly article with great appreciation, apart from the various literature on The Great Famine itself, the book entitled &ldquo;The Great Famine&rdquo;, and other tracts of that nature.</P>
      <P>We have been forced to innovate and develop at a much faster pace since that time.  In addition, Anglo-Irish relations might not have been as strained in the decades following that event if the famine had not occurred, or if the response to it had been different.  It is not good for continuing Anglo-Irish relations to term the famine as a deliberate act of genocide.  What happened was more a case of appalling neglect and disinterest on the part of some of the reigning officialdom. Serious mistakes were made but there was no official genocide policy.  It was really the manifestation of a <i>laissez faire</i> philosophy &mdash; let market forces reach their own level and, in the meantime, let the people die or try to survive, as inevitably they would.  Certainly it was a philosophy that failed disastrously and for which we still pay.</P>
      <P>Given the enormity of the catastrophe that was The Great Famine it must continue to have a focus in 1997.  I hope the commemorative events this year were just a warm-up and that in 1997 the profile of the famine commemorations will be raised even further.  I urge the Minister of State to concentrate on events that will capture the public mind and provoke reflection and deliberation among our ordinary people.  The commemorations must be accessible as we are all descendants of people who experienced this horrific famine.</P>
      <P>There has been much comment about the centralisation of activities in Dublin.  However, our capital city is home to one-third of our population and now the main destination of many tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> For that reason, a monument to all The Great Famine victims should be erected in Dublin.  It would be a starting point for many who live here or come here on trips.  It would have a major impact, stir the national conscience and serve as a reminder and help us to focus on the Famine and the threats which still exist around the globe. Such a monument in the capital would be a fitting project for the Famine commemoration.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this proposal.  I commend her for the efforts she has made to highlight the commemorations of this terrible time in our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The notice I received about this matter stated that the Deputy wanted to ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Doyle, to explain the controversy that was alleged to have arisen on her recent trip to the US when the Famine was described as an act of genocide by the then British authorities.  I interpreted that to mean that something I had said or done had given rise to that controversy.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to take this opportunity to refer to my recent and successful trip to the United States and Canada where I visited seven cities and was warmly received in them.  The lecture series was publicly advertised in the seven cities. I also appeared on a number of radio and television programmes on the Government's commemorative programme of the Famine and the impact it had not only on modern Ireland but also on the Irish-American community.  On behalf of the Government and the people, I explained the pivotal role which the Famine played in creating the modern Irish-American community.  My visit was also to strengthen the close ties between Ireland and our diaspora.  As I said on many occasions there, it was an exercise in strengthening the hyphen in Irish-American.</P>
      <P>I was gratified by the positive response I elicited from all sides, particularly the professional and academic sectors.  We had large attendances at every venue in Chicago, South Bend, San Francisco, San Diego, Washington, New York, Boston and Montreal.  We had excellent question and answer sessions for more than an hour at the end of each lecture series.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was accompanied by two eminent academics from Ireland, Dr. Kevin Whelan and Mr. Luke Gibbons from Roscommon.  The lectures were full of excellent intellectual vigour.  At each venue we had a guest moderator from the local universities where the Irish studies courses were being held.  In South Bend, for example, it was Professor Seamus Deane who is in Notre Dame at present and in San Diego it was Mr. David Lloyd. I introduced the lectures and I acted as chairperson for the question and answer sessions.  I responded to the political questions and the academics responded to the historical ones.  Politicians cannot always speak authoritatively on an <Col N="704" /> issue, particularly if they are not professionally trained in the subject.  We are general practitioners, not specialists on some topics.</P>
    <P>I was happy to be in a position to reassure the Irish-American community that the Government will continue its programme of commemorating in an appropriate, dignified and worthy manner our one million Famine dead and to recognise the descendants of the two million Famine immigrants who ended up in America.  There are now more than 44 million Americans who claim Irish ancestry.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is obviously aware of the recent Crowley amendment in New York state.  That controversy predated my visit by a couple of weeks, although it was still topical in the local newspapers when I arrived.  This amendment was signed into law in New York state by Governor Pataki.  It mandated schools in New York state to teach what was called in the amendment &ldquo;the mass starvation of Ireland&rdquo; as part of the same human rights school curriculum that deals with slavery and the Holocaust.  Unlike here, they have a system whereby politicians can influence the curriculum.  I warmly welcome the fact that the story of the Irish Famine will be taught to American school children.  It is important, however, that the curriculum content is designed to reflect the views of professional historians of the Famine.</P>
    <P>The woefully inadequate response of the then British authorities and the misguided relief policies which they pursued are now well established in the professional literature of Famine studies.  It was a rigidly doctrinaire and ideological administration, remote from the people whom it allegedly served and determined to pursue a programme of economic modernisation, even at the cost of thousands of people's lives.  However, it goes way beyond the boundaries of acceptable analysis to argue that there was a genocidal intent on the part of the British Government at the time and that the Irish Famine is therefore directly equivalent to the Holocaust.  By using that argument, we are letting the British authorities off the hook.  Their hands appear to have been clean but they certainly were not.  In my comments in America and elsewhere, I have made my position abundantly clear.  The British response during the Famine was entirely inadequate, but the genocidal argument has no validity and this inaccuracy does a disservice both to the victims of the Holocaust or the Famine.</P>
    <P>The National Famine Commemoration Committee, which I have the honour to chair, has chosen a magnificent site for the National Famine Memorial at Murrisk, County Mayo.  It will be in the shadow of Croagh Patrick overlooking Clew Bay.  The memorial is being designed by the sculptor, Mr. John Behan.  We hope to have the installation completed by August or September next year.</P>

      <P>It will be a bronze coffin ship.  I would be delighted to show the Deputy photographs <Col N="705" /> of it.  We examined many sites and chose this one because it is fitting that the national memorial should be located in the west.  One in four of the population of Connacht died in those terrible years.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to indicate the programme for 1997 to commemorate the Famine, which is extremely extensive.  There will be major art and photographic exhibitions, a major international historical conference in May in Dublin Castle, concert and candle lighting ceremonies, a set of stamps, an ecumenical service, an atlas of Famine sites of Ireland and the publication of a book of Irish Famine manuscripts.  We have a vigorous programme which will continue officially to the end of 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous Adjournment debates I asked the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, to legally transfer Dublin Corporation houses to Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council. Dublin Corporation, which has responsibility for these houses until the end of the calendar year, has refused to carry out house repairs arguing that they are now the responsibility of South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council. Many houses are in need of urgent repair. One house in my constituency, for example, is filled with smoke because there is something wrong with the fireplace.  However, I question the ability of the two local authorities to take over this task.  There has been a heated discussion among the local authorities about the financial requirements of such work.</P>
      <P>With other members of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs I visited the UK last week.  We visited a number of housing schemes in Liverpool and London where tenders had been accepted from the private sector for maintenance. It was a culture shock for the tenants and we had the opportunity to hear from the resident groups on how this experiment is progressing.  Many of the people we met had for many years worked on a local authority.  The local authority housing maintenance sections, in competition with other interested parties, tendered for the contract to look after the houses that are owned by that body.  I suggested to the Chairman, Deputy Jim Mitchell, that we should formalise our findings and present them to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had the difficult task of adjudicating on the corporation's ongoing financial commitments and the maintenance bill that goes with substantial housing.  There may be a more economical and efficient way of addressing this issue.  The Minister was in Corduff in my constituency <Col N="706" /> recently to discuss estate management. The Minister will have the support of all Members in attempting to achieve better estate management housekeeping.  Residents want to see more commitment to their area by the authority responsible for day to day maintenance. While that problem will be addressed in the new year, it is a matter of concern that the authorities in south Dublin and Fingal do not have the finance to build up a large direct labour workforce. The Minister should maintain an interest in this issue until we experiment with other options to ensure the people we represent receive a good service from the housing authorities to which they are paying rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the points he has made in a thoughtful, co-operative and generous fashion.  I look forward to the report he mentioned and undertake to keep the points raised in mind.  I want to clarify certain aspects relating to local authority housing management and maintenance generally and particularly in the context of the transfer of Dublin Corporation housing in the county areas.  In July last, the Minister approved, with certain revisions, the schemes prepared by the city manager under the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, for the transfer of Dublin Corporation's housing interests in the administrative areas of the councils to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils.  The schemes, as revised, provide that the transfers be carried out with effect from 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the management and maintenance of their housing stock is vested in the local authorities.  In overall terms local authorities have, in recent years, invested heavily in the management and maintenance of their houses using rental income, ongoing revenue receipts from the sale of houses under pre-1993 tenant purchase schemes and miscellaneous receipts.  Indeed, Dublin Corporation spent about £45 million on housing management and maintenance in 1995. The corporation has, therefore, recently and indeed for many years devoted considerable resources to the management and maintenance of its housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Dublin Corporation housing in the county areas, these houses are modern and were constructed to a good standard.  Dublin Corporation's remaining housing stock contains considerably more difficult and costly elements to maintain, including older housing and flat complexes. The fact that the corporation had a large rented housing stock in the county areas was a far from ideal arrangement from the point of view of ensuring proper democratic representation for households resident in the houses and, indeed, for ensuring delivery of housing maintenance services. The transfer of these houses from the corporation to the councils on 1 January 1997 sets out to address the issue of democratic representation <Col N="707" /> and affords the opportunity to improve management and maintenance of these houses.</P>
    <P>I recognise there is a need to assist the councils to deliver on the widespread expectation that overall conditions in the estates will be better after the transfer.  The councils will receive, from 1 January, considerable rental income and tenant purchase annuities from the transferred houses. In addition, the councils have been informed that the Minister will be prepared to consider proposals for the use by the councils of capital moneys as a contribution towards meeting the cost of necessary once off works to upgrade the houses and the environment of the transferred estates, and to provide the necessary supporting infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The long awaited transfer of these houses to the county councils will facilitate improvements in their management and maintenance arising from the fact that the county councils will be operating within their own administrative and electoral boundaries, unlike the situation which obtains at present.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a bheith agam ceist a thógáil maidir le cúrsaí uisce i gCois Fharraige, Conamara agus glacaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit atá ag tabhairt freagra orm tráthnóna.  Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil an tAire nó Aire Stáit ón Roinn Comhshaoil anseo le mé a fhreagairt mar bhí mé ag súil le bronntanas beag Nollag do mhuintir Chois Fharraige tráthnóna.</P>
      <P>Is é cúlra an scéil seo gur cuireadh grúp-scéim uisce ar bun i gConamara agus ba bhall de Pháirtí an Aire Stáit a bhí go mór taobh thiar den iarracht i dtús na seachtóidí, Pól Ó Foighil.  Ag an am sin bhí 350 teach i ndeisceart Chonamara. Anois, breis is fiche bliain níos déanaí, tá 681 teach, dhá eastát tionsclaíochta, ceann eile beartaithe agus stáisiún teilifíse ar an tseirbhís chéanna.  Chomh maith leis an 680 teach, méadaíonn daonra an cheantair faoi dhó sa samhradh mar gheall ar na scoláirí a bhíonn ag freastal ar choláistí Gaeilge sa cheantar.  Bhí ar an gcomharchumann áitiúil, le gairid, cosc iomlán a chur le ceangail nua, sé sin, ní féidir le héinne teach a thógaíl mar níl cead pleanála le fáil munar féidir a chruthú go bhfuil nó go mbeidh soláthar feiliúnach uisce ann.</P>
      <P>Tá fadhb sa cheantar sin, freisin, maidir le caighdeán an uisce: ní shásaíonn an caighdeán rialacha na Roinne agus rialtacha an Chomhpho-bail. Tá soláthar an-mhaith uisce i gceantar an Spidéil agus níl le déanamh leis an scéal seo a réiteach ach píopa uisce a shíneadh siar ó bhaile an Spidéil chomh fada le Ros a' Mhíl.  Tá tionscnamh iontach curtha le chéile ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe a réiteodh ní amháin fadhbanna uisce dheisceart Chonamara agus Chois Fharraige ach fadhbanna uisce Chonamara trí chéile, dá nglacfaí leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Tuigtear dom, áfach, nuair a fuair an Roinn Comhshaoil an plean seo nár chuir siad ar aghaidh chuig an Bhruiséal ach an chuid sin den phlean a bhain leis na hOileáin Árainn agus le ceantar Chois Fharraige.  Ar ndóigh tá píopa uisce nach gcosnódh ach £3 mhilliún ró-bheag le haghaidh an Chiste Comhtháthú agus mar sin tá an tionscnamh seo ag titim idir dhá stól.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh go gceadódh an Roinn Comhshaoil as cistí náisiúnta ar bhonn práinneach airgead le píopa uisce deich n-orlach a thógáil ó bhaile an Spidéil siar go Ros a' Mhíl: 18,000 méadar de phíopa atá i gceist anseo agus níl de chostas air ach £3 mhilliún.  Ní fada ó dúirt an tAire Comhshaoil go raibh sé sásta £50 milliún a chaitheamh as cistí náisíunta ar chóras séarachais do chathair na Gaillimhe.  Idir an dá linn, dá dtabharfaí an cead agus an t-airgead don chomharchumann áitiúil dul ar aghaidh ag leagan píopa deich n-orlach ón Spidéal chomh fada le ceantar Thigh Chuilinn in Indreabhán i gCois Fharraige, fad 2,700 méadar, ní bheadh ansin ach costas leath mhilliún punt nó faoina bhun agus bheadh an phráinn bainte as an bhfadhb.</P>
    <P>Iarraim mar sin ar an Aire Stáit breathnú go báúil ar an iarratas seo ón bpobal &mdash; tá súil agam go mbeidh dea-scéala aige dom tráthnóna &mdash; agus airgead a cheadú láithreach leis an bpíopa seo a chur ar fáil agus ligint do shaol Chonamara forbairt mar is cuí.</P>

Soláthraíonn an grúp-scéim seo timpeall is seacht gcéad tithe agus tá an grúpa cláraithe mar chomharchumann.  Ar na blianta deireanacha, leathnaíodh an scéim seo i bhfad níos fairsinge ná mar a bhí beartaithe.  B'é an toradh a bhí ar seo ná gur fágadh teaghlaigh le droch sholáthar uisce.

Tá iarratas ar mhaoiniú ón gCiste Comhuaineach do scéim An Spideál-Ros a' Mhíl curtha faoi bhráid an Choimisiúin ag an Roinn Comhshaoil.  Níl cinneadh ar bith faighte ar seo fós.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn an soláthar uisce i roinnt ceantar a fheabhsú, chuir grúpa Cnoc-Indreabhán togra faoi bhráid na Roinne chun cuid den phríomhphíopa uisce, 2,700 méadair, ón Spideál chomh fada siar le Tigh Chualann a leagadh, ar chostas £250,000.  Teastaíonn ón Roinn scéim iomlán An Spideál-Ros a' Mhíl a chur ar siúl chomh luath agus is féidir.  De bharr sin, níl i gceist ag an Roinn an chuid bheag seo den scéim a thógáil, tré grúp-scéim príobháideach a cheadú.</P>
    <P>Tá sé i gceist ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe 18,000 méadair de phíopaí deich n-orlach a leagadh ón Spidéal, trí Ros a' Mhíl, Indreabhán, Baile na hAbhann agus Casla agus tá réamhthuairisc faoi bhráid na Roinne i láthair na huaire.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Milk Quota.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to raise the important issue of milk quotas on the Adjournment.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan is present to respond.  A detailed proposal on milk quota has been put to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland by the Cross-Border Quota Action Group, which is representative of farming organisations and dairy co-operatives, North and South.  The group's very well researched proposal seeks additional milk quota for the Border region to help regenerate that economy which suffered so much over a period of 25 years of troubles.  All Members recognise that those troubles imposed a severe constraint on economic and social development in the Border region, North and South.  Economic and social activity was reduced, the attractiveness of the area for industrial development was lessened, the tourism sector was severely depressed and cross-Border co-oper-ation suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was established with the support of the European Union and both Governments to tackle those problems and enhance economic activity.  There is a united approach by all interest groups, North and South, in supporting this proposal. The largest economic sector in the Border region is agriculture and, obviously, a vibrant and <Col N="710" /> dynamic farming industry is essential if the economy of that region is to be developed.  Agriculture employs about 18 per cent of the workforce and accounts for 16 per cent of the regional domestic product.  Those contributions are further enhanced by the upstream and downstream activities of the sector to the economy of the region in respect of employment and valueadded. The dairy enterprise contributes more to the viability of farming than any other land-using enterprise.  Dairying is therefore of major importance to the Border region, accounting for about one-third of gross agricultural output of the region.</P>
    <P>The proposal put forward by the Cross-Border Quota Action Group refers specifically to the need to help small-scale farmers who have less than 30,000 gallons of quota.  The number of milk quotas in the Border counties is estimated at 5,900 and the average quota in the 1995-6 quota year was 19,470 gallons.  The scale of dairy farming is small when one considers it is 30 per cent or more below the national average.  Similarly, the average farm size is small and the dominant number of farm holdings is small.  The quality of the land provides little scope for farm diversification.</P>
    <P>Two of the stated aims of the Operational Programme for Peace and Reconciliation are to promote rural and urban regeneration and create employment.  That is particularly important given that the majority of farmers on both sides of the Border depend on dairying.  The provision of additional milk quota would help enormously to regenerate that economy and its positive effects would be evident without delay.  From an economic and social point of view it is essential that the maximum quantity of milk is produced in the Border region.  A decision to allocate additional quota to farmers with small quota would contribute enormously to stimulating the rural economy.</P>
    <P>Both sides of the Border experience similar problems, with the farm family population in decline, with the consequent loss of economic and social benefits to the rural community in general. The very survival of many farmers into the next century depends on additional quotas being made available to make their farm operations viable. To maintain rural communities, the maximum level of dairy production and processing must be retained.</P>
    <P>The processing of milk and the agri-industry in the region contributes significantly to employment creation and additional quota would have a multiplier effect.  It took political decisions to establish the Operational Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and the Minister, as President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, has the opportunity to advance this important and worthwhile proposal.  I am glad the Minister of State is in the House and I appeal to him, the Minister, Deputy Yates, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach to lend their full support to a practical proposal which would mean so much to my constituents in Cavan-Monaghan and my neighbours in Fermanagh. <Col N="711" /> Farming in the Border region needs this boost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Smith on his thorough presentation. A number of proposals were put forward in regard to a milk quota related initiative in the Border areas in the context of the peace process, under which additional quota would be sought from the European Union for allocation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of the Republic.  The Deputy is already aware that this Government would support any initiatives which would secure additional quota in these regions, especially for smaller scale producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was originally discussed between officials of my Department, the United Kingdom Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  This matter was also raised directly, at ministerial level, with the UK Minister for Agriculture <Col N="712" /> and, as the Deputy will be aware, a meeting has also been held with the Cross-Border Milk Quota Action Group.</P>
    <P>The success of an initiative of this nature will be dependent not only on the circumstances and timing of its presentation at EU level, but also, of course, on the position taken by the United Kingdom authorities.  The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of additional quota is a sensitive matter within the EU.  If there is to be any hope of success for this idea it is therefore essential that it be fully supported by the UK as well as the Irish authorities and that it be pursued in the EU in a suitable negotiating context.  The situation will be kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the extensive refurbishment which has been ongoing at the Collins Barracks complex.  The caretaker board, the director and the staff of the National Museum and the Office of Public Works have been intensively engaged in the challenging and multifaceted task of converting part of this magnificent building into a dynamic and innovative museum facility for the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Works on the first phase of Collins Barracks, which involves the opening of exhibitions in two wings of the Clarke Square area of the Barracks, encompassing some 6,500 square metres of exhibition space is well advanced.</P>
      <P>Tenders have been received in respect of the supply and installation of the substantial number of exhibition cases and other display materials required for this facility.  Completed tenders are expected shortly in respect of the other exhibition fit-out work, the siteworks and associated works required to open this phase.  When these tenders are received a specific date for opening to the public will be agreed.  This opening date is likely to be in the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the opening times for this new facility, it is envisaged that they would be similar to those at present in the museum's Kildare Street premises.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that the text of both questions refers to the cultural development incentives scheme (CDIS) which I am administering under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999.  On this basis I propose to circulate in the Official Report details, on a county basis, of the 25 projects which I have to date approved, in principle, for funding under the CDIS.  The total amount of grant assistance approved, in principle, by me in respect of these 25 projects is £13.694 million, of which £5.537 million is in respect of nine theatre projects and £4.770 million is in respect of ten arts centre projects. As these decisions were only made and announced by me this year, it follows that the bulk of expenditure under the CDIS will take place in 1997 and subsequent years.  To date a total of £136,216 has been expended on the scheme.  There were no allocations made under the CDIS in 1995.</P>
      <P>The present estimate is that expenditure on CDIS projects in 1997 will be of the order of £10.2 million.  This amount covers costs associated with the 25 projects I have to date approved, in principle, for funding and also costs which may arise in respect of successful projects under the final phase of the scheme, applications for which must be submitted to my Department by 10 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee for this scheme which was established in January, 1996, comprises representatives of the following organisations:&mdash; my own Department, which chairs the committee; the Department of Tourism and Trade; An Comhairle Ealaíon; the Heritage Council; the County and City Managers' Association; and the General Council of County Councils.</P>

      <P>The amount expended on national monuments and historic properties under the EU operational programme (sub-programme 1, measure 2) will be of the order of £7.5 million by end December, 1996.  As stated in my reply to Question No. 87 of 12 June last, the amounts allocated to certain projects may vary depending on project costs which cannot be determined precisely in advance, particularly in the case of restoration work.  However, at this stage it appears unlikely that there will be any residual funds available for allocation to new projects.</P>
      <P>As the funding under this measure relates to projects at State-owned properties only, the question of applications for funding being made by private applicants does not arise.</P>

    <P>It is anticipated that Ms Mairead Mullaney will be contracted in 1997 to continue the upgrading of the Department's library facilities at a cost of £23,757.  In addition, sanction has been sought from the Department of Finance to retain the services of Mr. Noel Dorr to act as the personal representative of the Tánaiste at the Intergovernmental Conference until the end of Ireland's involvement in the EU Troika next June.  The estimated cost of this is £24,070.  It is also expected that further expenditure will be incurred in connection with the project on performance appraisal being undertaken by Price <Col N="721" /> Waterhouse.  These costs will be met from the provision of £70,000 contained in Subhead A.7 of the Department of Foreign Affairs Vote which is outlined in the abridged version of the Book of Estimates.</P>

    <P>*This consultancy is being financed jointly with the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>There has been no change in the position outlined in my reply to Question No. 44 of 22 May 1996 in relation to the use of any public relations service by the Department of Foreign Affairs or the office of the Tánaiste.  No semi-State bodies come under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affiars or the office of the Tánaiste.  As the Deputy is aware, the White Paper on Foreign Policy was published this year by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Details of the costs are given in my reply to Question No. 57 of 16 April 1996.</P>
    <P>A study was also commissioned and received by the Anglo-Irish and information division at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The study, which was conducted by Professor Richard Sinnott of University College Dublin, was entitled &ldquo;Choosing an electoral system for elections to an elected body in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  The cost of this study is £1,500.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at present to estimate the final cost of the Presidency to my Department. My Department received special allocations of £3.5 million in 1995 and £8.7 million in 1996 to cover the additional costs associated with the preparations for and the management of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union this year.  Further costs will arise in 1997 as a result of Ireland's continuing membership of the EU Troika until 30 June 1997.</P>

      <P>During the conflict in the former Yugoslavia the Government contributed over IR£4.5 million in emergency humanitarian assistance for the civilian population affected by the war.  This assistance was channelled through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which was the lead agency during this period and to the International Committee of the Red Cross for <Col N="724" /> humanitarian relief operations throughout the region.  The Government also supported the work of Irish non-governmental organisations for their programmes which assisted vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, the blind and women's groups in Sarajevo, Mostar, Tuzla, Zenica and Goradze.</P>
      <P>Since the Dayton Agreement was signed last December, the Government has provided over £4.25 million &mdash; US$6.5 million &mdash; in recognition of the urgent rehabilitation and humanitarian needs remaining in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  At the First Donors' Conference on Bosnia and Herzegovina last December, I announced an immediate aid package of US$1.5 million for the first three months of 1996, which included grants to restore essential public services, water, gas and electricity in Sarajevo.</P>
      <P>At the Second Donors' Conference in Brussels in April an additional Government pledge of US$5 million for rehabilitation projects during this year was announced.  This pledge has been fully disbursed to international aid agencies and to Irish NGOs, who are aligning their efforts closely with rehabilitation priorities identified by the local authorities in Sarajevo, Mostar and Goradze. Irish Government rehabilitation assistance has focused on the following areas: support to the health sector through the physical rehabilitation of public health buildings &mdash; TB, paediatric and psychiatric clinics in Sarajevo; housing reconstruction and shelter repair for displaced persons and returning refugee families in Goradze and Bihac; support for civil society and vulnerable groups in Sarajevo and Mostar; direct support to the cantonal authorities in Goradze and to income generation programmes.</P>
      <P>Lists of all grants disbursed by my Department to aid agencies during 1994 and 1995 have been published in the Irish aid annual reports for those years.  A list of all grants paid in the current year will be published in the 1996 Irish Aid Annual Report in due course.  For ease of reference, following in the form of an Annex is a list of all grants paid in the period 1994-96 for humanitarian aid to the region.  Irish Government humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance is additional to financial and personal resources being provided for other aspects of the civilian implementation of the Dayton Agreement, namely support for the OSCE, European Community Monitoring Mission and the International Police Task Force, headed by Irish Commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald.</P>

      <P>The basic rate of pension has not been changed, but the frequency of payment has been changed from monthly to fortnightly.  Civil Service pensions were paid monthly until September 1996.  From 1 October 1996 payment was changed to a forthnightly basis, with the first such payment being made on 17 October 1996.  This was agreed following representations made by the Retired Civil and Public Servants' Association.  Notification of the changeover was included with all pensions issued on 17 October 1996.  Payment is now made on alternate Thursdays, as is the case for similar salary payments throughout the Civil Service.  For precise calculation of the forthnightly pension, the annual amount is divided by 26.09.  On this basis this person's current pension rate is correct.</P>

      <P>Given increasing public demands for cheaper telephone access to Government Departments and my ongoing commitment to promoting efficiency in dealing with the public, an inter-departmental expert group dealing with telecommunications services, and chaired by my Department, is currently examining a number of options for the provision of countrywide access to Government Departments at local charges.  While preliminary indications suggest that such a facility would place a significant burden on the Exchequer, I am hopeful that the group will find a basis for progress in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For cost reasons, access at local call charges or at &lsquo;freefone&rsquo; rates has been made available by a number of Government Departments and Agencies on a limited basis, mainly to provide shortterm &lsquo;help-desk&rsquo; facilities on new Government schemes being introduced.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners have provided such facilities to the general public and current examples include an information &lsquo;freefone&rsquo; line provided by the Eastern Health Board and the Confidential Freefone and Crimeline Callsave facilities operated by the Garda Síochána.  It is hoped that the co-ordinated approach afforded <Col N="728" /> by the inter-departmental expert group will result in a cost-effective method of providing cheaper access for the public.</P>

      <Quest>if he will provide the full text of a letter written by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners during the 1964/1965 negotiations with the Collectors of Taxes in which he stated that the grade of Tax Assistant equates to that of Higher Tax Officer which is next in line to that of Inspector of Taxes and that to place tax assistants on a grade higher than that would have serious repercussions in the service.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there was a considerable amount of correspondence in the years 1964-5 relating to the question of the abolition of the office of Collector of Taxes and the negotiation of a compensation scheme and alternative employment for the individuals concerned.  From an examination of the available files and records in this office, the following copy of a letter dated 17 Nollaig 1965 from the Chairman's private secretary to the Minister's private secretary appears to be the letter referred to in Deputy Wallace's question.  The terms of the letter differ somewhat from the position reflected in the Deputy's question in that the letter states that &ldquo;the annual remuneration at the rate of £1,600 equates to the maximum salary of the higher tax officer...&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;that the grade of tax assistant equates to that of Higher Tax Officer...&rdquo; as is stated in the question.</P>
      <P>Obviously over the last 31 years since the enclosed letter was written, there has been considerable changes in the duties and remuneration of the higher tax officer grade.  If the Deputy would consider it helpful, the Revenue Commissioners would be prepared to discuss the position of the tax assistant grade with her and she could contact the Commissioners' Office directly in this regard.</P>
      <P>P.S. 933/65.</P>
      <P>Rúnaí Aire,</P>
      <P>Aire Airgeadais.</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Chairman to refer to your minute of 7 December, 1965, enclosing a copy of a letter of 1st December from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance concerning representations received by him on behalf of certain former Collectors of Taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply I am to state that the remuneration of former Collectors of Taxes now employed in unestablished posts in the Civil Service as Tax Assistants is governed by the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Compensation Scheme, as approved by the Government.  Similarly the compensation payable is governed by the provisions <Col N="729" /> of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Compensation Scheme and the deferment of the balance of compensation in certain cases by paragraph 6.  The provisions of the authorised Compensation Scheme have been strictly observed by the Revenue Commissioners and the remuneration and compensation of former Collectors of Taxes has been determined accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have of course no power to vary the provisions of the approved Compensation Scheme.  This Scheme was sanctioned by the Minister for Finance and approved by the Government after protracted negotiations and its terms were generous.  The Commissioners would strongly oppose any proposals for revision of the Scheme along the lines indicated in the letter from Mr. J.V. Hayes, a copy of which was forwarded with your minute.  The annual remuneration at the rate of £1,600 equates to the maximum salary of the Higher Tax Officer which is the highest Taxes rank below the rank of Inspector.  To place Tax Assistants on a salary above the maximum of a Higher Tax Officer would have very serious repercussions on the salary structure of the established Taxes grades.</P>

    <P>The 1996 EBR will not be finalised until year end but it is set to emerge well below the budget target of £729 million and will include a substantial net repayment of foreign currency borrowing, continuing the trend of recent years.</P>
    <P>The general Government deficit, the relevant measure for Maastricht purposes, will also come in below budget and will be comfortably below the 3 per cent of GDP reference criterion contained <Col N="731" /> in the Maastricht Treaty.  This will be the eighth year in a row in which our GGD-GDP ratio has satisfied this criterion.  The 1997 EBR and GGD will be set out in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <Quest>the reason an additional 5 per cent income tax liability is being imposed on farmers and selfemployed people who choose to pay their income tax by monthly instalments under the recently announced direct debit scheme; and if he will consider accepting 100 per cent of the final liability for the preceding tax year and not 105 per cent.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the direct debit scheme for payment of preliminary income tax is designed to spread the preliminary tax payment evenly throughout the calendar year and thus avoid a single lump sum payment in November.  Normally, the minimum amount of preliminary tax which must be paid is the lower of: 90 per cent of the tax liability for the actual year of assessment, or 100 per cent of the tax liability for the preceding year of assessment. However, for taxpayers who avail of the direct debit scheme an additional option has been added viz.: 105 per cent of the tax liability for the pre-preceding year of assessment provided that liability is not nil.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated from the foregoing that basing the preliminary tax payment on 100 per cent of the final liability of the preceding tax year remains an option for taxpayers who avail of the direct debit scheme.  The suggestion that an additional 5 per cent liability is being imposed is not correct; in practice, the additional option will allow taxpayers who avail of the direct debit scheme more flexibility in determining the amount of preliminary tax to be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The areas in Meath qualifying for the tax reliefs for the renewal and improvement of certain resort areas are described in the Third Schedule to the Finance Act, 1995, as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  That part of the District Electoral Division of Julianstown comprised in that part of the Townland of Mornington bounded on the north by a line commencing at the high water mark and continuing in a westerly direction along the northern boundary of LaytownBettystown Golf Links to a point where it intersects with the boundary of the Townland of Donacarney Great; and those parts of the Townslands of Betaghstown, Sevitsland, Ministown and Ninch which are situated to the east of the Dublin/Belfast railway line.</P>
      <P>2.  That part of the District Electoral Division of Julianstown comprised in the Townland of Mosney and that part of the Townland of Briarleas situated to the east of Local Road (County Road 438).</P>
      <P>Gormanstown is not a designated area for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme commenced on 1 July 1995 and continues to 30 June 1998.  The detailed provisions of the scheme are set out in sections 46 to 53 of the Act as amended by section 30 of the Finance Act, 1996.  It consists of the following tax incentives:</P>
      <P>&mdash;accelerated capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction of certain industrial buildings, vis hotels, holiday camps and holiday cottages, and, subject to conditions, on the refurbishment of such buildings.  The allowances consist of an initial allowance (available to both lessors and owner-occupiers) of 50 per cent, annual allowances of 5 per cent and accelerated annual allowances, commonly referred to as free depreciation (available to owner-occupiers only), of up to 75 per cent.  Where an initial allowance is claimed there is no entitlement to free depreciation.</P>
      <P>&mdash;capital allowances, similar to those applying to hotels, holiday camps and holiday cottages, in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of buildings or structures which are used in the operation of certain tourism facilities.  The facilities in question are tourist accommodation registered or listed under the Tourist Traffic Acts, e.g. B+B accommodation, and such other facilities as are approved of for the purposes of the relief by the Minister for Tourism and Trade in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;a double rent allowance as a deduction in <Col N="733" /> computing trading income for the first ten years' rent arising under new leases of certain buildings or structures.</P>
    <P>&mdash; reliefs for 100 per cent of construction expenditure incurred (i) on the provision, of certain rented residential accommodation, (ii) on the conversion of certain buildings into rented residential accommodation, and (iii) on the refurbishment of certain rented residential accommodation.  These reliefs can be set against all rental income of the claimant in computing liability to tax under Case V of Schedule D but apply only where the accommodation is available primarily for letting to tourists.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information at the level of detail sought by the Deputy with regard to the amount of interest and take up of the incentives to date would not be available from the records.  However, in relation to the three designated areas mentioned, the Revenue Commissioners have obtained the following details from the Department of Tourism and Trade &mdash; there is a development of seven self-catering holiday cottages in Laytown, a development of 26 self-catering holiday cottages, a development of three self-catering houses and rebuilding of a licensed public house-restaurant in Bettystown.  The Department of Tourism and Trade has no knowledge of any development in Mornington.</P>
    <P>With regard to the progress of the incentives in the designated resort areas in general, I understand that the Department of Tourism and Trade is at present compiling a comprehensive report, in conjunction with the Regional Tourism Organisations, on tourism developments resulting from the scheme.  This exercise is ongoing and is not expected to be completed for some time.</P>

      <P>The following are the EU directives, regulations and conventions in respect of which my Department has responsibility and which have not yet been transposed into or made part of Irish law.</P>
      <P>Department of Finance</P>
      <P>Council Regulation 2988/95 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests sets out the broad framework for a system of administrative penalties in cases of irregularities committed against the EU Budget.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation 2382/96 repealing Regulations (EEC) No. 990/93 and (EC) No. 2471/94 and concerning the termination of restrictions on economic and financial relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia &mdash; Serbia and Montenegro &mdash; the United Nations Protected areas in the Republic of Croatia and those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces.</P>
      <P>The manner in which these regulations will be implemented is being examined with a view to the early publication of the appropriate legislation.</P>
      <P>Office of the Revenue Commissioners</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Council Directive 94/74/EC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty was due for implementation on 30 June <Col N="736" /> 1995.  The main provisions of the directive were implemented in the Finance Act, 1995 &mdash; section 99 to 102.  The remaining applicable provisions are to be implemented by regulation very shortly.</P>
    <P>The only outstanding issue in relation to direct taxes is the ratification of the convention on the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises.  The convention was signed on 21 December 1995 and it is hoped to have it ratified by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>Convention of the use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes (&ldquo;CIS Convention&rdquo;):</P>
    <P>This convention was signed by Ireland on 26 July 1995.  In order to ratify the convention, it may be necessary to introduce domestic legislation to give effect to one of its provisions; this issue is currently being considered in conjunction with the Attorney-General's office.  It is not yet possible to give a timescale for ratification.  The intention, however, is that it should be ratified as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Agreement on the provisional application between certain Member States of the EU of the Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs purposes.</P>
    <P>This agreement was signed at the same time as the CIS Convention, mentioned above, and domestic legislation may, in this case also, be required before ratification can take place.  Until the matter has been clarified with the Attorney-General's Office, no deadline for ratification may be set.</P>
    <P>Protocol to the CIS Convention</P>
    <P>A Protocol to the CIS Convention was signed on 29 November 1996 and will have to be ratified in due course.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> IMPACT, on behalf of physiotherapists, is currently pursuing a pay claim under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> These negotiations are complex <Col N="738" /> and are ongoing under the auspices of Health Service Employers' Agency, with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I presume that the review referred to by Deputy Brennan is that of the 1978 working party established to examine the grading structure for physiotherapists in hospitals.  The report of the working party was circulated in 1979.  However, this was not a pay review.</P>
      <P>Physiotherapists, similar to all other paramedical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes down through the years.  The relative position of physiotherapists, in terms of remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other paramedical disciplines.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that any further comment on my part would not be appropriate or helpful.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The medical product in question is indicated for use in the treatment of a number of cardiovascular conditions.  I am aware that there is a significant variation in price in respect of the generic form of this product in Northern Ireland and within the State.  This is due in large measure to a vibrant generic market in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland where the overall market is much larger and where there is significant competition which affects prices charged for generic medicines.  It is understood that there are a number of suppliers of the generic form of this product in the Great Britain and Northern Ireland market and these companies are reimbursed by the state authorities at a tariff (flat rate) price for the product.</P>
      <P>Due to the nature of the pricing agreements with the pharmaceutical industry some discrepancies exist between the prices of individual products in Ireland and the UK.  However, overall the current agreement has resulted in a stabilisation of prices in Ireland as compared with the rest of Europe given that a price freeze exists for the duration of the current agreement.</P>
      <P>The current pricing agreement with the pharmaceutical industry is due for renegotiation shortly and the pricing of generic products will be one of the issues examined in the course of these negotiations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Eastern Health Board, which has responsibility for the provision of drug treatment services in its area, has included in its 1996 drug service development plan a number of proposals including the development of a series of local initiatives in various community care areas including the area of Coolock-Darndale.  In developing these initiatives the health board has had discussions with representatives of community and resident interests in a number of locations, with a view to making a range of local based facilities available.</P>
      <P>Following extensive consultation with community and resident interests the board proposes to further develop its drug treatment service in the general Coolock area.  The service will be for the residents of the Darndale, Belcamp, Moatview areas.  It is proposed that the drug services which will be available in the centre will include treatment and counselling and will complement the outreach services already in place.  The outreach services currently provide prevention and education programmes to these areas.  Community addiction counselling services are also available in the community care area.  Services provided include: individual support and counselling, supply of information to local groups and community work.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the new services provided in the area will link up with other voluntary and statutory services in order to provide appropriate rehabilitation.  Staff from the Eastern Health Board met with local interested groups in November and following this the board identified a premises where drug services could be located. The board has the agreement of the owner of the property provided it has the general acceptance of the community.  The board is in discussion with the various groups with a view to providing services in this location or any other suitable premises in the area.  Once a premises has been agreed the board will immediately put in place the appropriate services.  Further expansion of services is planned in the area in 1997 in co-operation with local community groups.</P>

Records must also be kept of any occasion on which physical or chemical restraint is used, the nature of the restraint and its duration.</P>
      <P>The code of practice for nursing homes which was published last year states that every nursing home should have a policy on the use of restraint. The code emphasises that a record of all occasions on which physical or chemical restraint is used should be kept, detailing the nature of the restraint and the duration.  The use of restraint should also be noted in the resident's nursing notes.  With regard to medication, the code of practice refers to the guidelines for the administration of medical preparations for nursing-midwives of An Bord Altranais which oblige each nursing home to have a written policy and procedures for nurses on the administration of medical preparations.</P>

In addition, east Meath patients are serviced by units for the elderly in Drogheda, namely the Cottage Hospital, Boyne View House and St. Mary's Hospital.  There are also 360 private nursing home beds in the county. At present, there are no elderly patients in need of institutional care awaiting a bed in County <Col N="742" /> Meath.  There are also 14 vacant beds in nursing homes in the county.</P>
      <P>With regard to the development at St. Mary's Hospital, Drogheda, I have recently approved tenders for the construction of a new 50 bed unit for the elderly at the hospital.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The advisory group on the transmission of infectious diseases was established with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to advise the Minister for Health regarding the prevention of the transmission of infectious diseases in health care settings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In common with my ministerial colleagues I commission a number of reports each year.  There is no general expectation that all of these reports will be published.  Many of them are simply regarded as an input to the policy formulation process, and their advice and recommendations may be incorporated in other documents which are published or circulated to interested parties. I understand that this very question of publication was raised at the first meeting of the advisory group and that it was agreed that the group's role was to submit a report to me.  It would then be a matter for me to decide what subsequent action was appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> Following consideration of the report of the advisory group within the Department of Health, a circular was issued to all health agencies advising them of screening procedures for hepatitis B to be introduced from 1 January 1997 for new employees in posts which involve exposure-prone procedures.  This circular takes account of the relevant recommendations of the advisory group. However, in view of the concerns which have been raised in this whole area, I have decided to make the advisory group's report available by placing a copy in the Library of the House, and it will also be circulated to interested parties.</P>
    <P>There are several other complex issues, including the issue of mandatory testing, which need to be examined in relation to existing and new health service employees who may have or develop infectious diseases, such as hepatitis C and HIV.  In addition, I believe that there is a need for a central resource which will develop and oversee the implementation of Protocols for dealing with incidents involving infected health care workers, and which will also be available as a source of ready advice and guidance to health agencies dealing with such problems.  I am, accordingly, establishing a group, to be chaired by Dr. Jim Kiely, deputy chief medical officer, which will, not later than 31 March 1997, report to me on the further measures which need to be taken in relation to a range of issues not addressed by the advisory group, and which will also function as a central resource for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>This group will, <i>inter alia</i>, work closely with the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais to ensure that there is an integrated and complementary approach to dealing with the service, personnel, ethical and legal matters arising for health care workers and patients in relation to infectious diseases.  The other members of the group are Dr. Gerard Sheehan, Dr. Fiona Mulcahy, Dr. Karina Butler, Dr. Brian O'Herlihy, Professor William Hall, Dr. Denis Cusack and Mr. Brendan Phelan.  A senior infection control nurse will also be appointed to the group.  I thank all the members of the group for promptly agreeing to discharge this difficult task of great importance to their colleagues and the public.</P>
    <P>The group report will be published promptly after its completion and there will be widespread consultation with all interested organisations.  The public will also be invited to submit comments on the report.  This process will be concluded by the end of June 1997 and policy decisions will then be taken quickly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, has a policy of integrating its services into the community at Tallaght.  In this regard the hospital authorities are engaged in discussions with the Eastern Health Board and GPs in the area.  I understand that initial proposals have been drawn up for the development of a primary care centre for people living in the catchment area of the new hospital at Tallaght.  I have not yet received any proposals for funding for this centre but whatever final proposals emerge from the current discussions will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I have informed the House on previous occasions, the speech therapy service has been improved in recent years.  The health boards have viewed its development as a priority with the recruitment of 28 additional therapists in the last three years.  Notwithstanding these improvements, it is clear that the service is in need of further development.  It is one of the services which has been examined by the review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. The report of the review group, which will be published shortly, will provide a blueprint for the development of these services over the next five years.  I will examine speech therapy services in the context of the implementation of the recommendations of the review group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received correspondence regarding the development of services for persons with autism in the Western Health Board area. The proposals relate to the development of residential and day services at a property purchased by a voluntary agency and the recommissioning of an existing facility in the Galway area.</P>
      <P>The question of the development of services for persons with autism in the western region is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  Issues relating to the planning and co-ordination of services to persons with a mental handicap or autism in the Western Health Board area are dealt with by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee.  The co-ordinating committee is representative of the health board, voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap.  It would be a matter for this committee to consider proposals for new services to be funded from any additional funding which may come on stream in 1997, including the proposals in question.  I am not in a position to give the Deputy any indication of the timeframe which might be associated with decisions regarding possible service developments in 1997 as the level of additional funding for 1997 has not yet been clarified.</P>

    <P>Brief Background Note:</P>
    <P>This Directive updates Directive 76/768/EEC as amended.  It requires the establishment by the European Commission of an inventory of those substances which may be used in the manufacture of cosmetic products.  Evaluation reports on the products to be held by the manufacturing companies.  The Directive also requires the full disclosure of ingredients contained in cosmetic products.</P>
    <P>Many difficulties have been experienced in relation to this Directive particularly in relation to the establishment of the inventory which includes the common nomenclature and which is required by the industry for full labelling.  The inventory has now been established.</P>
    <P>The industry requires a minimum of two years to comply with the Directive.  Because of the delays in drawing up the inventory and other circumstances outside the control of the Commission and the member states, the Commission has agreed that Article 169 procedures would not be considered during an agreed extra six months required to achieve full compliance.  The new dates, therefore, for compliance by the industry are 1 July 1997 (replacing 1 January 1997) and 30 June 1998 (replacing 31 December 1997).</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I refer the Deputy to my reply to a previous parliamentary question (Ref. No. 23737/96) put down for answer on Tuesday, 10 December 1996 in relation to the usage of air transport for foreign and internal flights in 1996, and the related costs in this regard.</P>
      <P>In my response, I provided details of the number of foreign trips which I made in 1996 with information regarding the destination, purpose, duration, cost and mode of transport used during the trips in question.  I also provided details of the destination of persons who accompanied me.  It is not normal procedure to name individual officers who accompany me on official trips either internally or abroad.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be feasible for me to provide a breakdown of the duration of each meeting attended by me in this regard.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is not possible to provide the precise information requested by the Deputy.  It is estimated, however, that it would cost about £30 million to extend medical card cover to all persons aged 65 and over.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  In addition the standard guidelines used to assist determine eligibility are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  Consequently, while about 35 per cent of all persons have medical card entitlement, it is estimated that about 73 per cent of those aged 65 and over have medical card entitlement.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to all citizens aged 80 and over without reference to their means.  I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications made by such persons when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they need care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>There were 2,249 recipients of the domiciliary care allowance (DCA) in the Dublin region and 8,125 recipients nationally as at 31 December 1995.</P>
      <P>The area medical officers of health boards assess the eligibility of each applicant to the scheme.  Eligibility for the DCA is determined primarily by reference to the level of care and attention which the child requires rather than the type of disability involved.  However the child's disability-handicap must have been present for at least six months prior to the date of application and must be likely to continue for at least one year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Dental Health Action Plan provides for the extension of eligibility for dental services to children up to 16 years of age.  I am implementing the action plan on a phased basis and eligibility for dental services has already been extended to children after they leave national school up to their 14th birthday.</P>
      <P>Routine dental treatment will be provided by health boards to these children by extending the targeted approach which is currently used in the national schools.  Children who have left national school will be recalled, as appropriate, screened and provided with appropriate preventive and primary care dental care treatment for any defects noted in the course of screening.  These children will be provided with emergency treatment to relieve pain on demand.  I have requested each health board to implement the extension as soon as possible having regard to the resources available to the boards.</P>
      <P>In addition, emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is currently available through the health board dental service to children aged 14 years of age and over who are dependants of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>Under the dental treatment services scheme emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is available to all medical card holders irrespective of age and eligible persons over the age of 16 years may attend any private dentist under contract with the health boards, if in pain and in need of emergency treatment.  The second phase of the scheme was introduced from 1 June 1996 and involves the extension of the scheme to medical card holders in the 16 to 34 year old age group and the provision of full dentures to all edentulous medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The question of a further extension will be considered in the context of the funds available to me for the development of dental services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 12 November 1996, column 734 of the Official Report for that day refers, the matter of RTE reception in Northern Ireland is being dealt with under the Anglo-Irish Conference where efforts are concentrated on increasing the power northwards from the RTE and Teilifís na Gaeilge transmitters at Clarmont Carn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1996 a report jointly agreed by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Radio Communications Agency in the UK concluded that practical and reasonable solutions to any potential problems could be identified.  The report envisaged a phased <Col N="759" /> increase in the power northwards of the Clarmont Carn transmitter.</P>
    <P>If the power northwards at Clarmont Carn can be increased to the extent proposed in the agreed report RTE estimate that coverage will increase from the present level of 30 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland to approximately 60 per cent to 70 per cent.  This increase would include a considerable number whose reception is so bad at present that the improvement brought about by the alterations to the Clarmont Carn transmitter will represent the first chance of reasonable reception.  Viewers in the extended coverage area wishing to receive the services will, of course, have to have the appropriate aerial installations.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my earlier reply I wrote to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, who has functional responsibility for broadcasting matters in the UK, seeking political agreement to the proposed changes to the transmitter at Clarmont Carn on a phased basis.  I recently received a substantive and favourable reply to that letter subject to the resolution of certain practical and financial issues with regard to the implementation of the technical plan.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the Secretary of State that RTE is prepared to bear the agreed engineering costs arising from the proposals.  The other practical issues are being addressed as a matter of urgency by the officials concerned in my Department, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and RTE.</P>

      <P>The National Library of Ireland has been allocated the basement, ground and first floors of the Photography Centre, Temple Bar, Dublin, as the location for the National Photographic Archive.  The remainder of the building provides accommodation for the Photography Department of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Building and appropriate fitting-out works to the relevant areas of the premises to render them suitable for occupation by the library have been completed.</P>
      <P>Negotiations involving the Commissioners of Public Works, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and Temple Bar Properties to finalise a lease agreement in respect of the premises are ongoing.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of these negotiations, the National Library will proceed to occupy the premises on a phased basis.  Such phasing will have regard at all times to the fragile nature of the material being moved to the new premises and the resources in finance and staffing which can be made available to the library.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the development of the new Photographic Archive will allow the National Library to preserve its valuable photographic collections in optimum conditions.  It will also facilitate, through the use of a modern computerised imaging system, easy access to the various images in the collections.  The archive will also facilitate the development of new services to the public based on this improved access as well as conservation work on the collection itself.  I am confident that through exhibitions it will lead to greater public awareness of these valuable collections of the National Library of Ireland, many of which have been unseen to date.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department were in constant contact with officials of Clare County Council during the period of preparation of the planning application for the proposed visitor facility at Gortlecka.</P>
      <P>My Department arranged through the Office of Public Works for the preparation of the planning application.  Provisional agreement to transfer the treated effluent from the site to a county council sewerage treatment facility was obtained by letter from Clare Councy Council subject to further investigation by the council on the capacity of the sewage treatment plant at Clare Abbey, Clare-castle. As the application was lodged shortly thereafter, it was considered that the securing of definitive agreement would be one aspect of the overall planning application to Clare County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the removal of part of the sewage treatment plant is to reflect the currently proposed scaled down visitor facility and the fact that the effluent will not now be disposed of on-site. In this context, the Deputy will note that there is <Col N="767" /> no question of the treatment system being less complete.</P>
    <P>The reason for transporting the treated effluent is that, while such effluent would not in itself be harmful to the environment, it would have a higher level of phosphates and nitrates than the ground water in the general area around Gortlecka and, accordingly, it was deemed more environment friendly to transport it away from the site rather than to dispose of it on-site.  The transfer of the treated effluent should have no detrimental effect on the local environment but in any event will, of course, be taken into account by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>The projected cost for the removal of part of the existing sewage treatment system is in the order of £40,000.</P>

      <P>A preliminary proposal was received in March 1989 from Meath County Council for the provision of a new branch library in Dunshaughlin.  Approval <Col N="769" /> in principle was given in February 1992.  Sketch design and cost plans were received in April 1992 and sanctioned in April 1993.  The acceptance of a tender was sanctioned in April 1995.  Construction of the branch library commenced soon afterwards and the library was opened to the public in September 1996.  The approved budget for this project is £350,121.  The approved maximum grant is £299,596 of which just over £145.000 has been paid to date.</P>

      <P>The distribution of fire appliances among its brigades is a matter for the fire authority, in this case Meath County Council.  The council applied in February 1993 for approval for four new appliances which it proposed to assign to various brigades, including Dunshaughlin.  The application was considered having regard to the usual criteria, including value for money, fire services capital available, and the overall level of demand. Approval to invite tenders for one appliance was given in February 1994 and for a second appliance in December 1994.  The tender proposal for this latter appliance which, I understand, has been assigned by the council to Dunslaughlin, was approved by my Department in December 1995 and the grant for the appliance was paid to the council in two instalments in June and December 1996.</P>

      <P>Under section 20 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, which came into force on 1 January 1993, liability for licensing and payment of motor tax in respect of a vehicle which is intended for use in a public place arises from the date of its registration in the State.  Section 117 of the Finance Act, 1995, provided for certain exemptions from this requirement, but these apply only from 2 June 1995.  The court case in question arose in relation to a vehicle registered on 5 March 1993 and to which the concession introduced by the Finance Act, 1995, does not apply.  Information in relation to the estimated number of cases in which disputes have arisen in relation to the application of section 20 (or information on the amounts involved) is not available in my Department, as many of these cases are dealt with locally by the licensing authority without reference to the Department.  Since 1 January 1993, however, some 50 cases of this kind have been brought to my attention through local authorities or by public representatives.  The need for further amendment <Col N="779" /> of section 20 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, to make better provision for these cases is being considered in conjunction with the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The present urban renewal scheme commenced in August 1994 and areas were designated for urban renewal in 34 locations, throughout the country (Athlone, Ballinasloe, Bray, Ballina, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Dungarvan, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Galway, Kilkenny, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Longford, Mallow, Monaghan, Mullingar, Navan, Nenagh, Newbridge, Portlaoise, Roscommon, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow).  In September 1995, some adjustments were made to the designated areas in Bray, Clonmel, Cork, Dublin, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford, and certain areas in Cobh, County Cork, were also designated.</P>
      <P>In addition to the designated areas, a limited number of areas have been designated as enterprise areas in which incentives are available for certain types of industrial and traded services development.  There are two enterprise areas in Dublin (East Wall and Grand Canal Docks), one in Cork (Blackpool) and one in Galway (Westgate).  Certain streets in each of the five county boroughs were also designated for the Living over the Business Scheme.</P>
      <P>Details of the estimated capital expenditure for each category of development, based on the most recent information available in my Department, are set out in the following table; the figures do not include expenditure in the Temple Bar and Custom House Docks Areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An overall review of the urban renewal schemes as they have operated to date is currently under way.  As part of the review, a consultants' <Col N="780" /> study on the impact of the schemes in economic, social and architectural terms has been completed.  The study was published on 5 December and is now the subject of a process of public consultation as part of which submissions have been invited from interested persons and organisations.  Copies of the study are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>A request for the designation of the planned Finglas Industrial Campus has been received in my Department but, pending the outcome of the review, there are no proposals to extend the present urban renewal scheme to any additional areas.  It would be inappropriate to consider what new areas, if any, might be suitable for designation in the future until general policy in relation to the next phase of urban renewal is determined in the light of the review.</P>

    <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any year is determined by <Col N="783" /> resource availability in that year and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.

      <P>My Department will provide over £39 million this year towards the running costs of such courses, and I have abolished fees for PLC courses with effect from 1995-96.</P>
      <P>To provide a maintenance grants scheme for PLC students along the lines of the third level scheme would cost in excess of £11 million per annum.  I am sure the House will appreciate that a balance has to be struck between competing demands for resources in the education sector &mdash; between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and under achievement.</P>
      <P>In the case of PLC courses I consider it more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme developments, in inservice training, and in ensuring provisions in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.</P>
      <P>Due to overall resource constraints I am unable to provide maintenance grants for PLC students. I will, of course, keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The appointment to which the Deputy refers will be made early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The delay in this matter arises from the fact that the filling of this vacancy is being pursued in the context of a wider reorganisation of the visiting teacher service.  This reorganisation follows a decision to allocate an additional two teachers to the service in the current school year.</P>
      <P>It has not proved possible to secure the services of a suitable temporary visiting teacher to fill the post in question pending completion of the wider reorganisation.</P>

      <P>I regret I am not in a position to provide crisis funding to the school in question.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate such funding in any given year is determined by the level of available resources and the competing demands across special needs areas.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have sought to target available resources on the most disadvantaged urban schools among those already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative, which I recently introduced, was designed specifically for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the school to which the Deputy refers is not included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and did not therefore qualify for special supports on this occasion.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education facilities on a phased basis at all second-level schools where such facilities are not already available.</P>
      <P>The principal factor which determines progress in this area is the amount of capital funding available in any given financial year.  Given the limited resources available, the priority for the foreseeable future as far as the second-level capital programme is concerned will continue to be the provision of essential classroom accommodation.</P>
      <P>However, it was found possible to make provision for the architectural planning of PE halls, at 12 schools, in the 1996 Capital Programme, which includes the school in question.</P>

      <P>The current maximum class size guidlines for primary schools are as follows: 35 pupils in the case of a single grade class group; 34 pupils in the case of a class group of two consecutive grades; 31 pupils in the case of multi-grade class group.  In addition, a maximum of 29 pupils applies in the case of all classes in schools which are designated as disadvantaged while a maximum of 28 pupils applies to one teacher schools which have more than four standards.</P>
      <P>In the case of the large urban schools involved in my new initiative Breaking the Cycle a maximum class size of 15 pupils is applicable to all junior classes.  The most up-to-date information available on the average number of pupils per class relates to the 1995-96 school year.  The average figure for Dublin county was 28.8, while the average for Dublin city was 27.7.  The average number of pupils per class nationally for the 1995-96 school year was 26.9.</P>
      <P>No primary school should have classes with 39 pupils or more.  School authorities are advised, in cases where classes cannot be organised within the above-mentioned guidelines, to make application to my Department in the matter before 1 November.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates.  The local authority decides the rate applicable in each particular case.  The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which he or she is attending.  The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
      <P>I understand from Donegal County Council, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, that the student in question resides within 15 miles of the college.  Therefore, the adjacent rate of maintenance is applicable in this case.  I also understand from Donegal County Council that the non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant was inadvertently paid in this case.  The question of recoupment of the overpayment is a matter to be resolved between the local authority and the grant holder.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question relates to the statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwellinghouses.  I am satisfied that legislation governing the scheme is adequate to deal with the type of problem outlined in the question.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2), Act, 1978, contains provisions which enable the owners of dwellinghouses to buy out their ground rents and provides for the vesting of a fee simple in such dwellinghouses.  Part III of the Act provides that owner-occupiers of dwellinghouses have a special procedure available to acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property.  These provisions, which were to run for a period of five years under the 1978 Act, were subsequently continued in force indefinitely by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1978 Act also contains a provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming.  In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration.  Where the registrar is of the opinion that any party to the arbitration <Col N="794" /> has behaved unreasonably and as a result caused the incurring of the cost of the arbitration he or she may direct that that party pay all or part of such cost.</P>

      <P>The number of Bills published by my Department in 1996 was eight.  In 1993 four Bills were published.  While it is difficult to be precise about the timescale for the publication of Bills, I expect to be in a position to publish a Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, a Licensing (Drugs) Bill and legislation in relation to bail in the first three months or so of 1997.  It may also prove possible to introduce Bills relating to Europol and the United Nations Convention against Torture during the period in question or not long afterwards.</P>

The position has not changed since that time.  In relation to consultancies, reviews, etc.  I am assuming that the Deputy's question is directed towards consultancies etc. which relate directly to my office and the offices of the Ministers of State at my Department.

    <P>A person whose mother or father was an Irish citizen at the time of his or her birth is automatically an Irish citizen.  A person whose grandfather or grandmother, but not his or her parents, were born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registering in the Foreign Births Register (FBR) at an Irish Embassy or Consular Office or at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There are also certain instances whereby a person can obtain Irish citizenship through his or her great-grand-father or great-grandmother.

    <P>
      <i>Note:</i> If &ldquo;C&rdquo; had registered prior to 31 December 1986, &ldquo;D&rdquo; would be able to register at any time.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986 introduced a provision whereby registration in the FBR after the aforementioned date granted citizenship from the date of registration only.</P>
    <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory, a person, not otherwise an Irish citizen through descent, born in Northern Ireland after 6 December 1922 may declare himself or herself, in the prescribed manner to be an Irish citizen.  If the person is not of full age, i.e. 18 years, his/her parent or guardian may make the declaration.</P>
    <P>The President may grant Irish citizenship as a token of honour to a person or to the child or grandchild of a person who, in the opinion of the Government, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Naturalisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956, and 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice may, at her absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation, where statutory provisions are complied with.  These provisions require that an applicant has resided in the State for five years, is of good character and intends to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation. Section 16 of the Acts provides that the Minister may, in specific instances, waive some or all of the statutory requirements when considering an application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" />
      <i>Marriage to an Irish citizen (post-nuptial citizenship)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Acts provides that a person who is not an Irish citizen may, following three years marriage to an Irish citizen, lodge a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship, provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgment of the declaration and the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect.&rdquo; I am informed that there are approximately 100 declarations for post-nuptial citizenship from persons resident in Ireland under consideration in my Department at present.  Declarations from persons resident outside the State are processed by the Department of Foreign Affairs through its embassies and consulates. Figures of the number of declarations being processed in this way are not readily quantifiable. There are no residency or work permit requirements attached to post-nuptial citizenship.</P>
    <P>In so far as the naturalisation process is concerned, I am informed that there are approximately 400 applications for certificates of naturalisation at various stages of processing in my Department at present.  Because of the nature of the process, it can take up to 12 months to process such applications.</P>
    <P>The granting of Irish citizenship in this manner is a privilege and not a right and it is incumbent on both my officials and myself to be happy that applicants are deserving of the honour bestowed on them.  As I mentioned above, one of the factors taken into account in considering applications for naturalisation is that applicants have been residing in the State for at least five years. For the benefit of the Deputy, and applicants, I would point out that residence in this sense is taken to mean properly documented full-time residence, i.e. that the non-national in question is properly registered with the Garda for the required period of time.  Temporary residence in the State, e.g. as a student, is generally discounted as the individuals in question would have been admitted to the State for a specific purpose on the understanding that they would be leaving when that purpose had been achieved.  Notwithstanding this general policy, the Acts provide that I may exercise my discretion in this area where I consider the particular circumstances of a case warrant the use of such discretion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asks if the length of time on work permits is a major criterion in deciding to grant naturalisation.  There is nothing in the Acts dealing with this issue, <i>per se.</i> However, it is a general requirement of Aliens law that persons who are nationals of certain countries may work in the State only where a work permit has been issued to their employers.  The absence of appropriate work permits for such persons would mean that they were working illegally in the State and this is a factor I would have to take into account in reaching my decision in any particular case.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 164 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>As set out in my reply to Questions Nos. 25 and 74 on 27 November 1996, the Department of Social Welfare and the Pensions Board have jointly launched a national pensions policy initiative. The purpose of the initiative is to facilitate a national debate on how to work towards a national pension system consistent with the aim of providing pension benefits which maintain a reasonable relationship with previous income levels so that established standards of living can be maintained.</P>
      <P>This initiative will also take account of the two reports published by the Economic and Social Research Institute today on Poverty in Ireland: Evidence from the 1994 Living in Ireland Survey and A Review of the Commission on Social Welfare's Minimum Adequate Income.</P>
      <P>This is a very important time for pensions policy. We need to look comprehensively and very carefully, over a relatively short time frame, at the position.  We then need to make decisions and, most importantly, to carry those decisions through so that we face up to, and deal with the medium and long-term issues so as to ensure that the living standards of future generations of pensioners are safeguarded.</P>

      <P>The Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems identified two priority areas which need to be addressed in order to reduce poverty traps and work disincentives.  These were: reform of child income support and tax reform.</P>
      <P>The Government Programme already commits us to reform in both of these areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to income support for children, we have already been taking steps to ease the poverty trap associated with the current structure of child income support.  Child benefit has a particular role to play in this respect; since it is not dependent on the income or work status of the parent, it does not contribute to poverty traps. We have been gradually improving child benefit in recent years.  Child benefit has been increased by 45 per cent since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>The second main factor contributing to poverty traps is the taxation of people on low incomes. The expert group's report recommended that policies for taxation of the low paid should be directed towards limiting and eventually abolishing the exemption limits, by increasing personal allowances at a faster rate than the exemption limits.  This Government has already made considerable progress on reducing the tax burden. Over the last two budgets, the personal tax allowance for a married couple has increased by £600; the general exemption limit for a married couple has also been so increased by £600 over the last two years.  Progress has also been made on widening the tax bands.</P>
      <P>Further progress on both of these issues will be considered by the Government in the context of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no widely agreed definition of the &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; although the term is in widespread use.  Living conditions vary from country <Col N="803" /> to country at any one time and living patterns in any given country change over a period.</P>
      <P>Drawing on the academic debate on the experience gained from European poverty programmes the following definition is used as a working definition of poverty for the development of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
      <P>People are living in poverty, if their income and resources (material, cultural and social) are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living which is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally.  As a result of inadequate income and resources people may be excluded and marginalised from participating in activities which are considered the norm for other people in society.</P>
      <P>There is widespread acceptance of the view that poverty should be seen in terms of the standard of living of the society in question.  As a consequence, relative poverty lines have been put forward as a useful indicator of poverty in a given society at a point in time.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has undertaken a considerable amount of technical research and analysis in this area.  Their report, Poverty in the 1990s: Evidence from the Living in Ireland Survey, which was published today, utilises the 1994 Living in Ireland Survey to provide an updated picture of poverty in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Results based on these 1994 data show that approximately 6 per cent of households have an income at or below 40 per cent of mean household income, approximately 18 per cent of households have an income at or below 50 per cent of mean household income and approximately 34 per cent of households have an income at or below 60 per cent of mean household income.</P>
      <P>The usefulness of these analyses is not the percentages themselves, which depend on the poverty line one chooses, but rather the description of the groups at relatively greatest risk of poverty, and the trends over time.</P>
      <P>Further analyses is contained in the report Reviewing the Commission on Social Welfare's Minimum Adequate Income, also published by the ESRI today.  Both reports form part of a substantial programme of research being carried out by the ESRI, which is sponsored by the Department of Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency.  The national anti-poverty strategy (NAPS) is now entering a key phase of its development.  Much has been achieved since the launch of the strategy following the UN World Summit on Social Development, held in Copenhagen in March 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five working groups, including departmental officials, representatives of the social partners and of the national anti-poverty networks were established to examine the five key themes identified under the NAPS.  These groups have in each case now completed or are in the process of completing their reports to the interdepartmental <Col N="804" /> policy committee, which has been established to formulate the development of NAPS.  This follows on from an extensive consultation process which included seminars on the various key themes held in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.</P>
    <P>In addition, each Government Department is currently finalising a strategic statement in relation to its anti-poverty policy drawing on a review of relevant policies.  It is intended to make a report to Government as soon as the various Working Group reports and departmental statements have been completed, with a report being made to the United Nations on progress with the NAPS in the New Year.</P>
    <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee, with the assistance of the Combat Poverty Agency, is also in the process of finalising the Overview Statement in relation to the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, the draft of which was published this time last year.</P>
    <P>The reports published today by the ESRI, Poverty in Ireland; Evidence from the 1994 Living in Ireland Survey and A Review of the Commission on Social Welfare's Minimum Adequate Income, together with the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, and other key reports, such as that of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare, will contribute to informing public debate on the issue of poverty, while also providing a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current rates of social welfare entitlements and the standard of living of social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report &mdash; Developing the National Pension System &mdash; considered that a standard age for both retirement and old age pensions should be 65 years. However, because of the costs involved they considered this to be a low priority.</P>

      <P>Death grant is a social insurance benefit which is payable, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or of their spouse or child under 18.  The amount of the grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the grant, which was introduced with effect from 1 October 1970, was to help with funeral and other post-bereavement costs.  The rate of grant payable has not been increased since 1982 and the value of the grant has, accordingly, fallen having regard to average funeral costs.</P>
      <P>There are however other measures in place which are designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement.  For example, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for six weeks.  In addition, payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
      <P>The rate of death grant is reviewed in the context of the budget each year in common with all other social welfare rates of payment.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social <Col N="807" /> welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>In recognition that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, the scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.  The 1996-97 scheme will run from Monday 14 October 1996 to Friday 11 April 1997.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by almost 65 per cent in the last five years from £26 million in 1989 to £42.8 million in 1995.  This year a sum of £44 million has been set aside in the 1996 estimates for the scheme.  This includes an amount for the increase in the income limits from £10 to £15 which I announced in this year's budget.  The 1996-7 fuel season began on 14 October 1996 and from both an administrative and budgetary perspective it is now too late to consider doubling the fuel allowance for Christmas week.</P>
      <P>However, a review of the scheme is being carried out by independent consultants to ensure that it is operating effectively and equitably and any changes to the scheme will be considered in the light of their report.  The consultant's report is due shortly.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent payments to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation <Col N="808" /> costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for such a payment the claimant must satisfy the general conditions of entitlement of SWA set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and the conditions of entitlement to a rent supplement set out in the regulations.  Those generally excluded from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme include people in full-time employment, people in full time education and people involved in trade disputes.  The payment of rent supplements to tenants evicted from local authority housing as a result of anti-social behaviour is under review as the withdrawal of social welfare payments has legal and social implications.  Legislation to address the problem of anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates which was drafted by the Department of Environment was recently approved by Cabinet.  It will be presented in the Dáil in February 1997.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, has clearly defined the term &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; to focus on drug pushing and related activity.  The new Bill is aimed primarily at providing necessary legislative support to strengthen the capacity of housing authorities to deal with anti-social behaviour as one element in the management of housing estates.  The legislation provides discretion, in certain circumstances, for health boards to refuse or withdraw assistance under the SWA scheme in respect of rent or mortgage supplementation of private housing in the case of tenants evicted by a housing authority on the grounds of drug pushing or related anti-social behaviour.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the recently published Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) for 1997.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Social Welfare in that volume assumes the continuation of existing policies and services in 1997.  This means that the Estimate, which is on a pre-budget 1997 basis, reflects the full year costs of the improvements announced in the 1996 budget, including provision for the introduction of the new one-parent family payment from January 1997; the increased take-up on certain programmes arising largely from demographic factors; provision for the 1997 Christmas bonus &mdash; this is the first time that the bonus has been provided for in the published Estimates; the increase in PRSI income due mainly to macroeconomic factors, and the savings from a lower live register projection for 1997.</P>

Those provisions requiring legislation will be provided for in the Social Welfare Bill following the budget.</P>

      <P>At the end of November 1996 there were 50,137 recipients of lone parent's payments, 37,587 were in receipt of the maximum rate and of these 2,086 were in employment.  The remaining 12,550 were in receipt of reduced rate payments and of these 4,591 were in employment.</P>
      <P>At the end of November 1996, there were 16,836 recipients of deserted wife's benefit and allowance payments, of whom 13,573 received the maximum rate and 3,263 were on reduced rates. Aggregrate information is not available on the number of deserted wives who are in employment. In addition, 48 people receiving the maximum rate of lone parent's allowance, and 4,534 receiving reduced rates, are engaged in community employment.  Also, Department records indicate that about 50 deserted wives are employed on these schemes.</P>
      <P>Information is not readily available on the number of deserted wives and lone parents who are receiving maintenance in respect of themselves or their children.  Any steps to ensure a greater extent of maintenance commitment and compliance are primarily a matter for lone parents in the first instance, with legal options available to them through the courts under family law. They are required to make efforts to obtain maintenance as a condition of application for deserted wife's benefit or lone parent's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, under the &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions of the social welfare legislation, the Department pursues liable relatives for contributions towards the cost of the deserted <Col N="812" /> wife's benefit or lone parent's allowance payable to their families.  Actions under these provisions include seeking the transfer or maintenance payments to the Department where they exist.  The Department is actively considering ways of increasing the contribution yield under this system.</P>

      <P>The process of maintenance recovery is a difficult and protracted one.  A large proportion of liable relatives are not in a financial position to pay because they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or in low-wage employment.  In addition over a quarter of liable relatives cannot be traced. Maintenance recovery action can only be realistically pursued with persons who can be traced and who have the means to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>Since the provisions came into force in November 1990, 19,300 cases have been examined to determine liability on the part of a spouse to make contributions to the Department.  A total of 745 determination orders have been issued to liable relatives since the commencement of the system, directing that weekly payments be made to the Department; 300 of those orders have been issued in the past two years.</P>
      <P>Total receipts so far amount to almost £1.2 million from 350 contributors, of which £0.8 million has been collected in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to moneys recovered by way of concall <Col N="813" /> tributions from liable relatives, the operation of the maintenance recovery provisions yield savings where the investigation of the case results in the termination or reduction of the deserted wife's or lone parent's payment.  These savings, have totalled nearly £0.8 million, of which just under £0.4 million relates to 1995 and 1996 to date.</P>
    <P>The number of liable relatives contributing and the yield continue to grow and ways of building on this are being considered in the Department.</P>

      <P>In line with previous years, this year's Christmas bonus has been paid to people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments including those receiving old age, retirement, widows', widowers', invalidity pensions, lone parent's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, carer's allowance, disability allowance, formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance, as well as FÁS and CERT trainees. In all, almost 800,000 recipients and their 500,000 dependants i.e. a total of 1.3 million people have benefited from this payment.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments, such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance at the short-term rate, are not eligible for the Christmas bonus.  I have no plans at present to extend the bonus to those recipients.  Any such extension would have substantial cost implications which could be considered only in the light of available resources.</P>

Overtime is necessary in the Department and in the State-sponsored bodies under its aegis to ensure that services are delivered in a timely manner.  Overtime is worked in those areas where experience and-or special skills are necessary and in order to deal with peaks in the normal workload.

      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force.  The scheme has proved to be a very worthwhile initiative with over 16,000 persons currently in receipt of the weekly allowance which provides support over a three year period to those wishing to take up employment and self employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>An independent evaluation of the scheme was commissioned in 1995 along with an evaluation of the area allowance enterprise, which applies to unemployed people residing in designated partnership areas.</P>
      <P>The final report on the back to work scheme was made available to my Department earlier this year and the result will be made available early in the new year when the final report on the area allowance initiative is received from the consultants.</P>

      <P>As part of the programme to improve the overall quality of social insurance records held on the Department's computer system, the Department started last year to review the records of certain categories of people where it appeared that the records were deficient or incomplete.</P>
      <P>During this year about 10,000 persons were contacted.  The purpose of the exercise was to give the people concerned the opportunity to examine their insurance records and to furnish details if they consider that there are inaccuracies or omissions.  Discrepancies were reported in 146 cases and these are being investigated.  The discrepancies appear to be virtually all due to failure of employers to make returns or as a result of deficient or inaccurate employer returns.</P>

      <P>Under these schemes grants can be made for a wide range of activities covering almost every aspect of personal and skills development.  Projects should involve the participants in the running of, and where possible, the design of the project itself.  Priority is given to projects aimed at developing the skill and expertise of individuals in setting-up and running projects in their communities; groups in disadvantaged areas; projects aimed at specially disadvantaged groups and new projects establishing themselves in their communities. The emphasis is on supporting self-help and community development initiatives, and not on the provision of services.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have been able to have two Bills enacted this year.  The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for a number of major improvements including the introduction of a new disability allowance which replaced the disabled person's maintenance allowance and a new one-parent family payment which will replace the lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit with effect from the beginning of January next. This Act also provided for a number of significant pro-employment measures including: a reform of the manner in which earnings from employment are assessed for unemployment assistance purposes; a £10 per week increase in the family income supplement earnings thresholds which provided recipients with an increase of £6 per week; a reduction from six to three months in the minimum period which the employment is expected to last to qualify for family income supplement; and the retention of child dependant allowances for up to 13 weeks in the case of people unemployed for 12 months or more who take-up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1996, provided, <Col N="817" /><i>inter alia,</i> for mandatory reporting by certain persons in relation to fraud or misappropriation in a pension scheme and for two new members, who must be trustees of a pension scheme, to be appointed to the Pensions Board.</P>

      <P>It is not clear what reports the Deputy is referring to.  According to the September quarter 1996 Housing Statistics Bulletin issued by the Department of the Environment, the number of persons who are homeless has in fact decreased.</P>
      <P>The programme, A Government of Renewal proposed that all forms of social housing assistance be administered by local authorities.  This matter is being pursued by an interdepartmental committee under the aegis of the Department of the Environment with representatives from the Departments of Health, Social Welfare and Finance. This committee will report to Government in due course.</P>

      <P>Mr Pat Nolan, a career civil servant with extensive experience of economic and social policy issues is employed as programme manager at a salary of £45,525 per annum with effect from 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>I have one special adviser Ms Rosheen Callender who has wide expertise in social policy and whose salary is £43,133 per annum with effect from 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>I have a personal assistant, whose salary is £19,921 per annum and a personal secretary whose salary is £15,234 per annum.  Both salaries are effective from 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Durkan, has a personal assistant whose salary is £15,234 per annum, a personal secretary whose salary is £15,025 per annum., and two civilian drivers who receive the standard annual salary of £13,720.  All salaries are effective from 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>The function of personal advisory staff is to assist me and the Minister of State in discharging our responsibilities as public representatives and holders of Government office in a Department of State with responsibility for delivery of social welfare services to the public.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, as a party leader in Government I have been sanctioned to employ five unestablished Civil Service staff in a research unit attached to my office.  The staff of the unit is made up of one senior research assistant, Mr. Angus Laverty whose annual salary is £29,135, one research assistant whose annual salary is £18,729, two part-time research assistants whose annual salaries are £11,446 and one administrative assistant whose annual salary is £15,234.  All salaries quoted are effective from 1 January 1997. The research unit provides research, analysis and advice on policy issues which arise outside my departmental responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no consultants attached to my office or to that of the Minister of State.  As part of its ongoing business, the Department engages a number of different companies and organisations to provide consultancy assistance.  Most consultancies relate to technical and-or management support with projects that are designed to improve the delivery of the services of the <Col N="819" /> Department.  The predicted overall cost of consultancy to my Department for 1996 is approximately £1.8 million.  The following is a list of the main companies and organisations who provided consultancy assistance to the Department during 1996: Agency Accounts Telecom Éireann; Andersen Consulting; Coopers and Lybrand; Digital Equipment Ireland Ltd; Gartner Group (UK) Ltd.; Goodbody Economic Consultants Ltd.; Kelleher and Associates; Market Research Bureau of Ireland Ltd.; Price Waterhouse; Work Research Co-operative Ltd.</P>
    <P>In addition, a number of firms and-or individuals are engaged for smaller consultancy projects from time to time.  The estimated overall cost of consultancy to my Department for 1997 is £0.75 million.  A breakdown of these costs is not yet available.</P>
    <P>During 1996 the following were appointed to the board of the Combat Poverty Agency: Bernie Brady, Michele Power, Fergus McCabe, Niall Fitzduff, Eoin O'Malley, Pat Ridge, Fionnuala Richardson, and Hugh Frazer.</P>
    <P>During 1996, Mr. John Chadwick and Mr. Richard Keating were appointed to the Social Welfare Tribunal and Mr. Alan Broxson, Ms Caroline Jenkinson and Ms Maria Kinlan were appointed to the Pensions Board.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 524 of 25 September 1996.  The costs incurred by my Department in relation to Ireland's Presidency of the EU were estimated at £300,000.  While it is not possible, at this juncture, to give full and final details of these costs as invoices are still being processed, it is anticipated that expenditure will be within budget and that savings will be made on the original projection.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the difficulty in answering questions in relations to the purpose and duration of each of the meetings attended by me in the course of the various trips over the past year.  For example, in the case of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore, in addition to co-chairing the conference, I attended 38 separate meetings which were directly relevant to the subject matter of the conference.</P>

      <P>My Department was allocated a total of £52,000 under subhead A9 of the Department's Vote in respect of Presidency related activity.  To date, just over £44,000 has been paid out under this subhead mainly in respect of the preparations for the recent WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore and the temporary posting of an officer to the Irish Mission in Geneva for the duration of the Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, because our Presidency is in the latter half of the year, there are certain items of expenditure which have only recently occurred and which will give rise to payments before the end of the year and in the new year.  Accordingly, I am not in a position at this stage to indicate the final outturn.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>In the past, liquidators had been slow to file liquidation documents showing particulars of their acts and dealings as required by the Companies Acts.  In October, 1994 the Companies Registration Office issued a letter to all liquidators of companies which were two years or more in arrears in respect of filing statutory returns.  Liquidators were requested to file outstanding returns by 31 March 1995.  There was a good response to this letter, in general.  Liquidators for 1,542 companies requested that the companies be struck off the Registrar under section 311 (5) of the Companies Act, 1963.  This strike off procedure was concluded in August 1995.</P>
      <P>A small number of liquidators did not reply to the CRO letter of October 1994 and failed to file outstanding liquidation returns.  As a result proceedings are being taken and to date two liquidators have been prosecuted and convicted. Another case is pending.</P>
      <P>The table below sets out the number of liquidations notifed to the Registrar of Companies from 1991 to 1995.  These figures include companies wound up voluntarily and companies wound up by order of the High Court.  Figures for 1996 will be available early in the New Year.</P>

    <P>(Source of information: Companies Reports 1991-1995).</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that at the end of June 1993 there were 7,770 companies in the process of <Col N="828" /> liquidation.  However, by the end of 1995 the total number of companies in the course of liquidation was 5,605.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to companies which finalised liquidation are not readily available.  The CRO database as currently constituted does not easily allow an analysis of liquidations as requested by the Deputy.  The CRO is in the process of putting in place a new computer system which will facilitate the accessing of such information in the future.  In the meantime I have asked the Registrar of Companies to examine whether it is possible to extract additional information and I will inform the Deputy of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Following the campaign by the CRO in 1994 it is clear that there is now a greater awareness among liquidators of the need to comply with their obligations under the Companies Acts.</P>

The ERS is intended as an incentive for farmers to retire from farming before reaching the normal retirement age.  Under the scheme, persons entitled to social welfare pension must on reaching 66 years of age, have their ERS pension offset by that amount and receive a reduced ERS payment as a supplement to the national pension.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the continuing problem occasioned by attacks on farm livestock, particularly sheep, by marauding dogs.  These dogs are a particular menace at lambing time.  In addition to the cruelty and distress suffered by livestock, the financial losses to farmers, and indeed the economy, can be considerable but can be prevented by responsible dog ownership.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to all dog owners to ensure that their dogs are kept under control at all times. Negligent dog owners can face stiff penalties under the law and can be held liable for damages and costs in a civil action.  In addition, dogs may be shot by the owner of the animals subjected to attack.</P>

This was in line with my commitments under the Farmers Charter to improving the delivery of services to the farming community.  In 1996 with the increase in the incidence of BSE new control measures were put in place in district veterinary offices, factories, marts and export ports.  Extra computer facilities costing about £1 million have been put in place to support these measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy in 1992, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was obliged under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3508/92 to establish an Integrated Administrative and Control System, IACS.  A specific requirement of the <Col N="842" /> system was the development of an alpha-numeric land parcel identification system, LPIS, for all land parcels which are the subject of an area aid application.  The purpose of this parcel identification system is to provide the Department with a database whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified and have area values and land use attributed.  The deadline for implementation of the system was 1 January 1996.</P>
      <P>The LPIS operated for the 1996 area aid scheme and is currently being updated for 1997. As part of this update, some applicants for area aid have been requested to supply maps because their 1996 applications contained inadequate details of land parcels to allow identification of their location.  This happened in the case of the person named by the Deputy.  However, if she did submit a map with a previous application, she should contact my Department in writing or by phone and identify the townland in which that parcel is located.  My Department will then arrange for the issue of a map of the townland in question.  The address and phone number for contacting my Department are provided in the letter which issued to the applicant on 2 December last.</P>
      <P>The work involved in developing the LPIS and updating it in preparation for the 1997 campaign has been awarded to a private contractor based in Dundalk, County Louth.  However, I should emphasise that all queries to area aid applicants in relation to the LPIS are dealt with by staff of my Department who are temporarily based on the contractor's premises.</P>

      <P>I understand that it is unlikely that two out of the three firms will reopen as pigmeat slaughtering plants.  In the case of the third plant, Forbairt is in discussion with the owner and has placed its full range of resources at the disposal of the company concerned, with a view to a resumption of operations there, on a viable basis. A reopening will not happen in the immediate future however.</P>
      <P>Ultimately it is a matter for the owner of this company to decide whether a resumption of activities takes place.</P>

      <P>The new movement permit arrangements in respect of female animals were introduced on 16 September 1996 as part of the ongoing measures to provide greater assurances to customers and consumers on the origin of cattle and beef slaughtered and exported.  Each movement permit authenticates the origin of animals in respect of which application is made, and sanctions a specific movement from one point to a particular premises.  In so doing it provides a strick control on individual movements and maximises the integrity and security of the system, which is the primary concern.  Any provisions for more than one destination premises would have the effect of diluting this security and weakening the strick control currently exerted by the Department over movements of female cattle to slaughter and export.  Different arrangements apply in respect of male cattle.</P>

      <P>The Secretary of my Department announced on 19 April that the application by Esat Digifone for the GSM licence disclosed an intention to place 20 per cent of the equity with financial investors in the period leading up to the award of the licence.  The application was supported by letters of intent from a number of highly reputable financial institutions. Subsequently at the time of award of the licence some two months later, it was certified to my Department that the 20 per cent had been placed with IIU Nominees Ltd. which was wholly owned by Mr. Dermot Desmond.</P>
      <P>The licence awarded to Esat Digifone contains provisions which require my approval for any changes of direct ownership of the licensee.  The purpose of these provisions was to ensure that the second mobile telephony service would be delivered by the applicants for the licence.  This requirement extends to changes of indirect ownership only in certain circumstances when new shares are issued.  There has been no request for my approval to date in respect of any change of ownership for which approval is required by the licence.</P>
      <P>IIU Nominees Ltd. has also confirmed that that company continues to be wholly owned by Mr. Dermot Desmond.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take to overcome the serious difficulties which have arisen whereby persons receiving a television service from South Coast Community Television in County Cork have in many instances lost service due to the introduction of Teilifís na Gaeilge and its use of the same frequency wave; and when he proposes to grant a licence to South Coast Television, particularly in view of the problems which have arisen.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the difficulties referred to by the Deputy but it does not entirely surprise me that interference to unlicensed operators is beginning to manifest itself.</P>
      <P>It had always been planned that Teilifís na Gaeilge would be transmitted nationwide on the ultra high frequency band.  Frequency space in that band is limited and, in planning its use, priority has always been given to the national television programme services.  Unauthorised users, because of the frequency congestion created by their operations, must expect the possibility of interference as the national services take up the space allocated to them.</P>
      <P>Where an unauthorised user is transmitting on the same, or an adjacent frequency channel to a licensed operator, there will inevitably be interference &mdash; possibly to both.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree with me that interference-free reception of the national programme services must be a priority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the fourth national programme service has yet to come on air.  Use of the band will be even more restrictive at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> The Deputy will also be aware that an application for a licence from South Coast Community Television is currently being assessed by a team of consultants who will advise me on the technical aspects.  I hope to have the consultants' report in the near future.  I will make a decision in the matter as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>Details of EU directives which come within my Department's area of <Col N="860" /> responsibility and which are still awaiting transposition into Irish law are contained in the attached schedule.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2454/92 laying down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road passenger transport services within a member state has very limited practical application in Ireland and is implemented on an administrative basis.  It will not be transposed into Irish law in view of recent EC proposals which will supersede the terms of the existing regulation.</P>
      <P>The question on conventions is being dealt with and the response will be communicated directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out on the following schedule. The Irish Presidency of the EU necessitated a number of additional foreign trips which were an essential part of contributing to the success of our EU Presidency.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to give the exact duration of each individual meeting attended in the course of trips.</P>

There are some isolated parts where coverage is not so good but I understand that the company concerned are taking steps to improve it.  They are, for instance, planning to improve services which should ameliorate the reception difficulties being experienced in the centre of Fethard.  I have no reason whatever to believe that they would cease providing service in the areas in question.  The information I have is that the company intends to roll out their service to the widest possible extent.</P>

      <P>The cost of the EU Presidency to my Department may be set out as follows:</P>
      <P>Ireland has been responsible for the control and management of the European Community Monitor Mission to the Former Yugoslavia (ECMM).  There is currently a total of 88 Irish personnel serving with the ECMM of whom 78 are members of the Permanent Defence Force. The additional costs, payable from the Defence Vote, are estimated to be slightly in excess of £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>Additional costs are also being incurred by the Department of Defence during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the area of security and in the use of an air taxi service to meet additional transport requirements of Ministers during the period.  The final cost of the air taxi service operated for the duration of the Presidency is estimated, subject to the receipt of some invoices, at £850,000.  It is not possible to cost the element in the area of security which is directly attributable to our Presidency of the EU.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 and 272 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 26 November I explained that the overall position is that Ireland is committed, under an international agreement, to the provision of a Loran C station as part of a North West European radio navigation system.  That remains the position.  The Deputy will be aware of the ongoing legal issues relevant to this project.  I understand, in this regard, that an application for a certificate to appeal the recent High Court decision regarding planning permission is due to be heard by the High Court today.</P>
      <P>Full financial provision was made for the proposed Loran C system in the Estimates for this year and previous years but this was not expended as the project could not proceed because of ongoing legal proceedings.  Due to continuing uncertainty as to when legal matters would be clarified, the provision for 1997 was reduced on the understanding that should these matters be clarified, and the project allowed to proceed next year, the provision in the subhead would be reconsidered with a view to providing any further funding required.</P>

In addition, travel and subsistence costs are expected to exceed the normal level due to enhanced levels of participation at fisheries and maritime fora.  The bulk of these costs will, however, be refunded by the EU.</P>
