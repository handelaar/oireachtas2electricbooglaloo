      <P>Before commencing business I feel sure Members of the House would wish very much to join with me in extending a warm welcome to a parliamentary delegation from South Africa.  We express the hope that their visit to Ireland will be most happy and successful.  On my own behalf and on behalf of all Members I extend to you the warmest of Irish greetings, céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>Later in the debate today Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív will report on his visit to republican prisoners in the United Kingdom.  As I cannot raise that issue on the Order of Business it would be worth listening to what he has <Col N="946" /> to say.  I asked the Taoiseach on Tuesday last if he would avail of the next opportunity to raise the case of prisoner Paddy Kelly with the British Government. Can the Tánaiste give us some information on him as his health is deteriorating rapidly?  It is an important matter and on humanitarian grounds he should be transferred to this country.  In fact, he should be in hospital.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that we have taken the opportunity to raise the case of prisoners and, indeed, Mr. Kelly, on many occasions and will continue to do so.  My understanding is that the papers are in order and hopefully that transfer can take place.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Ahern has said.  On humanitarian grounds Patrick Kelly should be transferred back and I know that is the position of the Irish Government.  I hope in the light of the joint communiqué and the new understanding between the British and Irish Governments we will see some common sense in relation to this issue.  It would be counterproductive if, after all the work that has been done since 9 February, this matter was not dealt with urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The British and Irish Governments have long shared a common analysis and a common objective: a comprehensive political settlement based on consent.  We have also been united in agreement that this objective can only be attained through all-party negotiations addressing comprehensively all the relevant relationships and issues in an interlocking three-stranded process.  The necessity for all-party negotiations is also appreciated by all parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where they and we have differed has been on how to proceed into such negotiations. Was it possible to ensure that, on the one hand, all parties could enter into such negotiations freely on a basis of equality and without prejudice to <Col N="948" /> their fundamental aspirations and, on the other hand, that all could negotiate in full confidence that there was a basic commitment all round to exclusively peaceful methods and to the democratic process?</P>
    <P>This conundrum has dominated discussion between the two Governments, and wider debate, for the past 12 months.  It has been a difficult and frustrating period.  Disputes over a wide range of complex and interconnected, but ultimately secondary, issues have been permitted to obscure the fundamental point that there is an overwhelming consensus for peace and for agreement between the people who share this island.  Debate about questions of substance has been crowded out by debate about questions of procedure.</P>
    <P>The appalling prospect that the peace process might run into the sands has loomed before us.  In their mass demonstrations last Sunday, the people underlined their determination that this could not be allowed to happen.  Even before yesterday's communiqué was written, the wider Irish public had demonstrated that the peace does indeed belong to all the people in this country.  The two Governments agreed at the end of November that it was their firm aim to launch all-party negotiations by the end of February.  A clear and unalterable timetable leading to negotiations on 10 June has now been put in place.  The timescale now envisaged is consistent with the implications of an elective process, the possibility of which was signalled in the November communiqué.</P>
    <P>The essential point agreed at the summit is that there is a fixed date on which all-party negotiations will begin.  This is a firm and unambiguous commitment and neither Government has sought to enter any qualifications, to hedge or to equivocate.  We now see a definite commitment that the two Governments and the Northern parties will sit down together to begin to fashion that lasting settlement which is required to underpin peace and to allow for a new beginning in all three core relationships.</P>
    <P>The need for negotiations has been <Col N="949" /> acknowledged on all sides.  We want them because, objectively, they are necessary.  They would be necessary even if the paramilitary organisations had never existed because there is a political conflict which must be resolved. Nor can the will of the people for negotiations leading to an agreement founded on consent be thwarted by violence. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister resolved that neither violence, nor the threat of violence, would be allowed to influence the course of negotiations or preparations for negotiations. They also agreed that the IRA's abandonment of its cessation of violence was a fundamental breach of the declared basis on which both Governments engaged Sinn Féin in political dialogue. They reiterated what has already been stated more than once in the House, that the resumption of full political dialogue with Sinn Féin requires the restoration of the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the people of Ireland, North and South, who utterly repudiate the use of violence for any purpose whatsoever, can be assured that there will be no bending of the principle that violence has no place in any political process.  Equally, the Governments have emphasised that they are determined to press on in the search for political agreement, irrespective of whether the republican movement makes it possible for Sinn Féin to rejoin that quest. Nevertheless, a fundamental objective of the peace process has always been to offer a meaningful political alternative to violence.  Negotiations conducted on a fully inclusive basis, in the absence both of violence and security countermeasures, have always seemed more likely in the long run to produce a stable agreement in which all could acquiesce. The two Governments hope, accordingly, that the negotiations will be fully inclusive, with all parties being able to participate in them.  We call on Sinn Féin and the IRA to make Sinn Féin's participation in the process of such negotiations possible.</P>
    <P>On 15 February, the president of Sinn Féin said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> The absence of negotiations led to the breakdown.  The commencement of negotiations therefore provides the way forward.  Any new process must contain copperfastened and unambiguous public assurances that all-party talks will be initiated by both Governments at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>All-party negotiations will begin on 10 June.  While many would have wished for an earlier date, we wanted to be sure that the appointed date was realistic and could be fixed without doubt.  This fixed date surely now offers the basic assurances the republican movement sought. Given the intolerable human cost, and the grave political damage caused by the violence to date, how can the IRA explain the continuation, for one more day, of its renewed campaign?  It is up to it to decide its own course.  I cannot pretend to know how the minds of its leaders work, but I expect that all those with influence upon it will do what they can to point out to it the straightforward and positive implications of agreement on a fixed date and timetable for negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister both recognised that confidence building measures will be necessary in the course of all-party negotiations. Negotiations are a dynamic process, depending on the interplay of personalities and arguments, and not a matter of static calculation.  As one such measure, all participants need to make clear at the beginning of negotiations their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out so clearly in the Mitchell report.  These principles offer essential guarantees that negotiations will not be affected by violence, or by the threat of violence, and that they will address and, as part of their outcome, achieve, the totally and verifiable decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons.</P>
    <P>All parties will also have to address, as a high priority, the report's proposals on decommissioning.  Negotiations must, in a nutshell, deal fully and satisfactorily <Col N="951" /> with this issue.  However, decommissioning is by no means the only item on the agenda, nor should the commitments we seek be exploited to avoid serious negotiations on the many other questions which need to be addressed. The two Governments have been at pains to stress that confidence is required all round if the negotiations are to gain the momentum necessary for their success.  The parties must have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.</P>
    <P>Negotiations must be for real, and must be undertaken in good faith.  Every participant has the right to expect that every other participant will make a genuine effort to understand opposing perspectives and to seek accommodation. A heavy onus will rest on all of us.  For all to gain, each must be prepared to change.  A flexible and accommodating approach will be essential.  For example, I was heartened by the fact that the Ulster Unionist Party's recent paper, &ldquo;The Democratic Imperative&rdquo;, displayed some understanding of the basis of the Nationalist requirement for meaningful North-South links.  I hope all parties, including the Unionists, will feel able, both before and throughout the negotiations, to prove to others their determination to forge a new and all-embracing accord.</P>
    <P>The Unionist parties have stressed that for them an elective process is of crucial importance in enabling them to go to the table.  Both Governments are of the view that such a process would have to be broadly acceptable and would have to lead immediately and without further preconditions to the convening of all-party negotiations with a comprehensive agenda.  As reflected in the communiqué, the details of an elective process are primarily a matter for the Northern Ireland parties, which will be the participants in any such process, and for the British Government, <Col N="952" /> which will have to introduce the necessary legislation and ensure it is speedily processed.</P>
    <P>The question of how elections are to be integrated into the launch of negotiations is one in which we have a legitimate interest as one of the participants in those negotiations.  The Irish Government is prepared to support any process which satisfies the criteria set out by the international body: it must be broadly acceptable to the Northern parties, have an appropriate mandate and be within the three-stranded structure.  It is on this basis that the Government has agreed with the British Government on the approach outlined in the communiqué.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the Northern parties continue to disagree on the form of any elective process and on the precise function of that process.  There are significant disagreements even between those who have advocated such a process from the beginning.  There is a range of possible options consistent with the requirement that elections lead directly and without preconditions into three-stranded all-party negotiations. There are also numerous other significant details which need to be resolved in advance of the launch of negotiations. These are broadly grouped together under the rubric of &ldquo;the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda&rdquo; of such negotiations.</P>
    <P>Both Governments have had useful discussions with the parties during the series of preparatory talks which were initiated after last November's summit. Nevertheless, there is still much work to be done.  For example, we need to ensure that, irrespective of the form and outcome of any elective process, there will be a way for all the relevant players in the situation, including the loyalist parties which have played so crucial and constructive a role, to be involved in resolving the conflict.  There are several other key points and myriad lesser details on which it will be necessary to be clear in advance.</P>
    <P>It has seemed to me for some time that the only practical way to hammer out agreement on these issues, given <Col N="953" /> both their complexity and the number of participants involved, would be through some form of concentrated and accelerated dialogue which would allow us all to bounce ideas off one another and to explore common ground.  The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have now agreed that the two Governments will conduct intensive multilateral consultations on these lines with the relevant Northern parties in whatever configuration or configurations are acceptable to those concerned.</P>
    <P>These consultations will begin on Monday next, 4 March and preparations at official level are already under way. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I will meet in Belfast on that day to launch the consultations and to agree on how we will make the best use of the time available to ensure that every effort is made to secure widespread agreement among the parties on elections and the organisation of negotiations and to allow us to come to a view on the question of a referendum.  I appeal to all parties to co-operate fully in that process.</P>
    <P>These consultations are to be strictly time-limited.  They will end on Wednesday, 13 March.  They will not be allowed to drag on inconclusively and in so doing to threaten the timetable set out for the launch of negotiations.  The existence of a deadline will focus the minds of participants.  After 13 March, the two Governments will immediately review their outcome.  The British Government will bring forward legislation for an elective process, based on a judgment of what seems most broadly acceptable.  Decisions will also be announced as appropriate on the other matters relating to the negotiating process which are to be addressed by the consultations.  The two Governments are of the shared view that the parties must be given every opportunity to shape these matters in an agreed fashion, but ultimately we are prepared to make judgments and, where appropriate, to take the necessary decisions on the basis of what we have learned in the consultations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> In essence, we have mapped out a clear path to the negotiating table.  This combination of steps offers to all parties a balanced and honourable way forward. It guarantees negotiations, and that they will be conducted on the basis of the principles of democracy and non-violence. There is no reason for any party to refuse to participate in negotiations. Equally, there is no reason for the IRA, through a refusal to restore its ceasefire, to deny Sinn Féin the possibility of full participation in political dialogue and entry into negotiations on a basis of equality.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are a necessary means to an essential end.  We must not forget what it is that we seek to attain through negotiations.  It is important to remind ourselves of the ultimate prize we seek to gain.</P>
    <P>Political violence could be eradicated forever through draining the swamp of inherited distrust and incomprehension. Through partnership in agreed institutions Unionists and Nationalists could learn to respect one another and to work together for the common good. Nationalists could feel secure and valued within Northern Ireland: Unionists could feel secure and valued on the island.  We could achieve permanent agreement on the rules which would order our relationships through matching and reciprocal guarantees which would transcend disputes over sovereignty. The last ghosts which haunt the relationship between Britain and Ireland would be laid to rest.</P>
    <P>It is long past time that we began to work out together how to reach this destination. Now we know when negotiations will begin, and we must prepare ourselves for the task ahead.  The Irish Government, working on the foundations and with the commitments of yesterday's communiqué, will approach that task with the utmost urgency and resolve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As has already been made clear by our party leader.  Deputy Bertie Ahern, we on this side of the <Col N="955" /> House welcome yesterday's communiqué, including the fixed date for negotiations which has been the key to advancing the peace process.  For 18 months delay upon delay occurred without any real progress towards the commencement of negotiations.  We had the communiqué of 28 November with the firm aim of commencing negotiations by the end of February.  It was interesting to hear Michael Ancram say on the radio this morning that previous statements, including dates, were no more than wishful thinking.  That has been the difficulty.  They were recognised as being no more than wishful thinking.  It is essential that the fixed date in June is adhered to because we must go forward.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of regret that the question is being asked as to where is democracy in all of this?  If the bombs had not exploded three weeks ago, would we be where we are today?  I would like to think we would be and that the concentrated efforts of all parties in this House, the people of both these islands and the people of the United States would have been worthwhile. I fear, however, the message that will have been sent out to the hard men of the IRA.  I do not agree with it but I am afraid of it.</P>
      <P>For the past 18 months Sinn Féin, as well as Members of this House, have called for a definite date for the commencement of talks.  Now that a definite date has been set, it is incumbent on Sinn Féin to demand of the IRA army council a restoration of the ceasefire.  The people of these islands demand nothing less from the IRA. Neither frustration with delays in the democratic process nor delays in the commencement of talks can justify the violence we have witnessed in recent weeks.  Nothing justifies the two deaths in Canary Wharf, the death of the IRA member, Ed O'Brien from Gorey, and the pain and suffering that has caused his parents.  We must reinstate the ceasefire, have a permanent end to violence and move on to democratic negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> I am particularly proud of the role my party has played in the peace process since the Fianna Fáil-led Government brought about the ceasefire of 31 August 1994.  I am proud also of the role played by my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in the two and a half weeks since the bomb exploded in Canary Wharf on that fateful Friday evening when the ceasefire ended.  By supporting the Government in a bi-partisan way and leading the process of talks with Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the IRSP and various other groups, Fianna Fáil has done everything possible in the role of Opposition to restore the peace process.  The past two and a half weeks have been a time of crisis. Fianna Fáil has been central in trying to restore the peace process and we intend to remain central by using our contacts and our influence with all parties, bodies and individuals to ensure the process is moved forward.</P>
    <P>I have one regret about the wording of yesterday's communiqué.  There is an essential role to be played by Senator Mitchell in advancing the peace process, through the phase of negotiations and on to a comprehensive settlement. There will be occasions during the proximity talks, the electoral process and the negotiations to commence in June, when seemingly irreconcilable differences will arise and where the bona fides of both Governments will be questioned.  At that stage in the process, it will be essential to have someone who will act as an honest broker, and no one has become more identified with the peace process or is more knowledgeable about the issues involved in the conflict than Senator Mitchell.  The role of the United States Government and its people has been essential to the peace process.  I can understand the British Government's reluctance to have outsiders involved in its affairs but reason indicates there is a role for an honest broker, and Senator Mitchell is the obvious choice.  It will be necessary to have somebody from whom the participants can seek guidance or an opinion. In all disputes there is an intermediary <Col N="957" /> but in this case we are talking about conflict resolution, which is a complex issue, and the role of an honest broker is essential.</P>
    <P>Whatever the outcome of these negotiations &mdash; and I am glad this was emphasised in the communiqué &mdash; it must include a comprehensive settlement on the basis of the Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.  I welcome the fact that the framework document is being quoted in the context of the resolution of this historic problem because, since its publication, it has not been mentioned.  I note with satisfaction that the Taoiseach mentioned it more yesterday &mdash; three times on the one page &mdash; than at any time in the past 12 months, despite our repeated attempts at Question Time to have it made central to the resolution of the conflict.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember what is contained in the Joint Framework Document.  We talk about it, but may sometimes forget exactly what is involved.  Paragraph 13 of A New Framework for Agreement states:</P>
    <P>The two Governments will work together with the parties to achieve a comprehensive accommodation, the implementation of which would include interlocking and mutually supportive institutions across the three strands, including:</P>
    <P>(a)  structures within Northern Ireland (paragraphs 22 and 23) &mdash; to enable elected representatives in Northern Ireland to exercise shared administrative and legislative control over all those matters that can be agreed across both communities and which can most effectively and appropriately be dealt with at that level;</P>
    <P>(b)  North/South institutions (paragraphs 24-38) &mdash; with clear identity and purpose, to enable representatives of democratic institutions, North and South, to enter <Col N="958" /> into new, co-operative and constructive relationships; to promote agreement among the people of the island of Ireland; to carry out on a democratically accountable basis delegated executive, harmonising and consultative functions over a range of designated matters to be agreed; and to serve to acknowledge and reconcile the rights, identities and aspirations of the two major traditions; and</P>
    <P>(c)  East-West structures (paragraphs 39-49) &mdash; to enhance the existing basis for co-operation between the two Governments, and to promote, support and underwrite the fair and effective operation of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>That is the basis for the way forward. What progress is to be made in the proximity talks due to take place from 4-13 March on strand II?  How is it to be dealt with?  This matter was touched on by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs when he stated:</P>
    <P>There are also numerous other significant details which need to be resolved in advance of the launch of negotiations.  These are broadly grouped together under the rubric of &ldquo;the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda&rdquo; of such negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am keen to hear the Government's view on how it sees the strand II process advancing.</P>
    <P>I wish to take up a matter raised by my party leader on the Order of Business, that is, the role played by prisoners. My colleague, Deputy Ó Cúiv, returned yesterday from Britain where he visited a number of prisons.  The prisoners will play an essential role in finding a solution to the conflict, as they played a vital role in bringing about the ceasefire announced in August 1994. Rather than responding to this, easing the prison regime both on mainland Britain and Northern Ireland and providing for a release programme, as I praise the Irish Government for doing <Col N="959" />&mdash; I want it to recommence the programme as soon as the ceasefire is restored &mdash; the British Government has been bloody minded in its approach to prisoners, thereby damaging the peace process.  It should have responded in a generous manner by providing for early releases and relaxing the prison regime, but instead there has been a hardening of that regime and a refusal to respond to the guidance of the parole board on the issue of early releases.</P>
    <P>The harsh treatment of Paddy Kelly whose health has deteriorated because of the lack of proper medical care and who has still not been transferred to a hospital in the South or released does nothing to instil confidence in elements within the community and every Member of this House in the sincerity of the British Government in relation to the peace process.</P>
    <P>Time has been wasted because of the attitude adopted by the two Governments in the past 18 months, but particularly by the British Government.  Risks have been taken with the peace process. The IRA set off the bombs and although nothing can justify the murder and mayhem in London and the threat of continuing violence it is way past time for the democratic process to begin.  The negotiations should proceed to achieve a comprehensive settlement as laid out, in the best judgment of the two Governments, in the Joint Framework Document.  That should be the framework for the solution to this historic problem.</P>

      <P>In common with previous speakers, I welcome the joint communiqué issued yesterday by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. To everyone involved I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo;. This should be a day for rejoicing, but already people are indicating that they <Col N="960" /> may have reservations about the agreement. That is unfortunate.  We all appreciate that Sinn Féin will have to secure the agreement of the IRA before the peace process can be resumed, but that should not lead to any lengthy discussions or calls for clarification as happened after the Downing Street Declaration was published.  It should be done within a matter of days, not weeks or months.</P>
      <P>The IRA and Sinn Féin must know at this stage that they had a modicum of sympathy in this country during the course of the peace process, but once the bombs went off in Canary Wharf and Aldwych it soon melted away.  The public can become impatient with groups such as that unless they are seen to adopt a positive attitude.  The IRA and Sinn Féin depend on the goodwill and support of many people on this island.  The support that was forthcoming from extraordinary sections of the community during the course of the peace process melted away very quickly and it will not be forthcoming until they sit down and talk without any preconditions on any side.  They would be well advised to realise that there would be no sympathy for them, that they have a second chance and should take it.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major.  Two weeks ago I was critical of him.  We all appreciate that on this occasion he stood up to the Ulster Unionist Party, in particular to Mr. Trimble.  He deserves our gratitude and I hope he can carry it through. Their vote against him in the House of Commons on Monday shows his resolve in not giving in to their demands and we appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not have triumphalism from any side on the communiqué.  Let us not claim the Unionists have been faced down and, on the other hand, when the marching season again comes around the British should adopt a mature attitude and not allow Unionists to march through Nationalist areas.  We do not want similar scenes to those witnessed <Col N="961" /> last year on Garvaghy Road and elsewhere in the North which caused considerable resentment and anger, damaged community relations and the prospect of a lasting peace.  Let us have firmness on all sides.  We welcome the firmness shown by Mr. Major this week, it is a vast improvement on his attitude up to now.  Many of us were inclined to blame him for the breakdown of the peace process, but he has redeemed himself.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget the work done behind the scenes, particularly by John Hume.  An important meeting took place between the SDLP and the DUP in Northern Ireland last week which may have helped to resolve the impasse. There have been extraordinary changes in attitudes by people such as Dr. Paisley and I am sure John Hume played a major role in that.</P>
    <P>In my previous contribution on this matter I was generous in my praise of Gerry Adams and what he did during the 18 months of the peace process.  He is still a pivotal figure in the negotiations and the talks we expect to take place when Sinn Féin prevail on the IRA to resume the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the O'Brien family in Gorey, County Wexford.  I also praise them for the magnificent way in which they bore the brunt of their grief.  They denounced violence and refused to allow the IRA to dominate a sad occasion.  The father and mother deserve credit because they made people throughout the world, particularly in England, realise that the majority of us do not support violence or the IRA.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Deputy Burke raised the important question of the treatment of Irish people in English jails.  Mr. Major must ensure that those prisoners are treated like human beings and given fair play.  I recall the Tánaiste stating seven or eight months ago that conditions for IRA prisoners in English jails had worsened since the inception of the peace process.  That is inconceivable in a civilised country.  It smacks of vindictiveness and should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> If the British authorities are not prepared to address the matter, there is an onus on the Irish Government to request the human rights committee of the Council of Europe to carry out an investigation in the prisons.  While we do not want to come into conflict with the British, we must ensure that everybody is treated fairly and in a humane manner.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling of optimism on the island and I do not believe the IRA can resist the swell of support for this agreement. I ask the IRA and Sinn Féin to declare their support for the agreement in the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  We are all delighted that a date for all-party negotiations has been set and congratulate those involved in the communiqué.  Deputy Deasy referred to optimism, but people are still cautious, particularly having regard to the nature of the Sinn Féin responses.  An element of danger still exists, but it can be overcome. It was encouraging to hear the Tánaiste say the door is open for clarification. The initial responses illustrate that an open door is necessary.  Despite the optimism some 19 or 20 months ago, events did not unfold with the speed and generosity that was expected.  It is not surprising, therefore, that those wooed from their traditional violence to peaceful means will be cautious in a second courtship if matters are not clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sinn Féin is talking about preconditions and its lack of involvement in the proximity talks on the shape of an election.  I am sure everyone agrees that the Mitchell principles should be part of the agenda and the basis on which talks should proceed, but they contain a commitment to proceed with discussions on decommissioning immediately following the commencement of all-party negotiations. While decommissioning should be on the agenda, the purpose of the Mitchell commission was to bring about a parallel process.  Will the first item on <Col N="963" /> the agenda, following the commencement of all-party negotiations, bring us back to the decommissioning argument? In moving with great speed from centre to centre, Mitchell showed what can be done in a short time with intense commitment to an objective.  A similar urgency is required now.  When all sides &mdash; or as many as possible, depending on what happens in the meantime &mdash; sit down to negotiate I hope our lines are not firmly fixed on what we will accept in regard to decommissioning.  I hope we will examine some of the substantive issues in the interim.  There is an element of danger in setting deadlines. This was brought to my attention by prisoners and others in the republican movement who are committed to peace. Instead of setting deadlines we should ensure that the process moves on.  The Government should set up working parties which would concentrate not only on decommissioning and elections but also on the substantive negotiations which will follow.</P>
    <P>As democrats we may repudiate violence but this will not achieve peace on its own.  Many of the people committed to violence have sacrificed their lives for their objective, however misguided, and if the paramilitaries are to be won back to the path of peace we must prove that politics work.  It is not enough to have photocalls and visits, it must also be indicated that the negotiations which will follow will be substantive.  Progress must be made during the intervening period so as to ensure that the issues will be properly thrashed out in the talks.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing Deputy Ó Cuív's update on the prisoners issue. The only way one can ascertain the true position is by visiting the prisons.  The treatment of prisoners undermined the peace process.  We reported regularly on the situation and asked serious questions about the British Government's agenda, the reasons for the deterioration in the treatment of prisoners, whether there was a lack of sincerity on the other side and if it was trying to <Col N="964" /> humiliate prisoners.  If these were the questions asked by democrats one can only imagine the questions asked by people who are in direct conflict with the UK authorities.  If confidence is to be built and peace restored the UK authorities must move very quickly on this issue.</P>
    <P>We must also be realistic about what Sinn Féin can achieve in terms of the IRA.  I believe Sinn Féin as a party and certain sections within the IRA are committed to peace but it must be regarded by them as an honourable peace.  Much work needs to be done and the door must be kept open to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste who must immediately engage in negotiations at all political levels.  Consideration must also be given to other levels at which discussions could take place with Nationalists and Unionists.  If we are to solve the problem of republican and loyalist isolation we must bring them into the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the communiqué with cautious optimism.  I hope we can sustain it and prove that politics is the best way of achieving a political objective.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is somewhat ironic that I am speaking after Deputy Flaherty as both of us got some mention in the media last weekend for wearing green ribbons last Wednesday.  The journalist who ran with that story got the facts half right in that I had worn a white ribbon the previous day.  I am not sure if Deputy Flaherty did the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wore a green ribbon because of my strong feelings about the treatment of prisoners and its relevance to the entire process.  I compliment Deputy Flaherty, her colleagues and, in particular, Deputy Ó Cuív, for their tremendous work in highlighting the treatment of prisoners on both sides of the divide.  Deputy Ó Cuív will outline the up-to-date position on this issue in <Col N="965" /> his contribution.  There is at least one case on this side of the Border about which the Government could do something.</P>
      <P>Last weekend I participated in the massive display against violence by ordinary people in my home town.  The bombs at Canary Wharf and elsewhere in London shattered not only buildings and bodies but also the hopes and aspirations of all Irish people, particularly those living in Border areas.  During the 18 months of the ceasefire the cloud of violence under which I and many others had lived for most of our adult life was lifted.  People cherished the ceasefire and this is why people in the greater Dundalk area turned out in significant numbers last Sunday to show their abhorrence at the return to violence.</P>
      <P>The people in these marches called not only on the IRA to restore the ceasefire but also on all politicians to renew their efforts and bring a new impetus into the process.  As my party leader said in no uncertain terms last night, the general feeling was that not enough was done.  I do not say this in any party political way as it could equally be said about parties on this side of the House.  The main aim of politicians is to bring about peace on this island, it pervades all we do.  I live in a Border area which will never prosper properly until there is peace and stability on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my visits to the North in recent weeks I have been astounded at the way the landscape has changed and somewhat annoyed at the presence of members of the British army in every town and village.  I am not saying one should not be careful &mdash; the breakdown of the peace process obviously changes the situation &mdash; but I question why the British army should be deployed in these villages and towns given that there is no immediate danger in the North.  Its presence on the streets, together with the checkpoints in the South, were a stark reminder of the situation which obtained in the North for 25 years. Given that there has been no return to violence in the North I question <Col N="966" /> whether the deployment of British army troops on the streets is necessary at present.  Last November Fianna Fáil welcomed the communiqué put together by the two Governments. However, my party leader questioned whether the roadblock in the way of the process at that time was merely being pushed further down the road.  That disguised our private unease at that time. We would not say publicly that we were uneasy about it but we felt the problem had only been superficially patched up at that time; that is what appears to have happened.  There was a lack of follow through on that document by the two parties involved, particularly on the British side.  We all know what happened to the Mitchell report.</P>
    <P>In the communiqué issued yesterday both Governments apparently agreed that the resumption of ministerial dialogue with Sinn Féin and that party's participation in negotiations required the restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.  The Taoiseach said afterwards that this was the only precondition to Sinn Féin's participation in these negotiations.  Will there be any other preconditions?  From my reading of the document, if Sinn Féin is to participate in ministerial dialogue and in negotiations the restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994 is required.  Perhaps someone on the Government side can tell me whether that is an absolute guarantee.</P>
    <P>If what the Taoiseach said last night is the case if all that is required to allow Sinn Féin into the process again is for the IRA to call a ceasefire, then what was the last 18 months about?  This could have been done much earlier than now.  Will all the roadblocks that were removed on the basis of the permanence of the ceasefire, the decontamination period; the elective body and &mdash; biggest of all &mdash; the decommissioning process, be erected again?</P>
    <P>Decommissioning is, in my opinion, a Unionist agenda.  It was, surprisingly enough, a middle class Unionist agenda and came from those who, while involved in politics, were not directly <Col N="967" /> involved in the strife.  Mr. Billy Hutchinson was quite adamant on &ldquo;Counterpoint&rdquo; last night that the decommissioning issue was nonsense not only from their point of view but from the IRA's point of view and that all it was doing was putting back any possibility of moving forward.  Will this sentence in the communiqué cause difficulty in the future?  Will the British Government say that Sinn Féin can join the negotiations if the ceasefire is put in place, but then want to know whether it is permanent? Will it want decommissioning to take place?  I would like to hear the Government's opinion on that.</P>
    <P>The coming together of the two Governments has kept the peace process going.  Fianna Fáil was very much to the fore in achieving this over the past five years.  Some years ago Deputies would not meet any of our counterparts in the House of Commons, and, due to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, and other such contacts, there is a much better understanding between the Governments, between politicians from this House and politicians from the House of Commons. There is a much better understanding of the difficulties involved.  The perceptions that dogged British-Irish relations and the two Governments have been proof of that also.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have come together but, unfortunately, the necessary dynamic was missing for the past year because we were subject to 15 minute or half hourly telephone calls between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  It was obvious to those on this side of the House that relations were not good.  That led to wrong signals being sent culminating in the debacle of putting the Mitchell report into the bin.  It was admitted by Mr. Mates last night on television, and by other British Government representatives, that this was badly handled; it was not made clear to the general public that the British Government was not in fact binning the Mitchell report, that it <Col N="968" /> was accepting it.  There was an acknowledgement by the British side, no later than last night, that that issue was badly handled.</P>
    <P>Much of the difficulty arose because of what went on in the telephone conversation between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister the night before the Mitchell report was published and the fact that the Tánaiste, when speaking on the radio that day, did not know what the British Prime Minister had decided.  If I remember correctly, the Tánaiste said the British Prime Minister would not mention elections when he went into the House of Commons later that afternoon, when, in fact, the Prime Minister did the very opposite.  He binned the Mitchell report and in the House of Commons said that there would be elections.  That caused difficulty in the whole process.</P>
    <P>The major dynamic in the peace process has always been what is disparagingly called the pan-Nationalist front which we regard as a Nationalist consensus, with Sinn Féin, the SDLP, and the greater body of Nationalist Ireland coming together in one group.  Anyone who participated in that was aware that they would be required to compromise on their ideals and aspirations at some time, but that was the major dynamic which brought about this peace process. However, when I asked the Taoiseach on a number of occasions whether he saw himself as leader of that group, as leader of Nationalist Ireland, I was treated to a lecture about our obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  I was annoyed &mdash; the rules of this House do not permit people to react &mdash; but there is no doubt that the attitude of the Taoiseach, and his attitude when he refused to meet John Hume and Gerry Adams, gave all the wrong signals.  That was when it became obvious to those of us looking on, not only Fianna Fáil but those in the prisons, those in the North and those directly involved in the IRA that the wrong signals were going out.</P>
    <P>The last Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, led from the front.  This comes back to <Col N="969" /> the British policy of divide and conquer, which they have used throughout Irish history.  Unfortunately, the two Governments were divided and efforts were surreptitiously made to divide the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  Most important, an effort was made to divide the Nationalist consensus and this was successful for some time.</P>
    <P>I mentioned two dynamics in that process, but there is no Unionist dynamic.  We have heard nothing from unionism except that they want to retain the <i>status quo,</i> with or without violence. That was clear in Mr. Trimble's document recently in which he more or less threw out the three strand process. something Unionists were linked to for many years.  In effect, he said that Strand II of the process was not important.</P>
    <P>The release of prisoners is a confidence building measure, a two-way process. Deputy Ó Cuív was correct in describing it as such this morning.</P>
    <P>Regarding the South, I want to mention a prisoner, Patrick Duffy from Dundalk, who is in prison for a very serious crime.  A number of years after he was incarcerated he broke all his ties with the Provisional IRA and has turned over a new leaf.  A number of hours before the Canary Wharf bomb he was to be released.  He had his bags packed and his relations were to collect him, but when the bombs exploded he was immediately told that he would lose all the benefits he had previously gained.  I immediately contacted my party leader to make the point that the Irish Government's attitude to him was wrong.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, many of the benefits have since been restored.  However, last week he wanted to go to Belfast in connection with a custody application in regard to access to his children, in respect of whom he is fighting a European Court case.  He was not allowed to go, even though he was allowed to do so during the ceasefire.  I ask that some consideration be given in that regard because it is acknowledged by the prison authorities and by the Provisional IRA that <Col N="970" /> this man has nothing to do with it.  Perhaps the Minister would take that on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. When we last spoke about Northern Ireland in this House, there was a mood of frustration and despair.  Those most intimately involved in the peace process faced the prospect of three years of hard work ending in failure.  It is a testament to their commitment and ability that we have pulled back from the abyss.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in particluar are to be congratulated.  The Tánaiste's work in this area spans many years, and I am extremely proud of his contribution. Others have played their part too.  Deputy Ahern's speech in the last debate has rightly been assessed as a major speech for a leader of his party. He is to be commended for making it when he did.</P>
      <P>My hope is that we are now entering a new stage in the peace process, but we cannot afford to be too congratulatory. We have all seen how fragile the peace is.  Our job now is to recreate the momentum which makes a further return to violence impossible.  This, of course, presupposes that the IRA will re-establish the ceasefire.  It must do so, it never had justification for ending it, but even in its own terms, the excuses at that time have been rendered invalid. There are no guarantees, but there never are in politics.  My instinct is that Sinn Féin is prepared to argue its cause in this context and the IRA must let it do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have already remarked on various aspects of the communiqué. I have my views on the merits of many of them, but I see no point in articulating them.  Each aspect outlined yesterday represents a proposal from one of the parties to the peace process. It was important that the Irish and British Governments take these proposals on board.  To do otherwise would have led to alienation of a particular party. <Col N="971" /> The situation which both Governments arrived at places the onus firmly on the politicians of Northern Ireland to devise their own formula for the solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>The case to be made now is a simple one.  It is a matter of politics with a small &ldquo;p&rdquo;.  No party to the dialogue between 4-13 March can expect to achieve all its ends.  All must be prepared to compromise.</P>
    <P>For us, compromise is the essence of politics.  It is the difference between sustaining democracy and its demise.  We, in this House, all hold different political positions, but we remain wedded to one goal &mdash; the service of the people we represent. For some people compromise and accommodation are undesirable and, no doubt, we all feel like that at times.  In this State, there is no government without accommodation between respective political positions.</P>
    <P>We tend to take this for granted, but we forget that it is a political culture unique in these islands.  In Britain, the &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo; electoral system, rightly or wrongly, creates winners and losers.  In Northern Ireland politics at an internal level have never been conducted along similar lines to those in the Republic.  Recent years, however, have seen the welcome development of cross-party agreement in local government, particularly between the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists and the same is true in Britain.  However, the dominant political culture is one of winner takes all.</P>
    <P>This factor can explain some of our current difficulties.  When Unionists and, to a lesser extent, the British adopt a public position, Nationalists tend to view it as a negotiating position.  Often, it is not.  Similarly, the Unionists tend to view the refusal of Nationalists and the Irish Government to publicly declare their bottom line prior to negotiation as underhanded.  The classic example is the debate about Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.  We are prepared to make alterations to them but, because we will <Col N="972" /> not do so unilaterally or declare the precise nature of the changes we can accept, Unionists doubt our bona fides.</P>
    <P>The strength of the position adopted by the two Governments yesterday is that they represent a challenge to all parties.  All must be prepared to move if peace is to be secured.</P>
    <P>For Sinn Féin the challenge is clear &mdash; the abandonment of the option of the gun.  It is a fundamental choice.  I heard Deputy Harney express regret last night that the initial reaction from Sinn Féin was disappointing, but it is too early to tell.  Media reports have not yet been able to pin down the exact balance of power within that organisation since the breakdown of the ceasefire.  In these circumstances it is wrong to expect a speedy response from Sinn Féin.  Let us be clear that if Sinn Féin is unable to convince the IRA that the communiqué is the basis on which to move forward in a non-violent fashion, it is faced with the choice of whether to be a political party.  It is also letting down the people who have been spoken of here on many occasions during this and the last debate, the prisoners.  If they are not at the table to argue the cause of the prisoners, who will do so?</P>
    <P>For Unionists the challenge is just as clear.  It is about putting fears about their future and their grievances about the past to one side to enable them to secure that future.  It will involve the dilution of their current position, but any agreement they arrive at will be all the more secure for the consent to it of the other community in the North. There are signs that the necessary confidence in the Unionist community is developing.  The consistent and clear line taken throughout the ceasefire by the UDP and the PUP has been and continues to be very encouraging.  I am confident that the same potential and courage resides with the UUP also.</P>
    <P>It is now up to the parties in Northern Ireland to determine the process.  I know I speak for all Members when I <Col N="973" /> say that we will do everything to facilitate them.  The adage that peace threatens no one is true.  All sides to the conflict have an interest in seeing it end. However, peace challenges everyone. The Governments have played their part and any doubts about their collective determination to carry this process forward were removed yesterday.  The ball is now in the Northern parties' court.  I urge them to run with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>All who participated last Sunday in the peace marches throughout Ireland sent a clear and unambiguous message to politicians and participants in the peace process which ended to some degree when bombs exploded in London.  The people of this island, North and South, of all political and religious persuasions, demand that the peace process get under way and that peace be achieved with a negotiated settlement between all the parties, if possible.</P>
      <P>We have had the clearest demonstration in this country since the foundation of the State that peace should be the most important part of our agenda. We have tasted the fruits of 18 months of peace and we do not want to see it slide away.  The IRA, through its spokesman in Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, claims:</P>
      <P>The absence of negotiations led to the breakdown.  The commencement of negotiations therefore provides the way forward.  Any new process must contain copperfastened and unambiguous public assurances that all-party talks will be initiated by both Governments at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Dates and timetables have been agreed by both Governments.  All-party negotiations will commence on 10 June and multilateral consultations commencing on 4 March must be completed by 13 March.  If there is not agreement, legislation will be introduced and there will be an election to select the negotiators who will attend the all-party talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> The secretary of Sinn Féin, Mr. Martin McGuinness, gave a guarded welcome on &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; to what has been agreed by both Governments.  Hopefully Sinn Féin will enter into negotiations. The president of Sinn Féin said the absence of negotiations led to the breakdown in the ceasefire.  This is not similar to the breakdown in negotiations which may occur in industrial relations. The IRA set off bombs in England with disastrous consequences.  The sad sight of the funeral in Gorey yesterday brought home to everyone what the breakdown in the ceasefire means. Nobody wants a return to violence and it is incumbent on us all to do what is necessary to achieve peace.</P>
    <P>The British co-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body accepted that there was delay and a lack of urgency over the past 18 months.  If that was the Justification for the return to violence, a reason we cannot accept, it has now been removed.  Bombs kill, delays do not.  There is no evidence of delay on the part of the Government or the Opposition.  Every Friday people met in the Forum and all opinions were canvassed.  There were discussions with various groups every week.</P>
    <P>A date for all-party talks is being offered to Sinn Féin and the IRA.  We saw the peace demonstrations last Sunday and we earnestly hope everyone will meet the deadlines and return to the peace we experienced for 18 months which brought such benefit to communities North and South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the agreement between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister set out in the communiqué, particularly the date for all-party negotiations.  While it is not the time to be critical, it is fair to ask why it took so long for this to happen.  There is a duty on both sovereign Governments not to be held to ransom and I hope the date will be adhered to.  There is an obligation on all parties to ensure progress is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the negotiations in South Africa which led to the establishment of <Col N="975" /> a national government with black people and white people, Mr. de Klerk stated at the Forum that it was important not to allow a political vacuum to develop.  He and President Mandela addressed all the issues and crossed hurdles as they arose.</P>
    <P>The British Government, with its demands, preconditions and excuses, is mainly responsible for the long delay. All members have condemned the violence of recent weeks.  It cannot be justified. People want a permanent end to violence and inclusive talks held with those who are not committed to violence as the way forward.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the way communiques are agreed.  On 28 November and again yesterday meetings were held late in the night and telephone calls were made all day, racing against the deadline.  I would prefer the two Governments to do their business in a better way.</P>
    <P>The part played by my party in Government is well documented but since coming to Opposition Deputy Ahern has played a very responsible role.  He met people in an effort to ensure the door was open to anyone who could influence the IRA and persuade them to return to a ceasefire.</P>
    <P>There has been a bipartisan approach to this issue in the House but it is the duty of the Opposition to offer constructive criticism where necessary.  I was disappointed when the chairman of the Fine Gael Party, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Wednesday, attacked those who were critical of the Government and said they were working to a Sinn Féin agenda.  I replied to that on Saturday, 24 February.  It is positively unhelpful to attack people who, in this House and outside it, condemned violence time and again.  It was wrong of the chairman of the Fine Gael Party, who was no doubt representing his party, to launch into such an attack not only on Members of the House but on the media.</P>
    <P>We did not hear about the framework <Col N="976" /> document for 18 months, which was unfortunate because both the Downing Street Declaration and the framework document were positive commitments by the two Governments to make the desired progress.  Paragraph 10 of the framework document &ldquo;A New Framework For Agreement&rdquo;, in referring to the two Governments, states:</P>
    <P>They take as guiding principles for their co-operation in search of this agreement:</P>
    <P>(i)  the principle of self-determination, as set out in the Joint Declaration;</P>
    <P>(ii)  that the consent of the governed is an essential ingredient for stability in any political arrangement;</P>
    <P>(iii)  that agreement must be pursued and established by exclusively democratic, peaceful means, without resort to violence or coercion;</P>
    <P>(iv)  that any new political arrangements must be based on full respect for, and protection and expression of, the rights and identities of both traditions in Ireland and even-handedly afford both communities in Northern Ireland parity of esteem and treatment, including equality of opportunity and advantage.</P>
    <P>We all subscribe to paragraph 10, but why has there been no reference to it in the last 18 months?  I was very pleased it was referred to in paragraph 6 of yesterday's communiqué.</P>
    <P>It is time for generosity from all political parties on this island.  There must be a commitment by all parties to make worthwhile progress.  It is important that the three strands are addressed.  In the past 12 months there has been a tendency, particularly for the Ulster Unionist Party, supported by the British Government, to sideline Strand II dealing with North-South structures.  It is very important that all elements in the three strands be addressed, and that will <Col N="977" /> take generosity from all sides.  In fairness to John Hume and the SDLP in particular, they have shown generosity during the past 30 years, but there has not been a positive constructive move forward by the Unionist parties.  I hope, now that a date has been set for meaningful negotiations, they will address the issues involved.</P>
    <P>If agreement is not reached there is an obligation on sovereign Governments to take the necessary action to proceed.  The people want an end to violence.  They want a just and lasting peace.  That was demonstrated very effectively by the marches last Sunday. As representatives of the people, we are aware they want an end to violence immediately.  A sovereign Government should not allow itself to be held to ransom by a small number of people, whether elected or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have expressed reservations about elections.  I am concerned that the two major Unionist parties will compete with each other to see which one will go furthest back into the trench.  I am not sure what mandate they would receive from an election.  Elections are not necessary.  Everybody, even the children in the street, knows that all-party negotiations should include all constitutional parties, Sein Féin and political parties of the paramilitary loyalists, as long they accept an end to violence and the democratic way forward.  Those objectives are very well encapsulated in the six principles laid down in the Mitchell report.</P>
    <P>Last night the leader of our party referred to the significance of paragraph 9 of the communiqué which is in the Taoiseach's name only.  Perhaps that matter will be referred to in reply to the debate.  Another point which is probably of no great significance but which is worthy of comment is that the communiqué refers in some paragraphs to all-party negotiations and in others to substantive all-party negotiations.  Is there any significance in the use of the word &ldquo;substantive&rdquo; in certain paragraphs?</P>
    <P>On the question of elections, whatever process is used, a decision should <Col N="978" /> be made on the number of people representing each party.  It would be a disaster if the majority of those elected were Unionists.  That would not be a recipe for a way forward in negotiations and would not constitute a legislative assembly.  It must be spelled out that there cannot be constitutional change without the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland.  Elections such as those held in other parts of Europe, and the rules of democracy that apply throughout the European Union would not operate effectively in Northern Ireland.  If they did, we would not be here week after week debating this matter.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the positive approach by the British Prime Minister to the Mitchell report &mdash; there is reference to that in paragraph 12 of the communiqué. That report offers a way forward. The six principles laid down therein are very constructive and should be subscribed to by everybody.  Mitchell put forward the desired solution for all-party talks on decommissioning where there would be neither winners nor losers.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed about prisoners, particularly in Britain.  I appreciate the work the Government is doing in that regard.  I hope there is an immediate ceasefire so that it will be possible for the Government to release the nine prisoners who had their bags packed ready for release when the bomb exploded in Canary Wharf.</P>
    <P>There is much work to be done and all politicians must work together.  I pay tribute to some of the British politicians, particularly Peter Temple-Morris, co-leader of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, who took a legitimate stand and was unfairly criticised for it. I represent two Ulster counties and, as Deputy Boylan is aware, the people in my constituency were appalled at the return to IRA violence.  They want an immediate resumption of the ceasefire. While addressing political issues is fundamental and must be our prime concern, we must be aware of the economic <Col N="979" /> and social aspects, particularly in Border areas, arising from the political problems on this island.  Given that we have this great opportunity to move forward, I hope all parties will do so, thereby bringing lasting peace.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice for what was achieved yesterday. I also congratulate the leaders of all the main political parties for acting responsibly. Nobody tried to play party politics with this serious issue.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago in this Chamber I called on people in the North, the South and England to march for peace and to let politicians know how they felt.  I thank the people who marched for peace last Saturday and Sunday.  They sent a clear message to the politicians. They also sent a message to the gunmen, that they do not want to see violence here again.</P>
      <P>I hope Ed O'Brien's death will be the last one from violence here or in England.  I congratulate his family for the way they handled it and their condemnation of violence.  His mother and father, under very difficult circumstances, sent out a good message on behalf of this country and did it a great service.  I compliment them for doing that in their hour of grief.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate John Major for his contribution to the peace process.  Other political leaders might not have been as brave as he was, particularly last weekend when facing a vital vote.  He did not make deals with the Unionists or anybody else and he must be complimented. He is a brave leader and has shown he is committed to the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was great the Taoiseach was able to announce yesterday evening that a date has been set for all-party talks.  The <Col N="980" /> people welcomed that with open arms, including the people of County Mayo. Some newspaper reporters seem to think the people of Mayo do not have a global perspective, but that is not true. The peace process concerns the people in County Mayo as it concerns people in the North and in Border areas.  We do not want to see one life lost in the name of Ireland.  Through the years County Mayo has suffered a loss of population through emigration.  Many Mayo people who earn their living in England have had to deal with attacks from the British public when bombs have been detonated in London.  It is hard to blame the British public for being angry when innocent people suffer as a result of bombings.</P>
    <P>It was wonderful to hear that 10 June has been set for all-party talks.  The people are happy today.  They believe representatives of all parties will sit down around the table to discuss this serious situation.</P>
    <P>I ask Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness to use their powers to convince the people who control the IRA that we want the peace process back on line and an announcement in the next few days that it has been reinstated.  The people reacted last weekend and will react again if there is more violence in the name of Ireland.  I say to those hidden people who do not represent anybody that we do not want anybody to die in our name, that 99.9 per cent of the people here do not want violence.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate and hope it will not take another situation like this before we again have a debate on Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland should be discussed on a quarterly basis. We should discuss progress, and show we are as concerned about it as everybody else.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the main political leaders who have acted responsibly. The Taoiseach should keep up the good work.  The people responded last weekend and they will respond again.  Thousands of small marches are being organised in villages and towns throughout <Col N="981" /> the country by people saying they do not want to see a bomb being detonated here, in England or elsewhere in the name of Ireland.  I compliment all those involved in the peace process.  It is great to see people smiling today.  Their message that we do not want violence in this or any other land must be sent to the men of violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ring, for sharing his time with me.  Coming from a Border area I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to join in the good wishes and congratulations extended to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and to the British Prime Minister, John Major, on the joint communiqué issued yesterday. The announcement of 10 June for all-party talks is a major breakthrough.  We have been waiting for that date to be set for some time and it was not easy to reach agreement on it.  There were many difficulties, but we have achieved a goal that was set.</P>
      <P>This is a particularly difficult time and when the history of this period is written, the role played by Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach will be recognised. He has been statesmanlike, courageous and has shown leadership to our people. He did not lose his nerve.  He was not blown off the tracks by the men of violence.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that by and large the leaders of the main Opposition parties acted extremely responsibly, but that is what we would expect from democratically elected people.  This matter affects all the country and valid criticism is right and proper.  The role played by the former Taoiseach at a particularly difficult time was less than I expected from him.  If he considers he has a role to play in private, he is entitled to play it, but when private meetings are held in the full glare of television cameras, a question mark hangs over what he was trying to do.  It was not helpful.  He should step aside and leave it to the people involved to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has shown leadership <Col N="982" /> and courage.  A date has been set for all-party talks.  People of all shades of opinion in Northern Ireland must grasp this opportunity to come together and talk this problem through.  It will not be easy.  Being close to the situation I know what is involved.  I know how feelings run and while people are entitled to their beliefs, they must recognise all shades of opinion and that there is a place for everyone.  If people of all shades of opinion in the Border counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Louth can live together, surely the same can happen in the six counties of Northern Ireland.  People with strong beliefs who have adopted deep-rooted positions will have to give ground.  The men of violence must not be given another opportunity to repeat what happened three weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I fully support what Deputy Michael Ring said about the loss of life in this country.  Far too many young lives have been wasted.  A young man from Wexford, Ed O'Brien, was sucked in by ruthless men, cowards, brutal people who would not do the dastardly act, but used an innocent young person to do it for them.  That should be a warning to parents and families to ensure that young people do not become involved in violence. We are dealing with a small number of ruthless people who would waste an innocent life.  Perhaps out of the tragic loss of that young life good will come.  People whose views might be slightly shaded have had their eyes opened in no uncertain way by the manner in which the family, who were not remotely aware of his involvement, found out how their son had lost his life. Last weekend thousands took to the streets to march for peace and in every town and village people wearing the white ribbons carried the message of peace.  Irish people want peace and I do not think we can allow the opportunity being presented to slip.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has a role to play in convincing the IRA to restart the ceasefire and, having denounced the men of violence and stated categorically that there <Col N="983" /> is no going back to violence, to negotiate its way through the problem.  I do not mind how long it takes because once people are talking they are not killing each other.  The process will take time. It was wrong of some Opposition Deputies to say that nothing happend in the past 18 months.  That shows gross ignorance and a total unawareness of the progress being made on the ground, where it must all start.  Political decisions may be taken but if people cannot come together to work out their problems, the political decisions will be for nought.  The people must work together in harmony and I know for a fact that it was happening.  In the Border region, the roads in areas that were cut off from their hinterland in Armagh, Fermanagh and Tyrone were being reopened and all that remained to be reopened was the Aughalance Bridge in Belturbet, County Cavan.  That may not be very important to the majority of Members, but it is very important to the people of Cavan and Fermanagh.  This major link was cut off as a result of the bombings of Belturbet and it was the excuse the British Government needed to blow up that major link on the national primary route, N3.  Plans were well ahead for the restoration of the road and the rebuilding of the bridge but with the bombing at Canary Wharf they were put in abeyance.  I hope it will be possible to take a step forward and commence rebuilding that bridge.</P>
    <P>For the first time in 25 years people from the North felt free to go shopping and visit friends in the Republic and <i>vice versa.</i> People from the Border counties felt free to visit Enniskillen, which is within 30 miles of their home. The free movement of people was taking place, people were getting to know each other and economic development was picking up.  Cross-Border groups were being set up and were working on joint projects.  I am involved in two North-South development projects but the reason I cannot mention them publicly is that others may get the same idea.  People are working together to <Col N="984" /> develop the region and that is progress. For some Members to say that nothing has happened in the past 18 months is untrue.  Progress was being made.  The people can leave it in the safe hands of the Taoiseach because he is a man to be trusted.  The day of nod and wink politics is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very important debate.  I wish to correct one point Deputy Boylan made.  Nobody on this side of the House suggested at any time that nothing happened in the past 18 months.  What was said was that the pace of progress at the highest political level was too slow and that a vacuum would develop &mdash; as it did &mdash; which would lead to further difficulties.  That is a reflection of the frustration that all Members and people beyond this House felt in the past 18 months.  I have heard my party colleagues, from the Border regions in particular, speak eloquently about the progress on the ground and this was reflected by the peace marches last weekend.  We have to listen to the people.  The people who most want peace are those on the ground whom we purport to represent and I hope that politicians in this House and in the House of Commons will listen.</P>
      <P>I welcome the central tenet of the communiqué, the achievement of all-party negotiations without further pre-conditions on 10 June.  If this had not been included in the communiqué no doubt we would not be standing here today speaking with some optimism about the possibility of the restoration of the ceasefire.  Let me emphasise that it is all-party negotiations and not all-party talks.  The word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; has a resonance that words such as &ldquo;talks&rdquo; do not have.  I understand this to mean a substantial beginning of a negotiated settlement on the future of Northern Ireland.  That is what people had required in the past months to be set in train and I am happy that with the convergence of issues this has come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subscribe to the insightful views <Col N="985" /> expressed by my party leader in the past weeks and months.  The calmness and sensitivity of his contributions has been extremely important during this period.</P>
    <P>Some days after the bombing at Canary Wharf I said I was somewhat disappointed at the response in the European Union to the breakdown of the ceasefire and to the peace process. I am not diminishing for a moment the importance of the European Union's financial role and the substantial benefits that have been derived from funds for the Border regions.  However, I do not believe that is enough in itself.  If our colleagues in Europe believe that their only responsibility is to provide funding, they are sadly mistaken.  We need their help and involvement to deal with this problem.  It is as a result of our involvement in the European Union that I believe the EU has a more direct and public role to play in helping us put this process together again so that it leads to constant and consistent substantive negotiations after 10 June 1996.</P>
    <P>It is clear that once the process begins it will not be concluded within a matter of weeks or months.  It will necessitate travelling a long, difficult road and involve a substantial amount of time to achieve an ultimate settlement broadly acceptable to all communities living on this island.  Within that context there must be brought to the fore greater awareness, empathy and passion <i>vis-à-vis</i> the pain and suffering endured over the past 25 years.  The Government is uniquely placed to so ensure since we shall assume the Presidency of the European Union for the second half of this year.  Because of the timing of that Presidency and the substantive all-party negotiations, a senior European figure must be designated to be publicly and directly involved and committed in ensuring that this peace process succeeds.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have witnessed special funding provided on the strength of the ceasefire diffuse in the sense that it emanates from different Commissioners and regions.  Therefore, to some extent, its impact on the public <Col N="986" /> generally is lost and they are not aware of Europe's commitment to the successful outcome of the peace process.  I should like to see our Government push for the direct involvement of some senior European figure to take on an ambassadorial-type role so that Europe would assume some responsibility and be answerable at the highest levels to the Governments of all member states, somebody who would keep a finger on the pulse of developments in the evolvement of the peace process, who would be aware of what is happening at all times.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly many difficulties will be encountered along the way.  At the point at which we are confronted by such difficulties it will be important that there be substantive external influence by Europe and the United States in helping to break the inevitable log jams that will occur.  Because of our Presidency of the European Union later this year our Government is uniquely placed to put that issue on the agenda.</P>
    <P>It will be sufficiently difficult for our Government to maintain a watchful eye on Northern Ireland along with honouring its responsibilities and administrative role during its Presidency.  Whatever arrangements the Government makes for its internal dynamics, it should place on the agenda the appointment of a specific European person of the calibre required in these delicate negotiations, who would be listened to, would keep his finger continuously on the pulse of developments as they evolve in this peace process and report back directly to the European Commission and Heads of Government.</P>
    <P>I hope my comments and suggestions will be taken into account by the Government and by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, so that an eminent European figure could directly be involved in closely monitoring developments.</P>
    <P>No doubt the time will come when pump-priming of economic projects in Northern Ireland and the Border regions can be juxta-positioned to push the peace process forward, instilling <Col N="987" /> confidence in the negotiators on all sides and ensuring the maximum pressure is brought to bear, internally and externally, leaving no vacuum through any lack of incentive or encouragement from any quarter. We must avail of friends and allies in all quarters in our efforts to bring this process &mdash; no matter how long it may take &mdash; to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the lack of reaction within the European Union. I am convinced that within the peace process there is a role for Europe &mdash; perhaps not yet defined &mdash; and specifically for some European personage.</P>
    <P>Like everybody, I watched and listened to various television and radio programmes last evening in order to pick up the nuances of what was being said generally, in an attempt to ascertain from where people were coming, where they might be going and to assess the prospects for the restoration of the ceasefire. I heard much hopeful and encouraging comment.  I sincerely hope that the bottom line is encapsulated in the Taoiseach's remark that it is the restoration of the ceasefire that is required to bring Sinn Féin into the process and that no other issues will be included.</P>
    <P>I listened with very great disappointment to Mr. David Wiltshire, MP, last evening speak about this process; whether people take him seriously or not is another matter.  Within the context and sensitivities of the climate in which all of these discussions take place, it behoves all of us to acknowledge and understand that his type of remark is very damaging, particularly when one seeks to bring all those involved, from the centre and periphery, into a process with very many inherent difficulties.  It would be very easy for Members of this House on all sides to express trenchant views or misgivings in the manner in which he did but we have all rightly resisted that temptation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to contrast Mr. Wiltshire's reactions with those of other British politicians like Mr. Peter Temple-Morris, MP, and others who <Col N="988" /> have had a long and direct involvement in Northern Ireland affairs. Those British politicians with a long involvement in Northern Ireland affairs over many years have become aware of and alerted to the sensitivities, the nuances, the manner in which their words can be interpreted or, more importantly, misinterpreted. I very much regret that Mr. David Wiltshire expressed the sort of views he did on international television last evening, creating innumerable new road blocks of no benefit whatsoever to the successful initiation of the talks on Monday next, leading eventually to all-party negotiations on 10 June.</P>
    <P>We all have a role to play and a duty to be sensitive, acutely aware of the dangers, pitfalls and many difficulties.  It is my hope that this most recent joint communiqué, the key achievement of which is the convening of all-party negotiations on 10 June next, in itself will be sufficient to bring Sinn Féin back into the fold and restore the ceasefire.  I want to see Sinn Féin involved in the talks from Monday next to discuss what type of elective process might be devised, which will be very difficult.  I would have enormous misgivings about the prospects of elections in Northern Ireland, as I would in any country where the beginning of a process included the holding of an election which might more readily be held after a settlement had been reached. Nonetheless it appears we will have some form of an elective process.  The system devised and adopted must be one which will allow all parties, particularly the smaller ones who have a role to play, to gain sufficient support to participate as full, rightful negotiators on 10 June next. That is crucial and Sinn Féin has a role to play, by way of direct involvement from Monday next, in deciding what form that elective process should take. It is in its interest and in the interest of all parties to be directly involved.  It is interesting to note the way in which the PUP and the other smaller loyalist parties in Northern Ireland have reacted. They want to get into negotiations and to see the process up and running. <Col N="989" /> Because of this communiqué all party negotiations will begin on 10 June.  I hope Sinn Féin will be able to satisfactorily persuade those hard men in the IRA that the gun and the bullet must be taken out of Irish politics. The only way forward is through the democratic process which has now been offered to all concerned.  I look forward, as most people do, to the urgent reinstatement of the ceasefire and to getting on with the real aims that have to be achieved on a long and difficult road.</P>

      <P>The Downing Street communiqué opens a window of opportunity to get the peace process back on the rails.  It is for all parties to rise to the challenge and take advantage of that opportunity.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency to focus on the position of the IRA and Sinn Féin but in dealing with them there is a double challenge.  They sought all party talks and will get them.  They sought a date for those talks and got it.  Then comes the easiest challenge.  In order to be involved they must renounce violence. There is no support for violence. They do not have a mandate for killing and do not represent anybody in what they are doing.  It is time the bullet, the bomb and the coffin are taken out of politics and consigned to history.  That is the immediate challenge facing the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Martin McGuinness talks about Sinn Féin being a second class party with a second class mandate, I say it is not a second class party but it certainly has a second class mandate while the IRA continues with violence.  Sinn Féin, I think, can convince the IRA to renounce violence and do it quickly, but the medium term challenge to accept the principle of consent and the Mitchell report will present the greatest difficulty. It is not a pre-condition to entering negotiations, but as John <Col N="990" /> Major said it will be the first item on the agenda on 10 June.  All participants will need to make clear at the beginning of those negotiations on 10 June their total commitment to the principles of democracy and non violence, set out in the Mitchell report.  That will be the real hurdle for Sinn Féin.  It will have to address that issue now and be prepared to accept that there will be no progress in talks without that commitment.</P>
    <P>In many ways the biggest challenge will be to the Unionists who have a majority in Northern Ireland but not on the island.  The Nationalists have a majority on the island but not in Northern Ireland.  The challenge facing Nationalists, North and South, will be to accept that in the first strand there will be an assembly in Northern Ireland, a constitutional guarantee of the Union and the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  While the Unionists will get a copperfastened guarantee with regard to not changing the constitutional status of Northern Ireland while the majority in Northern Ireland wish for that, they will have to be prepared to accept there was a history of discrimination and repression of Nationalist aspirations and they will have to accept Strand II &mdash; the North-South dimension to the settlement. They do not like the framework document but it is difficult to see any agreement in relation to Strand II that will not be too far away from the prescription set out in the framework document.</P>
    <P>The loyalists have risen to the challenge so far and I ask them to continue. There is also a challenge for the UK which will have to be impartial and be seen to be impartial.  It will have to practice the politics of persuasion, not for a united Ireland but for peace and progress. There is an inevitable tendency to put things off in people who have to face difficult decisions.  It will be up to the UK to persuade people towards progress in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The second major challenge to the UK is that it must leave aside consideration of domestic UK politics.  It cannot play around with the Northern Ireland <Col N="991" /> peace process.  There was some suggestion of that in the context of the debate on the Scott report.  Northern Unionists might think wryly of the old complaint of Nationalists that the UK tended to follow the principle of divide and conquer. When we see the different positions of the DUP and the Ulster Unionists on the Scott report, perhaps they might find some analogies there.  It was with great satisfaction we saw Mr. Major put all that aside in coming to a decision on Wednesday.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the two Governments work together.  It was counter productive when they did not work together.  There is now a solid working relationship and that will help to lead to the political solution we seek.  We will have a ceasefire.  We will have a decision on election legislation and finally we will have all party talks.</P>
    <P>If there have been solutions in Bosnia and in other parts of the world, if intractable problems in South Africa have been resolved and if the age old feud between Nagorny-Karabakh and the Armenians is now being settled surely we can have a solution here.  If everybody is committed and prepared to rise to the challenges I have outlined then a solution will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come a long way since 1969.  Never before have the people of Ireland been given the opportunity to sit down together to work out our future.  It is a long time since I first spoke in this House on Northern Ireland.  In the early days my voice was a strange sounding one.  Many people now see things as I see them.  I am grateful that the violence of the past 25 years &mdash; God knows, we do not want more given that 3,000 are dead, 30,000 maimed and billions of pounds have been wasted &mdash; has taught the people, North and South, that violence does not pay and we must now seek to build a new society.  We must stop looking at the road blocks and blaming other people for our inadequacies.  All parties have a role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> The foundations of the different parties in this State must be a thing of the past.  The people of Ireland are no longer interested in history or how they got here.  What they have been saying at the weekend is that they want peace, and a political settlement now.  If I read correctly what the people have been saying, we in the Republic are saying to the Northern community we will constitutionally guarantee any fair arrangement worked out between both communities in the North.  No future generation can interfere with that constitutional guarantee, if it is agreed by both communities in the North.  We are saying bluntly to the Northern Protestant Irish that, if they treat the Northern Catholic Irish fairly and give them a role to play in a Northern state, we will give them the guarantees they require.</P>
    <P>One should picture what Ireland would have been like in the last decade of this century if there had not been physical conflict in its first decade, if we had not fought, killed and maimed each other, said brutal things about each other and if both communities had been brought together through constitutional politics and economic harmony between North and South.  Imagine what Ireland would have been like if everybody living in the Border areas had stopped to reflect on conditions in the last 18 months with, for example, freedom of movement of goods and traffic across the Border.</P>
    <P>The only difference now between North and South is economic and this must be overcome before the troubles are resolved.  Rather than discussing the politics of Ireland, we should spend the next few years talking about the economic divisions.  It is a question of constitutional politics or physical violence, of economic harmony or independent economics in the Republic.  We must tell the Northern community that we do not seek victory or compromise, but rather accommodation.  To ask a person to compromise is to suggest they must give something away.  &ldquo;Accommodation&rdquo; is a more acceptable word to get across one's point of view.</P>
    <P>Every person and political party has a role to play, but Sinn Féin has the most <Col N="993" /> important role.  It has been at the coal face and it is blamed most by the Northern Protestant Irish for the violence of the past 25 years.  There is no great rush of people in the Northern Protestant community, running with their hands up, saying they want to be friends with Sinn Féin.  Sinn Féin and the IRA have a job to build bridges between that community and the rest of what can be called the Nationalist, republican, Catholic Irish.  The Unionists also have a role to play in winning support and making it easy for Sinn Féin to come to the conference table and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Sinn Féin and the republican movement want us to believe that they walk in the footsteps of Tone.  However, Tone preached throughout his political life that the titles Catholic, Protestant and dissenter should be abolished and that people should come together in the name of Irishmen.  When we were born on this island, we were born Irish and nobody questioned it.  However, what occurred afterwards makes us what we are today and we all have personal experiences of how it happened.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage far beyond what I thought possible.  There is an obligation on the Irish Government to build absolute trust and a partnership with Britain, irrespective of the party in power.  The difficulties in Northern Ireland resulted from the inadequacies of political leaders in the Republic and Great Britain.  The people in Northern Ireland paid for this and perhaps the Catholic community paid more than others.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to six people, whose names are not mentioned often in the House, if at all, Mr. David Adamson, Mr. Gary McMichael, Mr. David Ervine, Mr. Billy Hutchinson, Mr. Andy Tyrie and Mr. Glen Barr.  I have been in the company of most of these men over the past 20 years and I heard them talk about the booklet &ldquo;Beyond the Religious Divide&rdquo;, which was produced by the UDA, and the book &ldquo;Common Sense&rdquo;.  Bearing in mind that they all come from the Protestant ghetto areas of Northern Ireland, they are now <Col N="994" /> speaking as sensible people and articulating an understanding voice, to which extreme republicans in the South listen. However, nobody has yet stopped to think about the role they played in bringing about a ceasefire and in bringing along the Protestant community in the North, particularly the militant elements in the ghetto areas of Belfast and, to a lesser degree, Derry.</P>
    <P>If one fine-combs the troubles in Northern Ireland, we are not talking about unionism and nationalism, but rather sectarianism, intolerant and bigoted Protestants facing intolerant and bigoted Catholics trying to dress it up by calling it nationalism and republicanism. They had the power to draw battle lines and they sucked in their own sides.  The people I mentioned come from that morass and extremely difficult position and appreciation must be recorded to them and others like them. Over the years I listened to what they said about the type of Ireland they might wish to join.  It is not the one many people going to Croke Park might envisage or one which involves waving tricolours or singing rebel songs, but, to them, it is an Ireland.  They have their own way of expressing their love of Ireland to which we must listen.</P>
    <P>The conflict in Ireland is no longer physical, it is mental, and the only way a mental conflict can be resolved is by sitting down and talking.  Nobody has criticised Sinn Féin/IRA more than I, but we must all find accommodation. The people concerned must find an accommodation which will make it very difficult for Sinn Féin/IRA to refuse to come to the conference table and they must find reasons to make it difficult for extreme elements on the other side to do likewise.  We have reached an exciting beginning and it would be wrong to miss this opportunity.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom gur tógadh céim mhór chun tosaigh inné i bpróiséas na síochána ach faraoir géar gur thóg sé an oiread sin ama orainn dul chomh fada leis seo.  Tá sé 18 mí ó d'fhógair an IRA an sos cogaidh agus i <Col N="995" /> rith an ama sin bhí daoine sa Teach seo a dúirt go mion minic go gcaithfí rud éigin a dhéanamh le muinín na bpoblachtach agus na ndílseoirí a chothú i bpróiséas na síochána.  Bhí an-lúcháir orm inniu éisteacht leis an Teachta Mary Flaherty agus an méid a bhí le rá aici i dtaobh na bpríosúnach.  Cinnte má theastaigh ó Rialtas na Breataine go dtiocfaí ar ais i mbun an fhoréigin, má theastaigh uathu comhartha a thabhairt nach raibh siad dáiríre faoi phróiséas na síochána, ní fhéadfadh siad é a dhéanamh ar bhealach níos fearr ná an chaoi ar chaith siad leis na priosúnaigh, go mór mhór na priosúnaigh atá coinnithe i Sasana.  I rith an ama sin, rinneadh gach dícheall ar gach bealach a chinntiú nach dtabharfaí cothrom na Féinne do na priosúnaigh.  Éinne a bhfuil tuiscint acu ar an dtaobh seo den uisce ar fhadhb na hÉireann tuigeann siad nach bhfuil aon bhealach níos mó le cur as do phoblachtaigh, le cruthú nach bhfuil i gceist athrú ar bith a dheanamh ar rudaí, ná gan tada a dhéanamh i gcás cearta sibhialta do phriosúnaigh.</P>
      <P>Ach chuaigh siad níos faide ná sin.  Ag an am gcéanna go raibh cóir leighis bunúsach á shéanadh ar Paddy Kelly agus ar dhaoine eile; ag an am gcéanna go raibh treoir a thug an té is aoirde ó thaobh cúrsaí dlí i Sasana, an Lord Chief Justice, á shéanadh agus á dhiúltiú ag an Rúnaí Gnóthaí Baile i Sasana, ligeadh an saighdiúr Lee Clegg saor.</P>
      <P>Cád é an comhartha a thug sé sin do na poblachtaigh?  Cad é an comhartha a thug na focla breátha a dúradh &mdash;&ldquo;dá mbeadh sos cogaidh ann bheadh croí mór ag Rialtas an Breataine&rdquo;&mdash; don dream a bhí i mbun an fhoréigin go dtí sin?  Is é an comhartha a thug sé ná go raibh an sean réimeas in Éireann beo i gcomhnaí, go raibh dlí amháin do dhream amháin agus dlí eile do dhream eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táthar ag iarraidh anois ar na dreamanna a bhí ag fanacht go foighneach ar na cainteanna seo fanacht go dtí an Mheitheamh seo chugainn.  Má táimid ag súil anois go dtabharfaidh daoine drom láimhe don bhforeígean tá sé in am do Rialtas na Breataine comhartha <Col N="996" /> substaintiúil a thabhairt go bhfuil i gceist acu a bport a athrú i gcás na bpriosúnach poblachtacha agus na ndílseoirí. Tá súil agam go bhfuil an Taoiseach agus an Tánaiste ag brú na ceiste seo an t-am uilig.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí an comhartha seo a thabhairt ar bhealach an-simplí.  Is minic a deirtear liom thall: &ldquo;Ní féidir leat a bheith ag súil go ligfí amach go luath daoine atá tar éis a bheith i mbun foréigin i Sasana.&rdquo;  I gcuid mhaith de na cásanna ní hé sin atá uainn.  Nílimid ach ag iarraidh, mar shampla, go ligfí Brendan Dowd, atá taréis os cionn 20 bliana a chaitheamh i bpriosún, saor.  Tá a théarma iomlán curtha isteach aige.  Nílimid ach ag caint faoi Joe McKinney a ligint saor.  Tá seisean beagnach tríscórgo leith bliana d'aois agus tá thart ar 11 bhliain as téarma 16 bliana curtha isteach aige.  Do mhol an bord paról i Sasana go ligfí saor é.</P>
    <P>Rudaí beaga atá á iarraidh againn &mdash; comharthaí dearfacha tugtha le croi mór anois.  Ba mhór an cúnamh do phróiséas na síochána dá dtabharfaí é agus bheadh súil le Dia agam go dtabharfaí na comharthaí sin anois.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's announcement could be the beginning of something new but 18 months ago we thought we had turned a page.  Unfortunately, despite the fine rhetoric about the generosity that would be shown to people involved in the troubles, we got nothing but obstructionism from the British authorities, particularly on the question of the prisoners' issue.</P>
    <P>I compliment my colleagues in this House who frequently travelled to Britain to visit the prisoners and who tried to preach the message that politics works.  I echo what Deputy Flaherty said earlier about politics; we have been let down as parliamentarians because we told the prisoners that politics is the way forward.  We returned from visiting the prisoners and lobbied on their behalf in this House.</P>
    <P>I travelled to Westminster twice last year to persaude British parliamentarians that issues do not always look the same on this side of the Irish Sea as <Col N="997" /> they do in Britain.  Unfortunately, we, as parliamentarians, were not listened to and I have no doubt if one were to analyse all the reasons that led to the bombing in Canary Wharf, one of the major factors would be the diabolical way the prisoners, who had such a major part to play in bringing about the peace process, were treated in the interim.  The obstructionism on the part of the British Government was so great I would be unable to outline it in detail in the time allotted to me.</P>
    <P>In the past two days I visited the four British prisons in which these prisoners are being detained.  The conditions they are being held in already have been outlined in detail.  They are all treated as category A prisoners, irrespective of the length of time they have served.  There is great resentment and bitterness among the prisoners of the way they and their families have been treated.  In talking to them they often do not mention their own cases but the case of another person.</P>
    <P>Violence is often condemned in this House and nobody would condemn it more than myself, irrespective of the quarter from which it comes, but there are many types of violence.  While we all accept that the bomb and the bullet is a form of violence, the denial of basic human rights and medical treatment and the imposition of inhuman conditions is another form of violence.  The fact that such treatment is protracted over a long period does not make it any less violent.  All violence and inhuman treatment must be eliminated from this process and we must begin to do that from today.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 53 of his report, Senator Mitchell refers specifically to the prisoners' issue.  It is unfortunate it was not specifically mentioned in yesterday's communiqué because from now on this process must be seen to be even-handed. All parties in this dispute will be asked to change.  In expressing hope that Sinn Féin and the IRA will turn away from violence, we also hope that those involved in inhuman treatment will take the view that what happened yesterday will not be repeated tomorrow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> I wish to refer briefly to some specific cases with regard to prisoners.  Joe McKinney, the last prisoner in Frankland Prison, was given a sentence of 16 years of which he has served 11 years. Last November, the parole board recommended his release but the Home Secretary rejected the recommendation. Joe McKinney is 69 years of age and cannot realistically pose a threat to anyone.</P>
    <P>Another case involves Brendan Dowd.  This time last year the Lord Chief Justice came up with a recommendation that he had served sufficient time in prison, and I have a copy of the letter from the Home Office confirming that recommendation.  One year later, Brendan Dowd remains in prison and he does not know when he will see the outside world again.  He has served a total of 20 years in prison.</P>
    <P>Patrick Kelly was transferred to a prison in Belfast only after the hands of the British authorities were forced on the issue by our engaging outside medical expertise, and after a considerable delay.  He is terminally ill and should be transferred to this jurisdiction but we are still working on the bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>John Kinsella has requested that his case be reopened.  I have examined his and other cases and I approached them with a sceptical eye.  However, I have no doubt that John Kinsella was a dupe and that he played an unwitting part in the activities for which he was convicted. That is obvious to anyone who reads the evidence.  A request to reopen this man's case was made to the Home Secretary and I have no doubt that if the Home Secretary does not act quickly, a Birmingham Six-Guildford Four type of miscarriage of justice will ensue.</P>
    <P>Why can we not get action on the prisoners' issue?  Why can we not explain to our counterparts in Britain that unless confidence building measures are put in place and justice is seen to be even-handed, it will be difficult to persuade those who, for good reason, never had faith in the British system that the promises given yesterday will be fulfilled?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> We can condemn violence for as long as we want, but when one analyses the fact that Sinn Féin is the second largest Nationalist party in terms of its share of the popular vote and representation in both Derry and Belfast one has to ask what is wrong and why so many people distrust British policy.  We cannot ignore that fact if we want to solve the problem. Just as we are asking Sinn Féin and the IRA to turn away from violence there is a need for reciprocation on the other side of the water.</P>
    <P>I hope that on this occasion the earnest words of politicians on all sides of the House on these issues will be listened to.  The small steps which would mean so much could be taken now without breaking any principle.  What was said this week to the Irish Association by the chief probation officer in Northern Ireland who could not be accused of being anything other than a loyal servant of the Northern state should be noted by those in authority. Rather than lecturing others and setting down preconditions we would all be better employed trying to see what we can do and give to encourage others to have belief and faith in the democratic process. That is what the peace process is about.</P>
    <P>Between now and next June, rather than setting down more preconditions everybody involved in the process should try to strip away the barriers to talks and take the small steps necessary to create confidence.  Whether it be Sinn Féin for the Unionists, the Unionists for Sinn Féin, the British Government for the Irish people or the Irish Government for the Unionists in the North, I hope that all involved will not lay down agendas, look for empty promises or formulae of words.  They should indicate instead what they are willing to consider and ask others to do the same.  If the matter had been approached in that way following the announcement of the cease-fire, we would not be in the sorry position we are in today.  A mistake was <Col N="1000" /> made.  The most important thing in life is never repeat one's mistakes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> If the contribution of Deputy ó Cuív who spoke as Gaeilge agus as Béarla and has a specific interest in the prisoners' issue was taken in isolation, one might get the impression that the only cause of our troubles was the non-release of prisoners. The Canary Wharf catastrophe, not to mention the bus explosion, cannot be ignored.  While we have our own views about the way Irish people are treated by the British one has to allow for the fact that the atrocities were perpetrated in their country.  If the IRA wants to be of assistance, it should help rather than hinder the process.  This does not take away from the case that can be made on behalf of prisoners, Patrick Kelly in particular who is seriously ill.  Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have assured us that they will do their best to help.</P>
      <P>I congratulate all involved in the negotiations to recommence the peace process, in particular the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste who have played a major role.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, was rightly criticised for the lack of progress in the past 18 months when no definite decisions were made.  He finds himself in serious difficulty and could have taken the easy option to protect his own position.  He deserves to be congratulated for not doing so.  As has been said several times &mdash; this does not stop us from repeating it &mdash; Mr. John Hume is the solid full back who dominates the game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the O'Brien family in Gorey for the marvellous contribution they made in convincing the doubters who felt that we were all savages in Ireland mad to commit crime, blow up <Col N="1001" /> buildings and kill people.  In their hour of tragedy they gave great example to the people of England and the North who, perhaps, look upon us with a jaundiced eye.  It was a marvellous gesture on their part.  An IRA funeral in Gorey with all the attendant coverage in the media would have done untold damage.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the many thousands who took part in the peace marches.  It is easy to say that the IRA does not take any notice of such marches, perhaps it does not, but if they had no other effect, they conveyed the message to the people of the world, Mr. John Major and his Government and the Unionists in the North that the people of the South were looking for the peace process to continue.  Those who helped organise the marches and went to the bother of participating in them gave great example to the doubters who were worried about our attitude.</P>
    <P>Eighteen months is a long time in the course of a peace process.  It is a pity that nothing concrete happened so far as negotiations are concerned, but that is all in the past.  It was a marvellous achievement that there was a return to normality, North and South.</P>
    <P>The absence of a firm date for the commencement of all-party talks was at the root of the problem.  The two Governments have set 10 June as the starting date and the parties involved will have no excuse for not taking part. Once people sit in a room together, even if they disagree for three or six months, we will be nearer to a compromise. The extreme Unionist and IRA view cannot be maintained.  The people have sent a strong message that they want peace.  There is an onus on all sides to sit down and bring the matter to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The communiqué issued was a simple one.  The Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>First, it reaffirms the commitment of the two Governments to work for a lasting peace and comprehensive settlement based on the principles set <Col N="1002" /> out in the Downing Street Declaration and Joint Framework Document.</P>
    <P>Second, it underlines the fundamental priority we attach to securing the earliest possible inclusive negotiations to address all the relevant relationships and issues in an interlocking three-stranded process.</P>
    <P>Third, it confirms that such negotiations should include all relevant parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and have shown that they abide by the democratic process.  There are no other qualifications for participation.</P>
    <P>Listening to the comments of the different groups last night one might have got the impression that they would all take their own line.  We must realise that people will bargain and make as much noise as possible before going into talks. I am not concerned about the condition building and &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; attitude because everybody must accept the overwhelming support for peace.  The recent MBRI poll shows that people want peace and know where to place the blame for the breakdown in the peace process.  It is interesting to note that only 6 per cent blame the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>It is easy to analyse with hindsight. Many people have to make on-the-spot decisions which others can analyse later. We should not be critical of what took place in the past.  I hope the will for peace is acknowledged by all.  Young people in Northern Ireland were beginning to realise, for the first time, what peace can mean to their lives.  I wish the process every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing time with me and I join others in congratulating those involved in the agreement reached yesterday. The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and their negotiators deserve the support of all Members.  The bombs in London made the process much more tense and difficult and many people believed it was not possible to reach agreement in <Col N="1003" /> such a short time.  Last November we were told there would be agreement on all-party talks and a date has been set.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has carried on the work of Deputy Reynolds and his predecessors. Great efforts were put into bringing about a ceasefire, but much remains to be done to solve the Northern Ireland problem.  Those who live near the Border know it is difficult to get communities to work together. Great difficulty was experienced in bringing together two groups in Donegal which people thought were of like mind.  Time will be required to resolve all the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The agreement reached yesterday will give everyone a chance to resolve their political differences.  The communiqué agreed between the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach is designed to move the peace process forward.  It creates a priceless opportunity to recapture and politically anchor peace.  The only matter standing in the way of peace is a decision by the IRA to call a permanent ceasefire.  I hope it can be persuaded by Sinn Féin who claims to talk on its behalf.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív said a new leaf was turned over 18 months ago.  Another important leaf in the history of this State was turned over yesterday, but it must be underpinned by trust on all sides.  When it suits, Sinn Féin claims to speak on behalf of the IRA and we accepted its word during the Mitchell Commission session.  A few hours before the bomb went off in London, Sinn Féin assured us the ceasefire was intact.  We must ensure that nothing is said or done to prevent Sinn Féin from getting the ceasefire back on track. Apart from the shooting of a postman in Newry, during the ceasefire people are not killed or injured.  In speaking on this matter on 5 February, Deputy Reynolds stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after the peace process was up and running, we had a raid on a post office in Newry during which a postman was tragically shot.  That <Col N="1004" /> was a difficult call for our Government. My colleagues in Government, who were aware how tough I had been at different stages with the republican movement, knew it was not easy for me to send for Gerry Adams to hear from him the reason the peace process had gone off the rails so soon.  When I heard his explanations about discipline not being imposed in various units, I made it quite clear that... I would not listen to that excuse again and the door would not be open to him to explain what had occurred...</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds said he would never again give Gerry Adams a chance.  We must be careful.  I was shocked at the former Taoiseach going on radio for publicity purposes before he had a private meeting with Gerry Adams. Anyone interested in the long-term well-being of the nation should not use this serious matter to risk peace.</P>
    <P>Major negotiations will start next Monday leading up to all party talks on 10 June.  It is important that Sinn Féin is involved, but it is up to it to ensure the ceasefire is restored.  I pay tribute to John Hume and others who must be encouraged to continue their work. Church leaders, civil servants and advisers have a role to play.  We must ensure that more people are not killed or injured and I call for an end to the punishment beatings.  I urge people to continue to call for peace so that not only the IRA but people throughout the world know that the majority of people on this island want peace and not more deaths.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Leonard.  Yesterday was a joyous day and a new air of optimism prevails inside and outside the House.  I join our party leader in welcoming the political progress achieved by both Governments.  I congratulate all those involved and wish them every success in the negotiations which will commence immediately.  I welcome, in particular, the setting of a specific date for the <Col N="1005" /> commencement of all party negotiations and regret that it could not have been agreed earlier.  This it not a time for recriminations but I have been frustrated by the procrastination, particularly by the British Government, over the past 18 months regarding all-party talks.</P>
      <P>I am privileged to be a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which has done wonderful work.  During the early months of the ceasefire there was an enthusiasm, optimism and burning desire by all members of the forum to achieve results.  The delegations who made presentations were also very interested in preserving peace.  No one personified this enthusiasm and optimisism better than my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who was always productive. However, early last summer this enthusiasm started to ebb as a result of the procrastination and prevarication by certain quarters and the failure to hold all-party talks.  When I asked the late Deputy Neil Blaney his views he said the process was dying on its feet for the reasons already outlined by me.  The summer break was a blessed relief to the parties and delegates and when business resumed in the autumn we hoped progress would have been made but, unfortunately, this was not the case.  I hope the communiqué will restore that sense of enthusiasm to the meritorious work of the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Ó Cuív on his excellent work in regard to prisoners. He has made numerous visits to British prisons and has given us the benefit of his invaluablel knowledge.  I also compliment the members of other parties who have visited these prisons and gleaned information which is so important to the entire process.  Given their circumstances, prisoners were even more frustrated than us by the lack of progress. We should not forget that they were a very important part of the process and one of the reasons the IRA announced its ceasfire on 31 August 1994 and loyalist parmilitaries announced their ceasefire three weeks later.  I compliment the loyalist paramilitaries for the <Col N="1006" /> way they are dealing with the present situation.  The role being played by them during this sensitive period in our history should not be forgotten in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The prisoners' issue had a major bearing on the decision by republican and loyalist paramilitaries to announce their ceasefires.  They still have a major role to play and should not be disregarded or treated in the manner they were previously. They were promised that their position would be addressed in the all-party talks, but these did not take place. This is a great pity.  We should learn from our mistakes and address this issue as soon as possible.  Today's air of optimism should be followed up with an air of urgency in the talks which will take place over the comming weeks, months and years.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday people displayed their solidarity with the peace process.  I congratulate all those people who voiced their clear view that they want peace restored.  They are aware of the benefits of peace in terms of the economy and reconciliation between people on this island.  People in virtually every town and village in my county marched on the streets to voice their view.  I took part in the marches in my home town of Rathdrum &mdash; and Arklow &mdash; and I have never seen the kind of fervour or passion as displayed by these people.  Their strong message was that they wanted peace restored and did not want further violence which would impede the economic progress since 31 August 1994.</P>
    <P>I wish all those involved in the process in the weeks ahead every success.  I hope the all-party talks which will begin on 10 June will lead to the type of life yearned for by people for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the communiqué which has been wholeheartedly approved by all parties.  In recent weeks we have learnt the lesson that time cannot be wasted and the process must be put back on the rails as soon as possible.  I was one of those who said that 18 months was a very short time in the life of a nation.  The process <Col N="1007" /> seemed to lag last summer and this continued until the end of last year.  I hope on this occasions that the process will be moved forward as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin said it required more clarification. It may make an issue of this requirement but there is no reason this should delay it going to the IRA with this document.  I cannot see for the life of me why that should not be done over the weekend; it should not take weeks. We are now faced with a very simple choice.  We will have negotiations or more of the violence we have seen for the last 25 years.  There is no row of options, no shopping list, it is either one choice or the other.  They should make a clear commitment and do so quickly.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the forum and I have met Sinn Féin delegations.  I met members of Sinn Féin a week ago with my party leader and we had a very frank discussion with them.  I hope they get into line quickly so that this can proceed. Like everyone else, I supported the peace marches last weekend. However, I heard speakers today say there may be more peace marches.  We should be very cautious about street demonstrations.  I had my own problems with them in the 1980s.  It is easy to get people out on the street, but sometimes it is very hard to get them off the street afterwards.</P>
      <P>Last week I was at a very well regulated, dignified march, organised by a group of people in Clones, a town which was devastated by the Border and whose commercial life suffered more than any other town south of the Border. A prayer was read prior to the march.  At the conclusion of the march it was read again and people dispersed. That is the kind of silent demonstration required, not flowery speeches or resolutions and so on.  I hope there will be no need for more demonstrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great opportunities for trade between North-South and South-North have become very obvious in the last 18 months.  Businesses in the North grasped the opportunity far quicker than those in the South.  One has to only <Col N="1008" /> travel through the towns along the Border to see far more northern registered delivery vans bringing food products to the South than southern vehicles bringing goods to the North.  They grasped the opportunity.  Those people who are gaining and stand to gain should now use their influence to press those people who are dilatory about getting into line.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation did very good work, both the plenary sessions where they brought in the various groupings and bodies to give evidence, and in the subcommittees where they looked into every aspect of life both sides of the Border, the problems associated with coming together and all aspects of religious, cultural and political life.  They worked very hard to do that; the ground work is done and all that remains is to get the show on the road.</P>
    <P>I was delighted that a definite date, 10 June, has been set.  The election process has been put in place so there is nothing for it now but to go ahead.  I wish the negotiators success in the future and I think the conclusion will be satisfactory.</P>

As a result, with your indulgence, Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to address some of the issues which I would have liked to address a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>I join others in warmly welcoming the communiqué issued by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in London yesterday.  It is a balanced and clear statement, setting out the framework for progress over the next few months.  In the communiqué the governments are trying on the one hand to give leadership in setting out their view as to how things should progress while, on the other, they are quite properly seeking to reach agreement on some of the important elements in that process.</P>

      <Col N="1009" /> There is a balance to be struck between giving leadership and seeking agreement.  This balance presents serious dilemmas for both governments but in particular for the British Government. The governments have ultimate responsibility to ensure that the train reaches its destination.  To lose any of the passengers along the way would be a major setback and everything should be done to avoid that, but equally, to continue the metaphor, no one passenger can be given the right to pull the emergency cord on the whole process.</P>
    <P>In the context of where we now stand, it is important that there should be consultation as soon as possible between all the parties concerned.  We must hope against hope that agreement can be reached on the terms of any referendum and on the terms of any elective process. In default of any agreement between the parties, it is the role and duty of governments to make a decision and to give leadership and in that context I warmly welcome the apparent willingness of the British Government to do just that.</P>
    <P>I was struck over the last few days by the findings of the opinion poll carried out by <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Guardian.</i> In particular, I was struck by the apparent willingness of people in this State to blame the British Government for the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire. This is an important issue and deserves careful analysis.  It is important that we are fair about this and that we recognise that the British Government has gone further than any other in recognising the political realities of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This British Government declared that Britain had no selfish political or economic interest to remain in Northern Ireland.  This British Government negotiated the Downing Street Declaration which eventually brought about the IRA ceasefire.  Moreover, Mr. Major and his Government negotiated the framework document which sets out the political principles which will necessarily underlie any political settlement or accommodation on this island.  The <Col N="1010" /> document set out the considered wisdom of both Governments and it is as valid now as it was one year ago.</P>
    <P>I have no quibble with the British in the way they have agreed the political principles which will guide any settlement. Unfortunately the significant political engagement of the British Government has been overshadowed, particularly in recent months, by extraordinary incompetence in the day to day management of the process.  It has moved too slowly, or not at all, on issues such as prisoners and the convening of all party talks.  Most importantly, they have wasted previous months in the cul-de-sac of decommissioning, from which we are only now beginning to emerge.</P>
    <P>I hope the British Government has learned something from the experience of the past 18 months; there are welcome signs in this communiqué to suggest that may well be so.  However, it is not only the British who have something to learn.  We have all made mistakes and we all need to move forward.  The current position presents us with some stark choices.  This is not a time for small steps forward, it is a time for all of us to take risks.  That choice is presented not least to the Unionist people of Northern Ireland and their political leadership.  It is beyond time for them to recognise the essential nature of Northern Ireland.  It is time for Unionists to acknowledge that they share the problems of Northern Ireland with a significant minority of people who do not regard themselves as British and who do not identify in any way with the state or province of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>For many years the Ulster Unionist Party sought to suppress Nationalists and nationalism.  This did not work and ultimately the British Government, led by Mr. Edward Health, dismantled the apparatus of the Protestant state.  Since 1972 many ordinary Unionist people have come to recognise and accept the civil and human rights of their Catholic neighbours but that in itself is not enough.  They need to go one step further.  They need to recognise the political rights of those who see themselves <Col N="1011" /> as Irish nationalists.  They need to recognise that Northern Ireland as an entity, whether within the United Kingdom or otherwise, can only be made truly viable through an accommodation that recognises the different national identities of those who live there.  It is clear, I am afraid, that many Unionist leaders are not prepared to take that step.  They believe that any accommodation with nationalism necessarily weakens their links with the United Kingdom and threatens the Union.  In this they are making a fundamental and, potentially, historically important error.  The Union works both ways.  It relies not just on the willingness of the people of Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom but also presumes the willingness of the people living in the rest of the UK to accommodate Northern Ireland.  It has been clear for many years that the patience of the average Briton is rapidly running out.  They simply do not understand the Unionist mind set. They do not understand or accept that Unionists are entitled to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any proposal that looks to accommodate Nationalists.  The continuing obduracy of Unionist leaders is weakening the Union day after day.  This is in nobody's interests, least of all in the interests of the one million people on this island who regard themselves as British.  It is time, beyond time, for the Unionists to talk.  It is time for them to reach an accommodation and we must look to Mr. Trimble and others to do just that.</P>
    <P>It is not just Unionists who have choices to make.  Yesterday's communiqué and everything that has happened in the past 18 months presents the representatives of militant republicanism also with an historic choice. They too must decide whether they want to reach an accommodation.  That choice presents itself in different ways. In the first instance they must decide whether they want to pursue the campaign of violence, the so-called armed struggle.  I hope against hope, as do we all, that they renounce violence and <Col N="1012" /> commit themselves to exclusively peaceful means.</P>
    <P>A simple ceasefire is not enough.  Sinn Féin and the IRA must go much further. They must, sooner or later, commit themselves to the Mitchell principles. They must abandon all forms of violence and all forms of preparation for future violence.  We cannot continue a peace process under the threat of armed violence, and it is important that Sinn Féin and the IRA should accept this fact.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, even a renunciation of violence itself will not be enough.  Militant republicanism needs to go one step further.  It needs to put political bones on the ceasefire, something it has singularly refused or failed to do since August 1994.  Sinn Féin have not accepted the Downing Street Declaration. They did not accept the Framework Document.  They did not sign up to the final report of the drafting committee at the Forum.  They have not yet accepted the Mitchell principles.  They must ultimately do all of these things.  I am one of those who felt very strongly that Sinn Féin should have signed up to the principle of consent at the Forum. That would have established their bona fides and would have helped to bring about the all-party talks which they claim so much to want.  I regret very much that they did not do so.  Their failure to do so informs where we currently stand.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few personal words about where I am coming from in this whole business.  I am one of those who is uncomfortable with the word &ldquo;nationalist&rdquo; or the concept of nationalism as traditionally defined in Ireland.  I sought to define my views before I became a public representative as principally concerned with social and economic issues and the welfare of people as a social democrat or a socialist or a democratic socialist, if one wishes to put a lable on it.  I have never been comfortable with the word &ldquo;nationalist&rdquo;, and I have never identified particularly with those who use that phrase a great deal <Col N="1013" /> more comfortably than I do.  I shuddered on the day in September 1994 when I saw the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, with John Hume and Gerry Adams on the steps of Government Buildings.  I did not feel they represented me or that I was a part of that. However, I and many others in this House and elsewhere took the risk, made the leap of faith, of confidence. We trusted the process, went along with it and tried to engage in it.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the Labour Party's delegation at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation for the past 18 months.  As part of my role in that I have sought to engage on a regular basis with representatives of Sinn Féin, with representatives of militant republicanism. I hope and believe that through contacts at the Forum and elsewhere, in Belfast recently and on a regular basis in the past 18 months, my understanding of the tradition and the ideas that inform militant republicanism has improved.  I hope that their understanding of where I and people like me are coming from has also improved.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to state that there is not what people in recent weeks have come to regard as a pan-Nationalist consensus.  There has been no meeting of minds.  There has been a compromise. The many thousands of people in this States who hold a view similar to mine have made a significant, perhaps historic, compromise with militant republicanism, one which forms an important part of this process.  I say that because I feel there are people in Sinn Féin who believe that the pan-Nationalist consensus was always there, that those who were sceptical would wake up one day and realise that we were all on the same side all along.  I have not changed my views.  I do not share the ideals of Irish nationalism.  I do not share the aspirations of Irish nationalism in large part, but I and many like me are willing, and have been willing over the past 18 months to trust, to make that leap of faith, to compromise, to accommodate that other important tradition which exists on this island.  We <Col N="1014" /> are entitled to ask that Sinn Féin show an equal willingness to accommodate us and, perhaps more important, to accommodate the Unionists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are two distinct identities on this island.  The Unionists look to Britain, though not exclusively.  The Nationalists look to the Irish Republic, again not exclusively.  We can accommodate both within Northern Ireland.  That is what is set out in the Downing Street Declaration, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, most recently, in the Framework Document agreed by both Governments last year.  That is the road we must go.  In order to do that all of us must make choices, compromise and accommodate.  I call on all parties to the peace process to do that so that we can rescue the process started perhaps only 18 months ago, perhaps two or three years ago, and continued so bravely by so many people in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the honesty and straight talking I have just heard from Deputy McDowell.  He has put a very clear challenge to Nationalists and Unionists.  I do not share his feeling of being uncomfortable with nationalism, but I admire the honest way in which he put his views and believe they should be carefully examined.  Some of the things the Deputy has said have not been said in this House for some time and they are worth nothing.</P>
      <P>I want to join with others in welcoming yesterday's communiqué and the breakthrough.  In the apparent putting back on the tracks of the peace process, there can be nobody on this island who does not commend yesterday's effort.  I thank all those involved, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister and officials on both sides, and everybody who was involved in the hard work which we know went on to try to put the process back together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the Northern Ireland debate recently in this House I, with others, suggested that the Governments should get together and set a <Col N="1015" /> date, some three months away, for all-party talks.  I am delighted to see that has come to pass.  I also did another thing for which I was criticised inside and outside this House, but I stand by it.  I was taken up wrongly by some Deputies on the other side but I made it clear that in criticising the Taoiseach I was not questioning his ability, his integrity or his earnestness in tackling this tragic problem.  In that he had our support.  I made it clear, and I do so again, that in order not to repeat the mistakes made by Dublin in the past six months it was important that we had the maturity to recognise that mistakes were made which must not be made again, because if they are made again we could end up in the same situation. That is not to blame the Taoiseach but to point out that the British and Irish Governments made serious mistakes. We should not fall into that trap again. Mistakes included preconditions such as decommissioning, elections, etc., and allowing the gap between the Governments to widen.  The Taoiseach did not take charge personally, we dealt with committees, Ministers and so on. However, yesterday he took charge and spoke to the Prime Minister, John Major, personally and with passion.  He must continue to do so and establish a bond of faith between them.  It would be dangerous to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>I was criticised by the Government side for making those points but in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 February Geraldine Kennedy stated:</P>
    <P>The peace process has been handicapped throughout the last 14 months by recurring reports about the difficulty of getting a precise formulation of Government policy from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>There is the seminal story from a high-level US delegation who met Mr. Bruton during the year to get a steer on the Government's position during one of the crises.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We left the room,&rdquo; confessed one source, &ldquo;believing that we had been <Col N="1016" /> talking to 10 men with 10 different arguments.  We were confused about the Government's stand.&rdquo;  Perceptions of inconsistency may reveal the reality of his policy on occasions....</P>
    <P>He cannot be saying, as he did on Sunday last, that &ldquo;an election now would pour petrol on the flames&rdquo; and then, on Tuesday, tell the Dáil that he had asked Mr. Major to consider &ldquo;whether, and how, an elective process...might lead directly and speedily, without equivocation, to all-party negotiations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has taken charge, firmed up his policy and is determined to run the process.  We cannot afford to create the image that Dublin is not clear on where it stands. He must not allow a gap to open between the two Governments as that was a major factor in the delays of the past few months.</P>
    <P>There have been dramatic changes in policy in recent weeks.  Some months ago it would have been unthinkable for the British to talk about holding all-party talks without the preconditions of decommissioning, elections, etc., being met.  They do not seem to be preconditions now.  We must ask why has it taken so long to achieve this.  One editorial in a newspaper this morning asks why the two Governments could not have done this last October.</P>
    <P>The British Government misjudged the urgency of the issue and dragged its feet.  Delays and problems occurred. The Irish Government also made mistakes which must not happen again.  The British Government now realises that the problems will only be solved through negotiations and that a security and military response will not solved them.  Some years ago its response would have been a purely military and security one.  It recognises that there must be a political response and I am glad they did not react to recent events in a knee-jerk fashion.  I hope the British Government is getting it right and that this is not a false dawn.  If it recognises <Col N="1017" /> that it must not concentrate on preconditions and security measures it will have our full support.</P>
    <P>The form of election was not mentioned in the communiqué.  The small parties that front the paramilitaries must have a role in the election otherwise it would be an academic exercise and reinforce existing prejudices.  John Taylor said he may consider some form of election other than to a 90 member assembly.  That is a hopeful sign.  There must be openness and no secret agenda or Stormont-type assemblies introduced by the back door through the election. Such developments would harden attitudes.</P>
    <P>A referendum should be held if it would help the process but it would be naive to hold a referendum on the question: &ldquo;Are you for or against violence&rdquo;? Nobody will vote no and it is doubtful if the hard men of violence will take notice of it.  We must ask sensible questions. If there is a 60 per cent turnout and 59.5 per cent vote against violence it will be a nine hour wonder.  We would look silly if it were reported around the world that we were holding a referendum on whether we favour violence.</P>
    <P>I do not have a copy of the communiqué with me but I understand there is a proposal that the British Government will bring in legislation to establish elections and to oversee decommissioning. If that was agreed by the two Governments we should be given further details but we must not allow preconditions to reappear under another name.  If the legislation which we have been told will be introduced by Easter is a decommissioning road block by another name and if there is an understanding that Mr. Trimble will succeed in establishing a 90 seat assembly, we should be told that now so that there is not another false start.  We support the very heartening and enlightening deal made but my main concern relates to the decommissioning and election issues.  If they become preconditions we will be back where we started.  I hope the deal was not put together in such a <Col N="1018" /> way that the real intention behind elections and decommissioning are concealed.</P>
    <P>The role played by Senator Mitchell is very important.  His recent visits here have helped the Government enormously. Through him we have a direct line of communication with the United States administration.  We should avail of President Clinton's genuine personal interest in Northern Ireland.  The US administration should be very crisp in dealing with Sinn Féin.  It should make clear, as it probably had done on many occasions, that access to the Oval office and the national media in the United States is conditional on the absence of violence.  Sinn Féin cannot have it both ways; it cannot expect to have access to the Oval office while at the same time supporting a return to bombing and maiming.</P>
    <P>The price of Sinn Féin's participation in talks is a resumption of the ceasefire. That is clear from this debate, as it was from the recent marches.  Given that both Governments have more or less acceded to Sinn Féin's demand for a definite date for all-party talks, we must now call the bluff of those who made that request.  The IRA's bluff is being called by the elected representatives of this House and by the deal made yesterday. Preconditions no longer exist and it is up to the IRA and Sinn Féin to respond.  If they do not, the patience of people on both islands will run out very quickly, and that would take us to a brink from which it would be very difficult to return.  Sinn Féin cannot back two horses, it cannot go the violent route and the democracy route at the same time.  It has reached a crossroads. It has an opportunity to convince the IRA to accept all-party talks, and to miss that opportunity would lead to great difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is a new timetable and hope has been restored.  A new chain of events has been set in train, but we must keep a close eye on the weakest links in that chain.  The decommissioning and election issues are at the heart of the <Col N="1019" /> problem and they must not be mishandled. The Taoiseach must not break links with John Major, as happened previously. The British Government must deal with the Taoiseach, not with the plethora of committees and advisers or even with Ministers.  The one to one relationship must be maintained.  In that way the new beginning will not be false dawn, Dublin and London will not repeat the past mistakes and hope will be restored.  We all enjoyed peace when it existed and, as was evident from last Sunday's marches, we want it restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend previous speakers on their rational approach to the debate.  However, as regards the mistakes Deputy Brennan alleged were made by the Taoiseach and others, with the benefit of hindsight who is to say who made mistakes and when? What is alleged as a mistake afterwards may not be perceived to be so when the action is taken.  At least 3,000 mistakes were made in the past 25 years because at least 3,000 people died in a conflict on this island.  During that period countless efforts were made, without success, by Taoisigh, British Prime Minister and political leaders in Northern Ireland. Despite the repeated and valiant attempts of a large number of people, the problem has not been resolved.</P>
      <P>An important change has taken place since I first became a Member of this House in 1981.  In those days one regularly heard vitriolic political and nationalistic statements on all sides of the House, which were unhelpful.  Such statements only serve to aggravate the person on the other side and incite reaction. This House has matured in recent years in that such statements are no longer made.  As long as that attitude prevailed, those across the Irish Sea and in the North who looked to this House for leadership could be well excused for saying that we had nothing to offer in terms of recognising the other person's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was recently travelling to Donegal <Col N="1020" /> when I heard on the radio that the cessation of violence had come to an end and a short time later I heard the unfortunate and tragic news of the Canary Wharf bomb.  I remember the sickening despair and disbelief at what had happened.  People thought that violence was in the past and that there would not be a repetition of past mistakes. That, however, was not the case, and the violence was repeated a short time later.  That proves, if proof is needed, that mistakes may be repeated.</P>
    <P>It is important that everybody recognises another chance has been given for peace.  The most fundamental aspect of the communiqué is that a date has been agreed on which discussions will take place.  All sides must fulfil certain criteria in order to qualify for participation in those discussions.  The fact that the heads of two sovereign States have decided that talks will take place by a specific date is progress.  Between now and 10 June public representatives on both sides of the Irish Sea should say and do nothing to exacerbate the problem or create further dissension.</P>
    <P>The process so far has been very difficult. It is as a result of the combined efforts of successive Governments that we have reached the stage where a date could be set for all-party talks.</P>
    <P>People should not assume now that a date has been set everything will automatically fall into place.  Everybody must recognise that there must be compromise.  We have two different traditions in the North of Ireland, one with an affinity to the United Kingdom and the other with a distinct affinity to the South.  If there is to be a resolution accommodating those traditions it follows there must be compromise.  That was stated in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Downing Street Declaration and other documents that emanated from what has become known as the peace process in the past 14 or 15 months.</P>
    <P>Whether we have sufficiently matured to accept compromise remains to be seen.  We must recognise that it is not the prerogative of one nation, group <Col N="1021" /> or country to give civil and human rights to another.  Equality and civil and human rights are entitlements, not the prerogative of somebody, somehow, somewhere, vague or otherwise, to give to another.  That applies to Nationalist and Unionist populations in the North of Ireland.  If one group does not recognise the other's position, ultimately there can be no agreement.  If there is no agreement or compromise, the date set for all-party talks will pass and we will not achieve our objectives.</P>
    <P>It was my privilege to contribute to a similar debate in 1985 and to subsequent debates.  We should recognise the setting of 10 June as the date for all-party talks as a step in the right direction. We should try to meet the guidelines set down within that deadline. Between now and then all parties with a role to play should refrain by word and action from doing anything that would make the necessary meeting of minds more difficult at that time.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the constraints in terms of expressions of nationalism in this House.  In the UK and elsewhere a degree of maturity is also emerging in that regard.  It is not helpful at any time if representatives in the United Kingdom or in the North of Ireland spring to their feet to point out the inadequacies of the process and the failure to date to reach agreement.  We know that is the case.  After 25 years of violence we all recogise that.  At this late stage we do not need one representative poking a finger in another's eye to point out that everything is not rosy in the garden and that we are not at one on this issue.</P>
    <P>The question at issue is whether henceforth matters will be resolved by political negotiation or, if that fails, what other approach will be adopted. We must address that question.  If political negotiation, discussion and talking fails, what other method is there?  Over the years people said there were other ways, but they have not been proven.  It has been proven time and again that where politics cease to be effective or <Col N="1022" /> are not allowed to function, tragedy follows. We have had ample illustration of that in the past 25 years.  Some people suggest that political progress and various goals have not been achieved fast enough and that 14 or 15 months was sufficient time to achieve all of our goals.  If that were the case what is the alternative and what was it before this process commenced?</P>
    <P>The perceived alternative to political discussion and negotiation achieved nothing but bitterness and death.  I discount the suggestion in some quarters that if the politicians do not get their act together there is an alternative route. Politicians on this island, and those in the United Kingdom, recognise that much more can be achieved in the sphere of political negotiation and discussion than can ever be achieved by anybody else.  Alternative methods would cause only frustration and upset in regard to discussions.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers for achieving this success.  I was somewhat sceptical about it being achieved.  I did not think that we would reach agreement on a date.  This objective has been achieved as a result of the combined and concerted efforts of all involved in recent weeks, despite the interruption by violence. It is the responsibility of everyone involved to ensure that this opportunity does not pass.  If it does, it may be a long time before anybody on any side gets an opportunity to restart and proceed with the same process.</P>
    <P>Emphasis must be placed on recognising the other side's position and a willingness to compromise.  If one side does not recognise the other's position, there can be no willingness to compromise. There is a will to travel the path of peace.  We have tasted peace in the past 14 or 15 months.  At this stage, even the people involved in violence must recognise there are tremendous benefits to be gained from the peaceful approach and what will be lost if it is not pursued. It is easy to set off a bomb and cause loss of life, but it is very difficult to negotiate peace afterwards.  Far from <Col N="1023" /> the resumption of the bombing campaign accelerating progress towards peace, ironically the move towards peace was tragically interrupted by the resumption of hostilities.  I hope a lesson has been learned from that.</P>
    <P>I compliment all involved here and the British Prime Minister for having the courage, in difficult domestic circumstances, to proceed along the route now charted.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 7, 41, 48 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The removal of the compulsory requirement that cattle must be pre-movement tested for TB within two months of movement has to be seen as part of the development of additional responsibility to farmers in protecting their own herds under the new arrangements. Herdowners can continue to test cattle prior to movement, while those buying cattle can insist on purchasing animals which have been pre-movement tested and/or can have cattle tested after purchase.  The new arrangements include measures which will encourage farmers to arrange pre and possibly post movement tests of cattle on a voluntary basis.  The practical arrangements for identifying the status of pre-movement tested cattle at marts is the subject of ongoing discussions with the mart organisations.</P>
      <P>The availability of higher reactor compensation and market forces will provide an adequate incentive to carry out pre-movement testing, as deemed appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that compulsory pre-movement testing has operated since October 1978, while the disease incidence has not fallen since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four main farming organisations &mdash; the IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Féirme &mdash; have indicated their agreement, in principle, to the new arrangements for the disease eradication schemes and to participate in the national TB Forum.  There are a number of specific issues outstanding which will be dealt with by the forum which I am establishing to advise, review and make recommendations on the operation of <Col N="1025" /> the new arrangements.  Discussions are continuing with the Irish Veterinary Union.</P>
    <P>The information requested regarding the results of tests in herds contiguous to privately tested herds which disclosed reactors is not readily available.  As I already indicated in a reply to a previous question, this information is being extracted and will be conveyed to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify precisely the percentage of bovine TB outbreaks that are due to transmission of disease from cattle in neighbouring herds. While most serious bovine TB outbreaks occur in herds which are contiguous to other restricted herds, a number of different sources of infection could give rise to this pattern.  Research in this area would indicate that disease transmission from neighbouring herds by lateral spread may be of the order of 23-25 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has now admitted that henceforth farmers will be forced to undertake a pre-movement or post-purchase test &mdash; whichever classification one likes to apply &mdash; to comply with his proposed regulations, has he any estimate of their future extra costs in providing their own herd tests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the position, the change will not be compulsory.  Through the TB Forum, we intend to pay a higher rate of reactor grant and compensation to those farmers who undertake pre-movement testing, the levels of that higher compensation will be determined by the TB Forum which has yet to meet.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the previous annual cost of pre-movement testing was of the order of £4 million, so it will cost a good deal less than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the cost to farmers of paying for their own annual herd tests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1026" />
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Between TB and brucellosis, the estimated annual cost will be of the order of £14 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister is now confirming to the House that farmers will be expected to incur an extra £14 million on their annual herd testing. While I know the Minister will say there will be savings on levies they would otherwise have to pay, will he agree that smaller farmers will suffer most since they rarely sell anything other than store cattle, especially in the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The best estimate I have is that the levies will be reduced by £18 million and that the cost of the annual test will be £14 million, entailing a saving of £4 million.  This year we will pay for the tags, which will involve a saving for farmers of £2.5 million in addition to which there will be savings on pre-movement testing.  I assure farmers that one of the key elements of the change is that all the levies they will pay will be reimbursed to them, all of it for compensation.</P>

In addition, he mentioned that this year there will be a saving to farmers of £2.5 million through the provision of tags.

      <Col N="1027" /> On the matter of numbers of reactors identified, how many reactors were found in herds which had been identified as reactor herds resulting from pre-movement testing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter, I think the figure is that, out of some 57,000 herds, fewer than 500 per annum were identified, taking one year with another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 13 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce a &ldquo;new residue test&rdquo;.  Laboratories engaged in official residue analysis in Ireland use methods prescribed for such purpose by relevant Council decisions.  Analytical methods and techniques are constantly evolving and being improved and these <Col N="1029" /> developments are followed by the laboratories engaged in official analysis.  In all cases the method and sample matrix chosen are those most likely to yield positive results if the animal has been illegally treated.  A recent newspaper report suggested that, by selection of less sensitive methods or matrix, the incidence of proven illegal treatment is reduced.  This most certainly is not the case.</P>
    <P>Over and above what is required by EU law Ireland has introduced a screening programme using the Enfer test on bile, which enables the rapid testing of a large number of carcasses in meat plants to be carried out.  This provides an excellent monitor on substance abuse and important intelligence in relation to suspected abusers, which can be followed up by necessary action at farm level.  A total of 75,771 such tests were carried out in 1995.</P>
    <P>In addition tests are also carried out in the meat plants in accordance with an EU random sampling programme and a policy of testing suspect carcasses.  In this instance the retina &mdash; an excellent matrix for detecting clenbuterol &mdash; muscle particularly at an injection site &mdash; pellets extracted from carcases, or liver are used for testing and a total of 4,412 such tests were carried out in 1995.</P>
    <P>A total of 57 seizures of illegal animal growth promoters were made in the last three years, details of which are set out in Table 1, which I am circulating in the Official Report.  Arising from these seizures eight persons have been convicted, a further 43 cases are before the courts and the remaining six cases are being prepared for referral to the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    <P>In 1995, a total of 80,183 samples were taken at meat processing plants and tested for the presence of illegal growth promoters.  As I have already stated, 75,771 of these were tested under a screening programme, which yielded 1,659 suspect results.  A total of 402 samples (0.5 per cent) tested were confirmed positive for beta-agonist or hormonal growth promoters.  The numbers of samples taken at each plant are set <Col N="1030" /> down in Table 2 which I am circulating. As I publicly indicated on 22 February, I propose to adopt the necessary legal powers to enable me to publish the test results for individual plants.</P>
    <P>In the case of the positive findings, the carcases involved are denatured and condemned.  Because of the nature of operations in meat plants, there are difficulties in relation to the proving of evidence to the level beyond all reasonable doubt necessary to sustain a successful criminal prosecution.  Where the necessary evidence appears to be available, proceedings will be instituted and four of the 1995 cases are currently under investigation with a view to prosecution. The positive findings have yielded valuable intelligence in relation to the uses of growth promoters, have led to on-farm checks and in many cases have resulted in prosecutions for use or possession of illegal substances.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister will try to provide that information.</P>
      <P>On the question of tests, is the eyeball test which can be carried out on the spot by veterinary surgeons when they are inspecting carcases not more reliable than the Enfer test?  Would the Minister consider introducing the eyeball test on all carcases as the veterinary surgeon can reach a decision there and then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have plans to introduce further testing.  The screening under the Enfer test is the most extensive anywhere in Europe.  On the residual criminal ring element involved in using growth promoters, I am advised that the practice is not that widespread and we want to let people who have information give it on a confidential basis.  I am introducing legislation that will allow the names of factories which may be used as a conduit for the animals to be published.  The screening test results I have seen show a great disparity between factories.</P>
      <P>The other problem is that the names of some cattle producers are bogus &mdash; Elvis Presley type names or untraceable Paddy Murphy type names are being given.  This means that where we detect a positive test we cannot proceed.  I am determined to stamp that out.  We are introducing new regulations that will make it mandatory on meat factories to provide solid evidence of the source of the animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of the most serious problems affecting the meat industry and it is important that the Minister should clarify further points.  Does the Minister intend to introduce the eyeball test, as it is known, which can be performed on every carcase by the factories' inspecting veterinary surgeons?  He said he will publish a list of plants but will the plants be responsible or will responsibility lie with those who supply the meat plants?  Would it not be more appropriate to publish the names of <Col N="1033" /> those who supply the factories and if the meat plants are found to be involved, publish their name?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>By publishing the names of the factories, will mean they will have to put new procedures in place and be a great deal more choosy about the agents and people who supply cattle to them especially where there are fictitious names.  They will have to be satisfied they can trace the animals.  I met with representatives of the meat industry yesterday on this issue and I made it clear to them that I am not prepared to consider their representations to drop this point because I believe it is the effective way of ensuring that this practice is stamped out.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the accuracy of the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 25 of Wednesday, 11 October 1995; if not, the reason this incorrect information was given to Dáil Éireann; the proceedings that have been instituted for the recovery of sums fraudulently obtained by beef processing companies selling beef into intervention; and the reason Ireland did not fulfil its obligations in this respect, imposed by Article 8 of Council Regulation 729/70.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4751/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the wording of the reply to the Parliamentary Question No. 25 of Wednesday, 11 October 1995 was inaccurate.  However, it was not my intention to mislead the House and I have apologised to the Ceann <Col N="1034" /> Comhairle and do so now to the Members of the House.  The correct response should have been that my Department had taken steps through the office of the Chief State Solicitor to institute legal proceedings for the recovery of the funds in relation to Rathkeale AIBP.  Indeed, I conveyed this to the House in response to supplementary questioning as the record shows.</P>
      <P>I understand that proceedings in this matter were issued yesterday.</P>
      <P>The Commission services have proposed a financial correction based on their view that the Irish authorities did not fulfil obligations arising in Article 8 of Regulation 729/70.  This is a general rather than a specific correction and arises because of the Commission view that deficiencies in control arrangements led to some loss of EU funds which it did not quantify.</P>
      <P>I have not contested the fact that there were inadequacies in the control functions having regard to the massive and unprecedented intake of intervention beef in 1990 and 1991.  These control inadequacies were recognised in the beef tribunal report.  However, the tribunal fully accepted that the control improvements begun in 1990 and continued into 1991 and 1992 went very far in dealing with the weaknesses of the controls system.  For this and other reasons I have argued that the level of correction &mdash; that is the time proposed &mdash; is disproportionately high.</P>
      <P>The obligation to recover sums which can be shown to have been lost as a result of irregularities or negligence is being discharged in accordance with legal advice available to me.</P>
      <P>As indicated I am in the process of seeking the recovery of sums in one case and am working in consultation with our legal advisers with a view to instituting further proceedings aimed at the recovery of other sums lost due to alleged irregularities in the beef industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his apology to the Ceann Comhairle and, presumably, to everyone else but he omitted to apologise to <Col N="1035" /> the Deputy to whom he gave the wrong information &mdash; we will pass over that.</P>
      <P>The Minister repeated the wrong information in his reply to the supplementary questions I asked on that day when he said, as reported in column 1793, Volume 456 of the Official Report: &ldquo;This is why we have instituted legal proceedings.&rdquo;, using in each case the past tense about proceedings that had actually started.  We now discover that instead of having started prior to 11 October 1995, the proceedings were instituted yesterday.  Were the proceedings instituted in respect of Rathkeale only and was it in respect of only one of the frauds in Rathkeale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the latter question first, the proceedings instituted yesterday relate to Rathkeale boning hall.  I am advised by the legal officers of the State that similar steps will be taken in a matter of days, I hope within a week, in relation to the Shannon Meats Cannery. That is the best advice available to me.</P>
      <P>May I refer the Deputy to what I said when responding to supplementary questions on that day.  In column 1792, Volume 456 of the Official Report of 11 October 1995 I said:</P>
      <P>Consequently, on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, the Department has taken steps through the office of the Chief State Solicitor to institute legal proceedings for the recovery of the funds.</P>
      <P>Today I apologised to all Members, including Deputy O'Malley.  I will go through the detail of this matter.  We wrote to the Attorney General about it on 11 October 1994, we sent a reminder in November 1994 and we were advised in February 1995 that a barrister had been appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a minute dated 23 February 1995 issued to the Chief State Solicitor's office setting out the facts and asking that legal proceedings be instituted, we asked that regular progress reports be sent to us as proceedings are proposed.  I <Col N="1036" /> have investigated the matter thoroughly and will set out what happened.  The barrister who was appointed was sent several reminders by the Chief State Solicitor's office, assured us it would be done and some considerable time later said he was too busy to do it.  Subsequently, another barrister was appointed and he issued proceedings and further proceedings in regard to the cannery are due to take place.  I am determined to expedite all aspects of proceedings and I regret the delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister now intend to take proceedings in respect of irregularities, frauds and misappropriations by these companies in factories other than Rathkeale, because there are dozens of others?  Will he tell the House why his Department did not comply with the obligations placed on it by article 8 of the regulation in question where it is stated that the member state shall recover sums lost, as a result of irregularities or negligence, and prevent and deal with irregularities?  In particular, will he explain to the House why he allowed this country to come within the sole exception set out in paragraph 2 of article 8: namely, that the European Union will bear all losses relating to this with the sole exception of the consequences of irregularities or negligence attributable to administrative authorities or other bodies of the member state?  In other words, if his Department had fulfilled the duties cast on it by this article, no fine would have resulted and the European Union would have been content to bear any losses that arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very significant point because Deputy O'Malley said here today, at the Committee of Public Accounts last week and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that there would be no fine if we had recovered the individual fines.  I want to make it absolutely clear that in all discussions I have had in regard to the unenviable job of trying to mitigate this fine, at no stage has it been said by any commissioner, any chef de cabinet or any technical services officer of the <Col N="1037" /> Commission that the issue of recoverability has been in any way relevant to the mitigation of the fine.  It is factually incorrect and untrue to say there would not be a fine if we had proposed recoverability.</P>
      <P>The second issue is that the largest fine is unspecific, general and not quantified to any particular meat plant.  It follows an article 9 inquiry in relation to general problems in terms of the control function.  That is the particular difficulty. Therefore, it is not open to me to institute proceedings other than in the instance of recovering specific losses relating to specific breach of contracts under EU rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not do that?  The first proceedings we had, in spite of what the House was told incorrectly last year, was yesterday. They were only issued yesterday because this question was tabled for answer today and the Minister could not come back in.  I hope the Minister will answer that question.  I also want an answer on the following matter.  Article 8, paragraph 2, states: &mdash; in spite of what was said to him &mdash;&ldquo;in the absence of total recovery the financial consequences of irregularities or negligence shall be borne by the Community with the exception of the consequences of irregularities&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that question. It relates to specific fines and that is the case in relation to Rathkeale.  If there is any inference by the Deputy that I failed to act other than rigorously against Mr. Goodman and the Goodman group, my ministerial record will refute it as it will show that there has been a rigorous, relentless and ruthless <Col N="1038" /> pursuit of Mr. Goodman and his company over and above any previous Minister. I have instituted the proceedings.  I have been in constant touch with the legal officers to institute proceedings not only against Rathkeale but against Shannon Meats.  I will also take any other proceedings that are necessary.</P>
      <P>I have written to the Director of Public Prosecutions to see if he will bring any case in relation to the statements made about the Rathkeale case.  Also &mdash; and the Deputy would not be aware of this &mdash; I recently authorised raids on a particular Goodman plant in the Border region in respect of allegations of abuse concerning illegal substances.  As Minister for the past 15 months, knowing what I know now about Mr. Goodman, and following the exasperating experience I have had in dealing with files relating to intervention and export refunds, I would shed no tears if Mr. Goodman was to withdraw from the beef industry.  As far as I am concerned he is the major culprit for the tarnishing of the beef industry and the damage that has been done to our international reputation.  I am in the invidious position of having to go around the corridors in Brussels trying to defend the good name of Ireland, because of the malpractice of the past, by not only Mr. Goodman but other people in the beef industry.  This is totally unacceptable and I assure the Deputy that I will be unrelenting in doing everything I can to discharge the functions of my office and the wider legal services of the Government to pursue Mr. Goodman fully, properly and effectively.</P>

Now that six have been charged, five of whom have pleaded guilty, will the Minister, in view of his statement just now &mdash; which I greatly welcome and appreciate &mdash; take steps to ensure that this person or persons unknown, with whom these five people conspired, is prosecuted?  The five employees did not gain anything by this conspiracy, it was the person or persons unknown who gained by it and who should be prosecuted.</P>

As far as I was concerned this was a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to whom I wrote, in the strongest possible terms, suggesting that all the facilities of my Department, or any other information that could assist in the direction the Deputy has alluded to, would be provided. The Director of Public Prosecutions replied to me in terms that did not encourage me to believe there would be such further prosecutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 27 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Total exports of live cattle to date this year have declined by 42 per cent.  Live exports to EU countries have fallen by 68 per cent in the same period.</P>
      <P>The decline in live exports to the European Union is due to high calf prices here relative to those in other member states arising largely from strong demand from dairy farmers with milk quota problems.</P>
      <P>The fall in live exports to third countries reflects the difficulties being experienced by Irish exporters on the Egyptian market following the various cuts in export refunds since last autumn and growing competition from Australian cattle.  I brought this development to the attention of Commissioner Fischler in the context of the meeting of the Agriculture Council earlier this week.  In my discussion with the Commissioner, I made it clear that the Commission policy on export refunds risked the loss of traditional and significant markets, such as Egypt.</P>
      <P>I pressed the Commissioner for a very early increase in refunds, either generally or on a selective basis, to eliminate that risk.  The Commission is considering my request and at the beef management committee meeting tomorrow my officials will press this issue strongly on my instructions.  I remain fully supportive of the role of the live export trade in providing fair competition in the cattle sector.  Over the past year I have devoted considerable effort to updating animal transport rules in order to provide a sound basis for the maintenance of the live trade.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister fully aware of the difficulties faced by 14,000 winter finishers, 5,000 of whom are specialists?  Is he aware of the situation of 40,000 beef farmers, who have an average income of less than £4,000 a year, and how does he propose to assist them?</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture is, at this minute, meeting Commissioner Fischler and making a strong case for beef farmers.  How many members of the Council of Ministers has the Minister met since the last meeting to explain our special case?  What response did he receive when he referred to our total reliance on beef exports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in Paris on Monday and I met and had detailed discussions with the French Minister there.  I also met the German, Austrian, Greek and Portuguese Ministers.  We had a long conversation exclusively about beef and we discussed the need to support consumption in terms of a promotion fund and the need to get prices up through an increase in refunds.  I had detailed discussions with the highest ranking official in DG6 on this issue on Monday and I also spoke to Commissioner Fischler.</P>
      <P>The situation is difficult.  Prices are rising or have not dropped in the rest of Europe and there is no justification for a price drop in Ireland.  They advised me that, after next month, the medium-term trend to meet the GATT requirement for the remainder of the GATT year, that is to 1 July, is downwards on refunds with longer validity periods. These are all very difficult developments and we must realise that the value of the beef premium is of the order of 28p to 30p a pound weight. Before CAP reform started, the price was 99p a pound and the premium was 4.5p.  Now, the price of beef is approximately the same and the premium is worth almost 30p.  The Commission feels raw material prices were to drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to secure a short-term <Col N="1042" /> measure regarding an increase in live refunds.  In relation to beef, the Commission is unlikely to increase the level of prefixation which has been so heavy in recent weeks.  However, we are making a sustained case, in conjunction with the British, to secure an increase in live refunds in Ireland, particularly to restore competitiveness in the Egyptian market.  France is seeking a similar measure in relation to cow beef.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little solace for beef farmers in the Minister's reply. Will the Minister accept that the fall in cattle prices coincided with the unbelievable decrease in the level of export refunds?  Will he accept that in allowing competition to decline he is playing into the hands of the factories? What does the Minister plan to do to restore competition between the live and carcase trades?  I do not want a history of the situation but to find out the Minister's plans for the future.  How and when does the Minister propose to restore viability to many farmers who, the Minister must agree at this stage, are threatened with ruin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of getting an increased level of competition, I am trying to secure an increase specifically in live refunds while the slaughter premium is in place to ensure a level playing pitch.  The meat factories might pay more if there was increased market activity by the live shippers.</P>
      <P>We are keeping the position under very close review.  The difficulties of this winter will be a singularly important lesson for everybody that the price of calves and store cattle must move in line with real market expectations in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has changed his tune since last November when he suggested that cattle prices would not fall when export refunds were reduced.  Although we had doubts at that time, this led people to believe that prices would not fall.  Is the Minister aware that cattle are selling at £1 a pound and that £1.05 is required at least <Col N="1043" /> to break even?  Will the Minister accept that his action in agreeing to the decrease in export refunds has damaged or perhaps lost the Egyptian market?  It is implicit in the Minister's reply to an earlier question that he accepts it is difficult to regain a market once it is lost.</P>
      <P>The Minister should stop preaching the fallacy of live horse and get grass. He should not send a heavily damaged industry down another <i>cul de sac</i>.  Does the Minister agree the position in relation to the beef industry, particularly winter finishers, is now regarded as an emergency?  The Minister has failed and he is telling me he will fail tomorrow to secure an increase in export refunds.  Is there any way the Government can assist the many beef farmers threatened with bankruptcy? The matter is in the Minister's hands. The farmers depend on him.  He is their only chance of survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of the Common Agricultural Policy is that national aids are not allowed.  I do not have an indication yet as to what the position will be tomorrow.  The Secretary in my Department was in Brussels on Tuesday and he held further discussions with the senior officials to whom I spoke on Monday. We are making a sustained effort.  I did not say that prices would not fall; I said they should not fall.  Meat factories increased their profit margins and did not pay a price which was justified.  They effectively swallowed up the value of the slaughter premium themselves and I was most critical of their action.  This is why I am trying to get the live trade more in play.</P>
      <P>I have had detailed discussions with the live trade and, while there is a difficulty with Egypt, contracts are being signed in Libya.  Given there is no intervention &mdash; and hopefully there will be no return to it &mdash; and a surplus of EU production over consumption of 400,000 tonnes per annum in Europe, the live trade is the best way to pick up matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody should be in any doubt about the overall problem.  This is the first <Col N="1044" /> year of the implementation of the GATT quota.  It had implications which some of the best people in the market did not foresee.  If the Deputy is trying to blame me, I would point out that we resisted the changes at all stages. However, this issue is within the competence of the Commission; it is not a matter for the Council of Ministers because these aspects were signed away some time ago.  We consistently staked out a position, due to the fact that we are 70 per cent dependent on third countries, and we will continue to do so. I am fully aware of the difficulties of individual producers to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister appears pessimistic with regard to refunds &mdash; although the situation he outlined is not the true position &mdash; and the fact that we have lost, or are in danger of losing, the Egyptian market if something is not done about refunds, what efforts has he made to find alternative markets for the cattle destined for Egypt?  What progress has he made with regard to Turkey, which I raised on a number of occasions?</P>
      <P>In his reply earlier, the Minister stated that Irish prices have dropped while prices in mainland Europe have increased or remained static.  What action has he taken to find out the cause of this and to ensure it does not happen again?  When the Minister met representatives of the factories earlier this week with regard to hormones, did he raise the pricing structure and the cartel which is now operating?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and progress was made.  They have three definitions of cattle, those for breeding, fattening and slaughter, and quarantine requirements were sought for cattle for slaughter. This was not possible, given that cattle shippers buy them in marts and are not in a position to guarantee quarantine. This condition has been dropped and we are pursuing other aspects of the matter with the trade to try to open up that market.  Obviously there are close ethnic, trade and political links between Turkey and Germany, and I am not overstating the market opportunities there, but my Department and the veterinary authority will do everything possible to assist.</P>
      <P>In relation to the differential between prices in Europe and in Ireland, our prices are currently approximately 75 per cent of the intervention price and prices on the Continent are approximately 87 per cent of the intervention price.  I had detailed discussions with the officials in DG6 about this matter on Monday.  They said that was equivalent to a 16 per cent differential in refunds and felt that European traders could source their beef in Ireland because of its cheapness.  There is usually a 10 per cent differential between European beef prices and Irish prices based on transport, fat trims and so on.  At prevailing prices Irish beef is extremely competitive on all markets.  The questions that have arisen can be validly addressed to the meat factories and I have availed of every opportunity in recent weeks to tell them that they could have paid a higher price than they did.</P>

      <Quest>the number of applicants who will be paid for the REP scheme in 1996 in view of the previous statement made by him and the Minister of State at his Department.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Current projections are that more than 20,000 applicants will have been accepted into REPS and received payment by the end of 1996.  I am keeping the funding of REPS under close review with a view to ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet the expected demand.  I can assure the Deputy that the scheme will be funded adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister's reply because in my estimation it would cost approximately £80 million to accommodate the present level of applications.  I understand only £40 million has been provided for the scheme in 1996.  I know the goal posts have been changed slightly, perhaps to allow each applicant receive a small amount, but will the Minister accept that the scheme has failed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I assure the Deputy that we attach great importance to this scheme.  We see it as a real money-spinner for many farm families, particularly those in the dry stock sector.  Of all the <Col N="1047" /> prevailing direct income schemes, I am more optimistic about this scheme getting support from Brussels than I am of renewal of Structural Funds.  If the Deputy is referring to the recent announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who has responsibility for the REPS, problems have arisen, unfortunately, in regard to an audit of 5 per cent of cases approved. We gave desk top approvals to REPS applicants and, given earlier difficulties with regard to the beef industry, I am determined to ensure that any successor of mine is not left with a legacy of disallowances and maladministration because of inadequate staff levels to deal with a torrent of applications &mdash; approximately 300 per week.</P>
      <P>I have asked my officials to, first, put in place immediate measures to check up on faulty plans, some of which involved technical breaches of the scheme &mdash; and that is a generous term &mdash; and, second, to ensure that in the lifetime of every plan there is proper compliance and checking, including farm inspections.  That probably means I will have to bring to Cabinet a dossier on funding, staffing and adequate measures to put in place a more foolproof checking system.  I am working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and my colleagues to ensure that this scheme can progress and be successful. I do not deny there is a shortfall in funding. I did not deny it the last time I answered questions in the House, but I assure the Deputy I do not see any legal basis for the suspension of the scheme. I have a strong case to put to Cabinet to ensure adequate funding on the three to one basis involving only 25 per cent from the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a strong case and I hope he is successful in his attempts to put it forward.  Will the Minister agree that many people, such as CFP applicants, were fooled into thinking they would be considered for the scheme?  I agree with the Minister <Col N="1048" /> that every case should be fully monitored but that should not be used as an excuse not to pay people.  There must be balance.  Why does the Government spend hundreds of millions of pounds on remedial action involving a general environmental clean-up when the Minister cannot obtain an additional £10 million, which would be further supplemented by £30 million from the EU? As the Minister said, endless amounts of money seem to be available from Europe for this worth-while scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made the point about the requirement for funding. The measures taken on fraud, strictness and checking are entirely separate and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is dealing with that.  It is my responsibility to discuss with the Minister for Finance the effectiveness of this scheme and ensure adequate resources are made available.  Given that the broad rule of thumb is that for every State scheme which puts money into people's pockets, approximately 22 per cent of that money comes back in taxation, and given that 75 per cent of this scheme is funded from Europe, there is a cost effective, economic case to be made in regard to it.  The money has not run out.  There is no need for panic and, at the appropriate time, the Government will address the funding issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister control his public relations machine in the interests of reality?  Why was it necessary for the Minister to change the goal posts in regard to payments?  I am not referring to the need for monitoring, with which I agree.  Did the Minister fail to get the money at Cabinet even though he had a better case for funding than some of his other colleagues in Government?  Will the Minister give an assurance that the 12,000 to 14,000 REPS applicants in 1996 will be paid in 1996 if they are eligible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the sequence of events for the Deputy.  A check was carried out on 5 per cent of applicants <Col N="1049" /> and almost half were found to be ineligible. They may have used a neighbour's farm or taken out land 100 miles away.  Serious breaches of the scheme occurred in addition to technical breaches.  If we were to ignore those findings and continue to give approvals, we would inevitably face disallowance in the future.  The problem had to be nipped in the bud.  I was then told that if I wanted to prove the validity of every plan, there would not be any more approvals this year, and all 11,000 applications would be held up.  That was not acceptable to me so, rather than advancing full payment, on average approximately £3,550, I decided to give half the payment on the date of approval with the other half to be paid six months later, during which time additional checking could be done.  People would not be at the loss of any money and it would allow the scheme to continue while putting in place a proper checking system.</P>

      <P>There were no hares or <Col N="1050" /> greyhounds killed at the national coursing meeting held in Clonmel on 5-7 February 1996 nor were there any reports of serious injuries to either hares or greyhounds.  Officials from my Department who attended the meeting reported that the standard of coursing was exceptionally good and the welfare of hares and greyhounds was of paramount concern to the organisers of the event.</P>
      <P>New control measures, including the muzzling of greyhounds, were introduced in 1993-94 with the intention of working towards the elimination of the kill.  These measures have worked satisfactorily in keeping hare killings and injuries to an absolute minimum.  All greyhounds participating in authorised coursing meetings are muzzled and there is good supervision of hares prior to during and after a coursing event.  I am continuing to monitor developments in this regard and I am satisfied with the considerable progress that has already been made to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State taking this question seriously when he states that the organisers of coursing events, such as the one held in Clonmel, have the welfare of hares at heart?  Does he accept that the issue of cruelty to and the abuse of animals is a serious and important one?  Does he agree with the view, which I share and which is based on a great deal of study, that there is a thin line between cruelty to and the abuse of children and cruelty to and abuse of defenceless animals; that the issue of the so-called blood sports where unnecessary suffering is inflicted on animals for the sole purpose of entertainment must be re-examined by any Minister who claims to be acting responsibly in this area; that the time has come to bring to an end the snaring and capture of gentle and inoffensive animals and their removal from their natural habitat so as to subject them to terror and suffering on the coursing fields?  Will the Minister of State give me a serious response to that question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always taken this subject seriously and made some practical proposals when the Deputy presented a Private Members' Bill over two years ago.  The ICC and coursing fraternity take the issue of animal welfare seriously.  A coursing meeting in Listowel was postponed because the hares had an infection.  When it was subsequently held no hare was killed.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of muzzling more than 1,000 hares were killed annually. Last year 30 hares were killed and five injured.  In 1993-94 when muzzling was introduced 267 hares were killed. This shows that there has been a considerable improvement in the statistics. I am satisfied with the trend and that, with improved veterinary supervision and husbandry of hares while in captivity, we can eliminate the kill from coursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that, even if the number of hares killed is 30, when removed from their natural habitat hares are subjected to unnecessary suffering &mdash; they feel terror and stressed in the same way humans do &mdash; when pursued on the coursing fields by greyhounds and that the only way to prevent this treatment of inoffensive animals is to introduce drag coursing where no live bait is used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Drag coursing meetings are popular and run successfully in many parts of the country.  On the issue of hare welfare, as long as there are hares, there will be coursing.  No other section of the community looks after hares or their habitats better or is more concerned about their welfare than the coursing fraternity.  There are people who are concerned about animal welfare, but they do not do anything to propagate the hare population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drag hunting would probably be a desired option, but the coursing fraternity prefer hare coursing.  As someone who represents a rural constituency and is familiar with coursing, I have seen hares after they have been coursed. <Col N="1052" /> They relax rapidly once inside &ldquo;the escape&rdquo;, sit down and eat grass.</P>
    <P>There are several aspects to the animal welfare question.  There is cruelty at abattoirs, if one wants to define it as such.  Three years ago I sought the introduction of standards.  I am happy that these are being imposed and complied with at coursing meetings.</P>

Does he agree that, after an interval as long as four years, it is unacceptable that no proceedings have been instituted even though there is a clear case of fraud involving public funds?  As someone who has followed this saga for many years and was one of the first to raise it in this House, it seems that what the Minister said earlier about a certain individual is probably true, but the most disturbing aspect is that his Department, prior to his coming on the scene, colluded with that individual and allowed him to get away with God knows how many things for many years.  Will he ensure that this is brought to an end once and for all and that every effort is made to recover the sums due by this individual so that they do not have to be paid by the taxpayer after the individual had enriched himself at their expense by tens, if not scores, of millions of pounds?</P>

      <P>The tribunal found that yields in excess of 68 per cent &mdash; this was admitted by the Goodman organisation &mdash; were not made known to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I have been advised that the evidence given at the tribunal would not be accepted as court evidence.  On 5 May a senior official of my Department wrote to the Attorney General's office.  The procedure followed is that we get legal advice and if it is decided to institute proceedings the matter is referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office.  In this case, information has been sent to and fro based on the advice of the senior counsel that a certain type of evidence is required.  I cannot give too many details as I might prejudice the case.  I <Col N="1054" /> spoke to senior law officers of the State this morning and have arranged to submit a letter stating that having regard to the statute of limitations consideration I want all possible legal redress put in place.  The secretary of the Department is not reluctant to assist me on this matter, he dispatched letters and so on.  I am advised the amount of money involved may be small.  However, the Department is committed to addressing the matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the number of years that may elapse, I have been advised that actions could not be taken while the tribunal was in session but that a legal process has been in train since it ended.

I will give an example of my dealings with Mr. Goodman and his companies on export refunds which predate the intervention misdemeanours in Rathkeale.  I sanctioned the largest forfeiture of assets since our accession to Europe in respect of the Goodman organisation.  I am not reluctant to adduce the necessary evidence but as the tribunal found, and we spelt out in the letter of 5 May to the Attorney General's office, such proof <Col N="1055" /> would not be enough to institute proceedings to effect recoveries.

Can he assure the House that the extraordinary delays in the recoveries are not related to the Attorney General's office?  Will he also bear in mind that the Committee of Public Accounts regularly deals with cases involving the dismissal of officials for stealing a few hundred pounds while there is evidence of officials in his Department colluding in the misappropriation of huge sums of money and frauds that have led to enormous losses to the State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the conclusions of the beef tribunal one would have expected the Garda and the DPP to institute proceedings.  Apart from the concern in Rathkeale no proceedings have been brought in respect of principals nor in regard to the 68 per cent yield issue.  The Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson, has nothing to do with this. The matter is being dealt with by the senior legal officer in the office who is being advised by an outside senior counsel who has submitted a memorandum. I am not satisfied that office is to blame for all the delays, our Department should have acted with alacrity in certain cases.  With the statute of limitations deadline only a few months away, I am pursuing the matter expeditiously and almost ruthlessly, but I do not wish to raise expectations that huge sums of money may be recovered. If anything the legal advice tends towards the opposite view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> I will be happy to answer further questions on disciplinary proceedings taken against staff members.  I normally interact with secretaries and assistant secretaries in the Department and I have not found a shred of evidence of collusion with Mr. Goodman or his organisation at that level.  I resent the damage done to my Department by Mr. Goodman in terms of perceived associations. It is a sad day when a unit of public administration can be pursued through the gutter by people who were involved in clear fraud in Rathkeale.  As long as I am Minister I will do everything possible to assert the good name of my Department and of decent and honest civil servants.  If others have been involved in any level of complicity then I am happy to be accountable to the House, while civil servants or public officers can be dealt with under the procedures of due process and fairness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have set out in the following table the detailed information requested.  In <Col N="1057" /> summary, by end January 1996, approximately 9,300 of the 18,500 applications received had been fully processed while 4,200 of the remaining applicants had been invited to submit drawings showing existing and proposed buildings, together where necessary with planning permission and consents.  Similar action in relation to the remaining 5,000 applications commenced on 12 February and will be completed within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> Funds earmarked for 1996 and 1997 have been increased from approximately £20 million to approximately £60 million.  The funds required to grant aid applications on hands which mature for payment will be provided but the reopening of the scheme to new applicants is not currently envisaged as there is a limit on the Structural Funds available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that the 650 applications from Cavan farmers submitted to his Department prior to 27 April last year will be approved at an early date? Given the severe drainage difficulties and the intensity of their agricultural production, special consideration should be given to new applications from Cavan farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to grant approval to all applications by Easter.  To this end, I have released the remaining 5,000 applications and given instructions to the FDS offices to process them with due haste, particularly for farmers who <Col N="1059" /> have section 12 notices from local authorities or have genuine and urgent reasons to proceed with the work.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there would not be a legal basis for reopening the scheme in Cavan and not doing so in the other 25 counties.  In the unlikely event of Spain, Greece and Portugal not expending their Structural Funds and of extra money becoming available, I will be happy to lodge a claim for additional funding at the midterm review.  I cannot reopen schemes unless I have adequate funding.  I have already transferred all the moneys from the Structural Fund inflator and infrastructural funding for forestry roads to the control of farm pollution scheme and I cannot transfer any other funds to it.  It would be wrong of me to make false assertions about reopening the scheme but if an opportunity arises to reopen it I will be only too delighted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the efforts he made to approve applications as quickly as possible. Some applicants will not be able to draw down funding under REPS if they do not get some other grant aid, even at some stage in the future.  This applies particularly to farmers in Cavan-Monaghan who do not have slurry facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, who has made constant representations to me, will be aware that I have secured extra staff to deal with this issue.  When the scheme was suspended on 27 April last, a total of 1,058 applications had been received from Cavan farmers.  Thirty-five of these were withdrawn, giving a net total of 1,023 applications, while the number of approvals to date is 420.  I will ask the district superintendent to do everything possible to expedite the remaining applications.  I succeeded in extending the REPS rule from one to three years for CFP scheme work and there should be no problem in relation to entitlement under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister seek further funds for the scheme at the midterm review?  As Deputy Crawford said, people will be debarred from taking up REPS.  Given the commitment shown by him and the EU to REPS, will the Minister seek extra funding to allow those who are debarred to come into the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I have to live within the resources available, and these resources come from the Structural Funds.  I will not rehash last year's debate on the Structural Funds debacle except to say I cannot work the miracle of the loaves and fishes on this issue.  I have given the CFP scheme the highest priority and I will avail of any future opportunity which arises to secure extra funding. With the benefit of hindsight, the rate of grant aid at 60 per cent was probably too high and it blew a fuse in terms of over demand.  It would have been fairer to have a lower grant rate so that everyone could apply.  Those decisions were made before I took up office.  If the scheme was to be reintroduced the rate of grant would be lower so as to ensure that everyone would get something.  If an opportunity presents itself to reopen the scheme I will do so but I cannot give any such commitment at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>if, in addition to the other problems regarding export refunds and losses from winter fattening of steers, his attention has been drawn to the fact that animals which have had to be legally retagged have been denied eligibility for slaughter premium, the total losses arising from denial of slaughter premium in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Regulations governing the deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme state that only those male cattle that qualified for, and were paid, special beef premium can be paid slaughter premium.</P>
      <P>In cases where retagging of male cattle took place subsequent to payment of special beef premium, deseasonalisation slaughter premium applicants were requested to forward lists showing the old tag numbers and the corresponding new tag numbers for those animals.  Where such lists were forwarded and found to be in order by my Department, payment of deseasonalisation slaughter premium on those animals was made on foot of the new tag numbers under which they had been slaughtered as my Department was able to correlate these with the old tag numbers under which they had attracted special beef premium.</P>
      <P>In cases where applicants were unable to supply to my Department such lists in respect of certain animals, then under the relevant EU Regulation payment of deseasonalisation slaughter premium could not be made as my Department did not have evidence that special beef premium had in fact been paid on those animals.</P>
      <P>Since the animals involved have not been proven to be eligible for deseasonalisation slaughter premium it would not be appropriate to define non-payment on those animals as losses under this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it would have been very desirable if his Department had adopted the same assiduous approach to enforcing regulations in the case of beef factories owned by a certain resident of County Louth as it adopted in the case of individual farmers with a handful of cattle <Col N="1062" /> to whom the £50, £100 or £200 is a great deal of money?  The country would be several hundred million pounds better off if his Department had been as assiduous in dealing with this matter as it is in dealing with these unfortunate farmers who make mistakes through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a hypothetical question in relation to the past about which I cannot do anything.  I am suspicious about the retagging of cattle in relation to disease control and cattle smuggled from Northern Ireland, and quite frankly, I am not sympathetic to it.  Of course a bullock might scratch his ear on a loose nail in a shed and the tag will come out, but the farmer will still have the blue card.  If he produces the old card and the new tag number, he can show his beef record and get the slaughter premium.  Where he cannot produce any records and he does not know where the animal was when it was 22 months or ten months old, the Department is right to be strict.  I am sure the Deputy, given his stance on all these issues, will be supportive of my stance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

There is a tendering procedure and so on involved and it is a very large commitment of resources but ultimately it will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my speech here on 14 February in the aftermath of the Canary Wharf atrocity I suggested that the first thing that needed to be done was to hold a summit where the two Governments should become and remain <i>ad idem</i>.  Even though it has taken longer than one might have wished, and the interval has been marked by yet another bombing atrocity <Col N="1123" /> in London by the IRA, nonetheless I greatly welcome yesterday's agreement between the heads of Government and urge that this meeting of minds be maintained through all the vicissitudes that will arise in the weeks and months to come.</P>
      <P>I believe the communiqué is as good as it could be in the circumstances, but let no one think that all is now well, that the peace process is back on the rails, or that we are back to pre-Canary Wharf days.  The IRA had plenty of opportunity last night and today to withdraw its statement of 9 February last and to reinstate the ceasefire but has failed to do so.  Their spokesmen, Messrs. Adams and McGuinness, are their usual evasive and dissembling selves.  Two years later we are back to their old buzz word of &ldquo;clarification&rdquo;.  It is greatly disappointing that after 24 hours, and 25 years, the IRA/Sinn Féin feel that it is their right to murder people to advance their political objectives.</P>
      <P>The great weakness of this summit and communiqué is that it all appears to have happened under a mushroom cloud of semtex explosives.  The two main participants will naturally deny that, but it is unrealistic to think otherwise. That is an unsatisfactory situation. It makes it all the more important that the determination not to admit Sinn Féin to all party talks without a cease-fire must be resolutely upheld.  Indeed, more than just a ceasefire is required to enable the political process to bring about a settlement.  Anyone participating will have to do so on the basis that they accept in practice the principle of consent and the Mitchell principles.  If the Mitchell report had been handled differently after its publication, Sinn Féin would not have been let off the hook but would have had to face up to what is contained in it which should be acceptable to any democrat or democratic party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation are deluding themselves if they think that a party which could not subscribe to the forum's <Col N="1124" /> agreed report because it accepted in practice the principle of consent is a party which should be dealt with in the normal way as just another political party.  The decisions of this summit as set out in the communiqué should be seen through in all their consequences and that entails a determination to call the Sinn Féin bluff.</P>
    <P>I am still very unhappy about the proposed elective process.  Although the detail has yet to be worked out at the proximity talks starting on Monday full reflection should be given by everyone to the need for or value of an election at this stage.  While in theory and in a normal society, I favour the concept of a list type election, I have serious doubts about its efficacy in Northern Ireland at present.  It may well diminish the voice of the Alliance Party and exclude the voice of the two smaller loyalist parties. These voices need to be heard.  As Deputy Harney said last night, the PUP and the UDP have been commendably successful so far in preventing any loyalist backlash or retaliation for the IRA atrocities.  To exclude them would seem to be very foolish while they pursue their current anti-violence policies and a very poor reward for their constructive approach.</P>
    <P>Likewise I am not sure that an electoral process which would strengthen the DUP at the expense of the UUP has a great deal to commend it.  Even with all these drawbacks to a list system election a constituency based election of individuals can, from other points of view, be equally unattractive and destructive of hope for the consensus.  It will further polarise an already divided society and may well reward a negative rather than a positive approach.</P>
    <P>The commitment in the communiqué about a referendum is much less certain. Mr. Hume's original suggestion has, to some extent, been overtaken by events.  One of the proposed questions was whether there should be all-party talks.  These are now proposed for 10 June and are welcomed by an overwhelming majority.  That question now <Col N="1125" /> seems superfluous.  His other question on violence almost answers itself and might be redundant if it were proposed so loosely as to allow the IRA Army Council to urge a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote while keeping up their murder campaign.  The value of a plebiscite is that it concerns some issue and resolves it.  An endorsement of the six Mitchell proposals and the principle of consent by the great majority of the people on this island might serve that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney pointed out last night that paragraph 7 of the communiqué, read on its own, would appear not to require a ceasefire.  I can only assume that would not have been the intention of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and, if this is so, it should be made clear immediately.  Otherwise, it is a completely unacceptable pandering to IRA-Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>The process outlined in the communiqué will allow those who want to obstruct it to do so at will.  That cannot be accepted.  If there is a general consensus among normal democratic parties subscribing to universal political principles of non-violence to go forward, those who are not prepared to subscribe to them should be seen as excluding themselves.  A compromise consensus can be obtained in the June talks between all parties of good will. That should be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there will be huge problems and major obstacles in the way of progress between now and 10 June.  There may be even greater obstacles after that date.  Nonetheless the two Governments and the democratic parties should be united and determined to overcome the setbacks and obstacles that will arise.  If that lowest common denominator of political resolve for political progress and the permanent peace that will arise from it can be demonstrated without deviation, sanity will prevail.  The worst action would be to change the political strategy in response to further violence.  Peace and political progress arising from a settlement are surely achievable objectives.  Failure to achieve them would represent a lack of <Col N="1126" /> will, determination, goodwill or all three.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House seeks to make political capital out of the solution to this awful problem.  For a House that was so divided in the past on the north, this is great progress.  The same approach should be taken in the north and, whatever the domestic political difficulties at Westminister, no effort should be made in the future to solve or alleviate them in a Northern Ireland context.  Arms for Iraq have no more to do with Northern Ireland than beef for Iraq.  If Private Clegg should not be released, he should not have been released just because there was a leadership contest within the Conservative Party.</P>
    <P>The apparent relaxation of anti-subversive security in this State, at least during the 17 months of the ceasefire, should now be tightened up.  It was a naive gamble that did not pay off.  It must not be repeated as a sop to devious and ruthless people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Liz McManus.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley that it is important that all-party consensus continue, not just in this House but in the British Parliament, because it was this that allowed the two Governments to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion yesterday afternoon.  The same goodwill and courage will be necessary in the months ahead if we are to see the beginning of a political solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>One thing that concerned me in recent months was the number of people who expected an instant solution to a problem that originated not 25 years ago but generations ago.  I look forward to increased political dialogue in the next few months, but I urge caution and ask for patience.  A problem such as that in Northern Ireland cannot be solved overnight.  We will not see a total solution in 1996, but, with commonsense and compromise, I hope we will see tremendous progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> The Irish and British Governments deserve to be congratulated on yesterday's result.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and their colleagues on the Northern Ireland sub-committee of the Cabinet, put in Trojan work not just in the past three or four weeks but in recent months.  There was much pressure on the Cabinet and on the Northern Ireland sub-committee in the wake of the Canary Wharf bombing but they demonstrated a sure touch.  The same sort of certainty will be required in the next few weeks.  Yesterday the politicans and the democratic parties seized back the initiative.  We gathered here a fortnight ago to speak about the end to the IRA ceasefire and requested the IRA to reinstate it.  We recognised the need for a political process and for political leadership by those who believe democracy is the only way forward.  This was central to a solution and it has now been given.  The political agenda has taken over.  There is a political track in place for those who wish to utilise it. The message must go out loudly and clearly to the people in Sinn Féin that they must use whatever influence they can with the IRA to get it to reinstate a ceasefire.  It is necessary to keep repeating what was said by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister yesterday. The only group now keeping Sinn Féin from full participation in all-party talks is the IRA.  We call on the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire and allow Sinn Féin to engage in all-party talks.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy O'Malley on the need to be extremely careful about the Northern Ireland elections.  It is necessary that all political parties be represented, because we are not talking about an ordinary political landscape. We have to ensure that the smaller parties who have no representation at present will be able not simply to take part in the electoral process but be represented in the political aftermath.  In that regard, although there is the need to ensure representation of Sinn Féin, it must be recognised that the even <Col N="1128" /> smaller Nationalist party, the IRSP must also be brought on board.  They too speak for a military wing in that the INLA has not gone away either, and it will be necessary to ensure that they finally lay down their guns.  We must, therefore, ensure that the IRSP can play a political role in the months ahead.  The joint communiqué issued on 28 February 1996 is a watershed and will go down in history as such.  We congratulate everyone who has brought us this far and look for courage, flexibility and compromise from all concerned in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate all those involved in the preparation of the joint communiqué which has been welcomed with a great deal of relief.  The two Governments have taken an important step and shown leadership but we must not underestimate the difficulties that lie ahead.  We know the context within which all parties can work towards a resolution of the problem.  Setting a date for substantive negotiations is not a sign of weakness but evidence of the resolute determination of both Governments to meet the objective of a negotiated settlement in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The framework has been laid down and it is up to the parties to respond.  It would be desirable if the political parties adopted a positive approach towards this but if one party decides not to participate the process will proceed. It is worth stating that whatever difficulties had to be overcome to reach this stage will pale into insignificance compared to those that will arise when negotiations commence on 1 June.  There is no easy route in politics nor is there a short cut to democracy.  If Sinn Féin and the IRA do not co-operate in this initiative it will be clear that they are not serious about engaging in the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Physical force as a political weapon has been part of Irish history for centuries but it has no place in Irish life today. There is no justification for it.  Sinn Féin <Col N="1129" /> and the IRA are at a point of no return. They must make a decision.  If they choose the political route it will be only one of the hard decisions they must make but the advantages of political engagement are immense.  I hope, together with thousands of others, that they will make the right decision.</P>
    <P>This morning, a spokesman for Sinn Féin said it wanted a week or ten days to reflect on the communiqué.  This is surprising because such spokesmen railed against delays in the past and had one simple demand, that a date be set for negotiations to begin.  He said points needed to be clarified.  The communiqué is written in crystal clear language and sets out a process in an unequivocal and unambiguous manner. It does not deal with all the issues with finality nor should it do so.  It is a balanced document where no one loses and everyone will win.  Accommodation is the keynote of the communiqué and while everybody gets something they also have to give something.  The predominant character of the negotiations must also be accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is clear from news reports today that Sinn Féin's response is not encouraging. It will not be forgiven easily if it fails to make the leap to democratic politics as 25 years of violence has convinced the overwhelming majority of the people that Irish unity is not worth the loss of a single life.  It has been stated that the peace process belongs to everyone and that was made clear when the people demonstrated for peace on the streets last weekend.  They were making the statement that peace belongs to them and they refuse to allow it to be hijacked by any paramilitary group.  It belongs to all of us but it makes demands on us which we must live up to.</P>
    <P>Some time ago Sinn Féin asked that the Governments be persuaders but it is now time for Sinn Féin to be a persuader if it is to have a credible role in the process.  For too long the Republican movement has spoken in the name of dead generations.  Now it has an unprecedented and unrepeatable <Col N="1130" /> chance to speak in the name of the generations to come.  This is its moment to show where its true commitment lies.  I hope it will have the courage, conviction and understanding necessary to make the right decision.  Democracy may be a hard master but it is also a productive one.  I have no doubt that those who vote for Sinn Féin and have done over the years yearn for it to be part of the political process.  The great strength of democracy is that the people can have a voice if their representatives work to ensure it is heard.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and their staff for their work.  I also pay tribute to John Major who is concerned with many political issues and crises.  However, despite his difficulties he has concentrated in an effective manner on the Northern Ireland issue.  We owe a debt of gratitude to him for that commitment.  We now have the possibility of achieving a peace process. The framework, date and timetable have been set in the joint communiqué and we can only move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The BBC weather section announced yesterday that Northern Ireland experienced its sunniest February since the keeping of records in 1880.  On hearing that I wondered if it were a heavenly sign that the sun was about to shine, politically speaking, across Northern Ireland and, therefore, the whole island.  I had no sooner observed this when I heard a number of leading public representatives give their reaction to what was happening in London.  I heard the comments of Martin McGuinness, as a leading representative of Sinn Féin, to the news that the two Governments had decided on a firm date for the commencement of the long awaited all-party talks.  I confidently expected him to state positively that Sinn Féin would now expect the Provisional IRA to resume its ceasefire immediately.  I could not believe I heard the dreaded word &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; trotted out yet <Col N="1131" /> again.  We heard the words &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; for several months after the Downing Street Declaration.  We will yet hear the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;.  I remind the House and Sinn Féin that while these words were bandied about people were killed and maimed.  I trust there will not be a repeat of this process.  Perhaps there are grounds for hope given that there has not been a further act of violence since the bomb on the bus which took the life of the unfortunate and misguided young man from Wexford whose parents and family reacted with courage and dignity. It is remarkable that the statement from the O'Brien family, which received huge publicity in Britain, was the most effective message ever delivered to British people that the vast majority of Irish citizens had no hand, act or part in the acts of terrorism in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The enormous turn-out of people on the streets of Ireland last Sunday endorsed that message.  The large numbers of Irish people who live and work in Britain will be particularly grateful to the O'Brien family for its statement.  It was the Irish in Britain who were at the receiving end of the understandable anger at atrocities committed ostensibly in the name of the Irish nation.  The overwhelming majority of Irish people would no more condone the bombing at Canary Wharf or Aldwych than the people of Yorkshire would condone the actions of the Yorkshire ripper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A quarter of a century more than covers the span of life from the cradle to maturity.  An entire generation of people who have grown up in areas such as the Falls Road, Shankill and Derry have never experienced a normal childhood. We can only speculate on the seriousness of the scar that leaves on a person.  I remember a television documentary in the 1970s which depicted a class of seven, eight and nine year olds who were asked by their teacher to paint a picture of a normal day.  A great majority of the pictures showed children at play in their front gardens in the <Col N="1132" /> Creggan estate in Derry, with flowers, toys, trees, cats and dogs, but most of them had one thing in common, in the sky was a large dark helicopter.  For those children, that was as much a part of nature as the sun.</P>
    <P>People have spoken about preconditions, real and imagined.  The only precondition to talks is that which applies not only to Sinn Féin but to every party that wishes to participate &mdash; the condition enshrined in the first, fourth and fifth principles in the Mitchell report and stressed by my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern when he said that Fianna Fáil would have no time for a twin-track policy involving the armalite and the ballot box.</P>
    <P>I have said many times in recent years that Northern Nationalists achieved more in a short time in the 1970s through the civil rights movement than they will ever achieve through the use of armed violence or terror.  I am sure the Irish nation unanimously agrees that the cause of justice and reconciliation was set back by at least 20 years by the extreme bitterness engendered by the campaign of violence.  If Sinn Féin identifies any preconditions which it regards as seriously hindering the peace process I will welcome its early comments on them.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody gets the impression that the British Government or Sinn Féin are the only culprits, I will refer to the performance of the Unionist parties. Strange as it may seem, the so-called modern wing of unionism, the Ulster Unionist Party under the leadership of David Trimble has adopted a line perhaps even harder than that adopted by the redoubtable Dr. Ian Paisley.  Mr. Trimble is inventing preconditions, the most impossible of which would involve the total surrender of Northern Nationalists.  They are expected to apologise to Mr. Trimble for daring to suggest that they have been treated with anything but kindness and generosity for more than half a century by what a former Unionist leader described as a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> Mr. Trimble recently visited Washington where he captivated his audience with the announcement that the Unionist Party has certain standards and that Sinn Féin would not be allowed share their company until it reached their standards.  At a time which we hope will herald the resumption of peace and reconciliation, I will refrain from going into the details of the high standards employed by Mr. Trimble's predecessors for half a century.  It was those standards that resulted in the establishment of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>I have carefully studied the communiqué and am struck by the fact that throughout the document the word most used is &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo;&mdash; it is used no less than 15 times.  Sinn Féin has generally referred merely to all-party talks, and I am surprised it has not commented on this quite remarkable emphasis by the British Government. Section 10 of the communiqué states that the purpose of the consultations which will commence on Monday, 4 March will be to &ldquo;(a) reach widespread agreement on proposals for a broadly acceptable elective process leading directly and without preconditions to all-party negotiations on June 10th 1996: (b) reach widespread agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of substantive all-party negotiations&rdquo;.  I would like the Government, in response to this debate, to explain whether there is an intended difference between the term &ldquo;all-party negotiations&rdquo; and &ldquo;substantive all-party negotiations&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;substantive&rdquo; is mentioned at least twice, in sections 7 and 10.  Perhaps there is no cause for concern, but I am puzzled about the wording in view of the extraordinary time and care usually taken in the drafting of a communiqué such as this.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Sinn Féin to use all the influence at its disposal to persuade the Provisional IRA to not only resume the ceasefire but make an historic commitment to permanently abandon the use of force as a means of obtaining a political aim.  I appeal to the leaders of the Unionist parties to give a commitment <Col N="1134" /> that we will never again hear of convenants written in blood.  I appeal to the British Government to pay greater attention to what my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív vividly described as &ldquo;the prisoners issue&rdquo;.  Surely that issue could be dealt with immediately.  The position of Paddy Kelly has been highlighted more than once in this House.  Surely on humane grounds alone his transfer should be possible.</P>
    <P>As we approach another summer, would it be too much to ask for a drastic scaling down of what has become known as the marching season?  It should be possible to commemorate historical events with dignity and good humour without the necessity for endless provocative marches.  Perhaps we could take the drum as well as the gun out of Irish politics this summer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While walking in a peace march on Sunday I was particularly struck by something that happened when a number of hecklers at the front started shouting and tried to disrupt people talking on the platform.  When about 15 photographers ran to photograph the two or three hecklers, the people around them shouted they should photograph the children, not the hecklers. That was a powerful message.  Our children are the future.  That message demonstrated the type of Ireland we want to create for our children and our children's children.  The public were annoyed that a small number of people at the front of the march could get so much attention, which is a symbol of the <Col N="1135" /> power attached to using those type of methods which can extend to violence and how powerful violence can be in exercising control.  Yet, nobody wants violence.  The opinion polls research published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Wednesday illustrates that clearly.  A strong message, perhaps stronger than any previously, has been sent that Irish people do not want acts of violence done in their names.  As Deputy McDaid said, that is becoming clearer to the rest of the world.  It must also be clear to Sinn Féin and the IRA that they have no mandate for committing acts of violence in Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>My son and all the nine year-olds in his class wrote an essay on violence in school this week and their message to the IRA was to stop the use of violence. The need to ensure that violence ceases has touched everyone.  For 18 months we experienced peace.  There was great joy about the contact between the North and the South.  There was a sense of things opening up, tourism was developing, people felt freer to move around and we were talking about improving the economy, North and South.  People experienced a freedom that had not existed for a long time and the shock of the Canary Wharf tragedy was all the stronger because of that.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the two Governments were able to issue the joint communiqué yesterday.  I praise John Major for his part in that achievement, but I was very disappointed at his response to the Mitchell report, a well written and optimistic document.  Its focus is on decommissioning mind-sets which is the most important phrase in it.  It was disappointing that the report was not given the attention it deserved and that the elections, as opposed to the other issues in the report, were given such focus.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the two Governments acted together and as the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, said they reached agreement on the framework, the timetable and the intention. That is what the people want.  I hope Sinn Féin and the IRA will take <Col N="1136" /> note of what is in it and that they will listen to the voice of the people expressed through peace marches and by children and that they will not use violence again.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that irrespective of political difficulties or mistakes people consider may have been made &mdash; perhaps they were not mistakes &mdash; one cannot compare them with using an act of violence to achieve a political aim.</P>
    <P>What happened yesterday must be welcomed.  We cannot underestimate the challenges or difficulties that may arise.  Stereotype thinking and rigidities are part and parcel of the Irish political scene.  Often, it is very difficult to move beyond rigid certainties.  If anything, this period calls for openness to change.  I hope that if the election process is taken women will be more visible in the politics of Northern Ireland.  I also hope they will be considered in decisions on the election system.  It is extremely important that new voices, particularly women's voices, are heard.  Women have not been involved in political parties as much in Northern Ireland as elsewhere, as they have put most of their energies into work at community level. I hope a way will be found to hear the voices of those involved at every level in the process in the months and years ahead.  That is an important aspect of the process.  If we wish to bring about change, we must create new dynamics. New people's voices must be heard.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who referred to the manner in which prisoners were treated during the past year.  A Fine Gael delegation which visited republican prisoners in Britain from 15 to 17 January 1996 regretfully concluded that during 18 months of peace the treatment of prisoners by the Home Office damaged and destabilised the peace process.  That is an extraordinary conclusion and the matter must be given more priority by the British Government than it has received to date.  Peace is made up of change at different levels. It is about the American influence, how prisoners are treated, people power on <Col N="1137" /> the streets shaping policy, how Government and political leaders lead and everything coming together.  We cannot ignore any aspect.  We all have a role to play and the manner in which all these issues are handled is critical.</P>
    <P>We should encourage people power to inform and shape policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Major took a major step in this process.  It is no disrespect to either of them or to what they have done to say they have taken a large step forward after a time when some steps backward had been taken.  What they have done is very significant.  I hope it has in it the seeds of something that will flower and bear fruit in the not too distant future.  However, without disrespect to either of them &mdash; rather it is with great respect to both of them and great appreciation of the quality of what they have done &mdash; I remain pessimistic. I am not sure there is a new dawn in prospect and I will state why.  Paragraph 12 of yesterday's communiqué states:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister expressed their hope that all parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations.</P>
      <P>They recognise that confidence building measures will be necessary. As one such measure, all such participants would need to make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the International Body.</P>
      <P>They would also need to address at that stage its proposals on decommissioning.</P>
      <P>Confidence building would also require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> That puts the parameters of the problem clearly before us.  I am reluctant to use the much bandied about word &ldquo;pre-condition&rdquo; but commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence should be a <i>sine qua non</i> of a real democratic negotiation.  They would also need to address the proposals on decommissioning of the international body &mdash; with which I agree &mdash; on which there is common ground among all of the democratic parties involved in this process.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall also, because it is particularly relevant today, paragraph 61 of the report of the international body chaired by former United States Senator, George Mitchell, which states:</P>
    <P>Rigid adherence by the parties to their past positions will simply continue the stalemate which has already lasted too long.  In a society as deeply divided as Northern Ireland, reaching across the &ldquo;peace line&rdquo; requires a willingness to take risks for peace.</P>
    <P>Those sentiments from the joint communiqué and the Mitchell report must be taken to heart by all of the parties seeking talks, all the parties who have been complaining about delays in talks and by all the parties who have been complaining at having been excluded from talks.  Those parties must accept those statements &mdash; and here is the kernel of it &mdash; as being the only basis on which real meaningful negotiations can take place.</P>
    <P>I say that with all the more conviction because I believe, however difficult things may have been to date, when substantive negotiations begin &mdash; as I hope they will fairly soon in the conditions I mentioned &mdash; we will find that that is when the really difficult issues must be faced.</P>
    <P>I am not optimistic.  I watched part of the RTE programme last evening which in one of its segments featured a member of Sinn Féin and a prominent spokesman of one of the Unionist parties, with an interviewer, degenerate into a squabble.  The interviewer tried to calm them down.  The squabble was not <Col N="1139" /> based on anything real about which we have to talk today but rather on their perceptions of what each had done to the other in the past or, indeed, something like Deputy McDaid's reference a few moments ago to Mr. Trimble's predecessors. That is exactly what the Mitchell Commission had in mind when it said:</P>
    <P>Rigid adherence by the parties to their past positions will simply continue the stalemate which has lasted too long.</P>
    <P>Unending and repeated rehearsals by the parties of the past sins of the other will simply continue that stalemate and we will discover that neither of those two attitudes will produce any benefit when we come to the real discussion. The real discussion, the substantive negotiations, the process in which everybody has been saying they want to be involved and which now appears to be within our grasp or coming near to hand will require creativity, generosity, a new dynamic to which Deputy Frances Fitzgerald has just referred.  Furthermore, it will need concessions on the part of every participant.  It will require every participant to give up some of his or her traditional positions and, above all, will require a real concern with people that prevails over concerns with doctrines that have been the bane of people's lives in Northern Ireland for so long and which, in so many cases, have been the cause of their deaths.</P>
    <P>That prompts me to ask what does this mean because we should make up our minds what will be required before entering substantive negotiations.  In Northern Ireland, in the traditional positions of the two communities, there are two flatly contradictory ambitions. One ambition is to see installed a 32-county republic and another flatly contradictory ambition, seeks to maintain, unchanged, a union with Great Britain. It must be clear to even a child that there is not a way in which those two ambitions can be reconciled; there is not a square that can sort out that circle. <Col N="1140" /> Neither is there a way that either one of them can be satisfied without immediately dashing the other.  Any attempt to reconcile those two traditions politically is doomed to failure because it is simply an impossibility.</P>
    <P>That is why all the parties that become involved in substantive negotiations &mdash; and all the parties have been saying for God knows how long they want to be involved in substantive negotiations &mdash; must accept that, by definition, that will require them to move away from, to give up, to compromise on, even to abandon some part of the bag-traditional stance, some part of the baggage they have carried with them so far. If they are not prepared to do that, then they are in effect saying there is absolutely no point in having substantive negotiations.</P>
    <P>I consider that a relevant thought this evening because I have been told that around lunchtime today one of the parties that wants to be involved in these negotiations &mdash; it was not a Unionist party &mdash; said it will not abandon anything. If, on one side, we hear people say they will not abandon anything of their traditional position, matched by an echoing cry from the other side of not an inch, there will be no point in substantive negotiations and our political system will condemn the people of Northern Ireland to continued suffering and unrest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this important issue of educational disadvantage in the Dublin 10 postal district, having been contacted recently, as I am sure were other Members representing the area, by a spokesperson on behalf of the educators, the management boards of the local primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of their submission to me which, I suspect, has been submitted to the Minister, was to draw ours and her attention to the very serious difficulties experienced by some &mdash; I stress <Col N="1141" /> some &mdash; pupils attending the three primary schools in question.</P>
    <P>The disturbances &mdash; which is how the spokesperson referred to them &mdash; manifest themselves in high drop-out levels in secondary schools, early school-leaving, lack of self-control or students experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Between the three schools there are 59 students in urgent need of psychological assessment, 70 with severe emotional difficulties, 65 in need of intensive speech/language therapy and 146 recognised as poor school attenders.</P>
    <P>These figures, obtained from the three school principals involved, were sent to us to highlight the urgency of their position.  They draw our attention, and to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention, to the unfortunate fact that, despite this very obvious need, no psychological or counselling service is available to the schools in question, that there is a two-year waiting list of children with speech/language difficulties and no play therapist available to them. The principals and spokesperson who contacted us wanted to draw our attention to the crucial issue of making such trained personnel available if they are to make decisive inroads into educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The report of the Technical Working Group on the Future Development of Higher Education stated that recently, within the Dublin area, the two postal districts with the lowest admissions to third-level education &mdash; ironically both in my constituency of Dublin Central &mdash; are Dublin 1, with a 4.8 admission rate and Dublin 10, slightly higher, with a 5.6 admission rate.  This contrasts with admission rates of 56.8 per cent in Dublin 14, 54 per cent in Dublin 6 and 50 per cent in Dublin 4.  Those figures show the very stark inequalities.  It is worth drawing Members' attention to the reply to Question No. 97 of 27 September 1995 on the level of unemployment in Dublin 10.  The official statistics show unemployment rates ranging from 34.2 per cent to 50.5 per cent in Cherry Orchard C district.  There are 2,050 children of primary and pre school age in <Col N="1142" /> Cherry Orchard and there is no school whatsoever to meet their needs, let alone the services that the three primary schools in another area of Dublin 10 are looking for.  I hope the Minister will have a favourable response to this very important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I understand his concern about the problems in the educational system arising from social disadvantage. In general, the responsibility for the psychological assessment of children in primary schools, where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards, through the appropriate director of community care. Parents may access this service through the school medical service or the family doctor.</P>
      <P>The psychological service for primary schools from my Department is in a limited number of areas, with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas. Parents may access this service, where available, through the school.  However, it will be some time before this service will be in a position to take over responsibility for psychological assessment for educational purposes from the health boards.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy, set out in the White Paper on Education and in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, it is proposed to continue the development of the psychological service, on a phased basis, as resources become available for that purpose.  In the context of the policy outlined in the White Paper, it is proposed that regional educational boards will be established and it is envisaged that psychological services to schools will be one of the services provided by these new boards.</P>
      <P>It is recognised, therefore, that there is a need for a psychological service to schools generally, but of course it is not possible to meet this need in all areas at once.  Therefore, there is a need to approach the matter on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> During 1995 ten psychologists were recruited for my Department's psychological service.  As a result of the recruitment of these ten psychologists the service has been extended.  In extending the service, priority has been given to primary schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Some limited further extension in the Dublin area is being considered as a continuation of the deployment of psychologists recruited in 1995.  This consideration includes primary schools in the Ballyfermot area, including the three schools mentioned by the Deputy. When the matter is finalised, in the near future, the management authorities of the schools concerned will be informed. The priority criterion will remain schools serving disadvantaged areas.  I can confirm that the three schools mentioned meet this criterion.  They have been given consideration in accord with this criterion in the past, for example, all of the schools mentioned have home school community liaison teachers.</P>
    <P>Consideration of any further recruitment of psychologists in 1996 will have to be in accord with the Government decision in limiting recruitment to the Civil Service and will be subject to the financial limits of my Department's administrative budget.  There is also the consideration that at any given time there is a limited number of persons with the necessary qualifications available for appointment.  These matters highlight the need to approach expansion on a phased basis.  Since the Minister took office, the original pilot project on the development of a psychological service to primary schools was put on a permanent basis, in early 1994, in the areas concerned, west Tallaght/Clondalkin and south Tipperary.</P>
    <P>This meant that the four psychologists employed on a temporary basis, for the duration of the project, were employed on a permanent basis.  As a result of the recruitment of ten additional psychologists in 1995, there are 14 psychologists working in primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to request the Minister to include the Presentation primary school Carrick-on-Suir in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Carrick-on-Suir has suffered enormously from unemployment during the past number of years.  At one stage the unemployment rate was 33.5 per cent which brings its own social consequences and disadvantage for many students attending the school.</P>
      <P>The school has 545 pupils on the roll and this includes eight traveller children, with no special travellers teacher, two children with cerebal palsy, eight children with mild mental handicap and a large number who are slow and have poor mental capabilities.</P>
      <P>In spite of such disadvantage the school has only one remedial teacher who started last September.  With 75 pupils on her list the school has to decide that some of those who would need remedial help could not avail of it. The school, together with other schools, has been allocated a resource teacher so that many of the children with physical and mental disabilities receive no help on a daily basis.  Pupils would need a resource teacher twice or three times a week but that service cannot be provided.</P>
      <P>There are three junior infant classes with 30 pupils each and in each class there is a child with cerebal palsy, cystic fibrosis or mental handicap.  In the two senior infant classes each with 36 pupils, one child in the class has cerebal palsy and a child in the other class has a mild mental handicap.  In third class there are 34 pupils, one of whom has a mental deficiency, and in fourth class one child has a combination of mental and physical disabilities.  All these children are functioning very much below the average child of their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other data substantiate their demand to be considered disadvantaged.  Of the 506 pupils in the school, 58 per cent live in a local authority housing area, 62 per <Col N="1145" /> cent are medical card holders and the parents of 60 per cent of the students are in receipt of social welfare.  What does it take to be deemed eligible for disadvantaged status?</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years, two of the secondary schools in the town were given concessionary posts because of the need in those schools.  It is unwise to omit the primary school sector.  Providing additional posts and such necessary help at secondary school level cannot be fruitful or worthwhile when it is not provided at primary level.</P>
    <P>I cannot let the opportunity go without complimenting the staff whose dedication and determination is keeping the school alive and helping students to attain a standard that could not otherwise be achieved.  It would be a worth-while decision by the Minister if she were to give disadvantaged status to the Presentation Convent primary school, Carrick-on-Suir, immediately.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question on 29 May 1995, the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, informed me that she hoped to receive a report on the outcome of the study of the Combat Poverty Agency by the middle of 1995 and she would then be able to arrive at a decision.  We are now approaching mid-1996.  I ask the Minister to consider my request with generosity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this matter.  I am aware she has raised it on several occasions.  I am aware that the school in question has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  To date, the level of need demonstrated by the school in its submission to my Department, relative to the competing needs of other schools, has not resulted in its inclusion in the scheme.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school will be considered in the event of an expansion of the scheme being undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools are selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socioeconomic indicators.  Factors taken into <Col N="1146" /> account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing occupancy and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.  The approach currently adopted was agreed by a working party comprised of representatives of school management, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and my Department, and has been in place for several years.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency was commissioned to conduct a detailed study of current approaches to the identification and support of pupils in disadvantaged areas.  The criteria used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme are among the matters covered by this study.  The report of the Combat Poverty Agency has now been received in my Department.  It is one of the most comprehensive studies of educational disadvantage ever undertaken in the State.</P>
    <P>The report examines the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacts on pupils in the education system.  It reviews the procedures currently in place to identify and address educational disadvantage.  It evaluates the effectiveness of current approaches using a wide range of national and international research.  It also raises a range of issues about our current approaches and how they can be improved.  In summary, the report provides a very valuable basis for considering our future approach to the identification and support of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the factors which give rise to educational disadvantage are many and complex. They have to do with a range of socioeconomic and other factors.  My decision to commission a detailed study of this area was taken in recognition of the complexity of the issues involved.  Arising from this review, consideration is <Col N="1147" /> now being given to the appropriate criteria to be applied in the future selection of schools for disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the Presentation Convent primary school, Carrick-on-Suir will be fully taken into account in this process.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an deis seo agam an cheist seo a ardú leis an Aire agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht liom tráthnóna.</P>
      <P>In 1991, long before the Deputy was Minister for Justice, a proposal was put by the people in the Maam Valley, Connemara, to the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice which had much merit.  A large old Garda barracks is situated in the Maam Valley with one resident garda.  For security purposes there is no need for this big building.  The proposal submitted was that the Garda barracks should be transferred to the local community for use as a community centre and in return the local people would provide, free of charge, to the Department's specification, a brand new Garda barracks.</P>
      <P>We have all heard of Aladdin's lamp and old lamps for new.  What was being offered was a purpose-built dwelling that would be suited to modern requirements in the Maam Valley.  In return it was hoped that the Garda barracks, which is an old large building, could be made available to the community.</P>
      <P>We hear much about communities helping themselves in self-help projects. It could be fairly said that this proposal was innovative and positive.  In 1996 we are no nearer to getting a decision on the proposal than in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 a letter was received from the Office of Public Works stating that the matter was being investigated.  In February 1995, in reply to a question raised, the response was that the options open to us have not been fully examined. With issues like this somebody has to <Col N="1148" /> ensure that the buck passing stops.  If it cannot be done the community should be told.  It would be more honest than continually saying that issues are being examined.  If it can be done it should be done now.  By any standard, four years should have been enough time in which to evaluate the merits of this simple and positive proposal.</P>
    <P>A question that arises is whether in the event of a transfer of State property it would have to go to public auction.  In view of the fact that a local community is involved, could some arrangement be made whereby the property would be valued and transferred in that way?  The local community has also raised questions regarding the condition of the property but they could all be overcome. If the property was transferred to them in return for their building brand new alternative accommodation a clause could be inserted in the deeds providing, in the event of the property ever being transferred to private ownership, any proceeds arising from that transfer would be indexed and any surplus created would be transferred to the Department.  That is not the intention; the intention is to use it in perpetuity for community purposes.  I do not think anybody would quibble with conditions that would protect the public interest.</P>
    <P>Public ownership is not only State ownership.  We have to recognise other forms of public ownership such as community ownership and to draw up proper deeds of trust that would ensure that items would be truly in public ownership and would not be exploited for private personal gain.  Those matters could be overcome.  I ask the Minister to ensure that a deadline is given in the near future &mdash; if it cannot be given today &mdash; for a firm decision on this original and reasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>This is a community which has suffered a huge population decrease.  There has been good economic development in the general area, although Maam has not gained to the extent we would have wished.  However, this is a genuine effort by a community to lift itself.  I am sure the Minister more than appreciates <Col N="1149" /> what is involved as my colleague, Deputy McCormack, has beaten a trail to the same doors on this issue.  We are <i>ad idem</i> as to the merit of the proposal and I hope the Minister will in some way facilitate the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am sympathetic to applications involving public buildings, which were essentially paid for with taxpayers money. Where possible, they should be utilised by local bodies.  This is not the first time a project has been proposed for an old Garda station or courthouse.  These are popular buildings which local communities would like to convert into heritage or community centres.  They are often the only public buildings in an area.  Communities may only have access to either that building, a hotel or a school and I imagine the Garda station is a focal point in this area.  I will fill the Deputy in on the background to this matter which has been going on for a number of years.  I wonder if the Deputy raised this issue when his party was in Government and the Minister for Justice was from Galway and whether he was not able to move the application on a little.  It would be ironic if a non-Galway Minister was in a position to bring the matter to finality.</P>
      <P>The Garda station in Maam is too large for foreseeable Garda requirements. It is in a poor state of repair and would require considerable investment to make it habitable.  The main value of the property lies in its superb location. It is proposed to replace it as part of the Garda building programme with a new basic unit station on the existing site. This is the recommendation of the Office of Public Works and it has been approved by Garda management.  The Office of Public Works is currently drawing up plans for the new station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coiste Forbartha An Mhama has written to the Office of Public Works stating that it wishes to purchase and convert the old Garda station for community use.  It is anxious to know if the building will be made available to it and <Col N="1150" /> the likely timeframe for same.  However, the exiting Garda station building cannot be made available until the new one is built and occupied by the Garda. Once the old Garda station has been vacated it will be a matter for the Office of Public Works to dispose of the building.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I have been advised that when the existing premises are no longer needed as a Garda station, the normal procedure, provided the property is surplus to State requirements, is to sell it on the open market.  The document entitled, &ldquo;Public Procurement&rdquo;, provides that the disposal of State property should be dealt with by competitive tendering or by auction.</P>
    <P>It should be appreciated that what is being proposed by Coiste Forbartha An Mhama would involve a departure from the normal tendering procedure for disposal of State property.  In the circumstances any agreement that might be reached with it for acquisition other than through tender or auction would have to receive the special sanction of the Minister for Finance who has a responsibility for ensuring that the procurement procedures are complied with.</P>
    <P>The normal timeframe for building the new station as part of the Garda building programme, taking into consideration overall priorities and the availability of finance, is three to four years from now.  This timeframe reflects the fact that other stations are in greater need of replacement and so have a higher priority.  On a general note, I remind the House that I have allocated over £8.5 million this year for the building and maintenance of Garda stations. More than a dozen major projects will commence this year and many other smaller projects.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney has agreed to meet Coiste Forbartha an Mhama about acquisition of the existing station.  I have no doubt the Minister will be as sympathetic as possible &mdash; I will tell him of my sympathy &mdash; to the worthy aims of Coiste Forbartha an Mhama.  Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out, <Col N="1151" /> with the sanction of the Minister for Finance which would not only see the Coiste Forbartha an Mhama succeeding with its aims quickly, but also the new station, which is also important, being built in advance of the current timeframe. Provided the local needs of the Garda Síochána are fully satisfied as quickly as possible, the Coiste will have my goodwill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the implementation of the Strategic Management Initiative, however, a re-organisation group is currently reviewing the organisational structure of my Department.  The group's brief includes the consideration of establishing executive units to carry out various executive functions, including those related to intervention operations. Finally, under Article 4 of Council regulations (EEC) No. 729/70 as amended, only accredited paying agencies may disburse EAGGF guarantee funds with effect from 16 October 1995. I have, in accordance with Article 1 (4) <Col N="1065" /> of Commission Regulation 1663/95, provisionally accredited my Department with effect from that date.  The European Commission has been notified of this, and has expressed no reservations about the basis on which provisional accreditation has been granted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of a special level of support to Irish sheep producers in the non-disadvantaged areas, agreed at the December 1995 meeting of EU agriculture Ministers, requires the preparation of specific legislation by the EU Commission.  I understand that work on the necessary regulation is in progress and I have been assured by the Commission that it will be presented as <Col N="1067" /> quickly as possible.  Payment of the supports will be made once this procedure which includes the approval of the European Parliament has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 22, 32, 33, 35, 40, 49, 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The current allocation for REPS in 1996 is £41.56 million of which 75 per cent is recouped from the EU FEOGA fund.  As I indicated in reply to a question today I am keeping the funding of REPS under close review with a view to ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet the expected demand.</P>
      <P>Under monitoring and control procedures carried out by my Department a random sample of REPS plans submitted in the latter half of 1995 were selected for checking.  This resulted in over 200 cases being checked in detail and subjected to on-farm inspection.  A further 200 approximately are currently being checked in this way but the results are not yet available.</P>
      <P>To date nearly 100 defective plans, prepared by 20 of the 241 approved planning agencies, have been detected. Because the random selection did not target every agency, the checking is now being further extended to cover all agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the recently announced changes in control procedures, planning agencies who have prepared plans which are found not to be in accordance with the scheme are being required to re-examine and amend those plans as a <Col N="1069" /> matter of urgency.  Additionally all other plans prepared by those agencies must be re-examined and certified as being in accordance with the scheme or changed to meet the scheme requirements. Furthermore, my Department will carry out increased levels of checking on all plans in the future to ensure strict compliance with the scheme.</P>
    <P>As also announced, plans which indicate a deliberate attempt to bypass the scheme requirements are being rejected. Any planning agency which in the future prepares a new plan not strictly in compliance with the Department's specifications may be removed from the approved list of planning agencies. Where genuine errors occur, a warning will be issued to the agency concerned with an instruction to have them corrected. If errors occur as a result of planning agencies' negligence they risk being removed from the approved list. Each case will be looked at individually.</P>
    <P>As part of the improved controls, the up front payment is now being split in two, with 50 per cent being paid on approval and the balance on a six monthly basis thereafter.  These changes <Col N="1070" /> will not result in a reduction of the overall funding for the scheme.  The attractiveness of the scheme to farmers remains.</P>
    <P>The revised procedures also require the planning agencies to certify that applicants' plans comply with the scheme before any second year payment is approved.  As a result, no second year payments have been made to date but it is expected that these will commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware of only one REPS participant who has been served a section 12 notice from a local authority. The matter is now the subject of discussions with the local authority.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Turkish market is open to Irish beef, bone-in and deboned.  However, discussions are continuing with the Turkish authorities regarding an acceptable health certificate for the export of live cattle.  Good progress is being made in these discussions and I am hopeful that a certificate acceptable to all parties will be agreed shortly.</P>

      <P>My advice to farmers is, as indicated in my replies to the Deputy dated 8 March, 20 June and 7 November 1995, to collect and store <Col N="1075" /> all plastics on the farm and reuse as much of it as possible.  As the Deputy is aware, plastic film used to bale silage cannot be reused and as a result it should be disposed of in approved land fill sites.</P>
      <P>It is highly desirable that as much waste plastic as possible be recycled.  In this regard I was pleased with recent developments in the area of recycling of waste plastics.  I understand that the National Farm Relief Services are putting in place a system of collecting waste plastic for recycling.  Furthermore, I understand a number of private concerns have indicated an interest in providing a waste plastic recycling facility.  I very much welcome these developments and I believe that such developments together with the good practices for disposal of plastics recommended under REPS will go a long way towards overcoming the difficulty of disposal of plastics from agricultural sources.</P>

      <P>As part of the EU internal market, an EU Directive is in place which lays down strict conditions for trade in live poultry, including day old poultry, between member states. The directive requires, in particular, that all such poultry must be accompanied by a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian in the country of export.  I am constrained by the terms of the directive from applying any additional requirements to the importation of poultry other than those set out in the directive itself.  As far as the importation of poultry from third countries is concerned, harmonised rules governing such trade will be in <Col N="1076" /> place shortly at EU level.  No such imports have been, or will be, permitted into this country pending the entry into force of these rules.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that the Irish poultry industry has adopted a code of practice which sets out some additional conditions in relation to the importation of poultry.  I would, of course, encourage every importer to follow this code of practice when importing poultry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 55 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 77 costs orders were made by Mr. Justice Hamilton granting costs, from various dates, to 75 counsel and 77 solicitors.  He specified in each order the number of counsel and solicitors to be paid.</P>
      <P>The procedure in relation to these orders is that those claiming costs, or cost accountants, acting on their behalf must submit bills to a Taxing Master of the High Court.</P>
      <P>The hearing by the Taxing Master began on 11 October and the State is being represented at this hearing by Mr. Peter Fitzpatrick, legal cost accountant, who is being instructed by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the hearing by the Taxing Master it remains open to the State to raise objections to the amounts awarded <Col N="1078" /> if necessary by way of appeals to the High Court and Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The taxation of the costs relating to Laurence Goodman and Goodman International was stayed under the order of Mr. Justice Lavan of 20 November 1995 granting the Minister for Finance leave to apply for judicial review in respect of a ruling made by the Taxing Master on 1 November 1995 with regard to the interpretation of the order of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The judgment of the court, given on 9 February 1996, was that costs could only be paid in respect of witnesses who actually gave oral evidence.</P>
    <P>To date 21 bills of approximately £10.532 million have been lodged with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor or the Taxing Master.  Of these 11 have been referred back to the claimants to present their bills in a proper format for taxing.  I am circulating a table showing details of the name of the claimant and the amount being claimed.</P>
    <P>An index of all the costs orders made by the beef tribunal is contained in Chapter 26 of the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry and in appendix three of the same document a list of all the legal representation before the tribunal is given.</P>

      <Quest>the decrease in the number of active farming units during 1995; the steps, if any, he is taking to reverse the trend towards increasing rural depopulation and an associated increase in urban unemployment levels.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4657/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures for the number of farms are not yet available for 1995.  The CSO are expected to be in a position to provide this data in May <Col N="1081" /> 1996.  There were 153,000 family farms in 1994 as compared with 158,900 in 1993, a decline of 5,900 or 3.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>One of the key objectives of Irish agricultural policy is to maintain the maximum number of viable farm households. This policy aims both at maximising viability and maintaining the greatest possible number of farms.  It must be acknowledged, however, that, in common with the pattern in all other developed countries, increased commercialisation and competition will mean reductions in farm numbers.</P>
      <P>The agricultural measures under the Community Support Framework 1994-99 are making a significant contribution to the objective of maintaining the maximum number of viable farm households.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry aims to improve the viability of existing farm households by encouraging structural improvement and rural development.  It includes: on farm investment measures aimed at assisting farmers with development potential in traditional agricultural sectors to improve production efficiency and comply with environmental and health and safety standards; income maintenance &mdash; headage &mdash; for farmers with less development potential; encouragement for farmers and other rural dwellers to diversify into new areas with employment creation potential e.g. alternative farm enterprises, production of non-surplus products, agri-tourism and forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Off-farm employment opportunities are also an essential element in the development of sustainable rural communities. The availability of local employment will help to reduce the migration of young people to urban areas in search of work.  Under the Industry Operational Programme, the Sub-Programme for the Development of the Food Industry and the measure to encourage forestry processing will contribute significantly to rural job creation.  Under the Leader Community Initiative, local community groups <Col N="1082" /> encourage both on farm and off farm employment creation schemes.</P>
    <P>Payments under the FEOGA guarantee fund are also important in the maintenance of the maximum number of viable farm households.  The accompanying measures to CAP reform comprise the following: the early retirement scheme for farmers, which complements the installation aid for young farmers under the OPARDF, will help to improve the age structure of our farming population and the size of Irish farms; the forestry measure encourages farm planting, thus providing an alternative source of income for farmers, and contributing to off farm rural employment creation in the downstream processing sector; the REP scheme supports farmers in their role as guardians of the rural environment, an essential prerequisite to sustainable rural development.</P>
    <P>Premia payments make a very substantial contribution towards maintaining farmers' incomes.  These payments help farmers who might otherwise abandon farming due to short-term income problems to remain in farming and adjust to a more competitive international environment.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out recently when welcoming the record level of farm income last year, direct payments to farmers amounted to about £750 million in 1995 or over one third of farm income.  Market support and other payments amounted to over £700 million.  These transfers represent a major boost for rural incomes and play an important role in supporting the rural population. For the future development of our rural areas however it is essential that we should concentrate on improving efficiency and competitiveness in our agriculture, food and forestry industries.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above policies, which are fully or partly funded by the European Union, the Government has structured the taxation and social welfare regimes to support farmers and rural communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is involved in the operation of certain measures which apply specifically in the six southern Border counties and are funded under the Joint INTERREG Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland 1994-99 and the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland 1995-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The INTERREG Programme contains specific measures aimed at assisting agriculture and forestry and for <Col N="1084" /> which £3 million in public funding has been provided up to 1999.  Measures approved for funding in the period 1994 to 1996 are in respect of projects which relate to the enhancement of the animal and avian health status in the region.  In addition most of the other measures in the programme will contribute to the development of agriculture and rural development in the Border counties. The total package for this programme in the six southern Border counties is £115 million of which £72 million is EU funding.</P>
    <P>The EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was introduced as a direct consequence of the peace process.  The programme contains a measure which can assist actions of a cross-Border nature between public bodies in the areas of agriculture and forestry.  The public funding provision for the southern Border counties is £0.666 million up to 1997.  Under this measure a cross-Border anti-farm source pollution initiative is being developed.  In addition other measures in the support programme may assist agriculture related employment and training, tourism, and small businesses. The total public funding under this programme is £64 million up to 1997 in respect of the six southern Border counties.</P>
    <P>A range of other EU assisted national programmes and schemes applies to the Border counties.  Under the Leader Programme eight groups operating in the Border counties or in parts of them, have been successful in securing a total of £16.361 million public funding for the period 1994-99.  There is also a provision of £1.5 million for transnational co-operation e.g. with Northern Ireland which could be of assistance to groups in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The funding breakdown of the other national programmes and schemes by county is not readily available.  These include the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF) 1994-99 and the various schemes operated under the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> The question of re-focusing expenditure under the OPARDF in the Border counties to support the peace process is being kept under review by the monitoring committee of that programme.</P>

      <P>Since the EU Commission cut export refunds last autumn in an effort to achieve a more orderly flow of licence applications to comply with GATT export restrictions, I have impressed on the European Commission the need for measures to <Col N="1086" /> ensure that Irish beef producers receive adequate prices for their cattle.</P>
      <P>The measures I have put forward for consideration by the Commission include an increase in the export refunds and an aids to private storage scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards an APS scheme, the Commission have indicated that the market situation does not warrant such action; that such a scheme could not in any event be introduced within a time scale which would bring any short-term benefit to the industry.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined in detail the efforts I have made to date in the matter of export refunds.  The Commission have responded to these efforts by increasing export refunds on two occasions in recent months &mdash; by 14 per cent in early December and by 5 to 7.5 per cent earlier this month.  However, the Commission has so far resisted the idea of any further immediate general increases on the grounds that cattle prices are reasonably high in the Union and that applications for export licences both in Ireland and the EU as a whole under the new refund rate are substantial. I am continuing to press for early action on refunds either on a general or selective basis.  The matter is still before the Commission.</P>

      <P>As I stated many times since becoming Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the key factors which will influence the ability of the food industry to meet the challenges facing it now, and in the years ahead, <Col N="1087" /> are competitiveness, innovation and marketing.  The National Development Strategy for the Food Industry which I launched last year, under which £284 million in State and EU aid is to be invested in the industry, and the plans drawn up by the State agencies to implement that strategy are all specifically geared towards building the industry's capability in these three key areas. I am confident that, used to the full, the measures I have put in place will help the industry to adapt to, and develop under, even the most difficult international environment.</P>

Advertisements are placed by the Civil Service Commission and normally appear in <i>The Irish Times, Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on a Thurdsay or Friday.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Last May, I asked the National Drugs Advisory Board to report to me on the potential human health consequences of the use of organophosphate sheep dips.  This work has been completed and the findings made available to the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other relevant bodies.  A report of the work will be published in due course but I have made arrangements to have the findings supplied immediately to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The work involved a review of safety in the use of sheep dips and of the potential ways in which these products can affect human health.  It took into account work done in other countries and the current published literature. The findings emphasised the need for precautions in their use and for appropriate training of those selling and using them.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has now developed training aids for users and arrangements for the introduction of training courses for those selling the products are at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>The National Monuments and Historic Properties Service is currently engaged in carrying out a national inventory of architecture which, of course, includes Georgian buildings.  As the inventory for each area is completed, a copy is forwarded to the planning authorities and data is also made available for consultation through the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, and as I have on several occasions indicated in this House, I and my colleague, Deputy Howlin, Minister for the Environment, established, in February 1995, pursuant to commitments in the Policy Agreement for Government entitled A Government of Renewal, an interdepartmental working group made up of officials of our Departments and of the Office of Public Works.  The working group is to examine and report back with recommendations on improving the protection for listed buildings (which would, of course, include Georgian buildings), including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis, introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings and undertaking a full national architectural audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should also note that specific protection is afforded to heritage buildings in the ownership of public authorities (which would include Georgian buildings), under section 10 of the Heritage Act, 1995.  This section provides that a public authority may not proceed with a proposal to demolish, alter significantly or dispose of a building owned by it, which has been designated as a heritage building by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht under that section on the advice of the Heritage Council, or any land or other building adjoining such a building, contrary to the advice of the Council, unless the Minister agrees to the proposal or to a modified form of the proposal, or the Government agrees to the proposal. Section 10 also provides that the Heritage Council may consult with or advise <Col N="1094" /> public authorities in relation to the maintenance, preservation, restoration, upkeep and improvement of any designated heritage buildings owned by such authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of public access, there are two categories of Georgian buildings held by the State:</P>
    <P>(a)  those buildings which form part of the heritage portfolio, e.g., Casino at Marino, Castletown House, Emo Court etc., to which access is provided for public enjoyment, and</P>
    <P>(b)  those buildings which form part of the State property portfolio and are in active use.  The question of the future use of and public access to this category of State-owned Georgian buildings is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The overall approach is to preserve archaeological remains where possible.  It is also desirable that those remains be available for viewing by the public.  Unfortunately in the case referred to by the Deputy planning permission has been given for a development which if it goes ahead as presently proposed means that foundation walls which have been uncovered cannot be preserved in situ.  A number of options have been outlined to me by the National Monuments Service none of which are completely satisfactory.  I am considering these in the context of many disparate views as to how the site should be treated in order to determine the best way forward.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to a case where following the normal appeals process my office received representations concerning the marking of the leaving certificate higher level English papers for 1995 from a school in the north east.  The chief inspector and the inspector who acted as chief examiner for this subject in the 1995 examinations visited the school on 22 February 1996.  The chief examiner had a discussion with the principal and teachers of English and the chief inspector joined him for a discussion with representatives of parents.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting the chief inspector ordered a further recheck of the 18 scripts involved.  This was conducted by the chief examiner and the chief advising examiner.  This process is now complete and today the chief examiner and the chief advising examiner are visiting the school to inform it of the result of the recheck.  When this has been done and I have a report I will be in a position to inform the Deputy of the result of the recheck and of the name of the school involved.</P>

      <P>I have recently established TEASTAS, the Irish National Certification Authority, to provide a single national structure for the certification and assessment of all extra-university third level and further and continuing education and training programmes.  One of the specific tasks within the remit of TEASTAS is to establish clear routes of progression from foundation awards to higher degrees through a standard of graded qualifications.  This will put in place ladders and linkages between the various levels of training in both the education and training sectors.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this development, access to post leaving cert courses will be open to students who have completed either a senior cycle programme through the leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme or the leaving cert applied, or who have completed an equivalent vocational programme. Work is also proceeding on the development of national vocational level 1 qualifications by the National Council for Vocational Awards, so that trainees who complete Youthreach or VTOS programmes may ultimately enter post leaving certificate courses through this route.  As part of an expansion of Youthreach under way at present, I have invited proposals from vocational education committees for the piloting of innovative Progression proposals which have a strong potential for reintegration into mainstream pathways, such as programmes in co-operation with schools, in-school or out-of-school leaving cert applied programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I approved a pilot scheme in 1995 which established a new system <Col N="1104" /> for allocating places in regional technical college colleges for holders of NCVA Level 2 (post leaving cert) qualifications. Under the terms of this scheme a quota of places is reserved on selected courses in participating colleges for candidates who are placed in an order of merit on the basis of their NCVA award results.  This means that award holders may be awarded a third level place either on the basis of their NCVA or leaving cert results.  The scheme is continuing this year and has been expanded to include courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 23 January 1996 at the rate of £116.20 per week.  He became unfit for work from 2 January 1996 and was no longer entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  He claimed disability benefit and is being paid £65.50 a week which is the rate appropriate to his circumstances having regard to the fact that he had no earnings in the relevant tax year.</P>
      <P>It is open to a person in this situation to apply for supplementary welfare allowance which is subject to a means test.  I understand, however, that the person concerned does not qualify for a basic payment of supplementary welfare allowance by reason of his wife's earnings. He is, however, in receipt of an allowance of £6.70 towards the cost of his mortgage.</P>
      <P>There is no social assistance scheme specifically for people who are sick and who do not qualify for disability benefit, on the lines of the unemployment assistance for unemployed people and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the only recourse for people in this situation.  The provision of such a scheme on the lines of the unemployment assistance scheme would have significant, financial implications.  I believe, however, that there is a need to review the provisions for sick and disabled persons generally and I will be undertaking such a review following the take-over by my Department later this year of responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-1999, which is the main EU-funded operational programme for the promotion of industrial development in Ireland, the total State and EU investment in 1995 amounted to £220 million.  This figure is provisional, pending receipt of final accounts from participating bodies, and covers all activities under the programme including support for the development of the food industry and the development of industry in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994-1999 is to promote the development of a strong internationally competitive enterprise sector in Ireland comprising both indigenous and non-indigenous companies that will make the maximum contribution to selfsustaining employment growth.</P>
      <P>The performance in 1995 under the Industry OP was particularly good. There were over 25,000 gross new jobs created during the year, which was well above the OP target of creating 20,000 jobs p.a. on average over the life of the OP.  The outturn in respect of net employment was even more encouraging with over 10,000 net jobs created. This is more than double the long-term programme aim which is to create a net 5,000 jobs p.a.  Exports by indigenous firms, promoted by ABT, grew by 12 per cent during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also administers the Human Resources Development Operational Programme which provides a range of measures aimed at addressing <Col N="1108" /> the training, educational and employment needs of different groups on the labour market.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the programme are to improve the education and skill levels of the work force to most directly reflect the requirements of the labour market, and to enhance the employment prospects of the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed and persons excluded from the labour market.  A total sum of £508.2 million was allocated to this Operational Programme for 1995.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure in 1995 by the county enterprise boards amounted to £19,793,776.  The county enterprise boards were established to fill a gap in the support services provided to small and micro-enterprises, including such enterprises in the services sector.</P>
    <P>Under the RETEX Operational Programme 1993-1997 a total of £1.12 million of State and EU funding took place in 1995.  The purpose of the RETEX Operational Programme 1993-97 is to help support the acceleration of economic activities in regions heavily dependent on the textile and clothing sector. RETEX support has been concentrated on helping SMEs to introduce world class manufacturing and new technology into the workplace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> As part of this process, and in order to ensure the effective delivery of the Department's policies, four working groups were established under the direction of a special strategic management board to examine the following areas: human resources; departmental structure and organisation; communications, and resources and outputs.</P>
    <P>While the majority of the work was carried out by Departmental personnel, my Department commissioned Hay Management Consultants Ltd. to carry out a staff perception survey among all staff of the Department in 1995.  The report drew attention to specific difficulties with regard to motivation, communication and, particularly in so far as the clerical grades are concerned, lack of challenge and responsibility.</P>
    <P>The consultants recognised that the Department of Enterprise and Employment is different from other public sector organisations in terms of the speed with which work must sometimes be completed and acknowledged this characteristic to be evident in the flexibility with which work is carried out.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the recommendations of the working groups, and taking account of the findings of the survey, the strategic management board decided on a realignment of some Departmental structures and approved a framework of action in relation to human resources and communications issues.  Cross-divisional teams are currently implementing the recommendations on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In addition in the context of the decentralisation of the Patents Office to Kilkenny, a team from the Department of Finance is currently undertaking a study of that office to establish the necessary management structure, business processes and information technology requirements to ensure a successful relocation.</P>

    <P>While it is obviously desirable that as much as possible of our food and drink needs are met from domestic production, factors such as climate prevent the production of many such products in Ireland.  Quite apart from this consideration, it would be unrealistic to expect that trade in food and drink could flow in one direction only, in the international trading conditions that apply today.</P>
    <P>In this connection it should be noted that in the period in question i.e. January to July 1995, Ireland's food and drinks exports were valued at £2.9 billion, representing a balance of approximately £2.2 billion in our favour. The measures which are available under the National Development Strategy for the Food Industry which I launched early last year have been designed to help the industry to compete even more effectively on both home and export markets.</P>

      <P>Of the ten applicants referred to in my reply of 23 January, five were located in County Meath, two in County Wexford and one each in counties Louth, Dublin and Kilkenny. These payments represented subsidies due under the EU scheme for compensatory payments for arable crops and were not mainly payments for the set-aside of arable land.</P>
      <P>The total amount paid out under the 1995 EU scheme for compensatory payments for arable crops was just over £82 million, of which £11.5 million was paid in respect of set-aside land.</P>
      <P>The top ten payments in 1995 totalled just over £1,675,000, of which less than £320,000 was paid in respect of set-aside land.</P>

      <P>The undertaking of any assessment of erosion and storm damage is in the first instance a matter for the relevant local authority.  In this case, that is Cork County Council.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to this House, Cork County Council has advised the Department of the Marine of their top four priority proposals for coastal protection.  These proposals include works at Ballycotton.  However, a detailed submission outlining fully costed, designed and justified proposals is awaited.  When this is received full consideration will be given to the inclusion of the proposals under the European Union Funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999.  Under this Programme some £5.2 million is available for all coastal protection works over the 1994 through 1999 period.  There is no fund for storm damage under the Programme.</P>
