    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the Law Reform Commission's 1994 annual <Col N="1490" /> report on 31 August 1995 the commission has completed the following three reports: (1) Report on An Examination of The Law of Bail, published in September 1995; (2) Report on Intoxication, published in November 1995; and (3) Report on Family Courts to be published shortly.  I also expect, very shortly, to receive the commission's 1995 annual report.</P>
    <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report details of work in progress by the commission, which, in the main is ongoing work arising from its First Programme for Law Reform approved by the Government and published in 1977. The Government will be giving particular attention to the formulation of a second work programme for the commission in the context of the renewal of the commission whose term of office, with the exception of that of the president, expires at the end of this year. The Attorney General has already had informal consultations with the president and members of the commission on the matter.</P>
    <P>To date the commission has formulated 52 reports containing proposals for reform of the law, 11 working papers, nine consultation papers and 16 annual reports.  This is a formidable achievement. Responsibility for implementation of the commission's recommendations is a matter for individual Departments.  Progress continues to be made in that regard and this is reflected in the commission's annual reports. There are no plans to establish a separate criminal law commission.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation, and that of the Government, for the valuable reports and papers which the commission has produced in the last 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Taoiseach expressed dissatisfaction in the House with the Report of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the question of bail.  Did the Taoiseach ask the commission to consider this matter again?  Does he accept that the absence <Col N="1491" /> of a clear Government policy on and commitment to this matter gives the impression that the Government is not serious about combating crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not express dissatisfaction with the commission in regard to their report on bail, I expressed concern about a report which did not contain recommendations, and the reason that report did not contain recommendations was that the Government of the day did not ask for them. That was an omission on behalf of the then Government.  When asking for such a comprehensive report it would have been more sensible for that Government, if it was concerned about the bail issue, to ask the commission, in addition to producing what is a very useful dissertation on the subject of bail, to produce recommendations for action. That omission on the part of the Government, not of the commission, was the cause of my comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine the previous Government, when it asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the question of bail, allowed the commission, as is normally the case, to use its best judgment, which it does very well.  My recollection is that the Taoiseach criticised the report produced by the commission.  Did he ask the commission again to make recommendations on that report, if that was what he found objectionable with it, and what is the Government's view on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The best course is the one the Government is following, that is using the report which has been presented, a very through report in so far as it describes the position and the legal options, as the basis for recommendations which the Government would formulate on the matter rather than send it back to the commission. That is the most expeditious way of dealing with the matter now.  It is regrettable the then Government did not ask <Col N="1492" /> the commission to make recommendations, but that is not a big problem at this stage.  Now that we have the report let us deal with it in the way I have described.  The Government will consider this matter quite soon.  It recognises there is concern about offences committed while on bail and will address that matter shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the term of office of the Law Reform Commission will expire later this year. Is the President of the Law Reform Commission free to engage in party political fund raising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be appropriately the subject of a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach not answer it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirements in regard to any matter concerning the conduct of members of commissions is laid down in legislation and if Deputy Harney consults that legislation she may find the answer to her question.  If, however, she chooses to put down a parliamentary question on the topic it will be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the events of recent days and the Taoiseach's strong defence of the chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, is he aware that the Tánaiste took a very strong view when the former President of the Law Reform Commission expressed views that he did not like.  He felt it was inappropriate for a person in that position to express publicly any political view.  Is the current president &mdash; this will apply also to his successor &mdash; entitled to express political views and to fund raise on behalf of a political party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recollect that the circumstances to which she referred were not ones where <Col N="1493" /> I had accountability.  I was not in Government at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for the Taoiseach's view, he is now in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not express any views at the time about the President of the Law Reform Commission, even though I would not be required to answer for it here in my present capacity.  If the Deputy is concerned about the engagement of the President of the Law Reform Commission in matters of current controversy or in regard to any other matter where she might feel there was a constraint that ought to be imposed on the President of the commission, the appropriate way to deal with it would be to propose an amendment to the legislation to impose such constraints as the Deputy feels are appropriate in the case.  That option is open to her.  I have also invited the Deputy to put down parliamentary questions if she wishes to raise this matter in a more substantive way.  I am answering questions here about the general work programme of the commission and I want to put on the record of the House my appreciation and that of the Government of the valuable reports and papers the commission has produced over the past 20 years.  That includes the work it did during the tenure of office of all the members of the commission during that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies are offering but we should bear in mind that there are only 30 minutes available for dealing with questions to the Taoiseach.  I want to facilitate as many Deputies as possible. I am calling Deputy O'Dea who tabled Question No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote down what the Taoiseach said at the time in relation to referring the question of bail to the Law Reform Commission.  He described the decision of the then Government to refer the matter of bail to the Law <Col N="1494" /> Reform Commission as &ldquo;a delaying tactic&rdquo;. Has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to revise his opinion on the propriety of referring matters such as this to the Law Reform Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was a delaying tactic on the part of the previous Government which could have dealt with the matter.  That is not a reflection on the Law Reform Commission; it is a reflection on the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Why will this Government not deal with the matter?  It now has the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the matter was as urgent as the party now in Opposition says it is, it would have dealt with it rather than sending it to the Law Reform Commission requesting a report but without asking that body to make recommendations on it.  The Government is dealing with the matter as it finds it now.  We have a valuable report, although it does not contain recommendations, and rather than sending the matter back to the commission a second time, as the Deputy's Leader suggested, the Government will take its own decisions on the matter and make recommendations to the House in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows that various people, including members of the legal profession and criminologists, hold differing views on bail.  At that time, I was strongly in favour of dealing with the matter, and that is still my opinion, but others believed it was better to ask the Law Reform Commission to write a comprehensive report.  As the Taoiseach said the report is very useful but will he consider asking the Law Reform Commission to examine our conspiracy laws and the adequacy of existing legislation to deal with drugs, particularly in light of what the Minister for Justice and I have seen in the United States?  Will he agree that <Col N="1495" /> our society should not tolerate a situation where the drug barons are well known and living a lifestyle well beyond their obvious means?  That does not happen in other countries and, if the Government is interested in tackling crime, it would be a positive step towards addressing this issue.  Other jurisdictions operate a system of zero tolerance to crime; we seem to tolerate all crime in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for his insight to what took place when the previous Government decided to refer the matter of bail to the Law Reform Commission rather than deal with it itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a delaying tactic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt the Deputy's version of events and I am prepared to accept that, notwithstanding collective responsibility, he was in favour of getting on with the matter but the majority of the then Government wanted to refer it to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not prepared to get on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting insight and I thank the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is afraid of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for that little glimpse of what was happening at the time.  In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question concerning conspiracy law, I will consider carefully what he said because I have no doubt the subject matter about which he is concerned is serious.  The suggestions he made are constructive and I will discuss them with the Minister for Justice and, if necessary, the Attorney General and the Law Reform Commission.  My own recollection as a student of law is that <Col N="1496" /> offences of conspiracy are notoriously vague and potentially oppressive in their effects in so far as it is not easy to establish what constitutes conspiracy. There is difficulty in that area of law. That may be all the more reason for taking seriously what the Deputy said on the matter.  I will look into it and revert to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are Law Reform Commission reports on the following topics: contempt, defamation, sentencing, landlord and conveyancing law, contract law, intoxication as a defence and dishonesty? Does the Government intend to implement those worthwhile recommendations and, if so, when can we expect to see the legislation?  If that is the Government's intention, why have those proposals not appeared in the Programme for Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>All those reports were given to the Deputy's party when it was in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us hear the reply without interruption from either side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that the Deputy was not just a Minister of State in the Government which received those reports but a Minister of State in the Department of Justice.  I have no doubt he is well able to offer explanations as to the reason he and his colleagues did not deal with those reports when he had the opportunity to do so. do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach for his view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has an obligation to answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those reports are being dealt with now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and if the Deputy wishes to put down questions, with the exception of one of the references he made, the appropriate Minister will provide him with detailed answers.  The exception is the report on sentencing; the Deputy's quotation is inaccurate in so far as that report has not yet been published.  It is due to be published later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to accommodate the three Deputies offering but we should bear in mind that almost 50 per cent of our time has been exhausted on these two questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the law of conspiracy.  Would I be guilty of engaging in too much conspiracy theory if I attributed the absence of any Labour Party Ministers in the House today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as an indication of party political pique?  Where are the Labour Party Ministers today?  Are they sulking in their tent or have they withdrawn from this Cabinet as well?  In relation to the Taoiseach's remarks to Deputy Harney about the necessity to legislate to prohibit the Law Reform Commission President from engaging in overt political activity or fund raising, is he aware that there is no law which prevents a High Court judge from doing that other than convention?  It is when conventions are flouted that Taoisigh are required to act to restore the integrity of the offices concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The conventions in question derive from the fact that our judicial system is based on the common law and the common law, as distinct from Statute law, rests in its entirety on convention and precedent.  That is the appropriate arrangement in regard to judges and why there is not a statutory provision.  The long standing practice and principle of the Judiciary in that <Col N="1498" /> regard rests on the conventions that derive from the common law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to recently established statutory bodies, obviously the statute will be considered carefully in this House and if any Members were of the view that particular constraints should be placed in regard to political activity, or any other matter, the appropriate amendments could be made.  I make the point, however, that if people adhere to the statute, they are adhering to it.</P>

      <P>The Government has had the Law Reform Commission report on bail since last autumn.  The Minister for Justice announced over two months ago that she would bring urgent proposals on the matter to Government within six weeks.  Will the Taoiseach accept the reason we have not seen these proposals is that the Government is hopelessly divided on the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Taoiseach that, in the context of the position of the President of the Law Reform Commission, it would be highly unethical, to say the least, for a person in a quasi-judicial position to overtly engage in the collection of funds for a political party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already replied extensively on the position in regard to the law on bail to the Deputy's leader and other members of his party.  That matter is currently at an advanced stage of consideration by the Minister for Justice and I expect her to bring proposals on the matter to Cabinet shortly.  When the Deputy's party was in office, rather than deal with the matter they referred it to the Law Reform Commission. That <Col N="1499" /> was a mistake on their part but, admittedly, something for which Deputy O'Donoghue has no responsibility because he did not have the onerous responsibility of being a member of that Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Taoiseach's attitude in the House today, is it not clear that his Government has lost total control of the crime problem in this city?  Is it not clear that this is largely due to argument and that the Minister for Justice is not receiving the necessary resources of time or money to fight crime on the streets?  There was another shooting recently.  The Taoiseach's attitude is quite clear &mdash; his Government has gone soft on crime.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government intends to implement all legislative commitments in the programme, A Government of Renewal; if he has satisfied himself that all legislation promised in this programme will be passed before the end of 1996; and the items, if any, that have effectively been dropped or are not being favoured.</Quest>

      <P>On 17 October 1995 in reply to a parliamentary question from the Deputy, I stated that satisfactory progress was being made in preparing legislation to implement the commitments in A Government of Renewal. I outlined the progress being made in that regard and I stated I was confident that all of the Commitments would be well advanced within the Government's mandate from the present Dáil.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that progress in implementing the legislative commitments continues to be satisfactory.  Thirteen commitments have been reflected in legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and one commitment by way of regulations. Four commitments are the subject of Bills before the Houses and a further nine commitments are the subject of ten Bills being drafted by the parliamentary draftsman.  I am hopeful these ten Bills, along with Bills in respect of a further nine commitments, will be initiated before the end of 1996, leaving a balance of seven commitments to be dealt with by way of legislation in 1997.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach formed the Government he borrowed <Col N="1502" /> without acknowledgement many legislative proposals from Fianna Fáil, which he included in the programme A Government of Renewal.  Does the Taoiseach have any intention of reforming the Ministers and Secretaries Act, replacing the Official Secrets Act, bringing in an administrative procedures Bill, enabling the establishment of a commission on the management of courts or establishing a prison management committee?  These matters are extremely important and many relate to the area of crime.  There was one Bill last year and there will be one this year.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the position in regard to crime was bad under the last Government.  Perhaps it was, but it is far worse now.  The position in regard to drugs, shootings, killings and muggings is appalling.  Will the Taoiseach give clear commitments on when, if ever, he intends doing anything about these matters in the lifetime of this Government?</P>

      <P>No, not at all.  Conflicts of interest are inherent in the position of any Attorney General who has previously practised as a barrister and was active in cases to which the State was a party.  There are several such cases but there is no need for me to statutorily revoke any powers for that to be dealt with.  I answered questions several times in the House outlining the formal procedures in place where the State needs advice or assistance in any matters where the Attorney General is conflicted, because of his previous work. They are either dealt with by the senior legal assistant, acting apart from the Attorney General and without consultation with the Attorney General, or where the senior legal assistant determines that he needs outside legal advice, such outside legal advice is taken.  There are formal arrangements for dealing with this situation which is inherent in the work of any Attorney General who has had a previously active practice at the Bar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The number of full temporary releases granted in any one year is approximately 4,000.  In addition, approximately 4,500 individuals would be granted varying periods of short-term temporary release in the course of any one year for such reasons as funerals, medical attention and family visits to see children or ill parents.  The information sought by the Deputy on the relationships between temporary release and offences, sentences imposed and lengths of sentences served, is not readily available.  To ascertain it would require the manual examination of over 10,000 individual offender's files and the collation of the information.  Such use of staff time could not be justified at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The temporary release system has been operated under statute since 1960 by successive Minister for Justice. Before granting temporary release the Minister has regard to a number of factors.  These factors would include the circumstances of the offence, the length <Col N="1508" /> of sentence imposed by the Court, the length of time served, as well as other factors such as behaviour while in custody, the previous record of the offender and whether the granting of temporary release would be likely to pose a threat to the community.  In recent years, i.e. at least over the last four years, the shortage of prison accommodation has also been a factor for consideration when temporary releases are being effected.</P>
    <P>A system of review meetings is operated at all the prisons and this enables the views of the various agencies dealing with an offender &mdash; such as prison staff, chaplains and the probation and welfare service &mdash; to be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>If temporary release, whether full or short-term, is granted it is always subject to conditions.  In all cases there is the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour.  Other conditions could include supervision by the probation and welfare service, reporting at regular intervals to a Garda station etc.  Temporary release automatically ends if any conditions are breached in which event the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without warrant or without any court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Temporary release arrangements are in effect our system of parole.  Paroles are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  While due regard must be had to any risk a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain cases, attempts at planned re-integration of offenders were not made since they must return to the community, anyway, on the expiry of their sentence.  Short-term temporary release such as one day, two days or a few hours would also be an integral part of most countries' penal system.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that nothing saps the morale of the Garda Síochána more than the sight of prisoners whom they have helped to <Col N="1509" /> put away walking the streets, having served only a short-term of their sentence? Will the Minister accept that the sole criterion used for most temporary releases is that there is insufficient prison spaces?  In that context, will she agree that it was a fundamental error and a downright disgrace for the Government to cancel the prison work at Castlerea and Mountjoy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of both Deputies to the existing legislation, the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967, as amended, which deals with the sale and distribution of pornographic publications.</P>
      <P>There is a mechanism in place, under this legislation, through which obscene publications can be banned.  In particular, section 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, makes provision for the Censorship of Publications Board, on receipt of a complaint from any person, to prohibit the sale of a book or magazine which it considers to be indecent or obscene.  Complaints should be made to the Censorship of Publications Board.  A complaint must be accompanied by a copy of the book in question or, in the case of a magazine, by three recent issues of the magazine. Once a publication is banned, it is then a criminal offence to sell, expose, offer, advertise, keep for sale, distribute, offer or keep for distribution any such publication.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge persons who may be aware of the sale, at any place, of books or magazines of this kind to employ the provisions outlined in section 6, which deals with obscene or pornographic books and section 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, as amended, which deals with obscene or pornographic publications.</P>
      <P>Arising out of a number of complaints received, I am aware that the Censorship of Publications Board has recently banned in the order of 40 publications and 39 books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda and the Customs and Excise service also have certain powers to search for, and seize, indecent or <Col N="1511" /> obscene pictures, books, magazines and videos.  I have recently obtained the advice of the Attorney General in relation to the existing powers which the Garda has in this regard and I have forwarded his advice to the Garda Commissioner for his attention.  I am aware that, where alleged breaches of the legislation come to notice, the gardaí take action.</P>
    <P>Again, I urge anybody with information on breaches of the law, in this or in any other regard, to bring the matter to the attention of the Garda Síochána, either by contacting the local Garda station or by telephoning the Garda freephone confidential telephone No. 1800 666111.</P>
    <P>I assure both Deputies that, if at any stage it were to become evident that the existing censorship legislation is inadequate to prevent the sale of offensive pornographic material, I will not hesitate to propose amending legislation. We all have a duty to ensure that children are protected from abuse of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the increasing availability of obscene material in the State and the threat this poses to vulnerable young minds, in particular, does the Minister of State accept that the present legislation is not adequate and that the Censorship of Publications Board should be allowed to unilaterally ban certain obscene publications without having received a complaint? Does he also accept that it should be a criminal offence to sell obscene publications irrespective of whether the matter is reported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the legislation is inadequate.  If in the future the law is deemed inadequate I will have no difficulty introducing additional legislation.  We sought the advice of the Attorney General and submitted it to the Garda Commissioner.  If necessary, the legislation could be examined in the <Col N="1512" /> context of the discussion paper on sexual offences which the Minister is preparing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of the Minister of State about this matter, but legislation is required to make it a criminal offence to sell obscene publications which portray child pornography and bestiality and, at the very least, other obscene material should state that it may not be sold to people under the age of 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not introduce legislation for the sake of doing so, we introduce only when it is necessary.  If I discover that further legislation is necessary to deal with this matter it will be introduced, but I am satisfied that the present legislation is adequate to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Most parents are satisfied that the legislation dealing with this matter is grossly inadequate.  As there is a proliferation of obscene and disgusting material available at outlets, tough legislation is required to protect vulnerable young minds.  Will the Minister of State address this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy believes that a significant amount of pornographic literature is available in the State he should do his duty as a citizen and report the matter to the Garda authorities.  If he reports it to me I will have the matter investigated.  I do not take this matter any less seriously than the Deputy.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for children, I am probably more concerned than most Members about the matter.  If parents are concerned they should get three recent issues of the publication concerned and send them to the Garda authorities.  If the Deputy forwards me details of the complaints to which he referred I will ensure that the necessary action is taken.</P>

      <P>The Government decided that a review by the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners of certain recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission as regards co-operation between the two bodies be carried out. Senior officers of the Revenue and gardaí have met over recent months and discussed arrangements for improved co-operation on the drugs problem and other serious crime in the context of the Law Reform Commission recommendations. The joint review by both agencies has been completed and the outcome of the review will be submitted to Government shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that co-operation between the Garda and the Customs and Excise on the drugs issue was not satisfactory heretofore?  Will she confirm that the drugs landed at Castletownbere last November and seized at Urlingford were landed without the agreement of the Customs and Excise service?  Will she also confirm that the suggestions made in some media to the effect that Customs and Excise had compromised their operation by revealing the details to the media are wholly false and malicious and without any foundation in fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners and the Garda co-operate on a number of fronts and at a number of levels to tackle crime and confiscate the proceeds of crime.  Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1983, gives power to the Revenue Commissioners to assess for income tax purposes any profits which arise from an unlawful or unknown <Col N="1514" /> source.  The Garda are in a position from time to time to supply information to the Revenue Commissioners to pursue such assessment.</P>
      <P>Section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides that the Garda can seek a court order requiring a body such as the Revenue Commissioners to disclose material where the Garda have reasonable suspicions about drug trafficking, money laundering etc.  More generally, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides that applications for confiscation orders against persons convicted on indictment of drug trafficking offences and non drug trafficking offences may be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's further questions about the position on drugs landed at Castletownbere, this is subject to ongoing investigations.  In accordance with precedents set in the House by former Minister for Justice it would be inappropriate for me to enter into any details about an ongoing Garda investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to confirm to the House that the drugs landed by the Garda at Castletownbere were landed without any co-operation by the Customs and Excise section of the Revenue Commissioners and that the suggestion that the operation had been compromised by a leak from this section to the media was wholly false and malicious and without any foundation in fact.  I repeat my questions to the Minister because I ask her to confirm that it is wrong, and was wrong, for anybody to suggest to the media that the &ldquo;Urlingford drugs seizure&rdquo; was in any way compromised by officers of Customs and Excise, that her departmental secretary confirmed as much to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and gave evidence to that effect to the Committee of Public Accounts?</P>

I do not intend to jeopardise this investigation and I ask other Deputies not to do so in order that it may be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      <P>I did not speak to any newspapers about who or what may have been involved in the seizure of drugs.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question as to whether anybody made an allegation that something was jeopardised.  I am aware the Minister for Finance answered an inquiry by the Deputy about the role of the Revenue Commissioners in this seizure.

      <P>Will the Minister accept that, since the number of cases that have been discharged at preliminary examination stage is minuscule, this is a time wasting exercise which is delaying the bringing of serious criminals to justice and that in the minutiae of cases where there are discharges there should be a provision whereby the accused person would apply to the court of trial for the case to be discharged on the basis that there was no <i>prima facie</i> case against him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with this subject on many occasions before in the House, most recently on 3 October, 1995.  On that date I informed the Dáil that the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides that applications for confiscation orders against persons convicted on indictment on drug trafficking offences and non-drug trafficking offences may be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Act also provides that applications for restraint orders freezing assets which may be liable to realisation if a confiscation order is imposed may be made by the DPP.</P>
      <P>I understand from the DPP's office that the DPP made an application to court for restraint orders in two cases. However, I understand that the DPP subsequently withdrew both orders, the first because he did not intend to proceed with the prosecution, and the second because the accused in this case was acquitted by the courts.  I understand that no application has been made for a confiscation order under the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the DPP is independent in the exercise of his functions and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that her reply will add to the growing cynicism of the public with regard to dealing seriously with drug traffickers and that it is unacceptable that only two applications were made and both were withdrawn?  Could she explain why applications were not made <Col N="1518" /> in all of the cases where people were convicted of drug trafficking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that when I became Minister the commencement orders for the necessary powers in the 1994 legislation had not been signed by the Government of which his party was a member.  I signed these orders in May 1995.  There have been two cases, both of which have been withdrawn for different reasons.  It is up to the Garda and the DPP to decide whether they can proceed.  The legislation is there for implementation.  It is up to the authorities who investigate crimes and for the DPP to decide whether the relevant sections of the Act are implemented.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Garda are pursuing the drug barons and others.  As prosecutions are instituted and convictions obtained I have no doubt that more and more orders will come into place.  The legislation is relatively new and it would not be unusual for only a small number of cases to have been taken under it. However, I hope it will be used more effectively over the coming years, indeed as effectively as was intended when introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>On the seizure of the assets of drug dealers, the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, are not adequate.  It is necessary to go beyond them and look at the proposal put forward by many interested parties that the Government and the Minister, who have an important role to play in this area, should set up a specialist unit made up of representatives of the Garda, Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  The only way one can go after the drug dealers in a co-ordinated way is by using all the powers available and not just those contained in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  The power is there but there does not appear to be a will to go after these people.  This is mainly due to the understandable fear among Revenue Commissioner officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To overcome this fear and the very real dangers facing people investigating drug dealers, it is necessary to set up a specialist unit which provides a certain degree of anonymity for officials so that they can go after drug dealers in an effective and co-ordinated way and get at their very substantial assets which they continue to accumulate.</P>

      <P>The net point of the Deputy's question is that a specialist unit should be set up.  It is precisely because I share the concerns expressed by many other people about the laws available in the criminal justice and Revenue systems that I asked the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda to work closely together.  That report will be presented to Government shortly and I will bear Deputy Gregory's suggestion in mind during its consideration. There is already close co-operation between the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners. I understand the team set up in the Department of Social Welfare to investigate people accused of taking social welfare illegally has achieved great success.  I will bear in mind the Deputy's suggestion that there is a need for a more co-ordinated approach between these three agencies during our consideration of the Revenue and Garda report.</P>

      <P>The lack of seizures and confiscations relates not only to the problems in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but also to the Minister's failure to make the regulation pursuant to section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  Her failure to do this since her appointment as Minister a long time ago has contributed to the situation whereby the assets of known traffickers could not be confiscated or seized by the Garda Síochána. The Minister has a duty to explain to the House why she did not introduce this provision by way of regulation until now.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's point.  I have put in place certain sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and these powers are available to the Garda and the DPP.  It is up to the Garda and for the DPP to prepare the case in court and for the DPP to decide whether he will implement those sections of the Act.  This is not my responsibility.  I prepared the legislation and made the powers available.  The fact that two cases only have been taken under the sections which are the subject of the question has nothing to do with the other sections of the Act.  The Garda and the Revenue Commissioners already have powers to deal with issues relating to people's assets.  In about an hour's time we will discuss the implementation of section 44 and the Deputy can comment further on the matter at that stage.  I do not have a copy of my speech with me but I will make my position clear.</P>

Will she confirm that the problem with the legislation which has been in operation for 11 months is that it is limited and restricted in its ambit and that Deputy Gregory was correct in stating that, if there was a serious political will to undertake a war against the drug barons, more than two attempts would have been made in 11 months during the middle of the drugs wave which has inundated the State to get at some of the assets of these people?</P>

      <P>As Deputy McDowell knows only too well, it is not for me to decide the number of times the legislation is implemented.  Having listened to an interview the Deputy did this <Col N="1522" /> morning I am beginning to lose my confidence in his expertise.  I always relied on him to be correct on all the issues to which he referred but this morning he tried to make the case that somebody might commit a crime while on bail when the issue of bail never arose. However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Gregory, his suggestion is worth considering seriously.  It is not a measure of the Government's intent that two cases only have been taken.  Rather these are the only two cases the DPP in his wisdom decided he could proceed with under the relevant sections of the Act.  He subsequently decided he could not proceed in one case as it had not been proceeded with while in the other case the person was acquitted.  I presume the Deputy is not asking me to ask the DPP to implement these sections of the Act in cases where a person is acquitted.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice is not empowered to do this, yet the Deputy has asked me to do so. However, I will not do so.  The Deputy said that the powers under the 1994 Act are limited but it should be remembered that this is a new Act and if it becomes obvious that it needs to be amended I will ensure that this is done.  The Act was introduced in 1994, less than two years ago, I thought my predecessor would have been well aware of the difficulties etc., in dealing with drug traffickers and that every effort would have been made to ensure the Act was as strong as it needed to be.  I do not wish to criticise my predecessor because the Act is a good one.  However, I will examine its operation when it has been in place a little longer to make sure it is having the effect it was meant to have.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell's suggestion is that the Minister should ask the Attorney General to confer with the Director of Public Prosecutions about the problems in this area.  Is the Minister not aware that under the Prosecution of Offenders Act, 1974, the <Col N="1524" /> Attorney General is perfectly entitled to confer with the Director of Public Prosecutions on matters such as this if the Minister requests him to do so?  If the Minister is serious about correcting deficiencies in the implementation of this legislation, why does she not ask the Attorney General to confer with the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement that the Garda Síochána are now working more closely with the Revenue Commissioners, has anybody been prosecuted for tax evasion in the past 12 months or is anybody serving a prison sentence for tax evasion?</P>

      <P>With regard to the second question, perhaps the Deputy would table a separate question because I have no information at present about this very specific question.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, Deputy McDowell asked me to intervene.  It was only when I said I could not that he said I should ask the Attorney General to intervene.  I am well aware of the powers of the Attorney General under the 1974 Act. As a result of the Deputy's inquiry I will certainly discuss the matter with the Attorney General.  The relevant sections of this legislation have not been in place a full year yet.  The Deputy, who practises law, will know that it often takes time for new legislation to be implemented in the way envisaged when the legislation was passed and results are not always immediate.  I will certainly ask the Attorney General if he will not confer with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  He has that power, but I do not.  Deputy McDowell asked me to intervene and I thought I should tell him that I do not have the power to inquire or to intervene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines referred to <Col N="1526" /> by the Deputy are set out in a report &mdash; Child Sexual Abuse: Framework for a Church Response &mdash; which was prepared by the Irish Catholic Bishops' Advisory Committee on Child Sexual Abuse by Priests and Religious.  The report was launched on 30 January 1996.  The Garda authorities were not represented on the advisory committee.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the report, representatives of the Garda Siochána domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit and representatives of a number of statutory and voluntary agencies attended listening days held by the advisory committee during January and February 1995.  No formal discussions have taken place between the Church authorities and the Garda since the guidelines were published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that, notwithstanding the publication of these guidelines relating to cases of suspected sexual abuse of children by members of the clergy, nothing has been done on either side to discuss how they might be implemented or to open up lines of communication between the Garda Síochána and the Church authorities to permit information to be passed to the Garda, and that nothing practical has been done in the context of these two bodies to implement the guidelines in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the advisory committee was established by the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference.  The terms of reference of the advisory committee were to consider and advise on an appropriate response by the Catholic Church in Ireland where there is an accusation, suspicion or knowledge of a priest or a religious having sexually abused a child, to identify guidelines for Church policy in this area and suggest a set of procedures to be followed in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities were not represented on the advisory committee. There was no direct consultation between the advisory committee and <Col N="1527" /> the Garda Síochána, and while one might think that such consultation would not have been out of place, a private organisation was clearly free not to consult if that was its wish.  Garda representatives together with a number of statutory and voluntary agencies contributed to the listening days held by the advisory committee during January and February 1995, but clearly this kind of participation in the work of the committee cannot be classified as consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that there seems to be a reluctance to discuss how these new guidelines would be implemented in so far as they relate to informing the Garda of such abuse, will the Minister of State take the initiative and ask the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to contact the relevant Church authorities with a view to establishing channels of communication so that these guidelines can take on some real life as opposed to a paper existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Church authorities, like any other private organisation, can decide what they wish to do with their own report.  I am quite sure that if the Church authorities wish to talk to the Garda Síochána about this matter or the Garda wish to talk to the Church authorities, that can happen.  I see no reason why I have to facilitate it.  I have given a great opportunity to everyone who is concerned with these matters to contribute to the discussion paper which I published last month on which I invited submissions by the end of April.  That presents an opportunity for all who are concerned about allegations of abuse to make their contribution, and I hope that all organisations and all individuals will take up the opportunity that is being offered to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must misunderstand me.  I am not talking about further discussion papers, etc.  I am talking about the implementation of these guidelines which involve having <Col N="1528" /> channels of communication opened between the Church and the Garda Síochána so that the Church can pass on relevant information to the Garda who can do something about these cases. Will the Minister not take the initiative and ask the Garda Commissioner to contact the relevant Church authorities so that they can establish between them lines of communication which will in future prevent and bring to light cases of sexual abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the Deputy was not listening to me, because I have pointed out, and it is self-evident, that we are talking here about a private organisation which produced its own set of guidelines.  If they wish to talk to the Garda or if the Garda wish to talk to them they can do it.  I do not think that my good offices are required in that respect.</P>

      <P>Is it desirable that there is no uniformity in the law governing those who come into contact with children, that one law applies to people in the State sector and another to those from the non-State sector and that each voluntary organisation, including the Church, has its own set of guidelines?

      <P>This is the statistic with which I wish the Minister to deal. The increase in the 1996 Estimate for the Department of Justice is 2 per cent or below the rate of inflation.  How many prison spaces does the Minister intend to create with that minuscule increase and does she accept that the additional allocation of £3.7 million subsequent to that will not build new prisons?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to create 278 additional prison places up to mid-1997. Already, 33 additional places have come into play in St. Patrick's Institution since my announcement at the end of January and a further 38 places lost through a fire in the health care unit are due for completion at the end of April.  In addition 25 places will be available in the first phase of Castlerea prison and will be completed by late summer this year.  Works to adapt the military detention barracks at the Curragh to accommodate civilian prisoners are due to commence the week after Easter.  A contract has been placed for certain construction works at Portlaoise Prison, which is part of my programme to produce an additional 105 places.</P>
      <P>The design of a replacement wing for the derelict and closed down D wing in Limerick is advancing rapidly and will accommodate 55 offenders.  Furthermore, the Government has agreed that I can proceed with the provision of a female prison and the remainder of the Castlerea prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the Minister's answer earlier that over 4,000 temporary release orders were made last year and the answer now given that there are 2,209 prison places which are fully occupied, is it not the case that by dividing one into the other one finds that the average sentence being served in Irish jails is less than <Col N="1532" /> four months and that it is largely the result of inadequate prison accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly I do not know where the Deputy is getting the figures.  I gave out figures for early and temporary releases but one cannot just divide one into the other to work out the number of prison places needed because the reasons for early or temporary release are varied in many cases.  I have admitted many times &mdash; and it was the case before I took office &mdash; that one of the considerations for early release is the lack of spaces in our prison system. I cannot match the Deputy's mental arithmetic divisions because I do not believe it has been done properly.  If the Deputy tables a very specific question about this matter I will endeavour to answer it.</P>
      <P>The programme I have instituted for the additional places will assist greatly in lessening the number of people who serve less than their full sentence.</P>

      <P>My question is based on the Minister's reply on prison places and places of detention.  Does she see any merit in recognising the places that she did not mention even though she probably understands my concern &mdash; and I know it is also hers &mdash; in the area the Minister and I represent where Oberstown and Trinity House are located? Does the Minister recognise the aspect of detention which these places represent and could they not be included, albeit with the proviso they are under the Department of Education administration, so that we are left in no doubt of the Minister's concern for these places as well as the other places of detention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

Any further resources I need to advance my plans in 1997 will be included in my Estimates for 1997.  I have enough money to advance on my proposals.  I have £400,000 for the women's prison and £100,000 for the first phase of Castlerea prison.  I will not be able to spend any more money than that this year.  The Deputy can be absolutely satisfied that I will get the remainder of the money for the building programme.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced in the House on 21 February 1996 in reply to a parliamentary question that my Department was preparing a discussion paper on crime.  The Deputy will appreciate that my Department is involved in a continuour review of strategies to combat crime and of measures to deal with the modern crime problem and I am in constant contact with my officials on these issues. I decided late last year that the Department should prepare for publication a paper which would deal with the crime problem in all its multidimensional aspects to encourage an informed debate on this very serious issue.  I communicated that decision to my officials at that time.  I cannot put a precise date on the decision beyond saving that it was late last year.  Preparation of the paper is now in hand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked my Department to publish a paper on crime.  I have not called it white, green, yellow, pink or any other colour.  I want a discussion paper on crime that will cover all aspects of crime rather than suggestions that it must be dealt with in a multifaceted way, an interesting debating point. No Government has practically considered dealing with crime in a multifaceted way.  I want this crime paper to be put into the public arena to enable it be discussed by people in all walks of life, <Col N="1535" /> including commercial groups, rural communities, women's groups, youth groups and all those who have an input in tackling the sources of crime and criminal activity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Department of Education and other relevant Departments will be asked to make an input into this crime paper and report on it.  The issues he raises in his questions about those places of detention for which I do not have responsibility were very much part of the consideration in the preparation of the juvenile justice legislation which involves the three relevant Departments and is with the Attorney General at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that she got sound advice yesterday from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors that instead of producing one large document which will attempt to cover the ramifications of crime and deal with it, to use the appalling phrase, in a multifaceted way, it would be more to the point if each area were considered in depth by people conversant with it?  Does she not consider a criminal justice commission headed in the manner suggested by the president of the AGSI yesterday, which she summarily dismissed, is what is needed?  Will she reconsider her curt dismissal of that proposal in view of the fact that I, as one who has worked in the criminal justice system for many years, consider it an intellectual and administrative slum which is a disgrace in many respects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy, who has far more experience of working in the <Col N="1536" /> criminal justice system as a practitioner than I, felt that way about it, one wonders why, when his party was in Government and his former leader was Minister for Justice, he did not do more about this system he describes as an intellectual slum.  If it is such, it did not happen in the past 12 months nor did it happen as a result of legislation.  Many others, including barristers and solicitors, implement the criminal justice system and they all have a role to play.  If I were a county registrar or a District Court judge, I would find it insulting to be told by a practising barrister that I was operating and overseeing a system that is an intellectual slum.  There is no doubt that the practices in place in the criminal justice system are becoming burdensome and slowing down the process. That is why I set up a working group under Mrs. Justice Susan Denham to examine the possibility of a courts commission to change the way we manage the courts and other aspects of the criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of what may be described as a two planked commission was proposed at the AGSI conference, which I was glad to attend and from which I returned for this wonderful Question Time session.  It consists of a commission on criminal justice laws and includes an examination of Garda pay and conditions.  I do not consider that type of commission is suitable.  I indicated I am preparing a paper on crime and I intend to set up a crime policy council which will bring together all the groups concerned.  I do not agree Deputy McDowell's point that it is a good idea to focus on crime and criminal justice because through the years Deputies have stated that infants are not born criminals and a child of two is not a criminal, but on reaching the ages of ten, 11 and 12 many of them get involved in criminal activity.  We must target children to ensure that they do not become tenants in our prisons.  The Deputy's colleague.  Deputy Quill, raised the targeting of those likely to become involved in crime at a much <Col N="1537" /> earlier age.  It is time we considered this problem in a broader way.</P>

Our system of criminal justice is an intellectual and administrative slum of which we, collectively, should be ashamed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a misinterpretation. Will the Minister agree that most people want deeply thought out but competent reports composed by people who know what they are talking about instead of waffly, holistic, candyfloss, philosophical treatises on the problem of crime?  They want improvements now.  Will the Minister agree that one can be tough on the causes of crime and on criminal law reform and that one part of the agenda should not be postponed as an alternative to addressing another part of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has now insulted many others who have taken part in holistic-type committees and study groups.  At present a group is examining sexual crimes, how they relate to women and how the courts treat women who have been the subject of such crime.  They are not a candyfloss group of people nor will the report they will produce be candyfloss or rubbish. <Col N="1538" /> The Deputy has managed in one fell swoop to more or less condemn anybody who has taken part in the preparation of a report.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme for criminal law reform is not being put on hold to enable this discussion paper give rise to a debate on crime.  I do not know why other Ministers did not prepare a comprehensive paper on crime as it has existed since the foundation of the State and before it.  I am preparing such a paper and it will be put into the public arena as quickly as possible to allow a debate on crime in this House or by way of one of the committees if that is what is decided.  I assure the Deputy that I have not been reluctant to discuss these issues.  More hours of debate have been devoted to crime than other matters. Some good ideas have emerged and others are what the Deputy would describe as waffly and philosophical. These are useful interventions and I would not like to condemn any Member by describing any suggestion they make as &ldquo;waffly&rdquo;, &ldquo;candyfloss&rdquo; or any of the other pejorative terms used.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The deployment of the force to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  There is no community policing scheme in operation in the Balbriggan district.  I understand however that the local divisional officer is examining the possibility of assigning a garda to community policing duties in the Balbriggan area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the need for gardaí to escort young offenders from detention centres in the Balbriggan district, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí from Lusk and other stations within the Balbriggan district, are called upon to escort juvenile detainees from the detention centres at Oberstown House and Trinity House, Lusk to courts, as required.  They have informed me that it is not feasible to separate escort responsibility for Oberstown House and Trinity House, Lusk from normal policing duties within the district.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that gardaí are reassigned from other duties to provide escorts.  While this is in the public interest it is a matter I have asked my Department to examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem has to be addressed and merits more than an examination.  Will the Minister facilitate a positive result?  Will she be prepared, once the examination is complete and it is discovered that every single hour of Garda time is committed to escorting <Col N="1540" /> prisoners, be it to Cork or Tipperary, or the hard work of tracking down drug traffickers, burglars and so on, to appoint a community garda?  I fear the examination will not allow this to happen. Does she accept that there must be a way of requiring gardaí from other divisions and districts, apart from the one that both she and I represent, to share the responsibility for escorting prisoners to places as far away as Cork and Tipperary?  This is a national and not just a local problem which needs to be addressed at national level and she is the person who can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that the deployment of gardaí is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Responsibility for providing escorts has always been assigned to the Garda Síochána. As I understand it, gardaí in the district in which the place of detention is located &mdash; in this instance, Oberstown House and Trinity House in the Fingal area &mdash; are responsible for providing escorts.</P>
      <P>The point the Deputy made is valid, the offenders serving time in Oberstown House and Trinity House come from all over the country.  I, too, hope the time will come when gardaí from Kerry, Cork, Dublin south east, Kildare, Longford or Westmeath will be made available to escort young people to court or wherever they need to be escorted.  As things stand, it falls on gardaí in the district in which the place of detention is located to perform this duty in the same way as responsibility for the protection of former Taoisigh falls on gardaí in the district in which the person concerned lives.  No extra gardaí are assigned to that district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to the local divisional officer about the matter and understand that gardaí from the other villages in north County Dublin now share this responsibility.  This provides some relief for the people of Lusk who were worried that the garda assigned to the area during the day would be reassigned to escort duties.  I cannot give any grounds for great optimism as it will still be <Col N="1541" /> necessary for gardaí to escort prisoners to court.  We do not have a separate police force to perform this task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is a waste of Garda time to escort a 12 or 14 year-old child to and from a district court from Lusk or anywhere else?  Does she consider that the suggestion she made &mdash; if I may use the indelicate term &mdash; on the hoof that it would be great if gardaí from Kerry could be asked to perform this task is rather foolish since it would involve four journeys, the journey to Lusk to collect the child to bring him to the District Court in Tralee, the journey back to Lusk in the evening and the journey home to Kerry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was responding to Deputy Sargent's suggestion that the responsibility for escort duties should be shared because the youths in Oberstown House and Trinity House do not come from Fingal only, but from all over the country.  As Deputy Sargent will be aware, extra gardaí were assigned to the Balbriggan district recently.  I hope a few more will be assigned in time to come as the area continues to expand. That should lead to an improvement in the position.</P>
      <P>Under the law a young person has to be escorted to court by the gardaí.  This is not necessarily a waste of their time as very often these young people try to escape.  Some have succeeded in doing so.  They, therefore, need to be protected in being brought to and from court.  This is a matter at which we can look again when dealing with the juvenile justice Bill.  These two centres which deal with children under 16 years of age will fall into the remit of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer the first part of my question which was related to community policing. Will she give further consideration to sanctioning a realistic increase, not one or two &mdash; no more than anybody else, I do not want to see scarce Garda <Col N="1542" /> resources wasted &mdash; in Garda strength in the areas where gardaí are required to perform escort duties?  It is a national problem and should be addressed as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to say I will deploy an extra ten gardaí in my constituency. However, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to deploy gardaí as he thinks fit.  I cannot dictate to the Commissioner and tell him to deploy an extra eight or ten gardaí in the Balbriggan district.  I can ask him to take into consideration that gardaí are taken off other duties to carry out this function when making such decisions so that if a place of detention is located in a particular area it does not suffer a reduction in Garda strength.  I have spoken to the Commissioner about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Deputy had been at the function last night, which I <Col N="1543" /> addressed, he would know I responded to that inaccurate information given by the president of AGSI.  He did not compare like with like.  In the middle 1980s the number of young gardaí training in Templemore was included in the overall Garda number.  That is no longer the case.  The 355 gardaí in Templemore are not included.  The difference in numbers is far less than the 700 mentioned by the president and I discussed the matter with him after the dinner.</P>

      <P>I raised the matter of the inland waterways authority some <Col N="1712" /> months ago and the Taoiseach stated it was a decision which arose from the transfer of the heritage department from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I understood from correspondence with the Taoiseach that a steering group was set up and the matter was reported to Government last month.  Is legislation still envisaged in this area and, if so, when will it be brought before the House?</P>

      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach about the Telecom Bill and put it to him that a serious political and financial mistake was about to be made.  Perhaps he has had time to reflect on the matter and, if so, will he intervene to prevent a very serious political and financial error, that is the sale of one-third of Telecom Éireann at a knock-down price, £200 million below the value of that company?  Will the Taoiseach review the matter urgently? This is potentially a very serious political and financial scandal.  In view of the information I have repeatedly given the Taoiseach, which is very serious and needs attention, is he proceeding with that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation in question is concerned with making provision for a strategic alliance and also updating all regulatory provisions in the sector to reflect the new regulatory environment in the European Union, which has introduced a considerable <Col N="1717" /> degree of competition over and above that which previously obtained.  It will also provide for regulation of the sector generally.  I expect the comprehensive legislation which deals with a range of matters will be ready for presentation to the House at the end of this year.

    <Title>Turin European Council: Statements.</Title>
    <Col N="1718" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the special European Council in Turin on Friday last.  I was accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the special European Council was to formally launch the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  The Council also offered an opportunity for the Heads of State and Government to have a brief exchange of views on employment and on Europe's economic and social direction into the next century.  Finally, as Deputies will be aware, the Council took place against the background of the European beef crisis and this issue was also addressed by the Council.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Intergovernmental Conference I stress at the outset that the Turin European Council was not a negotiating session for the conference and was not, therefore, a forum for setting out national positions.  The function of the European Council was to agree an outline agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.  The first session of the Intergovernmental Conference conducted by Foreign Minister commenced after the European Council concluded.</P>
      <P>The Conclusions of the European Council, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House, set out an outline agenda for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  I would stress that this does not in any sense limit the scope of the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference because the Treaty on European Union allows any member state or the Commission to raise any item they wish at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless the Turin conclusions undoubtedly encompass what will be the key issues at the Intergovernmental Conference.  The conclusions follow very closely the model set out in the report of the Reflection Group and indicate that the issues to be tackled fall <Col N="1719" /> under three general headings, namely, bringing the Union closer to its citizens; reforming the Union's institutions in the context of achieving a more democratic and efficient Union and against the background of enlargement, and strengthening the Union's capacity for action on external issues.</P>
    <P>In regard to bringing the Union closer to its citizens, the negotiations at the conference will have to result in an outcome which tackles the real concerns of the citizens of Europe.  There can be no repeat of the Maastricht experience when many sections of the Union's population were alienated by an outcome which seemed to them obscure and unconnected with the real problems which they face in their everyday life. The people's verdict on the outcome of this Intergovernmental Conference will be governed by one simple criterion; will the Intergovernmental Conference enhance the prosperity and security of the citizens of Europe?</P>
    <P>A good start has been made through the reference in the Turin conclusions to the need for the Intergovernmental Conference to examine how the Union can deal with everyday concerns such as unemployment and crime, including drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>No one is suggesting that the problem of European unemployment will be solved by writing provisions on employment into the Treaty on European Union.  As the Turin conclusions state, better employment opportunities require a stability oriented economic policy, greater competitiveness and sound economic growth.  The policies to achieve this are and will remain primarily the responsibility of national governments. What is required at Union level in the area of employment is better co-operation and co-ordination to ensure the maximum positive employment impact of the appropriate domestic policies. It will be a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference to examine how this can best be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> In the area of crime and drug trafficking, the need for ever closer co-operation between member states is patently obvious.  Internationally organised crime transcends national boundaries. The havoc that is being wreaked on society by drugs must be tackled on a co-ordinated basis.  The pace of progress on this and other issues under the Justice and Home Affairs Pillar of the Treaty has not been satisfactory.  A critical task of the Intergovernmental Conference will be to see what Treaty changes are required to give a better focus, direction and efficiency to the work of the Union in the Justice and Home Affairs area.</P>
    <P>The second general heading for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference will be to make the institutions of the Union more democratic and efficient against the background of future enlargement.  The White Paper makes clear that the Government welcomes the prospect of EU enlargement. We fully subscribe to the conclusions of the December 1995 Madrid European Council that enlargement is a political necessity which will offer both the applicant states and the current members of the Union new prospects for economic growth and general well-being.  In my bilateral contacts with the leaders of the applicant states, most recently with Prime Minister Klaus of the Czech Republic.  I emphasised Ireland's support for enlargement and I will do so again when I visit Poland later this month.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy indicated that Ireland will be determined to protect our interests when the next enlargement negotiations commence after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference.  In this we will be no different from other member states or indeed from the applicant states seeking to protect their interests in the negotiations. The people of this country realise fully the benefits that flow from our EU membership, and expect the Government to be vigilant in protecting them.  This wholly justified stance <Col N="1721" /> should not, however, be construed as designed to obstruct enlargement.</P>
    <P>There was no debate at the Turin European Council on the specific institutional issues which will have to be tackled by the Intergovernmental Conference. The Irish position on these issues is set out in the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  I would like to emphasise two points in particular.  First, Ireland does not believe that the current balance in the decision-making process between the large and small member states needs to be tilted in favour of the former.  The Irish approach is to view the European Union as a co-operative venture involving the pooling of sovereignty between all member states. Excessive concentration on the distinction between large and small member states militates against the fostering of the required Community spirit.  When it comes to individual issues there is generally no large versus small state divide. I wish, in this context, to also underline the Government's determination that we will continue to retain the right to nominate a member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The second specific institutional point I would like to address relates to what has been termed the introduction of a flexibility clause into the Treaty. Deputies will note that this is referred to in the conclusions which asks the Intergovernmental Conference &ldquo;to examine whether and how to introduce rules either of a general nature or in specific areas to enable a certain number of member states to develop a strengthened co-operation, open to all, compatible with Union's objectives, while preserving the <i>acquis communautaire,</i> avoiding discrimination and distortions of competition and respecting the single institutional framework&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The conditions in the conclusions attached to any development of a general flexibility clause are welcome. Ireland's position on this issue is governed by our commitment to a European Union founded on shared values and interests and adopting and implementing common policies to the greatest possible degree.  We believe <Col N="1722" /> that with political will this approach can accommodate distinctive national positions and can survive future enlargement. An unrestricted <i>á la carte</i> Europe is one which contains the seeds of its own destruction.  The common policies and institutional framework of the European Union are the glue which holds the Union together.  If these are eroded then the erosion of the Union might well follow.  This is not to deny that provision for member states to approach the same objectives at different speeds, as in the case of European Monetary Union, should be considered where necessary on a case by case basis. The starting point for the Intergovernmental Conference should, however, be what we can achieve together rather than how we can achieve things separately.</P>
    <P>The third and final general heading of the Intergovernmental Conference agenda is the capacity for external action by the Union.  The Tánaiste will deal with this area in more detail in his statement.  I would, however, remind the House that the provision for a review of the Union's common foreign and security policy was written into the Maastricht Treaty by the heads of Government at that time.  That Treaty also set the objective of implementing a common foreign and security policy, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence.  Those are the words of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland cannot, therefore, stand back from the debate on these issues at the Intergovernmental Conference. Account must also be taken of the changed security situation in Europe. Policies that were appropriate for the Cold War era may no longer be appropriate. The six underlying principles of the Government's approach in the security area are set out in paragraph 4.114 of the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  These principles include a requirement that a common defence policy should have as its primary objective the preservation of peace and the strengthening of international security <Col N="1723" /> in accordance with the UN charter and OSCE principles, and be relevant to the broader role of the United Nations which has a unique legitimacy in the area of international peace and security. These principles, in conjunction with the Government's commitment to put the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy to the people in a referendum, provide the necessary safeguards for any concerns that might arise in this area.</P>
    <P>After concluding its deliberations on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda the Council had an exchange of views on the economic and social situation in Europe.  The basis for this discussion was the presentation made by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, on his initiative for a European Confidence pact for employment and the proposals submitted to the Council by President Chirac on a European social model.</P>
    <P>The discussion did not go into any of the details of the proposals of Presidents Santer and Chirac.  There will be a comprehensive overview of employment and related issues at the Florence European Council in June next and the Dublin European Council in December.  It was clear from the discussion in Turin that all the heads of state and government are concerned about the economic and social future of Europe in a global economy characterised by fast changing and mobile technology and widely different social systems.  The importance of ensuring Europe's competitiveness without undermining its human values and system of social protection was stressed.</P>
    <P>The discussion pointed to the need to formulate a long-term vision of the economic and social direction of Europe.  The view was expressed by some heads of state and government that this issue could best be addressed through an informal meeting of the European Council, not distracted by the decision making on day to day issues <Col N="1724" /> that arises at a normal European Council, something like the meeting held in Formentoe during the Spanish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Such an informal meeting, properly prepared and structured, could be a valuable exercise in helping to map out a desired vision for Europe's future.  I would certainly be happy to convene such a meeting during the Irish Presidency if that was the wish of the European Council.  It is my intention to consult further on the issue with my colleagues in the European Council and with the President of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware,the Turin Council was overshadowed by the crisis in the European beef industry.  There was recognition at the Council that while the beef crisis may have resulted from events in one member state it was a crisis for the European Union.  The scale of the problem was underlined by the evidence adduced as to the collapse in the consumption of beef across Europe and the ban on imports of European beef into key markets.  As President Santer noted, over one million farmers in Europe are dependent on beef production and this statistic alone is a measure of the scale of the crisis.</P>
    <P>The solidarity displayed on the issue by the European Council was truly impressive and reassuring.  The consensus was that as a European problem it demanded attention at European level and all member states were willing to contribute to the solution.  The European Council sent a strong signal to this effect to the special Agriculture Council which convened yesterday and is still discussing the issue today in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that positive and decisive action will be taken by the Agriculture Council to restore European consumers' confidence in beef, to stabilise the beef market, to support producers and the industry and to provide assurances to our trading partners. More specifically, the Minister for Agriculture. Food and Forestry has pressed <Col N="1725" /> very strongly for supports for the market in the form of an immediate resumption of beef intervention at an appropriate level while the present situation lasts, including the waiving of the 340kg intervention weight limit.  I was informed by the Minister shortly before I came into the House that the Council has now agreed to restore beef intervention up to a limit of 50,000 tonnes over the next month with an increase in the weight limit to 380kg.</P>
    <P>The task now is to restore consumer confidence in beef and to restore access to key third country markets.  The decisions to be taken in Luxembourg today will enable the Government to build on the initiatives it has already put in place to reassure consumers and third countries.  In regard to the latter, I was particularly pleased that arising from my telephone call last week to President Mubarak of Egypt Irish cattle were allowed disembark in Alexandria at the weekend.  I assure the House that the Government will continue to do all in its power to convince third countries to lift the ban on the import of Irish beef. No political or diplomatic effort will be spared in this regard.</P>
    <P>The European beef crisis represents both a challenge and an opportunity for the European Union.  The challenge is to preserve a highly important European industry and the livelihood of millions of people who depend on it.  The opportunity is to show the citizens of Europe that the Union is relevant to their every day concerns and that it can deliver result on these concerns.  If, as I am confident will be the case, the Union achieves its objectives on this issue the long-term benefit for European solidarity and integration can be considerable.</P>
    <P>Given the brevity of this European Council there was no time for formal bilateral meetings with other heads of state and government.  This was a comparatively short European Council which nonetheless achieved its objectives of launching the Intergovernmental Conference, underlining the commitment to action on employment <Col N="1726" /> and, most importantly, tackling the beef crisis.  It is clear that a formidable agenda will face the Irish Presidency from 1 July next.  Planning on the policy and administrative aspects of the Presidency is well under way.  I can assure the House that this Government is determined our Presidency of the Union will be efficient, effective and successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Summit at Turin was intended to be a festive opening of the Intergovernmental Conference but, as the Taoiseach said, in reality it was dominated by the BSE crisis.  The summit should have concerntrated on the problem of streamlining the Union so that it could cope with enlargement and become more effective and coherent.  At this summit, instead of the usual situation of Europe being Britain's problem, Britain was Europe's problem.</P>
      <P>The negligent handling of BSE over a number of years by the British authorities, compounded by the crass handling of the belated public acknowledgement that there was a potential human health problem, has created a huge crisis of confidence not just for the British beef industry but potentially for the whole European beef industry, unless prompt counter measures are taken.  It is a problem that requires action and solidarity both at national and European level.</P>
      <P>As I said here last week, consumer safety and confidence are the paramount considerations.  While I believe we have a safe product here, there are further measures that can and should be taken to reinforce consumer confidence. It is important that we take these measures not only for their own sake but also so that we can report to our European partners and to our third country customers that there is no atmosphere of complacency here and that the maximum is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some measures are being taken but more needs to be done.  I am glad the Minister announced that all the meat from any herds containing a BSE animal <Col N="1727" /> will be destroyed.  I am also glad that on a voluntary basis the pig and poultry producers have decided to exclude bonemeal and related products from their rations as a precautionary measure.  This was a concern I raised here last week, which had been bothering many people.  The producers' decision should be underpinned by law or statutory order.  An Bord Bia needs to have consumer representation and not just be representative of the producer. The Minister needs to take action on this.  In this House and outside it, we as leaders of opinion in this country should show we have confidence in Irish beef, not by engaging in frivolous photo opportunities that have diminished credibility, because of their misuse across the water, but by sober statement and example.  Then we need vigorous marketing.</P>
    <P>Some 200 years ago, in 1796 at the time of the Bantry Bay expedition in which Wolfe Tone was involved, the question of provisions for the French invasion force arose.  The French Minister of War told General Hoche: &ldquo;There is plenty of beef in Ireland; if you cannot get bread, you must eat beef&rdquo;.  Could that scene not be the basis of a marketing campaign in French, appealing to French patriotic traditions?  I am told the Taoiseach has turned down the suggestion of a commemorative stamp for the Bantry Bay expedition, which is a great pity given the importance of the European dimension.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would confirm if that is correct. He should not let his distaste for the past get the better of him, if that is the case, because a commemorative stamp seems like a good idea.</P>
    <P>There are other things we need to do to protect our good name.  There must be strict enforcement of veterinary regulations.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry must acquire a reputation as a body with teeth, which will ensure that wrongdoers will be vigorously prosecuted.  We cannot afford any laxity.  Heavy fines and imprisonment must be the punishment for using <Col N="1728" /> angel dust or other illegal hormones or for involvement in smuggling or fraud. We may well need to enact stiffer penalties. There should be regular reports on the success of enforcement.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the ability to prevent cattle smuggling from Northern Ireland is of most concern to our European partners and third countries.  Security needs to be visible around the clock and extra resources may need to be drafted in.  I do have a concern for the position of Northern Ireland farmers and I sympathise with their position.  As I outlined in the House last week, I am prepared to accept their contention that their beef is not British.  They and their authorities will have to decide whether they wish to adopt our higher standards and harmonise their regulations with ours and seal off the North Channel from cattle imports from across the water.  Given the significantly higher incidence of BSE in the North, they might have to take additional measures as well before they can enjoy the full health status of Irish beef.  This is the one issue where they may have to choose and not expect to be able to get the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>It is a step forward that Irish beef brands labelled as such are now appearing on British supermarket shelves. Despite getting some consignments landed in Egypt, intensive work is required if we are to keep Middle Eastern markets open.  Both national and European diplomatic efforts are required.  I am glad an EU delegation is going to Cairo.  I support calls that the Tánaiste should travel to Iran, as this is a matter that will be decided at the highest political levels.  We have only just agreed to the opening of an Israeli embassy in Dublin.  It would be ironic if this were to be marked by a ban on Irish beef in Israel.</P>
    <P>The present crisis has brought home to Britain how they need European solidarity in a situation like this.  Such solidarity is in all our interests.  We would certainly agree to generous financial aid being given to whatever is the most effective means of quickly eradicating BSE among the British herd.  It is <Col N="1729" /> unrealistic, however, to expect an early and precipitate reopening of the British market before confidence is re-established. The reopening of the British market should only take place when it can be done without prejudice to the marketability of other European beef and consumer confidence in it.</P>
    <P>The European Union should also be sponsoring, as a matter of urgency, medical and veterinary research on the links between the human CJD disease and BSE.  We need to know how much meat needs to be consumed to catch the disease.  We need more certainty about the incubation period.  We need to know quickly whether there is any serious danger of a galloping epidemic, as some British scientists claim.  Methods of detecting the disease in cattle at an early stage need to be developed.  We need research into the possibilities of inoculation or cure.  What action is taking place on this front, both nationally and in Europe?  There seems to be a void in this area.  Our own people are trying to come to grips with that research.</P>
    <P>I am glad that temporary intervention is being reopened for a limited period, as announced today from Luxembourg. It would not be desirable for the beef industry to go back to a systematic heavy reliance on intervention and every effort must be made to avoid that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the launch of the Intergovernmental Conference, I broadly support the terms of the Presidency Conclusions, which set the agenda for the most part in very general terms.  My reading of the conclusions is that they are carefully balanced in areas where there are major differences of opinion.  The Union faces many challenges: international, economic, employment, crime, migration, the environment.  Enlargement also presents a major challenge to the institutional operation of the Union.</P>
    <P>The conclusions are correct to put citizens first.  Crime and drugs are high on the agenda.  The action being taken by the Union is not very visible.  It needs to undertake a more vigorous campaign to stop at source drugs traffic from some <Col N="1730" /> of the producer countries with which the European Union has Association agreements.</P>
    <P>I am glad that, thanks to a French initiative, the fight against unemployment is described as the Union's priority task.  More is needed than sound policies and respect for the Maastricht criteria. There is a sentence which states: &ldquo;The Intergovernmental Conference could also address the question of the compatibility between competition and the principle of universal access to essential services in the citizens' interests&rdquo;.  This is a concern of the French, who are proud of their state companies and are worried about the effects of the type of artificial competition that we see in Britain being introduced, for example, to break up the French electricity company.  The concerns of the ESB would be similar to those of the French.</P>
    <P>The conclusions say the Intergovernmental Conference should examine the question of the island regions of the Union.  As Ireland is clearly one such region, I would like to know what imaginative proposals the Government intends to put forward in that regard. The White Paper has very little to say on that subject, as pointed out in the debate on that issue a week ago.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of the principle of subsidiarity is important.  We must not overload our small businesses with unnecessary regulation from Europe and huge administrative burdens.  Improving standards is one thing, unnecessary bureaucracy is another.  I notice that, again under the influence of President Chirac, the value of a social Europe is evoked. This strikes a middle path between an overregulated social democracy on the one hand and the more capitalistic free market Anglo-American model on the other and stresses the importance of social consensus.</P>
    <P>On defence and security, the conclusions leave open Fianna Fáil's preferred option, which is that the European Union would take over from the Western European Union direct responsibility for certain peacekeeping <Col N="1731" /> and humanitarian tasks as the foundation of a common defence policy.  If the conference is going to look at arms industry co-operation, it should equally look at much stiffer control of European arms exports, so that they are not used for genocide, as has happened in Iraq and Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The reaction to last week's debate on the White Paper was, in many respects, ill informed because our peacekeeping and humanitarian operations are worldwide. The Western European Union and NATO are strictly limited to the European theatre.  Whether we join a closer relationship with them has absolutely no implications for our peacekeeping or humanitarian missions in the Middle East, Africa, Asia or Latin America.  Some people argue our neutrality is outdated and ask if we do not realise the Cold War is over.  Is it not the reality that many of the NATO and the Western European Union defence doctrines are clearly obsolete?  Why is that not more clearly acknowledged in public debate instead of urging us to get closer to them?  If it is acceptable for countries to hold on to nuclear weapons of mass destruction for which there is no obvious justification, is it acceptable for Ireland to hold on to its military neutrality? I would like Ireland to take a stand on Article J4 of the Maastricht Treaty which acknowledges the specific character of member states' defence policies and argues that the European Union take a direct role on the Petersberg tasks, with which we will gladly co-operate.</P>
    <P>The Government should openly and vigorously defend Ireland's ideals at the Intergovernmental Conference and not leave the running to the larger partners. Our valid viewpoints should be argued with vigour.  We look forward to the success of the Intergovernmental Conference, unfortunately it was overshadowed by other events last weekend. During our Presidency we look forward to co-operating with the Government on matters of interest to this country. We hope it will keep us informed on <Col N="1732" /> matters because at present we depend on parties in the North for public briefing documents on issues relating to Northern Ireland.  I hope Fianna Fáil Front Bench spokespersons, in particular, are briefed on what is happening so that we can make fair criticism if necessary.</P>
    <P>I wish the Intergovernmental Conference and the Presidency success and assure the Government of our co-operation on matters of importance to Irish citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The formal launch of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin last weekend was overshadowed by the BSE-CJD controversy.  It is appropriate that Europe would show solidarity with Britain in its time of crisis.  I support the aid package that is being negotiated in Luxembourg to aid British farmers who have to slaughter their cattle.  I hope this act of solidarity convinces the sceptics, particularly those on the Tory backbenches, that rather than diminishing its sovereignty, integration in Europe is in Britain's national interest.  Community solidarity is as appropriate now as it was in 1993 when the German aid programme for the eradication of swine fever was also supported by the Community.  This is the way it should be.</P>
      <P>We have benefited enormously from Europe.  Ireland is one of the largest aid recipients in the world, receiving in net terms approximately £1,800 per family, or £700 per person, per annum.  We receive one of the largest packages of development aid per capita in the world. In political terms Europe has been much more acceptable in Ireland than in Britain, but I hope it is now accepted that, together, we have an enormous amount to gain from Europe.  As the Community expands eastwards and the balance of power moves from Brussels to Berlin, I hope people realise it is in our interest to show Community solidarity and not to engage in triumphalism when a country is faced with a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> While only 15 per cent of our gross beef output is consumed on the domestic market, if it is not successful on that market we cannot expect to sell it on international markets.  It is regrettable that it took us a week to consider the interests of the consumer when the link between BSE and the human equivalent, CJD, came to light.  This country, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, is so producer driven that it does not realise the link between consumer and producer interests.  If consumers are not satisfied or are in doubt and leave out, to quote the well hackneyed phrase, producers and those who work in that sector will suffer.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for the separation of consumer and producer interests.  A separate agency should be established to deal with the safety, health and quality aspects of our food industry.  I am not advocating more Government, I am merely talking about establishing a separate agency with the sole purpose of examining quality, safety and health related issues.  That would be in the interest of consumers, producers and, in particular, exporters.</P>
    <P>In its current information campaign An Bord Bia should avail of the services of high profile individuals associated with this country to help sell the high quality and clean image of Irish beef. That would have much more credibility than An Bord Bia simply stating that Irish beef is of top quality.  I hope it notes my suggestion.  I am sure many of our sports stars would be delighted to be associated with such a campaign and they should be asked to do so.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will be one of the defining moments for the European Union.  Ireland will have the privilege of holding the Presidency later this year and, while I do not agree with everything in the White Paper, I am pleased to compliment the Tánaiste for at least spelling out a vision of Irish foreign policy which is long overdue.  In the context of European enlargement, no country, particularly a small one, will be able to take an appropriate stand at <Col N="1734" /> that defining time unless it has a vision of where it is seeking to go.</P>
    <P>While security and an Irish Commissioner are important matters for us, there are many other matters which are equally important from an economic point of view.  The enlargement of the Community eastwards &mdash; within a decade the Community could have 27 members &mdash; will have a much greater impact on our economy than our accession in 1973.  The Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia are much poorer than Ireland.  The per capita annual income of the Czech Republic, the richest of those countries, is US$8,000 compared to $17,000 in Ireland.  The per capita income of the others is approximately one third of that in Ireland.  In net terms we receive almost £2 billion per annum in aid and even with that huge injection of resources from the European Union, we had to borrow £1 billion last year to run our economy.  We must realise that we will not be able to avail of those resources in an enlarged Community. Given its problems with unification, the German economy, which funds the European Union to the tune of 80 per cent, will not be in a position to continue to provide such funding.  For example, it will cost approximately £10 billion per annum to extend the Common Agricultural Policy eastwards. Therefore, Irish farmers and our food industry will have to accept a reformed CAP and to cope we will have to be much more market driven.  As the massive reduction in subsidies in the next few years will have a dramatic impact on jobs in our economy we must prepare the way now.</P>
    <P>The Government owes it to the public to spell out in clear terms the implications of enlargement for Ireland. While we all assume enlargement is good, it will have significant economic consequences for our economy.  The last round of enlargement, which involved Sweden, Finland and Austria, did not present problems because of the resource base of those economies.  We cannot assume that because, up to now, <Col N="1735" /> enlargement has not had an adverse effect, this will continue.</P>
    <P>In 1995, 40 per cent of gross agricultural output, involving direct payments to farmers, was made by way of direct aid from Brussels.  We receive £1.4 billion per year in terms of agricultural supports, as approximately 50 per cent of cattle disposals by way of carcases and live trade go to third markets, it would be difficult to imagine the country trying to live without these supports. The cost of the current controversy in terms of jobs would be nothing in comparison to what the diminution of CAP would cost Irish agriculture and farming. Rather than feed the old habit of reliance on subsidies and handouts from Brussels, we must educate the farming community to move towards a market approach with less dependency on subsidies and grant aid.</P>
    <P>The question of nuclear power is another issue of concern to the public. The frequent calls in this House for the closure of Sellafield will not achieve very much, greatly as it may be desired. We need to move in a different direction in the context of the EU Presidency later this year.  We must ensure there is a review of the EURATOM Treaty to provide an independent monitoring service and a European-wide independent inspectorate which can be called on when adjoining countries have concerns. At present under the treaty, for example, the UK must invite authorities to inspect and monitor matters.  This is unsatisfactory; it is not reassuring for the public.</P>
    <P>This is a sophisticated, complicated industry and this country does not have the resources to deal with the kind of problems that arise by way of public concern.  I hope the Government puts this issue on the agenda.  It is an unanswerable case and one that can win us support and friends, even from those nuclear powers that may be reluctant to pursue matters at present or listen to the usual calls to close down the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> Over the next few months there will be much talk about some member states taking the fast track.  It is especially in the interest of a small island nation to ensure that everybody moves together and that there is not a two tier Community. The citizens of Europe, whether they live in Ireland or on the mainland, have the same set of concerns and live in a Community that approaches the issues on the same basis.</P>
    <P>The question of unemployment has not been seriously addressed by the EU. This has been its greatest failure.  The EU has an unemployment problem equivalent to the combined populations of four of its member states.  It is not in the interest of the Irish economy for Germany to export its problem by ensuring that everybody else has the same regulations.</P>
    <P>In a world where capital, labour and trade are all free and mobile, jobs will only be created if we are conscious of labour costs.  While I do not advocate slave labour, we must, when considering unemployment, look at costs in this economy, especially those of taxation.  It is 50 per cent more expensive to create a job in the Republic than in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is due to expire in the summer for the public sector and at the end of the year for the private sector.  The successor to this programme must be tax based.  It must realise the connection between high taxes and unemployment. We should seek to create a single island economy in Ireland to ensure tax harmonisation between North and South so that existing disincentives are eliminated. If we do not do this we cannot expect employers in Dundalk to expand their employment when it is 50 per cent cheaper for them to move across the Border, 12 miles up the road in Newry.</P>
    <P>National policies must be compatible with our European responsibilities. Ireland should not be to the foreground in looking for more regulation, which is not in our economic interests.  More regulations are not in the interests of people who have been marginalised and <Col N="1737" /> isolated and who live in many of our cities &mdash; Dublin, Cork and Limerick &mdash; where in some places over 50 per cent of the population is unemployed.</P>
    <P>The challenge for Europe as we move into the next millennium, review the Maastricht Treaty and approach this defining moment is to ensure that it is a place where all its citizens enjoy equality of opportunity and the opportunity to participate in the economic, social and community development of their own country.  Isolating people to a life of unemployment does not give them this opportunity.  We spend over £1 billion per year paying people unemployment benefits.  This is an indictment of our internal policies.  It is also a poor indictment of a Union that offered and gives us so much.  Our challenge is to play our part in ensuring that Europe can, as a trading bloc, be as competitive as America, Japan and some of the Pacific rim countries which are more successful in job creation than Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach reported on the Turin European Council of last Friday at which we both represented Ireland.  I also attended, on the same day, the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The opening was a formal occasion and did not involve negotiations.  It marked the first stage in an intensive process which will involve negotiating sessions once a month at ministerial level.  Ministerial negotiating sessions will be prepared at official level by a working group scheduled to meet weekly in Brussels.  My personal representative on that group is the former Secretary of my Department, Mr. Noel Dorr.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening session provided an occasion to outline the requirements of member states for the Intergovernmental Conference.  In outlining the Irish position for the conference, I suggested the following requirement for its success.  In the first instance, the Intergovernmental Conference must address all the key points but no more than those.  It will fail either if it lacks <Col N="1738" /> the resolve to address the main challenges on the agenda or if it dissipates its energies on issues which are better dealt with in a different context on which there is no prospect of agreement. The conclusions of the European Council, which of course do not limit the scope for member states to bring forward ideas, will help to guide the work of the conference.</P>
    <P>The second requirement is that the participants in the conference must all be prepared to listen to one another. We must not allow the Intergovernmental Conference to develop into a dialogue for the deaf.  That would be a recipe for its failure.  There are many issues to be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference which will have to be resolved with respect for the concerns of all member states.  The Union's ethos of listening and trying to accommodate the concerns of all will be essential if the Intergovernmental Conference is to be a success.</P>
    <P>The third requirement is that we must ensure further enlargement of the Union is accompanied by a deepening in the process of integration.  Facilitating enlargement at the expense of integration would be in the interests of no one, least of all applicant countries which do not wish to join a Union which has lost its sense of purpose and coherence of action.  Having been sustained through the difficult process of economic and political reform, it would be a cruel irony if their reward was membership of a Union virtually devoid of the very characteristics which persuaded the applicant countries to seek membership in the first place.</P>
    <P>Fourth, we must ensure that this is an Intergovernmental Conference which brings the public with it.  It must be transparent and comprehensive as an Intergovernmental Conference.  I am thinking especially of an approach which gives priority regarding unemployment and international crime, particularly drugs.</P>
    <P>Where the Intergovernmental Conference addresses institutional issues it <Col N="1739" /> must demonstrate that any improvement in the functioning of the institutions is not an end in itself but a way towards a more effective and accessible Union.  If the Intergovernmental Conference can take effective steps in areas of direct concern to the public, it will be a success.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency will devote all the energy, abilities and commitment at our disposal to ensure that these requirements are met.  It will be a major priority for the Presidency and we will seek to advance its work as expeditiously and constructively as possible. It is timely and appropriate that the European Union should examine ways and means of strengthening its capacity for external action at this Intergovernmental Conference.  The European Union has not only become a pole of attraction for countries in the European area but, increasingly, it is expected by its citizens and by the wider international community to act as an instrument of positive change in the world. The conclusions of the European Council amount to a balanced and realistic mandate for the forthcoming negotiations. They avoid prescribing specific outcomes which are for negotiation at the Intergovernmental Conference and, equally, avoid unrealistic expectations.</P>
    <P>Ireland will play a constructive role in the review.  The Common Foreign and Security Policy occupies a central place in the conduct of the foreign relations of all member states, including Ireland. The Government believes that member states can exercise a more effective influence for the development of a stable, just and peaceful international system by acting in concert than they could accomplish individually.  An effective CFSP is in Ireland's interest and at the Intergovernmental Conference the Government will work for practicable and sustainable ways to improve its functioning.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will consider proposals for modification of the present CFSP decision-making <Col N="1740" /> process with a view to facilitating effective EU foreign policy action, particularly in an enlarged Union.  The tasks facing the Union are growing considerably as its engagement in international issues intensifies.  Ways in which the international profile of the Union can be enhanced are likely to be considered, including the possibility of a single High Representative for the CFSP.</P>
    <P>Decisions on sensitive foreign policy matters have to be underpinned by broad support in the member states if they are to be sustainable and effective. This aspect must be taken into account in considering any proposals to adjust CFSP decision-making procedures. More use could be made of the provision in the Maastricht Treaty for qualified majority voting on decisions which implement the foreign policies decided by consensus in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The basis for efficient decision-making is good preparation and a shared analysis of the issue.  We consider that priority needs to be given to strengthening the mechanism available to the Union in these areas.  There is no parallel in the CFSP to the role played by the Commission in policy development and impulsion in Community matters under the First Pillar.  To meet this need the Government has advocated the development of a planning and analysis capacity in the Council Secretariat of the European Union and we are pleased that this idea has attracted broad support.  A central planning and analysis capability, which would be at the service of the Presidency and the Council, would facilitate the identification of the common Union interest in international issues and the formulation of EU responses to these challenges.  It would also provide greater support for the rotating Presidency and contribute to greater continuity between Presidencies.</P>
    <P>Article J.4.2 of the Maastricht Treaty provides for the EU to &ldquo;request the Western European Union, which is an integral part of the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement <Col N="1741" /> decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications&rdquo;.  The Maastricht Treaty also provides that this Intergovernmental Conference review the relationship established between the EU and Western European Union with a view to furthering that Treaty's objectives, which are fully shared by Ireland, and in view of the approach of 1998, which marks the end of the 50 year span set out in the Western European Union Treaty.</P>
    <P>A central question to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be to determine how the CFSP provisions, including the EUWEU relationship, can best be developed to enhance the EU's contribution to European and global peace and security.  There is an emerging consensus that the EU should be better able to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management tasks in such areas as peace-keeping and humanitarian operations, the Petersberg Tasks. It is possible that these peace-keeping and humanitarian tasks could provide a focus for the further development of the EU-WEU relationship, as the Turin conclusions state, in comformity with the UN Charter.  As the White Paper has made clear, this is an area where I see potential for Ireland, in view of our accumulated expertise in peace-keeping and humanitarian work, to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>The Turin conclusions also suggest an examination as to whether and to what extent closer co-operation in the area of armaments should be promoted by the Treaty.  This is a complex issue which has arisen many times over the years in a number of different contexts.  The tentative nature of the conclusions on this point indicates that the issue has lost none of its complexity.  Ireland's primary concern will be to ensure that any developments in this area include a strengthening of the arms control policies that exist at the level of the European Union.</P>
    <P>At the Madrid meeting of the Western European Union on 14 November 1995, which I attended as an observer, <Col N="1742" /> I commented on the acceptance by the Western European Union members in their contribution for the Intergovernmental Conference that a comprehensive definition of security is required rather than an exclusively military one. The Western European Union members explicitly acknowledged that the Intergovernmental Conference will need to harness to the best effect the diverse contributions to security and defence that European nations are able to make and the national security and defence positions of each country must be respected.  There is an understanding that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference must be acceptable to people in each member state.  The Government's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations and the Western European Union will continue to be in harmony with our outlook and traditions and at the same time responsive to the new and still evolving challenges that face us in promoting peace, security and progress at the European and global level.</P>
    <P>We are, naturally, preoccupied with the Intergovernmental Conference and the upcoming Irish Presidency. However, the Union's agenda over the next few years is very extensive and demanding.  This was set out at the Madrid European Council and it is worth recalling at this stage as we start on the first step of the process, the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations.</P>
    <P>After we complete the Intergovernmental Conference we will have to prepare the enlargement negotiations.  This will probably involve intensive negotiations among the Fifteen, from the second half of 1997.  The Commission is engaged in an intensive analysis of the conditions required for successful enlargement.  I assure the House that Ireland wants successful enlargement and that we are very well aware of the eagerness for a successful enlargement on the part of the applicant countries. In ensuring the adequacy of the Union's preparations we are not placing obstacles in the way of the process or lacking <Col N="1743" /> an appreciation of the needs of the applicant countries.  All previous enlargements were based on careful analysis of what was in the Union's interest, as well as that of the applicants, and all of them have been to Ireland's overall benefit.  With the right approach to the negotiations, I am sure that the result of the next round of enlargement will be equally positive.</P>
    <P>Enlargement inevitably brings in the question of cost and links in with the review of the Edinburgh Agreement setting the budget allocations through to 1999.  Related important issues are the situation of the Structural Funds after 1999 and the continued funding and scope of the CAP.  A key part of the larger agenda is, of course, the achievement of Economic and Monetary Union on schedule from 1 January 1999.  All of these matters are of vital significance to Ireland.  The Government will monitor very carefully the Council's and Commission's preparatory work.  While devoting all necessary energy to the Presidency, we are taking care to keep an eye on the larger agenda.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, which we discussed last week and which will be the subject of further debate after Easter on the floor of the House, in the Seanad and in committees, gives a clear outline of the Government's approach on all these issues.  Not since our enlargement negotiations began more than a quarter of a century ago has an Irish Government gone on to a round of negotiations with its position so clearly set out in advance.</P>
    <P>I will consider carefully all constructive criticism of the Government's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference and the related agenda issues I have already outlined.  I will be very slow to accept the allegation that we needlessly delayed setting out our position.  We have, for the first time in a generation and over a much wider spectrum, set out a basic approach to our European and foreign policy at the outset of a negotiation.  If it takes slightly more than 12 months from the time the <Col N="1744" /> public consultation process was completed to prepare and produce a document touching on vital issues with huge implications for domestic policy then that is a reasonable timeframe.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Act, 1994 (Section 44) Regulations, 1996: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Criminal Justice Act, 1994 (Section 44) Regulations, 1996</P>
      <P>a copy of which was laid in draft before the Dáil on the 13th day of March, 1996.</P>
      <P>On taking office I examined the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 and expedited as far as possible the implementation of sections 32 and 57 which relate to activities which might take place in banking and financial institutions and the reporting of suspicious lodgments of large amounts of money.  I discovered on taking office that those institutions had been given a period of time in which to prepare and train staff to implement those sections of the Act. The clock was already running when I took up office &mdash; they had been given until April to put those regulations into force and to complete training.  They sought an extension of at least two months.  I gave them an extra couple of weeks to finish their work.  I then implemented those sections which I felt were immediately urgent to have the necessary regulations in place in our financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce this motion to seek approval for regulations to be made under section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  The purpose of the regulations is to enable the State to seize drug trafficking money being imported into or exported from the State in the form of cash.  They prescribe the amount of money above which suspected drug trafficking cash may be <Col N="1745" /> seized under section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act, and will allow that section, and the whole of Part VI of the Act, to be fully implemented.</P>
    <P>Section 38 empowers the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officers to seize cash relating to drug trafficking which is being imported into or exported from the State provided that the sum is not less than a certain amount to be prescribed under section 44. I propose under these regulations to prescribe that amount as £5,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that large amounts of cash are generated by drug trafficking and that supplies of illegal drugs are frequently purchased in cash. As a result, consignments of cash derived from or intended for use in drug trafficking are regularly moved across international borders.  With the removal of exchange controls it is essential that our authorities have the wherewithal to seize such consignments as and when they are detected.  Section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act will, with the introduction of these regulations, give them that power.  With the making of the regulations, a member of the Garda Síochána or a Customs and Excise officer will now be able to seize and detain cash being imported into or exported from the State where it amounts to £5,000 or more and where the Garda or Customs and Excise officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the cash is derived from, or is intended to be used in, drug trafficking. Any cash so seized can initially be detained for a period of 48 hours.  An order for the continued detention of the cash may be made by the District Court for a period of up to three months and further such orders may be made for a total period of two years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the seized cash may be forfeited if, on application to it, the Circuit Court is satisfied the cash represents drug trafficking proceeds or was intended for use in drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue asked at Question Time why this was not introduced before now.  My immediate priority when taking over this office was to <Col N="1746" /> make sure that the sections dealing with our financial institutions where people might launder or try to hide money were implemented as quickly as possible.  I then proceeded to look in a broad way at all the areas dealing with drugs and drug trafficking.  I was anxious to make sure the best methods of co-operation existed between the Customs and Excise and the Garda Síochána when implementing this section because money of this nature can be seized by both the Garda and the Customs.  This is the background against which it was important to get some of those structures into place so that when this section was being implemented I could be satisfied it would work and prevent the movement of such quantities of cash resulting from drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>I have chosen to prescribe the minimum amount of cash that may be seized and detained as £5,000.  This is a tough measure, but Deputies can be assured that its effects will be felt by drug traffickers, not by anyone legitimately taking cash into or out of the country.  The limit of £5,000 and the terms of section 38 of the Act will ensure that this measure is properly targeted.  My aim is to ensure that effective action can be taken by the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise in seizing cash consignments of the size associated with drug trafficking.  In electing for the amount of £5,000, I am proposing stronger measures than those in effect in, for example, the UK, where the amount is fixed at £10,000.  This demonstrates the Government's determination to deal with the scourge of drug abuse and in particular to punish those who indulge in the deadly trade of drug trafficking by endeavouring to deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.</P>
    <P>Drug trafficking is one of the most destructive evils in society.  Lured by the prospect of huge financial gains, drug dealers are willing to go to any lengths to ensure their activities continue unhindered. This vile trade results in the destruction of many, mainly young, lives, and causes much misery to the family and friends of those caught up in <Col N="1747" /> the deadly grip of drugs.  To prove successful in the war against drugs we need to target every aspect of the illegal drug trade, one of the most obvious of which is the cash on which it functions.  These regulations will enable the full force of the law to be brought to bear on drug profits.  By seizing not only drugs, but also the cash which buys drugs, we can increase the pressure on drug traffickers and set about reducing the supply of drugs onto the market.  We have the successful efforts of the Garda and other agencies in taking drugs out of circulation. We have seen tensions building up among criminals and I have no doubt it is because they are being denied the profits they would make had they got their hands on much of the drugs that have been captured by the Garda Síochána and others.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the regulations is part of a series of legislative measures I will bring forward in the context of a comprehensive package aimed at dealing with drug abuse and the criminal activities which it spawns.  Deputies will be particularly aware of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill before the Dáil at present.  That is one of the most important criminal justice measures to come before this House. The measures in the Bill will increase Garda powers of detention in relation to suspected drug traffickers, with a maximum period of detention of seven days, and will allow members of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent to issue search warrants in suspected drug trafficking cases where a warrant is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I will also, in the very near future, bring forward further measures that will bring into force the few remaining parts of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 which do not yet have effect.  Most of the Act is in force and is a vital weapon in the fight against illegal drugs, particularly as regards the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking.  Notwithstanding that a confiscation order has not been signed, a power which did not exist two years ago now exists.  A great deal of <Col N="1748" /> work has been done in preparing the ground for the implementation of the remainder of the Act.  I will briefly outline my plans in this regard for the information of the House.  I intend to bring into operation in the very near future Part V of the Act which provides that anything that would constitute a drug trafficking offence if done on land in the State will also be an offence if done on an Irish ship.  In addition, the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise officers and members of the Naval Service will be empowered to stop, board, search and detain a ship suspected of being used in drug trafficking, even, in some circumstances, if the ship is outside Irish territorial waters.  This will form an important element in our co-operation with the international community in combating drug trafficking at sea, a problem which of its very nature demands a united and co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>I will also greatly strengthen Ireland's role in international co-operation against crime by bringing into operation Part VII of the Criminal Justice Act. This will enable Ireland to sign and ratify the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, a long overdue development in our criminal law which will enable us to play a full part in the co-operation with other countries which is so necessary.  In addition, I will bring regulations before this House, under Part VII, which will provide for the enforcement, by means of orders under Irish law, of orders made by foreign courts for the confiscation and forfeiture of property acquired by or as a result of drug trafficking offences or other serious crimes. These measures will greatly strengthen the hands of the law enforcement agencies, in this country and abroad, in dealing with the drugs menace.  The drugs problem, and the impact it has on other crime, is an issue I regard with the utmost seriousness.  If tough measures have to be taken to deal with it, I will not shrink from that, whether it is increased powers of detention under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill <Col N="1749" /> or seizure of cash under these proposed regulations.  My concerns are shared by Deputies on all sides of the House and they will join with me in sending out a clear and unmistakable signal to anyone involved in drug trafficking that we mean business.  I ask the House, therefore, to endorse the making of these regulations by approving the motion before it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue raised a matter in a parliamentary question that did not refer to this section of the Act and I told him that I would refer to it.  A number of the clauses of the 1994 Act were enabling provisions and it was left to me to do the detailed complex work of bringing in the regulations.  The Act did not cover the detailed work of bringing in the regulations.  I was glad to be able to introduce this new regulation and add further to the powers of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I pay tribute to the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who was responsible for drafting and putting through this House the Criminal Justice Bill, 1994, one of the most enlightened pieces of criminal legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out, various provisions in the 1994 Act were to be introduced by regulation.  The money laundering provisions of the 1994 Act were introduced by the Minister for Justice 100 days after the Brinks Allied raid, when the greatest money laundering operation in the history of the State was under way.  That represented the greatest act of political procrastination since Nero watched Rome burn.  Since then the Minister for Justice has shown herself to be adept at procrastination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 38 and all of Part VI of the 1994 Act are now being implemented but it was the duty of the Minister for Justice on assuming office to introduce those regulations.  The Minister does not seem to appreciate that she has been Minister for Justice since December 1994.  In those circumstances one would <Col N="1750" /> have thought the Minister would have given up her constant references to what her predecessor should have done.  The Minister knows that the former Minister for Justice who drafted the 1994 legislation did not have the opportunity to implement the necessary regulations, but she has.  The greatest example of political procrastination since Nero watched Rome burn has been surpassed. It took 16 months to bring the regulations to implement the provisions of this Part of the Act before the House. There is no excuse for excessive delays of that kind; to say the least it is mind boggling.  At a time when we were witnessing regular substantial drug hauls and bank robberies the Minister for Justice ignored calls not just from the Fianna Fáil Party but the Garda authorities to implement the necessary legislation pursuant to Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  That could be done quite simply.  The Minister for Justice had only to specify the sum the authorities could seize or confiscate pursuant to section 38 of the Act.  It took the Minister for Justice, and the rainbow coalition Government, 16 months to decide the magic figure should be £5,000.  No amount of excuses in the midst of what we have seen in the past 16 months can justify that kind of delay and dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>Another example can be found when one looks at the situation in the security industry.  At the time of the Brink's Allied raid I said it was of fundamental importance that the Minister for Justice and the Government introduce regulations for the security industry for fear there would be a repeat.  Almost one year to the day later there was a replica raid in Waterford where a security firm was involved.  It was abundantly clear that the most basic regulation was breached, which, of course, was that the Garda or Army escort or both would travel with the carrier of the money until such time as it was safely put away. It was abundantly clear there should have been regulations to provide for that but there were no regulations. Once again the Minister for Justice <Col N="1751" /> promised that the matter would be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the question of reviews, committees, sub-committees, interdepartmental committees and commissions. There is no substitute in the final analysis for action and, unfortunately, we have not seen that action.  It is extraordinary to say the least that we have seen the same kinds of delay in relation to the implementation of Part VI of this Act as we saw with the introduction of the money laundering provisions and as we are still seeing in bringing in regulations to regulate the security industry.  This begs the question as to why all the procrastination.  I cannot understand it.  It is difficult for any rational person to understand why it should have taken so long to implement the regulations.  When the Minister was presented with an Act by her predecessor all she had to do was to present the draft regulations to the House.  Why did it take so long to introduce these measures?  Measures brought before the House by the Minister for Justice on each occasion appeared to have had the gestation period of the elephant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should use a new line.  I am fed up hearing that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is inexcusable. The essential drug trafficking provisions of the Fianna Fáil Misuse of Drugs Bill were ignored by the Minister when she introduced her drug trafficking Bill.  It is severaly deficient for several reasons, not least the decision that an application for detention in court would not be <i>ex parte</i>.  An application to the court for the continued detention of a suspected drug trafficker should be <i>ex parte</i>.  The fact that it is not means the prosecuting authorities must go to court in an adversarial way and release the information they hold in regard to the suspect.  That can only damage their case.  The argument was made more than once in this House that this would not be constitutional, but suspects detained, for example, under the Criminal Justice <Col N="1752" /> Act, 1984, do not have to be given the information on which the Garda based its suspicions.  Likewise, suspects detained under the 1984 Act, whose period of detention is being extended by a superintendent, do not have to be given the information on which he reached his decision, nor must they be given an opportunity to make submissions as to why they should be released.  A similar provision pertains to persons detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
      <P>I humbly submit that in circumstances where it is obvious in legal precedent on the Statute Book that this power of detention can be <i>ex parte</i> or that the application to court can be made <i>ex parte</i> the application should be <i>ex parte</i> in regard to suspected drug traffickers.  Everybody knows that people who engage in drug trafficking deserve the full rigours of the law to root them out and to build evidence for a trial.  Releasing information prior to a trial is not in the interests of a successful prosecution.</P>
      <P>In outlining the object failures of the Minister in this and other areas, I am trying to be as constructive as possible. Our criminal laws need to be tightened. Drug pushing and the drug culture are getting a grip on this country.  In those circumstances existing failures and lacunae that need to be filled must be spelt out in stark language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this measure.  I do so in the absence of Deputy O'Donnell, our Justice spokesperson who is not available today.  It is time that the Minister tendered a complete and unreserved apology and withdrew the remarks she and Deputy Hogan uttered in this House to the effect that Deputy O'Donnell had in some way abused the confidence of a Garda briefing.  I was in possession of all the information Deputy O'Donnell had before she tendered any questions on the matter in this House.  Her contribution to this House was not based on a Garda briefing, but on information available to her <Col N="1753" /> from another source at all material times.  I ask the Minister to be woman enough to take this opportunity of a discussion on this subject to withdraw unreservedly the imputation against Deputy O'Donnell fostered by the Minister and Deputy Hogan to the effect that Deputy O'Donnell abused the confidence of a Garda briefing and spoke in this House on that basis to the detriment of a Garda operation.  That, most emphatically, is not the case and is a charge that should be withdrawn. Doubtless the opportunity will be taken to withdraw it some day.  It is sad that a Deputy should be maligned in this way by a Minister.  It is equally sad that the Minister will not come before the House and admit that the information on which Deputy O'Donnell acted in this House was available to her from another source well in advance of a Garda briefing offered to her by the State and that in no sense did she compromise herself or the Garda Síochána by using or abusing information thrust upon her by the Minister by way of that briefing offered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of interjecting to that effect, the Minister would be better advised to withdraw the imputation she made against Deputy O'Donnell. It was false and repeated in newspapers, which will have to account in a different forum to Deputy O'Donnell for the falsehoods they published about her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding this measure, the problem with the 1994 Act is that the confiscatory powers are all predicated on the establishment of criminal liability on the part of the person in respect of whose property the confiscation regime is to be operated.  That is offensive to reason. Recently we were told, but this may be untrue as was the case with the vast majority of what we were told about the Urlingford seizure, that people were detained in Dublin carrying money in anticipation of some deal relating to drugs.  It is extraordinary that under this <Col N="1754" /> Act those moneys could not be proven to be the proceeds of drug trafficking because, to prove them to be such, one must establish an offence of drug trafficking to predicated any seizure order or confiscation order.  Such moneys could not be seized under the general seizure provision in respect of other offences because a principal offence giving rise to the existence of these moneys cannot be proven.  It is time to change the law dealing with moneys found on people suspected of drug offences and to allow for confiscation without prosecution and conviction for a criminal offence. There is not a constitutional objection to such a measure being put in place.</P>
    <P>If I were caught passing through Dublin with £250,000 in my possession and a reasonable inference could be drawn from the circumstances in which I were caught that such money was for the purposes of committing an indictable crime, in particular a drug trafficking offence, it should be open to the State to apply to the courts to confiscate that money, even if they cannot establish a principal offence other than possession of the money.  We need a new offence, that of being in possession of moneys in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable interference that such moneys were for the purposes of an indictable offence.  A law along those lines would be a far more potent weapon than the law set out in the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>The problem with that Act as it applies to drug trafficking offences or offences generally is that it is predicated on a court order convicting somebody of an offence from which the moneys are supposed to have derived.  That is unacceptable.  We need a law which, on the civil balance of probability, would make moneys found in the possession of persons in circumstances which give rise to the reasonable inference that they were in their possession either as the proceeds of a criminal offence or for the purpose of committing another criminal offence liable to confiscation on a civil standard of proof.  No infringement of the Constitution would arise in such circumstances. The particularly narrow <Col N="1755" /> ambit of the 1994 Act is unduly restrictive and conservative.  I thought so at the time of its passage but did not have an opportunity to express those opinions in the House.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile emphasising that it would be perfectly in order to reverse the onus of proof in certain cases, as is done here in relation to some matters where a statement is served on the person from whom the money is seized, to require that a person should give an account of how they came into possession of certain moneys, even without their conviction for a criminal offence. In that context I suggest something akin to the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, which allowed opinion evidence of a senior garda in respect of moneys found in someone's possession to the effect that they represented the proceeds of crime or, alternatively, were in the person's possession for the purpose of committing an indicatable offence as a <i>prima facie</i> measure of proof which would give rise to an obligation on the part of an accused person to provide another lawful explanation as to how they came to be in possession of the moneys.</P>
    <P>The public will not stand for a situation where people can be found transporting large sums of money without an explanation being given.  Because the right to silence, so carefully maintained by the Government, is available and no explanation is ever tendered or required, such people can travel at liberty throughout the State carrying large sums of money when everybody knows that the sums of money in question must be either earmarked for some unlawful purpose or, alternatively, the proceeds of some unlawful activity unspecified. We should act, as a society, to stop that situation from persisting.</P>
    <P>This is not an academic discourse on my part.  If any of the highly speculative and inaccurate material generated from one particular source about the Urlingford drugs episode is true, it would tend to suggest that a sum of £230,000 was found in the possession of certain <Col N="1756" /> people in circumstances which give rise to the inference that they had it in their possession for the purpose of doing some drugs deal, but that sum does not appear to be confiscatable under this Act in present circumstances.  We have to reach the stage of making our law real as this country faces a drugs crisis.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Justice Estimates last year when I sat beside Deputy O'Donnell I said that Mountjoy was awash with drugs, I was told by the Minister in rather schoolmarmish tones not to use exaggerated language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the cavalry came to my rescue in the form of Deputy Eric Byrne who used exactly the same phrase without any rebuke, schoolmarmish or not, from the Minister. Last weekend's papers provided the ultimate proof there is one drugs seizure a day in Mountjoy.  On whom do I rely for that information?  The answer is the governor of that institution.  In the meantime I have been privileged to be informed that the Minister is establishing a drugs free special unit in Mountjoy for those prisoners who want to take refuge from the drugs epidemic in that institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has not yet got real on the drugs issue.  It is enough to have a <Col N="1757" /> law which permits the confiscation of certain sums of money, but only if a criminal offence in respect of those moneys is shown to have been committed. That is not a sufficient weapon in the war against the drug barons.  In these circumstances it is not enough to put in place the measures in this Act. We need something more.  The time has come &mdash; and is well past &mdash; to put in place real and substantial measures which would represent a challenge to those confronting the State with the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister's proposed drug trafficking legislation.  I have said it before in her absence and repeat that she should have dovetailed it with reasonable measures to curtail the right to silence because the godfathers behind this trade will be well able to avail of the right to silence and even withstand five to seven days in detention in order to save their skins.  In the future a jury dealing with a drug trafficking offence should be in a position to draw an inference from an accused person's failure to give an explanation until the date of their trial or to give any explanation at all.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had taken a more benign and less conservative view of the legislation tendered by Deputy O'Donnell, her own drug trafficking Bill would have been far more effective in adopting a twin-track approach as this would have brought about a change in the law relating to drug offences and drug barons and, at the same time, a general change in the law relating to the right to silence, the chief weapon of defence of the real masterminds behind the drug scourge.</P>

      <P>I thank the two Deputies who contributed to the debate.  As I always have to anticipate in respect of any debate on justice issues, I did not get a resounding vote of thanks for what I am doing as that would go against the grain.  I would probably be so shocked if either of the two Deputies dared to congratulate me or even murmur a word of appreciation <Col N="1758" /> that I would not be able to say a word. I am glad to be in a position to bring these regulations forward.  Neither of the two Deputies spoke against their introduction.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue paid tribute to my predecessor for introducing the 1994 Act.  I indicated that it was in place when I took office.  Many of it sections contained enabling provisions only. Legislation will only have an impact when all of its sections are given effect by way of regulations.  That was the job which faced me when I took office. Although the Act had been passed in mid-1994 many of its sections had not been implemented.</P>
      <P>I am used to criticism and will continue to be subjected to it until I move on to another Department, if the Taoiseach sees fit, after we have been returned to office following the next election.  The reality is that when I took office I immediately sought to implement some sections of the Act but I was bound by an agreement entered into with the financial institutions by my predecesor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, which allowed them a period of time within which to train their staff before the sections could be implemented.  It would have been impractical and highhanded of me not to honour that commitment. I am bringing in the regulations now because the various structures are in place to ensure their implementation.</P>
      <P>I cannot remember if the Progressive Democrats Party voted against the Bill in 1994.  I am sure its members did not do so as it would not want to publicly vote against legislation dealing with a serious criminal law issue.  However, Deputy McDowell seems to be implying that the Act is obsolete.  He said it should be amended to allow for confiscation without a criminal prosecution.  I am implementing the regulations under the Act as it stands.  The issue of whether the Act needs to be amended or strengthened is for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act the standard of proof will be applicable to civil proceedings. That was inserted in the Act to ensure <Col N="1759" /> there would be less stringent necessities of proof and that confiscation orders could be put in place.</P>

      <P>I realise that but we cannot arrest people simply because they carry money.  Perhaps criminals use people who are not known to the Garda to carry money for them.  However, some business people hold sizeable amounts of cash on their property. Some people use cash all the time, which is unwise in this day and age. Others do not like using credit cards and cheque books.  I do not want to stop legitimate business people carrying quantities of cash.  This regulation deals with the import and export of money at ports of entry and not with stopping people on O'Connell Street and arresting them if they are carrying large sums of money.  It is part of the Act passed by the House in 1994, all sections of which will be gradually implemented.</P>
      <P>I will review the Act to ensure its powers are sufficiently strong.  I set the figure at £5,000.  It is £10,000 in the UK. Obviously the authorities there feel that is the amount of money people carry around.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned the security industry.  There is an ongoing review of that industry.  Last Saturday week I was handed yet another submission on how regulations should be implemented.  A number of jurisdictions have found it difficult to reach a conclusion on how to regulate the industry. I was approached by members of the industry some years ago to see if regulations were contemplated.  There is a working group in the Department of Justice to which members of the industry make submissions.  I hope to make decisions on its study before the end of my term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important and necessary regulation.  I hope to bring other parts of the Act into operation soon to ensure that the most stringent regulations are <Col N="1760" /> in place and that the ill-gotten gains of those involved in drug trafficking are confiscated and cannot be used to further this evil trade.</P>

    <Title>Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is widely recognised that the Pensions Act, 1990 was a milestone which safeguarded and protected workers' occupational pensions.  It was important legislation and ensured that pension promises made to employees would be honoured.  It has worked well and has been acclaimed and used by others outside this country in framing their pensions legislation to ensure that funds are neither abused nor misappropriated.</P>
      <P>If the UK had similiar pension safeguards in place the Maxwell disaster would have been less likely to occur.  We can see how important it is in current circumstances to ensure that the pension promises made to workers in the semi-State sector are honoured.  In the case of Telecom Éireann, there is a major requirement on the Government to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet employees' pensions in the fullness of time.  It highlights the fact that unless moneys are available to meet pensions the promises made to workers will not be honoured.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which amends the 1990 Act, follows a detailed review of the operation of the Act carried out by the Pensions Board.  I congratulate it on its work in the first five years of its operation. Great support was given by the industry and the professions involved in meeting the provisions of the Act.  Many of the amendments are of a technical nature.  Their purpose is to clarify, extend and strengthen the original provisions and remove anomalies identified in the intervening years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 36 is particularly welcome in that <Col N="1761" /> it clarifies the position in the event of the chairman of the board having to be replaced.  It also provides for two extra board members to represent the newly appointed trustees of schemes, one representing trade union members and one nominated by employer organisations.  It is interesting that the Government is clarifying the position at this stage and ensuring in the event of the replacement of the chairman of the board the proper procedures are in place.  Various Departments are ensuring legislation is up to date in that regard, and it is possible this provision has nothing to do with events involving the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins.  As I understand it, the purpose is to clarify the arrangements for replacing a chairman of the Pensions Board.  I presume the measure is to correct an anomaly and does not relate to the current chairman or to incidents that occurred in recent times.</P>
    <P>The two extra board members are to be nominated by ICTU and IBEC with a view to representing the interests of trustees and they must be trustees of an occupational pension scheme.  It is particularly important that trustees be represented.  Trustees have been appointed and registered.  The representative role of the two trustees nominated to the board is crucial.  I would like the Minister to clarify that their function and duty is to employer members and worker members of schemes and that their role will be truly representative in practice.</P>
    <P>Trustees are the principal custodians of members' interests in funds and assets and their formal representation on the board is especially welcome.  I am nevertheless surprised the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to provide for a place on the board for a pensioner. He could have done so by appointing a pensioner who is also a trustee.  A pensioner trustee would have a wealth of knowledge, life-long experience in the workplace, would have contributed to a <Col N="1762" /> pension fund and have the added experience of being a beneficiary of the fund.  A pensioner would have a very strong interest in the security of the scheme and would provide a balance in the membership of the board.  I will request my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, to put down an amendment to include a pensioner trustee in the membership of the board.</P>
    <P>The impetus for this legislation came from people who found their pensions were not there for them when they retired but had been used, perhaps accidentally, on other projects which did not yield returns.  In some cases the funds had been wiped out altogether.  They were literally left in tears.  Now that the scheme is up and running and we are including two trustees on the board it is time to include a pensioner in its membership. I suggest the Minister consider that matter for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another important change being made in section 34 is the provision for reporting by auditors, actuaries, trustees and others of any reasonable suspicion that funds have been misappropriated or that a fraud has been perpetrated. Special protection and privilege is provided to safeguard those who make such a report in good faith.  In this regard the Minister said: &ldquo;In introducing this provision I am going further than was recommended to me by the Pensions Board&rdquo;.  He outlined why he felt he should go further and said the board felt his objective would best be achieved by encouragement rather than by compulsion. The board recommended a voluntary system, but the Minister considers that the best way to proceed is by compulsion. Time will tell whether the concerns of the board were relevant.  I fully understand the Minister's concern to go a step further in safeguarding this area, but whether he is going beyond what is necessary we will not know.</P>
    <P>This is a very much a specialist Bill which is very welcome, but it does not tackle the important issues and challenges facing workers and the pension industry.  It tidies up a number of issues, it provides for reporting of fraud and <Col N="1763" /> misappropriation of funds, that trustees will be represented on the board and for the replacement of a chairman of the board.  Other technicalities are also dealt with and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>There are major issues facing the pension industry.  The provision of adequate pensions is based on a two-tiered system, a basic pension provided by the State for PRSI contributors and a top-up occupational pension by the employer.  There are currently three major problems in this area.  First, the State's retirement and old age pensions are being systematically eroded by this Government.  Increases in 1995 and 1996 are barely adequate to meet the low levels of inflation.  Pensioners are not participating in the growth and the increasing wealth of the nation.  Young people do not appreciate the importance of pensions until they reach the age of 35 and 40 but they should think about it for the future when their job security may not be as solid, even if their jobs are more challenging.  My main concern is that with growth levels in GNP in excess of 5 per cent each year, pensioners received only 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent increases in the past two years.  Pensioners are not getting a share in the growing national cake.  Having built the nation with their sweat, intelligence, initiative and hard work they are now being denied any share in the benefits.  Pensioners have been ignored twice in the past two budgets and I hope that will not be repeated next year.</P>
    <P>The provision of occupational pensions by employers is changing substantially and there are many areas which need to be urgently addressed.  Pension fund assets, estimated at £16 billion, have grown steadily in recent years; some 40 per cent of the funds are invested abroad.  In future, those of us in Europe may receive our pensions in euros rather than punts but we will have to carefully monitor any developments affecting pensions within the EU.  Any shift of control towards free movement of investment could have a damaging <Col N="1764" /> effect on the Irish economy.  Most of these funds are currently managed from Ireland.  People are now living longer and in many instances they are retiring earlier.  Pressure is building on the funds to meet new demands.  Employers are requesting greater flexibility and workers are becoming increasingly mobile.  Employers fear their funds will not be able to meet the extra demands. Consequently, they are shifting to defined contribution schemes and away from defined benefits.  The older pension funds provided for 50 per cent or up to 66 per cent of salary as the defined benefit for the pensioner.  The new schemes fix the contribution but the pension will depend on the investment performance of the fund.  Workers should be aware of this change and be advised of the long-term implications.  In general, they suit employers more than employees; the investment risk shifts to the employees.  These changes, which are occuring now, will require a close examination of all legislation affecting pensions to safeguard workers' interests in the future.</P>
    <P>Existing pension schemes or rules do not cater adequately for the growing proportion of the workforce employed part-time, those redundant or those who want to take time out to care for children or people with disabilities. Employers increasingly need flexibility in the workforce.  That is being provided but there is a need also for matching flexibility in the provision of pension support.  It can be done if somebody cares.</P>
    <P>Overall there is a need for a more radical reappraisal of the present provision and operation of pensions. Ireland, with its young population, has great potential for growth but if we are to achieve this growth and the jobs it will provide, we need investment.  The present favourable economic climate and forecast augur well for greater pension fund investment at home.  Many opportunities can be identified and the Government should give every encouragement to invest more of the pension funds here.  We must be careful also not <Col N="1765" /> to discourage the development of pension provision through over-regulation. This crucial balance must be maintained if the best interests of the workers and their employers are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Bill, while limited, is welcome.  It is very technical.  It provides for the replacement of chairmen and two additional board members to represent trustees, but it does not provide specifically for a pensioner trustee.  Pensioners' interests are considerable and such a provision would be an addition to the Bill.  It also provides for compulsory reporting of suspected fraud or misappropriation and for a whistle blowers scheme, but it does not tackle key issues such as State pensions and the need for pensioners on social welfare pensions to get a share of the growing national cake. It does not cover the shift to defined contribution schemes away from defined benefit schemes, an area which needs a great deal of attention.  The growing proportion of the workforce employed part-time, who are redundant and who want time out must be considered in pension provision.  Redundant workers are increasingly seeking greater security in their position and further backdating of their pensions.  I welcome the Bill but I would like to see more work done in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the issue of pensions has gained great momentum in recent years.  It has also received a great deal of attention from the media in the past year.  That is to be welcomed because it is an issue of concern facing our society in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 Pensions Act, which deals with occupational pensions, is significant. The purpose of that Act is to regulate occupational pension schemes, to ensure they are properly administered and that the pension rights of members and their dependants are adequately safeguarded.  It sets out minimum standards in key areas by providing a framework for the regulation and supervision of schemes.  The Act sought to ensure that members could change jobs without forfeiting their pension rights, that <Col N="1766" /> schemes would be properly funded, that employers would deliver on promises made to employees and that members would have full access to all information on the operation of their schemes and the security of their pensions.  It also sought to provide for equal treatment for men and women in relation to the scope and conditions of access to schemes, benefit rights and contribution levels.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides for the amendment of the 1990 Act, the majority of the amendments being of a mainly technical nature.  Those amendments were brought forward following a review of the principal Act.  The Bill also introduces some new provisions.</P>
    <P>The area of pensions is a minefield. However, with the demographic changes, the proper provision of pensions is of utmost importance.  Within the next 25 to 30 years the structure of our society will change enormously.  At the moment, about 11 per cent of our population are over the age of 65. According to the CSO, by 2011 that will have increased to 19 per cent and to 23 per cent by 2021.  While the ratio of those under the age of 65 years to those over 65 years is now 5:1, by 2035 the ratio will be 3:1.  Therefore, fewer people will be supporting those of pensionable age.  If those pensions have to be provided by the State, it will throw a great burden on the employed.  It is necessary to allow for proper occupational pension schemes so that people can provide for their own pensions outside the State system.</P>
    <P>There is a drawback in the taxation structure for the self-employed where 15 per cent of net relevant earnings are allowed as a tax relief deduction for investment in a pension scheme.  The main problem is that many self employed people start their businesses when they are in their twenties, build them up in their thirties and provide education and so on for their children up to their mid forties.  It is only then that they have finance available to invest in a proper pension scheme.  The State is providing a pension scheme for <Col N="1767" /> every self-employed person whereby they contribute 5 per cent of their income under the PRSI scheme towards a pension fund.  However, it would be better if the State increased the 15 per cent allowance which would enable self-employed people to provide for a proper pension and take pressure off the State sector.</P>
    <P>The position of those who entered the present scheme for the self-employed when they were over 56 years of age and who are not entitled to any pension as they have not made payments for the ten year period stipulated in the provisions must be looked at.  Those who do not qualify for a pension should receive a refund of the contributions they made.  Will the Minister clarify that matter in his reply?  I am often asked, as I am sure the Minister is, about what is happening in that area.</P>
    <P>Pension funds should receive more direct help to invest in Ireland.  Pension funds hold roughly £16 billion, most of which is invested abroad.  If proper provision and direction was given by the Government &mdash; which I am sure the Minister would also like &mdash; funds from Irish investors would be invested here. I urge the Government to examine this which would allow for investment in bodies such as Telecom Éireann.  I know pension funds must invest prudently and wisely so that they do not lose money, but there are opportunities in this country which could be availed of.  Every assistance should be given to pension funds to ensure they invest here, which would create and maintain jobs.</P>
    <P>I agree with the whistle blower provision in the Bill as every professional adviser should be obliged to report fraud.  However, the area of reporting the contemplation of misappropriation or a breaking of the rules will cause problems.  I have no doubt that if professional people, such as accountants and auditors, were discussing matters with decision makers and a matter arose which was likely to be fraudulent, they would advise that was not allowable <Col N="1768" /> within the rules and should not be followed through.  If people contemplate a course of action but are advised it is not within the law, they will not go ahead with it.  It is not wise or necessary for such matters to be reported.  The concept is too loose and I would like more detail from the Minister in regard to this provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to restore political confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, damaged by the recent revelations of political party fund-raising, by relieving the current chairman of his responsibilities; requests the Government to immediately review the system of programme managers so as to properly define their role, in view of the substantial State funding incurred in this regard; and calls on the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in view of the adverse implications for the principle of ethics in public office, to resign, particularly in view of his inability or unwillingness to fully understand the consequences of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this motion in an attempt to restore some public confidence in the Independent Radio and Television Commission and in the political system generally.  Both have been damaged by the activities of, and statements from, the chairman of the commission and his political master, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, over the last number of days.  The fact that the <Col N="1769" /> Government has not tabled an amendment to my motion is unprecedented and indicates the disarray of the three parties in Government in dealing with this issue.  Even in the darkest hours of previous administrations, at times of crisis there was always somebody in the ranks who could cobble together a retort on an occasion like this.  If the Government cannot agree on this issue, it does not augur well for its future.</P>
    <P>In my motion we seek the immediate removal from office of the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission who has clearly failed to meet the standards required by the holder of that office by involving himself in a partisan way in the political system, and the immediate resignation of the Minister who has supported such activity and has failed to comprehend the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    <P>What we have in this case is the chairman of the State body responsible for allocating radio and television broadcasting licences fundraising for the re-election of the Minister in charge of broadcasting.  How can the public believe that Mr. Stockes is acting independently while being politically involved with the Minister?  The system has to be fair and it has to be seen to be fair.</P>
    <P>The actions of Mr. Stokes in the past few weeks and earlier are obviously imcompatible with his chairmanship of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  It should be remembered that the Independent Radio and Television Commission is not an ordinary State board.  The legislation setting up the commission distinguishes it from the majority of other State boards as its responsibilities involve the granting of broadcasting licences.  It is for that reason that Fianna Fáil appointed Mr. Justice Henchy as the first chairman of the commission in 1988.  We wanted to ensure that the chairman was independdent and was seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>If Mr. Justice Henchy had acted in the same way as Mr. Stokes there would have been a similar breach of standards. Would even asking Mr. Justice Henchy <Col N="1770" /> to participate actively in a fundraising political event be considered acceptable by the Minister?  Surely the answer must be no.  This should give the Minister pause for thought.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that nobody believes it is wrong for a director of a State body to maintain his or her friendship with the Minister.  Nor do I suggest that a person should be disqualified from a State board because of their involvement with a political party.  As I have already said, the Independent Radio and Television Commission is not the normal type of statutory body to which the Government makes appointments. Unlike statutory corporations such as CIE or Bord na Móna, the Independent Radio and Television Commission is given responsibility to select persons who wish to provide broadcasting services in the State.  In addition, the Independent Radio and Television Commission regulates the service provided by such persons.  In blunt terms, licences issued by the Independent Radio and Television Commission have a huge commercial value.</P>
    <P>It is well established in Irish law that an administrative body created by statute, such as the Independent Radio and Television Commission, is obliged to act in accordance with natural and constitutional justice.  This requires the body to be even-handed and fair in all its dealings and also to be seen to be even handed.</P>
    <P>The applications of these principles to the Independent Radio and Television Commission was up held by the High Court and the Supreme Court in the case brought by the TV3 consortium two years ago.  In that case the Independent Radio and Television Commission had failed to give TV3 notice of its intention to withdraw a previoius decision to allocate to this company a national television franchise.  There is, therefore, a legal onus cast on the Independent Radio and Television Commission, and in particular its chairman, to ensure that the requirements of natural and constitutional justice are met.  A doubt and a shadow is now cast over the <Col N="1771" /> manner in which the Independent Radio and Television Commission carries out, or may have carried out, its functions.</P>
    <P>Natural justice is explained by Hogan and Morgan in their book <i>Administrative Law</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>The best way of explaining constitutional justice is to begin with natural justice, which consists of two fundamental procedural rules, namely: that the decision-maker must not be biased; and, secondly, that anyone who may be adversely affected by a decision should not be condemned unheard; rather he should have the best possible chance to put his side of the case.</P>
    <P>Does bias raise its head here?  That bias which should be a concern of the Minister is emphasised by a court case taken against the Independent Radio and Television Commission by Dublin and County Broadcasting in 1989.  In his judgment Mr. Justice Murphy stated:</P>
    <P>If it is shown that there is on the facts circumstances which would lead a right minded person to conclude that there is a real likelihood of bias, that would be sufficient to invalidate the proceedings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>This is the territory into which the Independent Radio and Television Commission may be descending.  It should never be there.  A statutory body is established to carry out its functions without fear or favour in a fair and even-handed manner.  Recent events call that into question.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the Independent Radio and Television Commission is not just any old statutory body.  It is at the frontiers of technology.  It is dealing with the brave new world of services in radio and television that have a commercial value. It is not dissimilar to An Bord Pleanála, the planning appeals board, and the functions it discharges under the Local Government Acts.  It is not a body which should descend into the party political fund raising area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> For reasons I have given earlier, the principles of natural and constitutional justice apply to statutory bodies such as the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  There can be no doubt whatsoever about that application as there have been judgements of the courts establishing this fact.</P>
    <P>The rules of natural and constitutional justice, which include rules preventing bias, should have served as a warning of the ill-advised actions of the chairman of the commmission.  Are there no standards left in public life? What will the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission be asked to do next?</P>
    <P>The latest political fund raising endeavours by Mr. Stokes were not his only display of political partisanship. Through his magazine, <i>Hot Press,</i> he has heaped vitriolic abuse on politicians from other political parties, but never on the Minister, Deputy Higgins, and the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I will give an example of what I am talking about.  In an editorial in <i>Hot Press</i> magazine last September during the divorce referendum campaign, Mr. Stokes described representatives from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil as a &ldquo;lily-livered shower of swine&rdquo;, &ldquo;cowardly bums&rdquo; and &ldquo;flotsam&rdquo;.  This is quite unacceptable from the head of the State agency charged with upholding the integrity and standards of independent radio and television communications. There was a clear conflict of interest between expressing opinions like those expressed by Mr. Stokes and being ultimately responsible as a Government appointee to the democratic representatives of the people. Public representatives have a duty to represent the views of their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to a decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission in October 1992 to force the resignation of Senator McGowan from the board of Highland Radio.  The letter from the Independent Radio and <Col N="1773" /> Television Commission dated 23 October 1992 reads:</P>
    <P>The Commission at its meeting considered whether it should give retrospective approval of the change in the composition of the board of directors which your Company has sought to make.  The Commission decided that it could not do so.  Mr. Patrick McGowan is a member of Seanad Éireann and it is the Commission's opinion that the independence, actual or perceived, of an independent radio station would be imperilled if its board of directors included a members of either House of the Oireachtas.  None of the other twenty local radio stations has a member of either House of the Oireachtas on its board of directors.  The Commission decided at its meeting that it could not make an exception in the case of Senator McGowan.</P>
    <P>At its meeting the commission decided it could not make an exception in the case of Senator McGowan and in a further letter, dated 5 November 1992, the Independent Radio and Television Commission once again demanded Senator McGowan's resignation.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>I refer to my letter of 23 October regarding the presence of Senator Patrick McGowan on the board of the Company.</P>
    <P>To date I have not received a reply to this letter and must therefore assume that the Company remains in serious breach of the Contract with the Independent Radio and Television Commission.

    <P>Those two letters demonstrate that the Independent Radio and Television Commission was prepared to take <Col N="1774" /> action in the case of a commercial company and where a public representative happened to be on the board of Highland Radio.  I am not questioning those decisions, but how can the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht square them with the decision to allow Mr. Niall Stokes, the chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to fund raise for a Minister fail-with responsibility for broadcasting?  I do not see the logic in the Minister failing to take action in this case.  He allowed the chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to fund raise for his re-election in County Galway.</P>

      <P>In a letter in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon, the chairman of the no-divorce campaign, stated that during the referendum campaign last year it was informed that a directive had been issued from the Independent Radio and Television Commission to all independent radio stations instructing them not to accept or broadcast notices about meetings to be held in connection with the divorce referendum on the basis, apparently, that it was a political issue. Mr. Justice O'Hanlon pointed out that public meetings were arranged by groups opposed to divorce while there were virtually no meetings convened by those in support of it.  He queried why, if it were up to each group in that campaign to determine its strategy, the Independent Radio and Television Commission should decide that public meetings, a device used by only one group, should not get prior coverage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the stated views of the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission on divorce.  We must ask, therefore, if he abused his position to attempt to manipulate the media during the referendum campaign? Taken with his editorials in <i>Hot Press</i> which were violently abusive towards those supporting the anti-divorce position.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon's <Col N="1775" /> letter is a cause of legitimate concern.  It is evident from the political fund raising case we are debating this evening that Mr. Stokes was also repaying favours. He who pays the piper is obviously calling the tune, but as in the case of the traditional story, the piper may eventually lead all the rats into the water.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has made great play of his support for the film industry.  However, the current script being acted out looks more like a very sick B movie than Oscar material, unless perhaps under the arrogance category.  The Minister's refusal to accept that anything wrong took place displays an arrogance and a lack of political judgement which makes him unfit for office.  He should explain why the fund raising event was cancelled or was it cancelled?</P>

      <P>On the News at One on RTE radio on Friday, 29 March, the Minister stated that the letter seeking support for his fund raising event was withdrawn because other units of the party in Dublin felt it might clash with their events.  He stated &ldquo;... a letter organising this particular event went to some members of the Labour Party in a Dublin constituency who were having their own fund-raising events and said they didn't like the idea of fund-raising events for other constituencies in, as it were, their territory, and for that reason the letter was withdrawn&rdquo;.  However, according to Bruce Arnold in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> a spokesperson for the Teachers' Club said last night that the event took place and was attended by the Minister, Deputy Higgins, and the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Minister claims this fund raising race meeting was a once off event.  Yet the letters seeking support for the race night refers to &ldquo;a series of fund-raising events which will take place in Dublin during the remainder of 1996&rdquo;.  It is obvious that Mr. Stokes was <Col N="1776" /> part of the fund raising committee for the Minister's re-election.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that Deputy Hogan was forced to resign his position as Minister of State because an official in his office issued a press release on the budget a few hours too early, even though the full details of the budget were carried on the RTE nine o'clock news the previous evening.  Deputy Coveney had to resign from Cabinet because he sought a contract for his family business.  It could be argued that the case we are discussing tonight is a great deal more serious than those relating to Deputies Hogan and Coveney. The Minister used the head of a State body, for which he is responsible, to raise money for his re-election.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Labour Party practises double standards.  If a Minister from another party were involved in this scandal, the Labour Party would demand his or her immediate resignation as the price for staying in Government.  However, when it involves another party, the Labour Party pontificates from the high moral ground.  It is time for the Labour Party to stops the hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the role of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the manner in which he carries out his duties.  It is well known that the people in the arts world are speaking of a climate of fear.  Groups are either in or out.  Patronage and funding issues have been increasingly linked to a dangerously personalised clientelism.  The words &ldquo;openness, transparency, accountability and fairness&rdquo; have no meaning for the Minister.  We all remember reading that 50 per cent of an arts budget went to Galway, the Minister's county.</P>

There <Col N="1777" /> are some people in the arts world who would miss the Minister if he resigned, but many others would be relieved.  The Minister's legislative record is appalling. Only three Bills are promised under the Programme for Government and the Heritage Council Bill, initiated by the previous Government, was the only the dealt with by the Minister in the past year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What about poor Fine Gael?  It is still delighted to be in Government and will accept anything from the Labour Party merely to remain there.  Last night we had the pathetic sight of the Taoiseach defending Mr. Stokes, the chairperson of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, who failed to meet the standards required by the holders of that office.  The Taoiseach is prepared to give more support to Mr. Stokes and a Labour Minister than he gave to his party colleagues, Deputies Hogan and <Col N="1778" /> Coveney.  We all remember the statement by the Taoiseach when he took office 16 months ago.  He told the nation this was a Government it could trust. However, the actions of the three parties have led <i>The Irish Times</i> to state in an editorial today:</P>
    <P>There is a perception of sleaziness in the way the constituent parties of the Government conduct their business whose main characteristic is an apparent disregard for public opinion or concern.</P>

      <P>The editorial continues:</P>
      <P>Yet when Mr. Higgins appoints Mr. Stokes to his part-time position, and Mr. Stokes joins a committee to raise electoral funds for Mr. Higgins, something happens that ought not to happen. There is a crossing over of the line of separation that must exist between the holder of political power and the wielder of executive authority. The distinction is fully understood by every barrister appointed to the bench and every civil servant who rises to the highest Department ranks.</P>
      <P>It concludes by reminding the Taoiseach about his statement regarding trust: &ldquo;It is time for Mr. Bruton to show that his fine opening words were not the usual empty promises&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach had an opportunity on this occasion to show he wants to lead a Government the public can trust.  He failed to seize this opportunity last night.  However, it is still not too late to take action and to restore some public confidence in the political system.  By removing Mr. Stokes and demanding the resignation of the Minister, the <Col N="1779" /> Taoiseach will have displayed his commitment to heading a Government of trust.  Failure to do this will only further undermine the political system.</P>

      <P>The controversy that has led to the motion before the House raises four themes.  All of the themes implicit in this controversy relate to fundamental political values.  However, this motion has nothing to do with values but everything to do with party politics of the most base kind.</P>
      <P>The motion seeks to cast a slur on one of the most honourable, decent and able people ever to serve in Government in this country.  It seeks to traduce a proud record of service, and an even producer record of accomplishment.  It will not, and it cannot, succeed for that reason alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion moreover seeks to bring into disrepute the contribution made by a private citizen to a complex and sensitive area of public policy.  Niall Stokes is a private citizen who has made a huge donation of his time and energy to the interests of his community.  The roles played by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and Mr. Stokes, their singular contribution to a newly vibrant Irish culture, will be remembered long after this motion and the pettty vindictive calculation behind it is forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention the praise due to the Progressive Democrats for their assiduous hunt of the highest standards with regard to political fund-raising.  Their relentless quest for politically motivated fund-raising has led them to borrow in dark corners, and to help us, at least sometimes, shed light on this crucial issue.  As recently as March 1994 the redoubtable Deputy Molloy put down a parliamentary question to the Minister <Col N="1780" /> for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht asking him to identify the semi-State companies under his responsibility that had contributed to political parties in the previous year.  The Minister was forced to reveal that Údarás na Gaeltachta had contributed £100, not once but twice, to a fund-raising event in Oughterard in his constituency.</P>
    <P>The only problem was that the fund-raising event in question was a golf tournament, rather than a race night, and it was organised by and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  This probably explains why the matter was not relentlessly pursued at the time by Deputy Molloy.  It was not a matter concerning any political values, at least according to the Progressive Democrats.  In this respect the Progressive Democrats are a bit like Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty &mdash; when they use a word, it means just what they choose it to mean, neither more nor less.  For example, let us consider the word &ldquo;quasi-judicial&rdquo;, a much favoured word of Deputy Michael McDowell, who is senior counsel.  In his voluminous correspondence about this controversy, I note he applies the term to a number of offices and agencies, including the DPP, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman and An Bord Pleanála.  It is central to his analysis that anybody who has expressed a political preference is automatically disqualified from holding such a quasi-judicial post.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of agencies which perform functions ordinary mortals mights well regard as quasi-judicial, which Deputy Michael McDowell forgot to mention, no doubt inadvertently in his excitement over the weekend.  An example is the Employment Appeals Tribunal, a highly sensitive agency making decisions crucial to the people involved, decisions that can be complex enough to make it a statutory requirement that legal qualifications are necessary for either the chairmanship or vice-chairmanship. Who was in Government when a distinguished lawyer and well known party political activist, Mr. Gerard Danagher <Col N="1781" /> B.L., was appointed chairman in January 1990 under the seal of Deputy Bertie Ahern?  To our surprise we discover that two Progressive Democrats Ministers bear collective responsibility for what were no doubt very wise decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely such appointments, well merited as they no doubt were, transgressed the deep rooted values of the Progressive Democrats? Or is it possible that the party applies one set of standards to itself, one set of tailor-made values that are expendable when necessary, and a different set of others?  The truth is that this motion is <Col N="1782" /> not about values; it is merely about party political point scoring.</P>
      <P>Politics is a noble profession, a profession embellished by somebody who has made it his chief preoccupation to secure a central place in Irish life for good writing, good art and good music. Those who play the acrid, bitter, virulent games implict in this motion and its like, are seeking only to debase the profession.</P>
      <P>There are four themes implicit in the controversy behind the motion.  Each of them goes to the heart of good politics. I will list them and then deal with each in turn.  They are disclosure, judgment, integrity and consistency.  I wish to begin with disclosure and to make a disclosure of my own.  Long before I became a Member of the House I was involved in fund-raising for the Labour Party.  Since I became Leader of the party our ability to fight campaigns, to pay our way and to elect representatives &mdash; sometimes our very survival &mdash; has depended on honest and open fund-raising. I have tried to the best of my ability to play my part in that fund-raising and to do so in as open and honest a way as possible.</P>
      <P>Political parties have no product to sell &mdash; they survive or thrive on the basis of ideas, values, policies and messages. In the modern world, they complete by applying the best possible communications skills to those ideas and trying to ensure they are understood and valued. Ninety per cent of the work they do is carried out on a totally voluntary basis. However, like any other organisation, political parties need to be administered and organised and campaigns have to be fought, either around single issues or over the course of an election, whether it is local, national.  European or presidential. A political party that is not prepared to throw itself body and soul into the task of trying to win a democratic mandate for its ideas, values and candidates is not a political party worth believing in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As every Member knows, all of this costs money.  In our case it would be true to say that we are required to raise <Col N="1783" /> approximately £300,000 per annum for day-to-day head office operations. Membership fees, levies on parliamentary Members and affiliation fees account for slightly less than half of this amount and the rest has to be gathered by fund-raising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with most of my colleagues on all sides of the House I regard it as part of my democratic responsibility to be involved in fund-raising, which involves three elements. The first is the party leader's allowance which is paid to the leader of each qualified party in the House.  This allowance has been in existence for many years and it has always been the case that a larger allowance is paid to the Opposition parties.  The allowance is paid directly to the party leader each month. I endorse the cheque each month and it is handed over to the party office.  It appears each year in full in the professionally audited accounts of the Labour Party.  Any intrepid investigative journalist would be able to find it in our published national reports.</P>
      <P>I presume the same is true of all the other parties in the House.  For example, during the four years I served as Tánaiste to Dr. Garret FitzGerald there was only one party in Opposition and, therefore, the entire parliamentary allowance was paid by monthly cheques to the then leader of the Opposition. The total sum involved during the period 1983-87 was approximately £750,000 and each monthly cheques made out to the then leader of the Opposition would have been worth approximately £15,000. I assume that normal accounting procedures would demonstrate the normal democratic uses to which that money was put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the lion's share of the sums available for leaders' allowances goes to parties in Opposition.  This can be seen from the current figures which are as <Col N="1784" /> follows: Fianna Fáil, £292,361 per annum; Progressive Democrats, £145,250 per annum; Fine Gael, £103,256 per annum and Labour, £44,413 per annum.</P>

      <P>The second area of fund-raising in which I have been involved over the years is collections, usually outside churches, and attendance at functions, some organised in my constituency and others in different parts of the country.  The functions range from dinner and supper dances to table quizzes, race nights and raffle draws.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The third area of my activity in regard to fund-raising has been the conducting of national business appeals.  This normally takes the form of a letter from me to the chief executive of the top 100-500 companies explaining what the party stands for, what it has achieved and what it hopes to achieve in the future.  I have to admit that in the past some of these appeals have been more successful than others.  I have never at any time during such fund-raising efforts offered anyone anything in return for their financial contribution to the Labour Party. Unlike Fianna Fáil I have never accepted cheques for £50,000 from people in the beef industry with whom I was engaged in daily negotiations about export credit insurance.  Unlike the Progressive Democrats, I have never tried to sell my party to the highest bidder <Col N="1785" /> by calling it &ldquo;an investment opportunity with a proven rate of return&rdquo;.  Unlike them, I have never written only letters to beef barons, accepted a cheque for £20,000, delivered on the day a Government fell, and looked for a cosy dinner so that the donor's concerns could be discussed &ldquo;in more detail in a more relaxed atmosphere&rdquo;.</P>

Members will be glad to know that three of the races were sponsored at a cost of £100 each, 46 of the horses were sponsored at £20 each, 21 of the jockeys were sponsored at £10 each and the frenzied betting which took place on the night yielded £206.35 net after the winnings had been paid out.</P>

No radio licences were bought or sold, no favours were offered or taken, no new friendships were struck up since all the people in attendance were already friends, no cheques were written, no brown paper bags were handed over and an enjoyable night was had by all.  That is all there is to disclose about the race night over which the Opposition is demanding two resignations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue I need to address is that of judgement.  Niall Stokes occupies an important position.  He chairs a commission whose decisions must be made and be seen to be made in a totally impartial way.  Nothing would bring local radio or independent television into disrepute faster than the charge that it had been allowed to be politically manipulated.  There is no evidence whatsoever &mdash; and none has been offered &mdash; that Niall Stokes would be capable of such manipulation.  No Member of the House would believe that the Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, would be capable of the political corruption inherent in such activity.  Those who know both these people know that the independence of commercial radio <Col N="1787" /> and television is in safe hands between them.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the independent broadcasting sector is in a healthier state than ever before.  Niall Stokes and the Minister have something in common, that is they share a strategic vision of how broadcasting, among the other cultural industries, can become a vibrant area of economic and creative activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>If we reward that vision and effort with the kind of abuse that has been heaped on Niall Stokes over the past week it says little for our efforts to attract people of creativity and talent into this area.  We are supposed to be able to take abuse in the House but I wonder if anyone on the other side has stopped to think about the cavalier and unfounded attacks on a private citizen and the damage they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have total confidence in the integrity of the people involved in this case.  However, for those who do not know them, a definite error of judgment occurred in this case.  It was wrong and imprudent to place Niall Stokes in a position where he could be accused, however wrongly, of political favouritism.  His name should not have been on the correspondence promoting the race night, as it should not have been used in support of any fund-raising activities for the Labour Party.  He is not a member of the party, and should not have been put in a position where he was made to appear a party activist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues know my views on this matter and I have told them I regard it as imperative that the party should learn <Col N="1788" /> from this and earlier mistakes.  It would, rightly, be unacceptable to the people who vote for us, the people who work for us and the people who support us, if we were to lose sight of the need for total sensitivity where issues of standards are concerned.  Our members and our electorate demand &mdash; and they are entitled to &mdash; the conviction that we are capable of applying to ourselves the standards we demand for public life generally.</P>
    <P>I will now return to the third theme I mentioned at the beginning, the theme of integrity.  The motion advanced by Fianna Fáil, and supported by the Progressive Democrats, seeks to impugn the integrity of two individuals.  Deputy McDowell, for instance, despite his much-vaunted reputation for legal scruple, has accused them, tried them, and convicted them already, in radio interviews and press releases.</P>
    <P>I will not go down that road.  I will not stand by and watch two people of undoubted and unchallenged integrity sacrificed on the alter of Deputy McDowell's ego or the Fianna Fáil's hyprocrisy.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with one central issue.  Has the enormous contribution of Deputy Michael D. Higgins to the life of this country been compromised by a fund-raising event, honestly and openly conducted for legitimate and democratic purposes?</P>

      <P>If integrity is to be so cheaply abused and accusations can be so lightly flung around, will anyone's reputation be respected?</P>
      <P>In the motion before the House, there is a catch-all phrase asking us to review the programme manager system, and there will, no doubt, be the usual cheap jibes about people who work long hours trying to ensure that services are delivered faster, that policies are translated into action quicker, that the public gets value for money.</P>
      <P>These individuals have saved this country money through their expert advice.  They have brought forward innovative ideas that have contributed to an improved quality of life for citizens of this country.  They have provided the independent analysis that has informed fresh thinking on issues like long-term unemployment or disability rights.  They work on the basis of mutual respect with civil servants at every level, and provide a professional and committed service to the country.  The benefits of the system could be documented in detail.</P>
      <P>However, that would not do justice to the need for a daily headline about one person's mobile phone or another's fax machine.  The truth does not matter, only the point-scoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be accused of hypocrisy by some of those opposite, because I have defended the reputations of two people whom I believe are under unfair attack. Last night, for example, I heard Deputy Cowen on television say that if anyone other than a member of the Labour <Col N="1791" /> Party had been involved, we would be the first to demand their resignation.</P>
    <P>History has a way of distorting even simple facts &mdash; especially in the hands of propagandists.  In my entire political career in this House, I sought the resignation of one politician, Deputy Charles Haughey, and I did that from a position in Opposition, and for very good reasons.</P>

On both occasions, I did not seek the resignations of others &mdash; I resigned myself, with my Labour Party colleagues.  I did so because I believed then, as I believe now, that each Member must be accountable in the first instance to his or her own conscience. I have always tried to take the view also that if issues arise that cause difficulty within or between parties, it is for the parties involved to sort out those issues for themselves.</P>

      <P>For some time now, the Deputies opposite have sought to run a consistent strategy with my party as target for constant propaganda.  In the process, they have tried to destabilise a good, coherent Government which is implementing policies of change and renewal.  We are putting peace first and consolidating and building on economic growth.  By the time our term comes to an end, we will have implemented a wide range of reforms that can only contribute to more accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day, I find myself wondering if this is the real agenda.  Some of those who most strongly attacked the personal integrity of Deputy Higgins are also among those who most viciously attacked the whole process of reform.  Again, the record of this House will reveal that it has been the Progressive Democrats who have been the most sceptical of ethics legislation and most opposed to State funding of political parties, although not <Col N="1793" /> averse to pocketing whatever they can get.</P>
    <P>The juvenile attempts at damage will not work.  This Government will last, united and disciplined.  Integrity will be valued, and the vital, vibrant contribution of Michael D. Higgins has a long way to go yet.</P>

      <P>The Government of openness, transparency and accountability has been well described by some eminent journalists as the most secretive in the history of the State.  In recent weeks the shutter has been padlocked and only the Tánaiste holds the key.  He seems to have assumed an empirical air comparable to that of Caesar's wife who was, of course, above reproach.</P>
      <P>Even a cursory examination of Labour's record in Government will show that they have sinned more than they were sinned against.  Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald had been in this House for only a short period when she proclaimed that she did not want to see an Imelda Marcos type situation arising in the country.  That was patent nonsense but it sounded well and had a certain gloss to it.  Although Deputy Fitzgerald proclaimed ethics on that occasion, she had no difficulty subsequently in selling access to the Minister for Finance.  The Labour Party appears to go around with an ethics Bill in one hand and a collection box in the other.  Ethics, it would appear, are not for sale, but access and information are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next speaker was the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who was unable to identify any difficulty whatsoever with the so called independent chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission collecting funds for his Labour Party organisation.  The <Col N="1794" /> fact that the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission exercises a quasi-judicial position in this State does not appear to interfere with the Minister's interpretation of the world &ldquo;ethics&rdquo;.  Of course, the most extraordinary aspect of this entire affair is the full blooded support which the Taoiseach is giving to the Ministers concerned, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  This underlines what I have felt and what I have been saying for some time that Fine Gael are truly the poodles of the rainbow coalition Government.

When they said something they meant it and at the very least they had the courage to implement it.  It was most extraordinary that the Taoiseach was not obliged or forced by the Labour Party to seek the resignation of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry.  If the Labour Party had come looking for a head one can be absolutely sure that the head of the poodles would have given it to them.  The only other explanation for the Taoiseach's extraordinary support of the Minister in this case is the old adage that if you lie down with dogs you will surely get up with fleas.</P>

      <P>It would appear that the Tánaiste has missed the point and so has the Labour Party.  It is clearly provided in the legislation dealing with the Independent Radio and Television Commission that the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission cannot be removed except for stated misbehaviour and then only by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is precisely the same provision that applies to the Judiciary so it was clearly envisaged when the legislation was put in place that the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission would exercise a judicial function.  Strangely enough the same Independent Radio and Television Commission under precisely the same legislation is empowered to act in relation to political partiality.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission following an investigation can conclude that a radio station has been guilty of political bias and can terminate a broadcasting contract.  How can the Tánaiste and the Labour Party honestly tell the Irish public that an individual who holds a quasi-judicial position and <Col N="1796" /> has been publicly involved in collecting money for the Labour Party organisation in the constituency of the &ldquo;Minister for Broadcasting&rdquo; can act impartially in relation to deciding whether a radio station has acted with political impartiality?</P>

They are applied at the adverse publicity generated by the unbecoming conduct of some Ministers and the damage they are doing to the organs of State through their naked greed and anxiety to fill their constituency coffers for the next election.  For the public that cannot come soon enough and their toll on those parties who made lofty promises but delivered low standards will be great.  In any organisation large or small, Cabinet or even a club committee, mistakes will be made and there will be occasional lapses of judgment when things will be done which are not entirely in accordance with approved practice.  People understand and accept that, but what they cannot accept is seeing their Cabinet Ministers constantly and consistently involved in affairs which are at best shady and at worst an assault on the integrity, independence <Col N="1798" /> and high principles of the organs of State.  That may sound a bit excessive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but in the light of the series of scandals which have dog-get two political colours of this rainbow coalition there is no other interpretation we can apply or connotations we can attribute to what has emerged about their fund-raising activities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring may well grind his teeth at lapses in standards and breaches of ethics which have been perpetrated by senior members of his party. He may well privately deplore their antics but ultimately he has to accept responsibility for the actions of those Ministers whom he nominated to the Government, in whom he continues to have confidence and with whom he continues to share his Front Bench.  He will soon have to face reality; he may have to do so tomorrow.  He will shortly have to accept that there are some lapses which are not minor breaches of etiquette but major assaults on the code of ethics which one of his junior Ministers imposed with such pomp and cant, and by now we realise, hypocrisy, on the Members of the Oireachtas.  I found it objectionable at the time, I have considered it regrettable since and I find it laughable now that a Minister from the Labour Party should make comparisons between the Marcos regime and Members on this side of the House when all along it must have been herself and her party she had in mind when she framed that famous quote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all for ethics in parliament.  I support and endeavour to practise high standards in public life and I deplore any actions which might bring our political system into disrepute.  However, those standards must apply equally on both sides of the House and must be aspired to and practised by all.  There is no greater hypocrisy or farce than the exhortation &ldquo;do as I say, not as I do&rdquo;.  It illustrates the attitude of those who feel superior, above the law or beyond all <Col N="1799" /> regulations.  It is the credo of the powerful who see themselves as beyond correction. That is what we have been subjected to by successive Ministers from the left of this lopsided coalition.  They preach ethics in Government and yet, before the President's signature is dry on their new Bill, a succession of them trample on every principle it contains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The prophet may not be accepted in his own land but he generally understands his own message. The message the Labour Party, through Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, preached <i>ad nauseam</i> does not seem to be understood by that party and least of all by Deputy Fitzgerald who is not adverse to selling party favours to feather her constituency nest.</P>
      <P>We have had a succession of events where Labour and Democratic Left Ministers have been gravely compromised and yet cling to office like limpets to a rock.  Compared with their Fine Gael counterparts, those Labour and Democratic Left Ministers have acted in a cheap, shabby and quite disgraceful manner.  If it were to any other party they gave their allegiance, they could and would have been forced by their colleagues and their leader to consider their positions long ago.  Whether it be £100 a plate lunches, packing the Department with party activists or late night jaunts through the Phoenix Park, some Ministers have been more than lucky that they have such an accommodating leader whose primary purpose in life is surviving past the presidency of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least Deputies Coveney and Hogan did the decent thing and accountability still seems to exist in some measure in parts of the Fine Gael party.  However, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and the Minister, Deputy Higgins, one of the finest preachers of ethics to come into this House, should take a lesson from <Col N="1800" /> them and consider his own position today.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on RTE radio on Monday morning huffing and puffing about the role the chairman of the commission plays in issuing licences.  He tried to make much of the title Independent Radio and Television Commission and seemed to suggest that, as it was not called the Neutral Radio and Television Commission, it should not act independently at all.  The Minister said &ldquo;It does not recruit either its staff or its representatives from that group of people who are proud of having no opinion on anything&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not realise even at this stage that everyone is entitled to have an opinion on any matter but that the constraints of office may and sometimes must preclude people from declaring those opinions openly or otherwise making their view known publicly on a variety of matters?  The Minister does not seem to realise such people do not have the right to publicly involve themselves with the activities of any political party, even the one from which their nomination for office came.  Why else would the Minister fail to agree that people who have political opinions of any kind whatsoever should be &ldquo;excluded from consideration for appointment&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>He later said: &ldquo;I as Minister simply require that people will be independent, impartial and fair&rdquo;.  That is precisely the point.  One cannot be deemed to be impartial if one is acting to further the candidacy of a Member of the Oireachtas.  Why else are such people debarred from holding even the office of poll clerk at election time?  Surely the chairmanship of a body such as the Independent Radio and Television Commission requires at least that same impartiality.  If it does, furthering someone's candidacy by fund-raising for his re-election campaign is not a realistic, impartial or acceptable practice.  He gave the Independent Radio and Television Commission chairman the thumbs up when he said: &ldquo;I think that <Col N="1801" /> Niall Stokes has done nothing improper whatsoever&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Such behaviour by the Minister does not surprise me.  On 28 November last I asked him for the breakdown of the allocation of capital moneys from his Department for the last two years. While I was expecting that Galway would be a reasonable beneficiary from the Minister's generosity I was shocked to find that over 60 per cent of the funding went to the Minister's county.  Like the unjust servant in the bible who made provision for his future by currying favour with his boss's clients through shady discounts, so did the Minister seek to provide for his political future by generously scattering his departmental largesse among his constituents. &ldquo;Take the pen and write 80&rdquo; might be his favourite bible quote but &ldquo;take my pen and write what you like&rdquo; has to be his working principle.  It may no longer be barrels of oil or bushels of corn but theatre seats and art galleries which guarantee the future of this doomed Minister but the principle is the same and the cunning no different, even at the remove of 2000 years.</P>

They will not be impressed at how easy the parties of the left slip into the practices they purported to despise in other parties.  They will not be enticed to vote again for those parties who preach one creed in Opposition and practise another in Government and who seek to impose standards on others in which they do not believe themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has lost credibility, not only through his own actions but through his approval of the actions of his appointees and his ostrich like defence of the indefensible.  He has lost the credibility of the people and the <Col N="1802" /> confidence of many of his Government colleagues.  He has also lost the confidence of his party and leader, though they are unlikely to admit it.  He has become a lame duck Minister whose position is untenable and he now has no option but to resign that position.</P>

      <P>The most unsavoury aspect of one's role in this House is to have to criticise a colleague in a practical and constructive way.  I do not know and have not met Mr. Stokes.  I heard him on the radio for the first time recently.  There was a practice in this house until a couple of years ago whereby Members were not permitted to name private citizens or others outside this House.  That seems to have gone by the board.</P>
      <P>This issue is quite straightforward. The Tánaiste's words were &ldquo;It was wrong and imprudent to place Niall Stokes in a position where he could be accused, however, wrongly, of political favouritism&rdquo;.  I presume nobody placed Mr. Stokes in any position.  Mr. Stokes willingly placed himself in support of the Minister in what turns out, per the Tánaiste, to be a very glossed over fund-raising event?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>If a programme manager who is doing a good job, wants to put himself in the position, as he claimed on radio, of being a quasi public servant during the day and a Labour Party activist in his own time, one cannot distinguish the overlap.  People who want access to the Minister and receive correspondence from the person who has to discharge his duties in a pragmatic and responsible way, however, innocent, will feel compelled to contribute and support.</P>
      <P>If Mr. Stokes's name is associated with something, as in this case, people will feel compelled.  There may be no wrongdoing and no intent of wrongdoing, but the concept is there that letters sent by people in sensitive positions put the recipients in an invidious position.</P>

      <P>As we all do.  There is an unfortunate overlap in this case.  The Minister's programme manager and an independent appointee have been compromised by their activities.  That must be the conclusion on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Mr. Stokes refer to Deputy Michael McDowell's profession.  It is my understanding that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht wrote <Col N="1804" /> for <i>Hot Press</i> before he became Minister and, presumably, was paid for it.  He was double jobbing in the same way as Mr. Stokes accused Deputy Michael McDowell.  From his position as writer Deputy Higgins became a Minister and then appointed his arm's length, non-party political friend as chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  What was called the golden circle has become a pink, smoked salmon circle.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any corruption at the heart of this.  However, there is a perception that it is not correct.  The Minister for Health wrote recently to medical personnel and the perception was that they had better attend the function.  If the chairman of the Labour Party in Galway West wrote to everybody in the country there would not be anything amiss.  He would be doing his job as a party officer.  However, that is not the case in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <P>Debate on this issue is commonplace in the House, which is a pity because it gives a sickening impression of an addicition to point scoring in politics which is not rooted in the issues which should be dealt with in the House.  A mistake was made in this case and the Tánaiste admitted as much earlier.  The Minister, Deputy Higgins, should come clean about the matter and give an undertaking it is not being treated lightly.  Standards should be maintained and be seen to be maintained. An individual of the calibre of Mr. Stokes should not be compromised as his like are not too plentiful in Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the comments in the interviews on this case on radio yesterday were more stinging in that they were Freudian slips than any grilling the Opposition might give the Minister and Mr. Stokes.  I heard Pat Kenny on RTE say the matter would be &ldquo;decided&rdquo; in the Dáil.  He then corrected himself and said the matter would be &ldquo;discussed&rdquo;. That slip indicated how ineffective the Dáil can be in dealing with a matter such as this.  Ironically, on one of the <Col N="1805" /> independent radio stations, there was a more stinging slip when a presenter introduced the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission as Mr. Michael Stokes.  That was the ultimate and, from the Minister's point of view, most unfortunate mix up. It indicated a Freudian overlap of identities. It probably has a more stinging effect than any slap on the wrist from this debate.</P>
    <P>Many issues have been earmarked for Private Members' Time and it is sad to have to spend the time on an issue such as this.  There are Bills on land mines and other issues waiting to be debated. This may be a policitical land mine for some.</P>

The Leader of Fianna Fáil should have been made aware how wandering horses can cramp one's style.  The debate on the White Paper on Foreign Policy has been put off, despite there having been discussions today in Turin. The important issues of our neutrality and the Western European Union etc. have been put off.  I wonder about our sense of priorities.</P>
      <P>A mistake has been made.  The Minister could have prevented this motion being moved.  Had he been thinking about the prioritisation of issues he should have had the good grace to admit the mistake and let us get on with important issues.</P>

      <P>An interesting fact which has emerged about this matter over recent days, amplified by the comments of the Opposition, is the glee with which so many people have vented a pent up frustration with the legislative framework the Labour Party has championed in recent years &mdash; addressing the issue of standards in Irish public life.  We went into negotiations with all political parties after the last general election with a clear set of objectives to address the fundamental disquiet about standards in public life.  We were not motivated because we felt many Members of this House or the institutions of the State were corrupt, but we felt it essential to establish in legislation a new openness in the way we did business.  Many people scorned that proposal and fought it trenchantly &mdash; I negotiated with every political party in this House and know their attitudes to the Ethics of Public Office Act and the Electoral Act.  Using those Bills we sought to have openness about the way political parties are funded and about the means and ownership of individual Members, particularly office holders, so there would be no fears that Members, Ministers or decision makers would be compromised by self-advancement or financial improvement arising from decision making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people felt we were setting ourselves up for a fall.  We have fallen &mdash; we have made mistakes in the last few weeks &mdash; and the gleeful way in which those opposed in principle to what we wanted to achieve have rejoiced at minor mistakes and sought to rubbish the principle and dump the framework is a clear indication of their stance.  We knew we had ruffled many people's feathers in trying to put in place what we wanted.  We never set ourselves up as paragons of virtue and we are not better than any other party in this House.  The vast bulk of Members of every party have nothing to fear in the legislation we advanced and <Col N="1807" /> sought to enact.  The notion that minor mistakes &mdash; which should not have occurred and were wrong and foolish &mdash; should somehow bring a major plank of public policy tumbling down is one which we in the Labour Party totally and absolutely reject.</P>
    <P>We have tried to be honest in our position.  The Minister, Deputy Higgins and the Tánaiste have put on the record every last detail of this fund-raising effort &mdash; a Member opposite described it as more of a farce than anything else but it was not dishonest.  There was no indication, suggestion, or even charge made that there was anything dishonest or self-seeking about the actions of either the Minister or Mr. Niall Stokes, as a long-time friend and ally of Deputy Higgins in the crusades he has been involved in throughout his public life, to bring about social change.  Mr. Stokes was not and is not a member of the Labour Party, but he saw in the Minister a champion, someone who could change our political culture in so many ways. Foolishly he allowed his name to be associated with a minor race night, which would be held for a local school or social club, at £20 per horse, which raised £1,200 in total &mdash; hardly the stuff of major scandals or, to dovetail with Deputy Sargent, a matter which should occupy this House on two consecutive days.</P>
    <P>It has also been charged that the Labour Party has somehow set standards it is not willing to accept, or that anyone else who makes a mistake is removed from office.  That is wrong also.  In the last Government, the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, discovered he had a small shareholding in a company which had a licence application before his Department.  There were howls and demands from the then Opposition for his resignation &mdash; I suppose there is a <i>pro forma</i> game whereby the Opposition demands the resignation of Ministers. The Labour Party did not immediately demand any resignation; on the contrary, I went on television and <Col N="1808" /> explained that it was a simple mistake which in no way compromised the actions or decision of a man I regarded as a competent Minister.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that my constituency colleague is present to allay any fears I may have about this issue.  A debate on the criteria for issuing public service vehicle licences may appear to be obscure and an unwarranted imposition on the time of this House but it is not.</P>
      <P>A situation has developed in Cork City which is perhaps unique but I believe the rest of the country will experience it in due course.  There are a mixture of taxis and hackney cabs operating in Cork City and the system has worked extremely well during the past five years.  Approximately 400 to 600 hackney cabs service the city at any time which makes for a unique and excellent public transport service. However, a peculiar situation has been brought to my attention by constituents who expressed shock when they realised it was nothing new.  They inquired with regard to why something is not being done and why the law and the criteria for issuing of public service vehicle licences remain unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation relates mainly to men &mdash; although increasing numbers of women are becoming involved in operating hackney cabs &mdash; who apply for public service vehicle licences which cost a relatively small amount.  They apply at the age of 40 to 50 years, by <Col N="1811" /> which time the hackney industry is virtually the only area in which they can obtain worthwhile employment.  They are people of good character, upright citizens and family men who, in the main, have never had a brush with the law during the past 20 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>I have been approached by people who were refused public service vehicle licences.  In one case it emerged that the applicant had been found in possession of a stolen rug 23 years ago.  The rug was not from the Shah of Iran's palace but was something that a person would throw before their front door or fireplace. The man in question was convicted and fined £2 and 23 years later, following a Garda investigation of his record, he has been debarred from employment as a result.  This is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I was approached by another man who was convicted and fined £1 for selling Easter lilies 26 years ago.  I sympathised with him because the only reason I was not in a simlar position was that I was quicker than he.  The man involved cannot obtain worthwhile employment. He is not a thug or blackguard who beats up elderly people and was never convicted of assault, sexual assault, drunken driving or anything which would lead people to worry about his driving a hackney cab or taxi.  For incurring fines of £1 and £2, 26 and 23 years ago respectively, these men are debarred from worthwhile employment.</P>
    <P>I am not certain who is responsible for this.  The Department of the Environment is responsible for issuing the licences but I do not know who is responsible for investigating legal records.  The Minister responsible should change this outrageous condition and place some kind of moratorium regarding offences which people committed in their youth.  It must be ensured that people can avail of employment opportunities.  We are insisting the people remain dependent on the State because of minor infringements and placing a blight on their characters.  I ask the Minister of State to be sympathetic <Col N="1812" /> and introduce some worthwhile proposals for which he will have the gratitude of the people of Cork and, eventually, the rest of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1995 the Minister made public service vehicle regulations which provide for the licensing and operation of taxis and hackneys. The main thrust of the regulations is the devolution to local authorities of all of the significant functions relating to the licensing of taxis and hackneys.</P>
      <P>The primary functions of local authorities, as public service vehicle licensing authorities, are the licensing of taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys, including the grant and renewal of all licences; the creation of new taximeter areas and the alteration of the boundaries of existing taximeter areas; the determination of the number of taxis to be licensed in a taximeter area, decisions in relation to the maximum fares which may be charged by taxis and decisions relating to the fees to be paid for all licences.  The Minister has also given local authorities the power to decide that no further hackney licences are to be granted in their functional areas and the power to apply conditions to hackney licences granted.</P>
      <P>All major policy decisions relating to taxi and hackney licensing are now vested in the elected councillors.  These decisions are best made by local representatives who know the area, rather than as heretofore being made centrally by a Minister or Department.  The regulations provide that before deciding to authorise the grant of new taxi licences a local authority must engage in a public consultation process to ensure that the views of taxi interest groups and of people using taxi services are taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities, under the 1995 regulations, have maximum discretion to decide how to cater for the need for taxi and hackney services in their areas. It is a matter for these authorities to monitor the quality and adequacy of the service being provided in order that <Col N="1813" /> they may respond to any outstanding demand for this type of transport service in their areas.</P>
    <P>When a new taximeter area is being created, or when additional licences are being issued in an existing taximeter area, it is the responsibility of the licensing authority to determine the optimum number of taxis which should operate in the area.  The regulations provide a mechanism for assessing applications for new taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences on the basis of a points system. The system favours holders of hackney licences in new taximeter areas, and &ldquo;cosies&rdquo; in existing taximeter areas.</P>
    <P>The 1995 regulations came into effect last September.  The Minister made those regulations following consideration of the report of an interdepartmental committee, examination of the response to that report from local authorities, interest groups and the general public, and discussions with representatives of the various interest groups.  It is now a matter for local authorities concerned to apply the regulations as they deem appropriate in their areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no proposals to amend the regulations at this early stage.  He intends to review the position in the light of experience of the operation of the regulations but it would not be right to initiate such a review until at least one year after the commencement of the new system.  I will bring the views and opinions of Deputy Lynch to the Minister's attention.  Some of the examples she provided must be dealt with in a common sense manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1987 the Dublin region has received a disproportionately small allocation of national lottery funds.  The four Dublin counties account of 30 per cent of the population of Ireland.  Our records show that until last year less than 25 per cent of national lottery funding was allocated to sports clubs and youth clubs throughout the Dublin region.  The irony is that some of <Col N="1814" /> the heaviest buying of national lottery products is in the deprived places of the greater Dublin area.  Most of the national lottery sales each year come from the type of areas I will highlight tonight.</P>
      <P>It is sad that some of my colleagues in this House seem to have only become aware of the levels of crime and vandalism when they visited estates in Dublin West during the current by-election campaign, yet many of my constituents are constantly intimidated and harassed and have to deal with major vandalism and crime on a nightly basis, much of it drug related.  I congratulate the Government for its initial moves to deal with these problems.  However, at the same time heroic youth clubs, football clubs, and GAA clubs are doing massive work for communities across Dublin, very often with little or no support from central Government.</P>
      <P>Much of the spare time of the people who run these clubs is taken up in basic fund-raising to keep them going.  Any strategy to deal with crime and vandalism must include targeting resources at the deprived communities and at youth and sporting facilities.  I will bring one problem I have noticed to the Minister's attention since he has been responsible for this area for the last 15 months.  In north Coolock, Kilbarrack, Baldoyle and Donaghmede we have large soccer and GAA clubs with memberships of perhaps 500 or 600 people catering for 12 to 25 teams of boys or girls but which do not have grounds or clubhouses and therefore do not qualify for ongoing national lottery funding.</P>
      <P>To meet the massive weekly expenses of teams and club activists, members have to spend much of their energy, not on helping the young people and giving them something to do with their spare time, but in raising the money to run the clubs.  Will the Minister and his colleague, Deputy Bhreathnach, look at this issue and see if we could do anything in 1996 towards helping often heroic clubs in my constituency and most of the other 11 constituencies of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> I realise there have been improvements in the allocation of lottery funding and I hope the days when funding was a personal slush fund for various Ministers are now gone.  My colleagues on the Committee of Public Accounts are glad we played some small role in that.  The recent lottery report also raised crucial questions in relation to lottery money allocated to ongoing spending and not to providing the extra facilities the promoters of the lottery intended.</P>
    <P>Over the last nine years the most deprived areas of our cities and counties have been among the least well served by the national lottery.  Despite the fact that during that period we had two Fianna Fáil leaders from Dublin, one of whom was Taoiseach for a long time, they certainly did not get the balance right with regard to giving Dublin its fair share.  It could be argued as part of a coherent strategy to deal with crime and vandalism that Dublin should get perhaps even up to 40 per cent of the available national lottery funds, to make up for past neglect.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at the allocation of funding for Dublin?  To give Dublin its fair share should be a central part of our strategy to deal with crime and vandalism.  I would like the Minister to examine the whole area of current spending for youth and sports clubs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Broughan said.  Shortly after coming into office I reviewed the allocation of lottery funds over the previous few years.  What I saw in Dublin West was no surprise to me because it is very similar to my constituency with its huge diversity of living standards and problems.  I acknowledge the role youth clubs and sports play in the prevention of crime and many modern social ills. There was a serious imbalance in the allocation of funding and I am trying &mdash; I reflected this in the allocations I made <Col N="1816" /> in 1995 &mdash; to correct the imbalance suffered not only by Dublin but by a number of areas over a period.  That will be done in the context of a sports strategy I am developing which, I hope, will win greater resources for one of the major elements in dealing with crime and drugs.  Money spent in sport and youth affairs is money well spent and is an important part of the strategy for dealing with crime and drugs problems.  I support Deputy Broughan and applaud the voluntary workers in the sports and youth clubs.  They are all to the forefront of dealing with crime and drugs problems and they will be the unsung hereos of society.</P>
      <P>One of my areas of responsibility in the Department of Education is the provision of youth work services.  These services are in the area of non-formal education and I am continuing in my efforts to make them available to young people.  This is principally done through the provision of financial assistance, mainly from the proceeds of the national lottery, to special projects for disadvantaged young people and to national youth organisations which support local clubs and units throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Youth projects and organisations present valuable opportunities for social and personal development.  Qualities and skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision-making, motivation and responsibility can be acquired in a &ldquo;learning-by-doing&rdquo; manner.  The aim of the youth service is to assist all young people to become active participants in a democratic society.  This participation, essential to full development, extends to involvement in institutions of social, political, cultural and economic life.  In essence, the primary objective of the youth service is to help realise the potential of each young person and to facilitate their full participation in community life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate the emergence of a more comprehensive and accessible youth service, a revised policy on youth work was outlined in the recent White Paper on Education.  Furthermore, in line with <Col N="1817" /> the commitment given in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> I have arranged for the preparation of a youth service Bill to provide a statutary basis for the development of youth work.  That will be introduced with other education legislation later in the year.</P>
    <P>I envisage the new structures being planned for the youth sector will facilitate the involvement of local communities in identifying gaps in provision at local and community level and empower them to play a role in the development of responses to the needs of young people.  For deprived areas in particular, my Department administers a scheme of grants in respect of special out of school projects for disadvantaged young people.  Priority is given to projects in the field of special youth work initiatives, young homeless people, young substance abusers and young travellers.</P>
    <P>Grants are allocated to organisations and community groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people in areas which are disadvantaged due to a combination of high youth population, youth unemployment, dependence on social welfare, social isolation, drug misuse, homelessness, juvenile crime, vandalism, truancy, lack of mainline youth services for inadequate take-up of ordinary educational opportunities.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, these special youth projects for disadvantaged young people are provided mainly through Comhairle le Leas Óige, the youth subcommittee of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  In 1995 alone, my Department provided Comhairle with £569,714 for the support of youth groups in the city generally and an additional £1.68 million for the provision of special initiatives targeted specifically at disadvantaged young people.  Furthermore, a number of projects grant aided through the Eastern Health Board, aimed mainly at young homeless, young travellers and young substance abusers, deal, to a significant extent, with young people from deprived areas in Dublin city.  My <Col N="1818" /> Department provided £689,099 for the support of these projects in 1995.  I should add that financial assistance is also made available to a number of voluntary youth organisations which support their local clubs or units in all areas throughout the city.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the allocation of funds for the provision of youth services in 1996 will enable me to seriously consider the expansion of youth services generally.  I am glad to say my Department enjoyed an increase of 10 per cent this year, which will be reflected in an improvement and expansion of youth services.  However, youth services aimed at alleviating or eliminating the most serious forms of disadvantage among young people will continue to be a priority.  In this regard, a number of applications for new special projects, in Dublin city and other areas, are currently under serious consideration and I hope to be in a position to make decisions on these in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education also provides financial support for a wide number of schemes for the development and promotion of sport and to help provide opportunities for all people to participate in and enjoy sport at various levels.  Capital grants are available to sport clubs and to local community groups to assist them in the provision of sport and recreation facilities in their communities and localities.  About £6 million is made available annually for this purpose.  National governing bodies of sport receive substantial funding for their various activities and for the advancement of their sports right throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Over £1 million is granted each year to vocational education committees, including City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and County Dublin vocational education committee which receive substantial funding.  I know there is a major need for expansion of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was contacted by Andy Lam who owns the Silver House Chinese restaurant in Linenhall Street, Castlebar, and who is trying to get his brother, Hon Kit Sammi-Lam, into the country.  Mr. Lam employs two Irish people &mdash; one part time &mdash; pays all his taxes and keeps his business above board.  He wants to employ his brother as a specialist chef.  He has tried to get Irish people to cook Chinese food but it did not work out.  They are doing a great business but he has to work day and night.  He is married with three young children and they are settled well into the community.  However, last weekend he was sick and had to close his business from Thursday to Sunday, losing three to four days' valuable trading time.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at this case. This man employs Irish people and will employ more because he intends to expand his business.  He works hard for long hours and needs a work permit for his brother who will assist him.  His young family go to school in Castlebar and he makes a major contribution to the local economy.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with emigrants all my life as a public representative.  I was chairman of the Westport Emigrants' Reunion for ten years.  Irish people are dotted all over the world. Last week, our President and the Chief Whip, Deputy Jim Higgins, were in South Africa where they met many Irish people.  The Taoiseach and many Ministers travelled the length and breadth of America for St. Patrick's Day and they met many Irish people who have done very well over there.  Our Governments over the years have put pressure on politicians all over the world to let our people work in their countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to show compassion to a man who has made a major effort to raise his family.  He employs Irish <Col N="1820" /> people and intends to expand his business if his brother can come here to assist him.  It is sad when a man's business depends on him solely.  He had to close his business last week and put a notice in the newspaper because he was sick.  He is doing his best and making a major effort.  I ask the Minister to reconsider giving his brother a work permit so that he can assist him with his three young children.  This individual does not have a million pounds but he employs Irish people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think of the Irish people around the world.  Let us not be hypocritical.  We are glad to see our people employed all over the world, although we do not know whose jobs they are taking.  This person is not asking the Minister to allow someone in who will take an Irish person's job &mdash; he wants someone to assist in his specialised business.  I appeal to the Minister to give this man's brother a work permit. His wife came to my clinic last week and cried because they cannot stick the pressure.  I appeal to the Minister on compassionate grounds as we depend on other countries to take in Irish emigrants. Let us not be hypocritical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's frustration but there is an established system for dealing with such cases.  The background of this case colours considerably the Department's approach to the application.  The position is that applications for work permits are made by employers and considered in my Department under the aliens' legislation.  Such permits are necessary before an employer can employ a person who is not a citizen of the European Economic Area.  The main criterion in regard to the issue or refusal of an application for a work permit is based on the need to ensure that job opportunities which arise in the State are, as far as possible, reserved for Irish or EEA nationals.  Permits are not granted unless the employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts having been made, there are no suitably <Col N="1821" /> qualified Irish or EEA nationals available for the position in question.</P>
      <P>The most recent application in respect of the person in question was received in the work permit section of my Department on 14 February 1996 and the decision to refuse the application was taken on 28 February 1996. This decision was transmitted to the applicant on the same date.  The basis of the refusal was that my Department had been informed by the Department of Justice that the person in question had been in the State illegally and had been refused permission to remain.  He was asked to leave the State in April 1994, but he returned subsequently without going through immigration control.  He was again asked to leave the State by the Department of Justice on 24 January 1996.  I understand he has, in fact, left the State since then.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department not to issue work permits in respect of persons who are working, or have previously worked, in the State illegally.  I understand the person in question had been working for the employer in question since at least 1992.  My Department liaises closely with the immigration section of the Department of Justice in this regard.  The employer in question has been informed on a number of occasions that if he submits a work permit application in respect of a suitably qualified member of the legally resident ethnic community in the State, it will be favourably considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise a very serious issue for the people living in the south coast area.  I understand that a transmitter was put in place by RTE in Cahir, which was made fully operational last Wednesday.  It is interfering with the rebeaming process carried out by the South Coast Community Television group.  The RTE transmitter is blocking out the main source of signal coming into the Carrigaline area, an area which <Col N="1822" /> stretches from Mitchelstown to Fermoy down to Carrigaline, and from there to Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty and Bantry. This is a significant area, involving a large number of people.  There is a suggestion that it may also be affecting the Dungarvan group.  What has happend in effect is that BBC 2 has been blacked out completely and I am also given to understand there is interference with the reception on the HTV and BBC 1 signals.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, and his Department were made aware almost one month ago that the making of this transmitter fully operational would have these consequences and yet he or the Department failed to take any steps to avoid the disruption in service. The people of Fermoy, Carrigaline, Bantry and Clonakilty, County Cork, are of the opinion that there has not been a change in the thinking of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  They accuse the Minister of engaging in a charade and trying to delude those communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question being asked is how is it that RTE never interfered prior to this with the operation of South Coast?  A more than adequate RTE signal is already available in this region.  Is this action designed to make the case which was the subject of recent High Court proceedings, that South Coast Community Television is interfering with the spectrum within which RTE operates? How is it this hindrance occurred within one month of Minister Lowry giving an undertaking that South Coast could continue to operate unhindered by his Department?  How is it this operation was not delayed until such time as the independent assessment group had considered and advised this concern on the submission of its licence application in line with the commitment given by Minister Lowry in the Dáil?  Is there such a divergence of dictate between Minister Lowry and the Secretary of his Department, given that the Secretary claimed at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that the onus <Col N="1823" /> is on South Coast to devise a mechanism outside the present spectrum whereas Mr. Justice Keane in the High Court adjudged that the onus was on the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to devise such a mechanism for the legal operation of South Coast on the same lines and mechanisms as they had put in place for the MMDS system?</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to a meeting, attended by a large group of people that took place at Carrigaline, County Cork, before the Cork South-Central by-election. At that meeting the Taoiseach made a clear statement that he saw no difficulty in granting South Coast Community Television a temporary licence. He said it could be done immediately and the licence could cover two or three years.  Two years on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications have failed to deliver on that promise.  The Taoiseach also stated that night that there was no need for a High Court action, that everything would be resolved when Fine Gael went back into Government under his leadership. The High Court action was at great cost to South Coast Community Television. The company is in debt to the tune of £500,000 as a result of the action and the Taoiseach is not living up to his promise.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, that there is concern among the people at the shabby treatment meted out to them?  Is it any surprise that they have lost all trust and faith both in the Taoiseach and, indeed, in the Minister who have betrayed them?  The blocking out of their signal is the last straw and the ultimate in bad faith.  It is contrary to Mr. Justice Keane's verdict in the High Court action.  On behalf of the people in the communities which stretch from Mitchelstown to Bantry, County Cork, I ask the Minister to rectify the problem immediately and live up to at least one of the promises given to this group so that all faith will not be lost in the political system and the promises made prior to elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before addressing the Deputy's question, which I find to be somewhat lacking in specifics, I want to put the general issue into context. The Deputy will know that the radio frequency spectrum is a scarce national resource.  It is the statutory function of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to manage the use of that spectrum and to make specific allocations from within it for specific purposes. The recent High Court judgment reaffirmed his role in this regard.  The House will agree that there cannot be scope for a Minister to be anything other than objective in allocating frequencies; there can be no scope for partiality when we are dealing with a national asset of immeasurable value. The criteria for managing the spectrum and allocating frequencies must be the national interest and the public good.</P>
      <P>Essentially, that means the spectrum must be managed according to a well thought out plan which takes into consideration current and planned uses for it in line with broadcasting and general transmission policies set by the Government of the day.  We are talking about the use of frequencies in the ultra high frequency or UHF band here.  This is used for television broadcasting and the Deputy's question touches therefore on the broadcasting policy of this and previous Governments.  Among other things policies call for the continuing roll-out of the national services of RTE 1 and Network 2.  There are still significant numbers of our population who either are not receiving these channels or have very poor reception of them. For this reason RTE still require new frequency allocations to improve their nation-wide coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will also be aware of the Government's plans for Teilifís na Gaeilge which is due to begin broadcasting later this year.  Transmission testing for new services must be carried out well in advance and this has already started in the case of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  Finally, <Col N="1825" /> fresh proposals to launch an independent television channel in the near future have been lodged with the Independent Radio and Television Commission. All these services are to operate on the UHF band and provision must be made for their reception in all parts of the country.  This involves precision planning of the use of the UHF band.  This is an iterative process which has been under way in my Department for a long time.  No matter what way you look at this, the space available in this band is severely limited and it is sufficient for no more than four services of a national character.</P>
    <P>This scarcity of frequencies is the crux of any debate involving the operation of deflector systems because they want to operate in the same band.  The High Court ordered the Minister to reconsider an application from South Coast for a licence to operate such a system. This he has gladly undertaken to do. Indeed, the process to appoint outside consultants to aid him in assessing such an application is already under way.  The Minister has taken the unusual step of going outside the expert advice available to him within the Department so that the process can be judged to be utterly fair and impartial.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister gave an undertaking to the court that pending this assessment, there would be no attempt to close down the South Coast operation.  Given that the Government's broadcasting policies to which I referred earlier must be pursued, discussions have already been initiated with the South Coast group with a view to establishing whether any temporary accommodation could be reached which would minimise difficulties for both sides in the run up to a decision on their proposals. To this end, officials have had several meetings with representatives of South Coast and I am informed significant progress in this respect was made of a meeting held as recently as 19 March last.</P>
    <P>In the course of these discussions alternative frequencies to the ones already in use by South Coast have been <Col N="1826" /> identified by them as suitable for the continuation of their services pending the assessment of their application and which they maintain do not interfere with the roll-out of the national services. As that roll-out is happening on a continuing basis, these frequencies may ultimately be needed of course for the national services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has always said that if flexibility can be found within the constraints imposed on him by the necessity to provide for the four national services, we will apply it pending a final assessment of South Coast's application.  In fact, by taking this course of action we are going beyond what would be necessitated by the commitment.  The objective of the discussions with Southcoast is to try to find this flexibility.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has raised the question of interference to South Coast's main source signal, which I gather they receive somewhere in the Comeragh Mountains.  The Deputy alleges that this is being caused by an RTE transmitter but does not identify the source of this interference.</P>

      <P>This is not an ordinary case of interference complained of by a licensed service.  That usually results from some unauthorised use of the same radio frequencies by someone else in the locality.  Here it is alleged that the planned use of frequencies is interfering with an unauthorised user.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts that are relevant to this issue, as far as I am aware, are as follows: RTE recently changed frequencies at the Cahir site to relay reception of Teilifís na Gaeilge signals from its main <Col N="1827" /> transmitter site on Mount Leinster.  The effect was to move RTE 1 and Network 2 reception onto new channels to make room for Teilifís na Gaeilge.  These changes were flagged to South Coast last December.  In the continuing roll out of the new national services, changes of this kind are inevitable.  We try to see to it that they are flagged up well in advance but that may not always be practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that neither RTE, Department officials nor South Coast foresaw serious difficulties with the Cahir transmissions, if indeed they are responsible at all here.  It was felt that if interference to South Coast arose it could be overcome by their moving their equipment downhill from its current site.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Minister did not licence the South Coast transmitter site.  He has no <Col N="1828" /> details of its precise location or what equipment is erected on it.  These details are critical in any assessment of interference problems.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed that a cable operator whose head-end reception facility is in the same vicinity is not experiencing any interference problems from RTE.  It may be then that the South Coast equipment is at fault.</P>

It seems to me that the best way forward is to let the experts on both sides get on with the job of trying to identify the flexibility which I spoke of earlier, if such can be found, with the objective of reaching some accommodation in the short-term at least.</P>

With regard to the accommodation for young offenders, my responsibility extends, except in very exceptional circumstances, to the detention of those juvenile offenders between the ages of 16 and 21.  Responsibility for the offenders under 16 years of age rests, in the main, with my colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of extra accommodation for young offenders, I would like to point out that 33 additional cell spaces have been made available in St. Patrick's Institution in recent weeks and a further 57 cell spaces will become available for young male offenders at that institution following on the building of a new women's prison.</P>
      <P>With the increase in offender numbers at St. Patrick's the obvious need for additional education and training facilities is being addressed.

      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, provided for an increase in the maximum number of judges who could be appointed and the appointment of additional judges under the terms of that Act, is now taking place.  The salaries of judges are charged on and payable directly from the Central Fund and as such do not require to be voted by the Dáil on an annual basis.  Therefore, the question of a Supplementary Estimate does not arise in relation to the appointment of additional judges.  I should add that the estimated cost of judicial salaries which is included in the Government White Paper on the 1996 Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure does allow for the additional appointments planned for 1996.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have already implemented certain measures to control the amount of time spent by the gardaí in relation to court appearances. These measures include: the increased use in the Dublin Metropolitan Area of the summons as an alternative to the charge procedure; computerised summons application and issuing procedures which allow for court dates to be fixed for a rostered working day of the garda concerned; computerised scheduling of court cases so that cases relevant to a particular garda are listed together for hearing; the vehicle rectification scheme in the Dublin Metropolitan Area which allows motorists to repair vehicle faults within a specified period as an alternative to prosecution and consequent attendance in court; the number of Garda requests for remands is kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>A Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation is an important element of the legislation which is a part of the criminal justice plans announced by me following the Government meeting of 30 January 1996.  The main purpose of the Bill is to free Garda time and resources for the detection and prevention of crime.  This is to be achieved by reducing the frequency of attendances and the amount of time spent by gardaí in the courts mainly through the provision of procedural Garda evidence in court by way of certificate instead of through attendance by gardaí in court.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, provides for an increase in the maximum number of judges of the Circuit Court, including the President, from 18 to 25.  The Act also provides for the permanent assignment of two additional judges to the Dublin Circuit, one additional judge to the Cork Circuit and for the appointment of four unassigned judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of unassigned judges is a matter for the President of the Circuit <Col N="1550" /> Court.  The permanent assignment of additional judges to other particular Circuits was given full consideration during the drafting of the 1995 Act. However, it was decided, having regard to the level of arrears at all venues of the Circuit Court, that the provisions of the Act as they now stand, provide the most effective method of addressing the backlog of cases.</P>
    <P>I understand that the President of the Circuit Court intends that the unassigned judges to be appointed under the Act will be assigned on a temporary basis to those Circuit Court venues worst affected by delays.  I am satisfied that the additional judges appointed under the 1995 Act will assist in eliminating delays in the hearing of cases in the South-Eastern Circuit, which includes Waterford.</P>
    <P>The arrangement of sittings of the Circuit Court is a matter for the President of the Circuit Court and the judge of the relevant circuit and I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is as follows: The Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice made available a grant of £20,000, in 1995, to <Col N="1552" /> Cox's Demense Youth and Community Project, The House, 16 Oakland Park, Dundalk, County Louth.</P>
      <P>The project is a locally based community project that caters for adults, young people and children.  Its aim is the development of the community as a whole, with special emphasis on youth at risk from truancy, petty crime, alcohol and drug abuse.  The project received EU funding in 1993 and 1994 under the Horizon Initiative.  This funding ceased at the end of 1994.</P>
      <P>I am examining other possibilities in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have a major programme of criminal law reform under way at present.  While, of their nature, all of these proposed measures will impinge to a greater or lesser extent on criminal procedural matters, I should refer the Deputy in particular to the proposed Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I am concerned about some of the procedural arrangements for dealing with criminal cases and, in particular, the amount of Garda time which is spent unproductively in court.  The Miscellaneous Provisions Bill &mdash; which is at an advanced stage of preparation &mdash; will contain a series of measures to address this issue.</P>
      <P>In regard to the specific matter of amending the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, as I indicated in the House last week during the debate on the Private Members' Criminal Procedure Bill I am prepared to consider referring the question of the abolition of, or improvements which might be made in the procedures surrounding the preliminary examinations of indictable offences in the District Court, to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána has the personnel and resources necessary to meet the demands placed on them.  However, this is something which must be kept under continuous review and changes made as necessary.</P>
      <P>I am, for example, recruiting 350 gardaí this year and a further 350 gardaí in 1997.  In addition, an Information Technology Plan for the force is being implemented at present at a cost of approximately £26 million.  When implemented, this plan should result in the release of a significant number of gardaí from administrative tasks to perform outdoor policing duties.  It should also provide improved management information so that more effective use can be made of Garda resources.  As part of this development I inaugurated in January, a new £1.8 million computerised fingerprinting system for the Garda Síochána which is one of the most advanced fingerprinting systems in the world.  This system will lead to an increase in crime detection rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year I have undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure that the Garda have the means necessary to tackle crime.  These include: a CCTV System which was established in the Temple Bar area of Dublin on a pilot basis and which is likely to be extended to other areas; a Garda National Drugs Unit was established in July 1995 under the control of a Deputy Commissioner; an increase in the number of Youth Diversion Projects in operation in urban areas from two to seven throughout the country; additional funding to enable the Garda transport fleet to be replaced in a five year cycle; a regional command structure which was created in January this year.  This was the first major change to the organisational structure of the force since the foundation of the State.  The reorganisation of the force on a regional basis will provide for a much more co-ordinated and cohesive <Col N="1561" /> approach in tackling, on an operational basis, all facets of crime, particularly mobile criminals.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have under review at present the question of providing enhanced air support to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all possible efforts are being made to seize supplies of the drug commonly known as ecstasy and to apprehend those who are involved in the importation, distribution and sale of the drug. These efforts have led to record seizures of the drug, including the discovery of a so-called &ldquo;ecstasy factory&rdquo; in Dublin.  A number of persons are currently before the courts arising from these Garda operations.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, in relation to the powers of gardaí to enter premises where a public dance hall licence is in force.  I believe that this will be especially relevant in the context of &ldquo;rave&rdquo; dances, which are associated with ecstasy.  This proposed amendment arises from a review carried out by my Department of the law in this area.</P>

      <P>Since no rural Garda stations have been closed over the past five years I presume the Deputy has in mind the extension of opening hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> The times during which stations are open are largely determined by operational considerations.  While there is a need to facilitate the public with business at stations this must be balanced by the necessity to have as many gardaí as possible &ldquo;on the beat&rdquo; to deter, prevent and detect crime.  Having stations open for longer hours would tie down manpower and would hinder rather than help the campaign against serious crime in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present arrangements best meet the operational needs of the force in the fight against crime and I am satisfied to be guided by their professional judgment.</P>

      <P>I need hardly say that the Garda Síochána allocate optimun resources to the investigation of all murders.  The primary task is to identify those responsible and to assemble evidence to support their prosecution.  Special attention is also directed to the motivation involved.</P>
      <P>The Serious Crime Squad at the Central Detective Unit gathers intelligence and information on all serious crime. Every effort is made in the examination and collation of this material to establish if the crimes are linked in any way. This includes, in the case of murder, trying to establish if there is a common prepetrator for two or more offences. The Garda authorities are satisfied that maximum resources are deployed to solve all murder cases including the identification of possible so-called contract killers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of murders and suspected murders over the past five years and the number of detections each year are set out in the table below.  Deputies may note that the figures for the years 1990 to 1993 inclusive are a little lower than those contained in the Annual Garda Crime Reports.  The reason for this is that some cases classed originally <Col N="1565" /> as &ldquo;murder&rdquo; will subsequently be classified under a different heading, e.g. &ldquo;manslaughter&rdquo;, on the basis of more complete information or as a result of court decisions in the meantime.</P>

      <P>Information is not maintained in such a way as to indicate the number of persons released on bail pending appeal directly from the District Court.  I can inform the Deputy that in 1993, the latest year for which figures are available, 784 persons were released from prison on bail pending appeal.  The vast majority of these would have been appeals to the Circuit Court.  In relation to the question of possible changes in our bail laws, I am at present consulting my colleagues in Government on comprehensive proposals to deal with the problem of offending while on bail.</P>

The outdoor facilities provide for exercise on a group and individual basis, in compounds where football, jogging and other such activities can take place.  All institutions have a supervised gymnasium which is used by inmates for a range of activities, including exercise classes on a group and individual basis. Supervision is provided by a qualified instructor.  Other facilities which are available in all institutions include television and video showings in a communal area.  Indoor activities such as pool, table tennis and board games are available at set times.  Limited library facilities are available in all prisons and newspapers are magazines are available on request.  Inmates are also encouraged to avail of a varied educational programme under the guidance of teachers from the vocational education services.  Recent <Col N="1569" /> initiatives in respect of recreation for some female offenders include swimming lessons on a weekly basis at a facility in the local community and the introduction of an outdoor pursuits programme involving canoeing, hill walking, orienteering, rock climbing and sailing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that there has, for some years, been a problem with illegal drugs in some of our prisons.  This is due to the increasing numbers of committals who are suffering from drug addiction and also to the fact that illegal drugs are, despite stringent preventative measures, finding their way into the prisons.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a drug free unit at the training unit which I announced last week is but one of a series of initiatives taken by me in response to this most serious problem.  The concept of drug free areas within prisons is not new.  They are a feature &mdash; and a most successful one at that &mdash; of penal systems in several other jurisdictions where, like our own, the abuse of illegal drugs has spilled over from the community into the prisons.</P>
      <P>The drug free regime at the training unit will provide prisoners who have no history of involvement with illegal drugs with an opportunity to serve their sentences in an environment free from illegal drug abuse and from the influence of those who might seek to involve them in the practice.  The unit will, in addition, provide a setting in which those prisoners who have, either through their own efforts or with the assistance of the new drug treatment facilities, which are due to commence operations at Mountjoy Prison in the near future, achieved drug free status, can ensure their longer term recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>In their report entitled <i>Non Fatal Offences Against the Person,</i> published in 1994, the Law Reform Commission made two recommendations which are relevant</P>
      <P>(a)  they recommended that the maximum penalty under section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875 should be increased to five years (at present it is three months).</P>
      <P>(b)  they recommended a new offence of harassment which &ldquo;would capture, for example, the acts of an infatuated psychotic who follows a woman in order to gain her affection&rdquo;. The recommendation was that &ldquo;a person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, harasses another by persistently following, watching or besetting him or her in any place, by use of the telephone or otherwise, should be guilty of an offence ... when his or her acts seriously interfered the others peace or privacy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced in December 1995 the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to amend the law relating to non fatal offences against the person, which would take account of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  That legislation is being drafted at the moment and I hope to <Col N="1575" /> publish a Bill shortly.  The Bill will implement the recommendation of the Commission to increase the penalty under section 7 of the 1875 Act at (a) above and will also contain a provision as recommended by the Commissioner to deal with &ldquo;stalkers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The existing law which might cover this type of offence is the above mentioned provision in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, which makes it an offence where a person &ldquo;with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing or to do any act ... wrongfully and without legal authority,</P>
    <P>(1)  uses violence to or intimidates such other person or his wife or children, or injures his property, or</P>
    <P>(2)  persistently follows such other person about from place to place, or</P>
    <P>(3)  watches or besets the house or other place where such person resides or works, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This coercion provision which appears to have been aimed at trade disputes, is not confined to such disputes or to disputes between employer and workman and could be used in suitable cases against &ldquo;stalkers&rdquo;.  The DPP's office has no record of a case of stalking having been reported to it.</P>
    <P>Apart from this a victim of stalking, under the civil law, can seek an injunction from the High Court or Circuit Court against the stalker to stop the harassment.</P>

However, I am happy to report that significant progress has been, and is being, made in relation to speeding up the processing of all transactions in the Land Registry.</P>

    <P>A number of initiatives are currently being pursued to further reduce the time taken to process applications and to improve the efficiency of the Land Registry.  A considerable investment is being made in computerisation and information technology in the Land Registry.  In this regard, the IT unit in <Col N="1578" /> the Registry is currently working on the development of a title registration information system specifically for the Land Registry and it is hoped that considerable progress will be made in this regard during 1996.</P>

      <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána was 10,744 on 28 March 1996 compared to 10,984 on 31 December 1992.  The drop in numbers has affected mainly the garda rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recruited 350 gardaí last year, and will recruit the same number this year and next, but they will not immediately <Col N="1579" /> make up the shortfalls.  Retirements have been higher than normal in recent years for exceptional reasons e.g. in response to the added pensionability of unsocial hours payments and the ending of the temporary extension from 57 to 60 of the retirement age.</P>
    <P>However, a fall in the strength of the force does not necessarily result in less effective policing.  It can be compensated for by more effective operational deployment, by greater civilianisation and by the introduction of better management tools such as the information technology plan costing £26 million which is about to be implemented.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present and proposed opertional strengths are adequate for operational needs.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental committee on non-Irish nationals was established in 1993 with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to examine and restate present policy and practice in relation to the admission to residence and right of work in the State of EU and non-EU nationals from the point of view of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;general aims of policy;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" />&mdash;to examine, in particular, the transparency and efficiency of arrangements which exist for dealing with special categories of immigrant e.g. asylum seekers, refugees;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to make such recommendations as are necessary for the development of a system of treatment of immigrants which is consistent and transparent, having due regard to the commitment in respect of refugees and asylum seekers which is contained in the Programme for Government;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to make recommendations on the most feasible way of dealing with the problem of immigrants who have illegally resided in the State for considerable periods of time.</P>
    <P>The committee has already presented its report on applications for refugee status etc. and that report formed the basis for the Refugee Bill which has passed all stages in this House and is currently before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee on non-Irish nationals has almost finished its examination of the remaining issues outlined in its terms of reference.  I understand that the contribution of one of the participating Departments to the current draft of its second report is being revised at present.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated in reply to a similar question put down by the Deputy for answer on 14 March 1995 I believe that future policy changes should be informed by that report, especially since the committee held meetings with individuals and agencies with an interest in these matters.</P>
    <P>The whole area of immigration policy and practice is a complex one of importance, not only at a national level, but of mutual concern to the member states of the European Union.  Developments at this level will necessarily be reflected in any policy changes which I would undertake.</P>

Intoxicant is defined as including alcohol or drugs or both.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, empowers a member of the Garda Síochána to require a person to give a blood or urine sample, where the Garda is of the opinion that the person in charge of a vehicle is under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that there is rigorous and ongoing enforcement of road traffic law.

      <P>The Central Statistics Office has recently recruited over 3,400 part-time enumerators to carry out the fieldwork for the forthcoming Census of Population.  Employment as an enumerator is insurable and involves about 25 hours work each week.</P>
      <P>In recruiting the enumerators preference was given to persons who were not in paid employment.  The CSO agreed in advance with the Department of Social Welfare that unemployed persons appointed as enumerators would be allowed to sign on the live register for a maximum of three days a week during their 8-10 week period of employment on the census.</P>
      <P>However, the eligibility conditions for secondary benefits such as rent allowances are covered by Department of Social Welfare legislation.  Any questions relating to an individual's entitlement to benefit under these schemes is a matter for that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CSO is in the same position in relation to the statutory rules on secondary benefits as any other employer who is offering part-time short-term <Col N="1585" /> employment.  The legislative rules cannot be disregarded selectively, say in relation to the enumerator posts. Accordingly, the normal rules apply equally to all welfare recipients, including lone parents, who take up such part-time employment, irrespective of whether the employer is in the public or private sector.</P>

      <P>The Government has consistently emphasised its support <Col N="1592" /> for the principle that, wherever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families. Many additional difficulties are imposed when prisoners are required to serve their sentences far away from families and friends.</P>
      <P>Nineteen Republican prisoners have been transferred from prisons in Britain to Northern Ireland since July 1994.  We have welcomed these transfers and will continue to press for a positive approach to requests for such transfers in the future.</P>
      <P>Regarding the specific case raised by the Deputy, he will be aware that the person in question has recently been granted a temporary transfer to take effect only after the hearing of his appeal.  I understand that this is scheduled for 17 July 1996.  On my instructions, officials of the Irish Embassy in London raised this case at a meeting yesterday with the relevant British authorities. The position of those authorities is that it is the standard practice for transfers of this kind to be delayed until the hearing of any appeal is concluded. However, I understand that there has been at least one exception to this practice and I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to press for the earliest possible transfer of the person in question.</P>

      <P>I reiterate the Government's commitment to receiving all those Republican prisoners who have applied for transfer to prison in this <Col N="1593" /> jurisdiction under the terms of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
      <P>Transfer application papers for the person referred to by the Deputy were processed on our side and returned to the British authorities in early February 1996, and it was subsequently indicated that the person in question would be granted a transfer.  Following further contact yesterday between Irish Embassy officials and the British authorities, it was confirmed that the person in question has given formal consent to a transfer and I expect that this will proceed shortly.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that prisons issues remain a key element in the broader context of the peace process. They will continue to be discussed fully with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and are also raised on an ongoing basis through our Embassy in London and the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.</P>

    <P>The embassy in London is monitoring developments and has visited this person several times, the last occasion being 26 February 1996.  His solicitor has made a detailed written submission to the Home Office asking that his case be reopened, that is, referred back to the Court of Appeal.  The embassy has also raised the matter directly with the Home Office and has asked that consideration of the case be expedited.  The <Col N="1594" /> Home Office has assured the embassy that the submission will be examined as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The embassy will remain in close contact with the Home Office as well as with the person concerned and his legal representatives and will continue to give what assistance and support they can.</P>

      <P>The Government has made it clear on many occasions that we stand ready to receive into this jurisdiction the Republican prisoners who have applied for a transfer to prison here.</P>
      <P>Under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons which entered into force on 1 November 1995, a number of applications, including that of the person referred to by the Deputy, are currently being processed by the relevant authorities here and in Britain.</P>
      <P>On my instructions, the specific case mentioned by the Deputy was raised at a recent meeting of officials of the Irish Embassy in London and the relevant British authorities and I understand that a decision will be made on this case in the near future.  I hope that this application and the other applications for transfer will be brought to a positive conclusion.  The question of the medical condition of this person was also raised at this meeting.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to emphasise the importance of proceeding in a humane and constructive manner with regard to the issue of prisoners generally in the period ahead.  Sensitive handling of this matter is of crucial importance in terms of building the confidence which both Governments are agreed is necessary if we are to achieve our shared objectives.</P>

      <P>Decentralisation has made a significant, positive contribution to economic growth and employment creation in the centres which have benefited from it. About 2,800 personnel have relocated under the programme since 1987 or are in the process of doing so.  Personnel have already decentralised to the following centres; Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Cork, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Killarney, Limerick, Letterkenny, Longford, Nenagh, Sligo and Tullamore.</P>
      <P>Approximately 1,450 further personnel are due to decentralise to the remaining designated centres of Kilkenny, Waterford, Dundalk, Wexford and Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The new offices in Portlaoise will open shortly and work will get under way on projects in Kilkenny (Phase II), Waterford and Wexford during this year.</P>
      <P>The number of civil servants decentralised, the Departments and Offices involved and the locations to which they have moved are set out in the table attached.</P>

      <P>According to vehicle registrations statistics, 62,057 pre-owned motor vehicles were imported into Ireland in 1995, of which 44,591 were cars.</P>
      <P>As to the impact of these pre-owned imports on the motor industry, I would point out such imports are actually part of the motor industry, at least to the extent that they are brought into Ireland by motor dealers; 1995 was a buoyant year for the Irish motor industry.  Pre-owned car registrations rose by 8.1 per cent in 1995; the rise in new car registrations was broadly similar, at 8.5 per cent, with 87,204 units being registered. The number of new car registrations in 1995 was therefore almost double that of pre-owned car registrations.  The introduction from 1 July 1995 of the £1,000 car scrappage scheme was associated with a significant number of new car sales last year, and was widely welcomed by the motor industry and by the motoring public.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 12 March 1996, in response to questions by the Deputy and others, the operation in question was primarily a matter for the Garda and is.  I understand, the subject of ongoing investigation by them.  In the light of this I have nothing further to add to what I said about the operation in the House on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied, following an investigation they have made, that media reports with regard to a leak by customs about the operation are without foundation.  This was made clear by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee on 7 March. The Chairman of the Commissioners has also informed me that he had been assured by the Secretary of the Department of Justice that the Garda Commissioner has no information that would <Col N="1599" /> support an allegation that any leak came from customs.  I am satisfied that any leak that may have occured did not emanate from customs and I am pleased to have this opportunity to make it clear that there is no basis for the allegations in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 115, 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to investigate as far as possible all information received from whatever source concerning any tax, duty or prohibition.  The Revenue Commissioners have made it clear that they do not seek out or induce people to give information, nor do they simply accept at face value any information received. Revenue officials have wide experience in sifting and evaluating information received from many different sources, including information received from members of the public.  It is sometimes the case that information received from the public is in fact already known to Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information from the public, whether given in person, by telephone or in writing is often &ldquo;hearsay&rdquo; in the legal sense <Col N="1601" /> and, as such, has limited evidential value, Revenue officials are conscious of this limitation.  Consequently, care is taken to analyse all information in order to assess the quality of the information before any follow-up action is taken.</P>
    <P>Information received from members of the public is just one of several factors taken into account in deciding whether or not to initiate an audit or investigation.  It is therefore not possible to state how many persons were found to be non-compliant solely on the basis of information received from members of the public.</P>
    <P>There is of course a potential for a mischievous informant to attempt to misuse any regulatory authority for the purpose mentioned by the Deputy.  For this reason, Revenue assure me that it has systems in place to ensure that all information is carefully evaluated, and if possible, validated before any follow up action is taken.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of informants and amounts paid, 26 payments were made in 1994 at a total of just over £24,000 and 27 payments were made in 1995 totalling just under £23,000.  In the great majority of cases, the individual payments did not exceed £500.  The largest individual payment was £11,000 in 1995.  The question of a payment is considered only when there is a recovery of the tax or duty involved or prohibited items are seized.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Independent Hospital Association of Ireland (IHAI) negotiates centrally for its members with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in relation to arrangements for payment in respect of the care and treatment of VHI members.  The central negotiations which took place in respect of payment arrangements between the parties for this year did not achieve a mutually satisfactory conclusion and resulted in a dispute between the parties. Furthermore, with the exception of one major acute hospital, efforts by the VHI to have direct negotiations with a view to reaching agreement with individual hospitals did not succeed.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to intervene in this dispute as it would not be appropriate for me to do so in view of my role as the regulatory authority for the health insurance market.  Financial arrangements between any health insurers and service providers are matters to be directly negotiated between the parties. I cannot, for example, attempt to bring about a solution which would lessen the financial exposure of the dominant insurer in the market, neither can I increase the return to private hospitals which could affect future competition. However, recently, in reply to a question in the House I called on the parties to try to resolve their differences and I would again urge them to do so without delay.  I concur with the sentiment expressed in the Deputy's question that this dispute must be a cause of concern to people who are proposing to stay to people who are proposing to stay, and receive treatment, in any of the 18 private hospitals involved in the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that private hospitals which are not members of the <Col N="1605" /> Association and public voluntary hospitals are not involved in the dispute. Private and semi-private accommodation in health board hospitals is also unaffected.  The VHI's arrangements for the payout of professional fees remain unchanged, regardless of the hospital in which the member receives treatment.  It is reasonable to assume that the prolonging of the dispute would have some impact on demand in the public-voluntary hospital sector but it remains to be seen to what, if any, significant extent this would occur.  Any such impact would be a management issue for the hospitals concerned.</P>

      <P>Where a child has been baptised in the Roman Catholic Church prior to the making of an adoption order, the Adoption Board notifies the Catholic diocese in which the adopters live in order that details of the adoption relating to the baptismal record can be entered in the special register maintained by each diocese for this purpose.  This arrangement ensures that adoptive parents are able to obtain a new baptismal certificate for the adopted child in their own names. Adopters and adopted persons are not allowed sight of the baptimal entry in the special register to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the case of the other Christian denominations the need for notification does not arise because it is the practice to delay the baptism until the adoption has been finalised, at which stage the child is then baptised in the name of the adopters.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment procedures are also a matter for the chief executive officers and they have agreed on a number of standardised procedures to ensure uniformity and consistency in all areas when the income of a medical card applicant is being assessed.  Persons aged 16 to 25 who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders.  Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement <Col N="1608" /> under EU Regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Persons aged 16 to 25 who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants.  The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependent or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of orthodontic treatment services in the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow region is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that the number of children who commenced orthodontic treatment in each of the last five years was as follows: 1991, 588; 1992, 474; 1993, 606; 1994, 803; 1995, 1,015.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and the Eastern <Col N="1609" /> Health Board have agreed a framework for the development of orthodontic services in the region.  This agreed framework provides for the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The recruitment of two consultant orthodontists with appropriate dental support staff.  The consultant posts were advertised by the Local Appointments Commission and the board expects that one of these posts will be filled inthe near future.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The recruitment of eight orthodontists to be based in community care areas.  During 1995 the Eastern Health Board increased the number employed by the board from two to five whole time orthodontists. Pending the employment of the full eight orthodontists the board purchases additional sessions from seven private orthodontists equivalent to two full-time orthodontists.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision of hospital based units for the consultant orthodontists at St. James's and Beaumont Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The board has experienced difficulty in recruiting trained orthodontic staff because it has to compete with the high level of income which orthodontists can generate in private practice.  To minimise the effect of this the board has arranged orthodontic training at the Dublin dental hospital for its own staff.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1988, provides for the adoption, in exceptional cases, of children whether born inside or outside marriage whose parents are deemed by the courts to have failed in their constitutional duty to care for their children.  Part of the procedure under the Act involves an application to the High Court for an order authorising the adoption of the child concerned.  I have no plans to amend the provisions of the 1988 Act and I am not aware of any Irish cases before the European Court of Human Rights in relation to this matter.</P>

        <i>Limerick-East</i>): The Western Health Board, having considered legal advice from senior counsel, decided on 11 March 1996 to publish only the general recommendations of the report of the inquiry team into the Kelly Fitzgerald case.  They also decided to refer the recommendations to the Community Care Committee and the Child Care Advisory Committee of the board and endorsed the decision of the chief executive officer to send a copy of the report to the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>It was my intention that the report, subject to legal advice, would be put into the public domain.  The legal advice available to me confirms the difficulties associated with publication of the report.  The Government considers it appropriate, however, in view of the public concern about the important issues addressed in the report that an Oireachtas committee should consider the report as regards the legislative implications of its recommendations.  I have referred the report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Family to facilitate consideration by the committee of policy developments and legislative changes which it might consider appropriate to support the family, especially with regard to child care, in the light of the report.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to make a resource teacher post available to the school in question.  The role of the resource teacher is to support ordinary teaching staff in dealing with the special needs of children with disabilities who are fully integrated into ordinary primary schools.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is a special school.  The particular staffing needs of all such schools are recognised through the reduced pupil teacher ratios which apply in such cases.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the school in question has brought its particular difficulty to the attention of my Department.  This matter is currently being considered and the school will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The current position on the application for a school hall in the case referred to by the Deputy is that due to the current level of contractual commitments on the primary school building programme it is not possible to provide grant-aid for this facility at this time.  I am not in a position to state when funds will be available.</P>

    <P>Information on the number of children currently in receipt of a visiting teacher service and the number of schools involved is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  I should point out that in addition to the visiting teacher service, children with disabilities attending ordinary national schools may also receive support from the resource teacher service. A total of 38 resource teachers are currently in place.  The role of the resource teacher is to provide support to ordinary teaching staff in dealing with children with disabilities, including Down's Syndrome, attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis.</P>
    <P>The resource teacher model would be used where a significant number of children with disabilities are identified in one school or in a group of adjacent schools.  I am keeping the question of need in these areas under ongoing review in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend the early start pre-school programme to the school mentioned by the Deputy.  The early start <Col N="1638" /> pre-school programme is currently focused on schools serving areas which have been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  The programme has been expanded in the current school year and a total of 40 primary schools now have a pre-school project.  I have also established an expert monitoring committee to advise me on the operation and future development of the early start pre-school programme.  This committee is representative of a wide range of interests involved in the provision of pre-school services.  The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the event of any further development of the programme being undertaken.</P>

      <P>The teacher to whom the Deputy refers trained as a primary teacher abroad.  Teachers trained abroad are not automatically recognised to teach in primary schools in the Republic of Ireland.  This is because Irish primary teachers are class teachers as distinct from individual subject teachers.  They must be qualified to teach all aspects of the curriculum, of which Irish is an integral element.  There is, therefore, a requirement that all teachers seeking full recognition as primary teachers in this country must achieve a standard and competence in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>This standard can be achieved by undergoing and passing the Irish qualification examination entitled &ldquo;An Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Gaeilge&rdquo;, both written and oral, or its equivalent both written and oral.  People who hold a recognised BA degree in Irish may be entitled to an exemption from part II of this examiniation.  I understand that the teacher in question has been so exempted.  I indicated some months ago that I proposed to allow teachers trained in Northern Ireland and the European Union to teach for a period of up to two years at a salary rate appropriate to a trained teacher.  The full details of these arrangements will be notified to schools after Easter.  This teacher will be covered by the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am aware of considerable concern expressed by parents about the possible detrimental effect on children of carrying heavy school bags. The only study that I am aware of is one which was conducted by the National Parents Council (Primary) in 1989.</P>
      <P>Medical opinion had not been sought in relation to this matter nor am I aware of a recommended maximum weight. The study by the National Prices Commission (P) echoes my own views that optimum solutions to this problem are most likely to be achieved at school level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers and parents working in partnership at the level of each individual school can make suitable practical arrangements for schoolwork and homework.  These involve time-tabling and advance planning by teachers so <Col N="1641" /> that pupils know in advance what books are required on any particular day. Arrangements for storing books in schools where this is possible can also be helpful.</P>
    <P>Parents can ensure that schoolbags themselves do not add to the problem by being excessively heavy and by ensuring that pupils do not carry unnecessary material in their school bags.  In the case of primary schools the advisory committee on textbooks and materials which I established, has been requested to take these concerns into account when new guidelines are being prepared for publishers.  New guidelines will be required to cover any textbooks published as a result of the impending revision of the primary curriculum.</P>

      <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme was expended in 1994.  The school referred to by the Deputy was included in the expanded scheme and as such, it receives additional capitation funding.  Concessionary teaching posts previously associated with disadvantaged status were not available to the scheme on that occasion.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently considering the findings of the recent reports on disadvantage as part of the process of developing a revised approach to the selection and support of pupils with educational disadvantage.  The needs of this school will be considered in the context of any future expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 1994 was 89 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and two assistants in the current school year.  The third assistant's post at the school was suppressed in June 1995.</P>
      <P>By reference to the existing staffing schedule, an enrolment of 94 pupils would have been required at the school in September 1995 in order to reappoint the third assistant for the 1996-97 school year.

      <P>It is the policy of my Department's planning and building <Col N="1648" /> unit to incorporate PE facilities and changing areas into the schedule of accommodation for new schools or for major extensions to schools where previously there was no such accommodation or unsatisfactory existing facilities. The most recent PE hall provided to a school with financial assistance from my Department is the newly constructed community school in Kinsale due for completion this month.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision has been made for the architectural planning of 12 PE halls in the 1996 capital programme at post-primary schools which do not already have PE halls with a view to commencing construction on three of these projects during the course of the year.  The question of providing PE facilities can only be considered in the context of capital available for post primary building purposes generally.</P>
      <P>Provision of PE facilities where these are not being planned at present will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for classroom accommodation has eased.  My Department also administers a sports capital programme.  In general, school projects are not eligible for funding under either the major sports capital programme or the recreation facilities scheme.  However, a limited number of school sports facilities have been assisted under the schemes where the project is being undertaken by a local community group in co-operation with a school.  One of the conditions attaching to the scheme is that the completed facility must be available to all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>In relation to the possibility of alternative funding outside of my Department, this is a matter for the school authorities to pursue.</P>

      <P>I assume that the special status recognition to which the Deputy refers relates to the grant of disadvantaged area status.  I am not in a position at present to extend disadvantaged area status or to allocate a remedial teacher post to the schools in question.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing its approach to the selection and support of pupils suffering educational disadvantage.  I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.  The needs of the schools in question will be considered in the context of any future development of the disadvantaged areas scheme which may be undertaken.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the schools referred to by the Deputy will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>I understand that the information requested by the Deputy was intended to relate to both St. Gabriel's boys and girls national schools, Oxmantown Road.</P>
      <P>The number of children enrolled in the boys school at 30 September 1995 was 81.  A total of 100 pupils were enrolled in the girls school on the same date.  In addition to their normal teacher allocations, each of these schools has the service of a full-time remedial teacher.  Both schools are also included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and as such each has the services of an over-quota concessionary teacher post.</P>
      <P>Also, by virtue of their disadvantaged status, both schools receive special supplementary capitation funding.  The funding in question is being increased to £30 per pupil with effect from September next.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Education sets out that the primary focus of regional technical colleges will be to provide non-degree level programmes and a limited level of degree provision.  It states that the degree provision should take account of student, economic and social needs, as well as the academic capability of individual institutions to provide degree level programmes. The programmes should reflect an appropriately balanced output of graduates from certificate, diploma and degree programmes, with reference to the occupational and skill needs of the economy.</P>
      <P>The Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education recommends that, as a guideline across the regional technical college sector as a whole, programme planning should be on the basis that not more than 20 per cent of those completing would do so at degree level.</P>
      <P>The provision of courses in the regional technical college sector is initially a matter for the college authorities. However, any proposal to upgrade certificate or diploma courses to degree status would have to be examined in my Department in the context of the foregoing recommendations as well as the implications for additional resources.</P>

      <P>I understand the number of pupils seeking places in St. Declan's for next September is in excess of the number the school can accommodate.  I have recently approved the provision of extra accommodation to meet increasing demands on pupil places in the school.  This consists of a permanent extension of seven general classrooms, one commerce business room and a remedial room and this extension is presently at the architectural planning stage.</P>
      <P>In addition to the schools traditionally catering for pupils in this general area, new post primary schools opened in Hartstown in 1992, Dunboyne in 1994 and in Diswellstown last September.</P>

      <Col N="1660" /> One of the principal recommendations in the report related to the abolition of covenant relief.  I have already announced the diversion of tax savings from the withdrawal of covenant relief to fund the major policy decision to abolish third level undergraduate fees.</P>
    <P>I have also implemented a number of other measures in response to the recommendations in the report.  These include: the abolition of the separate academic attainments for eligibility for a grant; the introduction of new rules for second chance cases; the provision of funding to assist students in college who are disabled or suffering financial hardship and the simplification and earlier issue of the student support schemes to facilitate students with their grant applications.</P>
    <P>In response to other recommendations in the report the initiatives of allowing income tax relief on fees paid to private commercial colleges and extending maintenance grants to students studying abroad are being introduced with effect from the academic year 1996/97.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in A Government of Renewal and taking account of the recommendations in the report, I shall pursue the implementation of further recommendations as resources permit.

The question, therefore, of appointing a Minister as ex-officio member of a sub-committee when it is dealing with business not covered under paragraph 1 of the standing orders does not arise.

      <P>The ratio of gardaí to citizens in the State compared to other EU countries, most of which are also members of the OECD, is set out as follows for 1993, the latest year for which figures are available.</P>
      <P>In looking at comparisons of this kind, one has to ensure that one is comparing like with like.  In some of the other jurisdictions listed, a much higher proportion of civilians are employed in the police service than is the case here and some of these civilians are engaged on duties that would be regarded here as police rather than civilian duties.  It is also the case that some of the countries listed have much higher crime levels than we do.  It would be quite wrong, in other words, to conclude that this country is either under or over resourced in policing terms by reference to these figures.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have confirmed that failure to obey road traffic signs by drivers can result in accidents in certain cases.  Breaches of the general by-laws, local traffic and parking by-laws and speed limit regulations are examples of such offences.</P>
      <P>There are, however, no statistics available for the number of accidents which have occurred in such circumstances. The information could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, complementary to the ongoing strict and sustained enforcement of the road traffic laws, there are special road safety campaigns conducted throughout the year encouraging motorists to exercise greater care and stay within the law.</P>

    <P>*I should point out that prior to 1989 Garda recruits were included in the overall strength figures.  Since April 1989, with the introduction of the two year training programme for recruits, only those members who have been attested to the Force i.e. completed phase three of training, are included in the overall strength of the Force. There were 455 recruits in phases one, two and three of training on 31 December 1995.  These recruits are not included in the ratio calculations.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The police to population ratio in 1965 was 1:430 compared to 1:326 in 1995. These figures are based on the population census for 1961 and 1991.</P>

      <P>There is no specific offence of &lsquo;kerb crawling&rsquo;.  Under section 8 (1) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, a member of the Garda Síochána who has reasonable cause to suspect that a person is loitering &mdash; including loitering in a motor vehicle &mdash; in a street or public place in order to solicit or importune another person or other persons for the purposes of prostitution may direct that person to leave immediately that street or public place.

      <P>The number and rank of members currently serving on UN missions outside the State is set out in the table following as are the details requested in respect of previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> The first Garda contingent was deployed on UN duty in April 1989. Since that first mission approximately 330 members of the Garda Síochána have served with various UN missions throughout the world.  The duration of the contracts depends on the mission but usually lasts for one year.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that approximately 500 members apply annually for overseas duty.  The United Nations pay the deployment cost of the contingent to the mission area and repatriation costs on completion of the tour of duty.  They also pay an allowance to members in respect of food and accommodation.  The State provides suitable equipment and continues to pay the salary costs of the contingent and an overseas allowance which can vary from £11.57 to £18.73 per day.  One paid journey home during the term of the mission may also be borne by the State depending on the duration and nature of the mission.</P>
    <P>The reputation of the Garda Síochána and Ireland has been greatly enhanced by the contribution made by gardaí to <Col N="1672" /> these missions.  Tributes and commendations not only from the UN but also from the local communities where they have been based testify to this.  It was because of this high reputation that Chief Superintendent M. Murphy was appointed by the UN as commissioner of the UN civilian police component in Somalia in April 1994 and Assistant Commissioner P. Fitzgerald, was appointed recently as commissioner of the UN International Police Task Force in Bosnia and Hercegovina.  The members of the contingents themselves have gained valuable experience in working abroad and also by contact with police contingents of other nationalities, but we should not, at the same time, play down the very important role which has been played by this country, through the Garda Síochána, in assisting the UN in establishing-maintaining democracy throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I would finally like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the force who have participated in or are currently abroad on UN missions and have brought distinction to this State in the discharge of their duties abroad.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a freephone service to the public from time to time for specific purposes.  A recent example was the provision of a Social Welfare Budget Information Freephone service, which was available for two weeks from 19 January to facilitate people inquiring about changes to social welfare schemes.  A freephone facility is currently being provided to enable people or organisations contact the Commission on the Family, which is sponsored by my Department.</P>
      <P>The provision of a general freephone service for all calls to the Department would be expensive.</P>
      <P>The Department already makes extensive use of telephone facilities provided by the Government Telecommunications Network (GTN).  For instance, persons wishing to contact one of the decentralised offices of the Department at Longford, Sligo or Letterkenny can do so by either calling those offices directly or if it is cheaper to do so, by calling the Department's main number in Dublin and having the call relayed without additional costs.</P>

      <P>Class D is a modified rate of PRSI payable by public sector workers employed in a permanent and pensionable capacity and whose employment commenced prior to 6 April 1995. People insured at this modified rate are covered for widow's or widower's contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance, deserted wife's benefit and occupational injuries benefits.</P>
      <P>The rate of PRSI is determined by the nature of the employment concerned and an employee who is compulsorily insured at a modified rate cannot opt to pay a higher rate to acquire additional benefit or pension entitlements.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> However, class A contributions paid in respect of any other employments a person may have had before or after their period of public sector employment can be combined with the modified class D rate for the purposes of mixed-insurance pro-rata pensions.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that people entering public sector employment since 6 April 1995 are insured at the full class A rate of PRSI which covers all benefits and pensions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment (CE) is designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed persons, whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or lone parent's allowance.  In addition other special categories who have been identified as having severe difficulties in obtaining mainstream employment such as those referred by the National Rehabilitation Board can also participate.  From 15 April 1996 married unemployed persons <Col N="1684" /> will be allowed to swop their social welfare entitlements in order to qualify for participation on the programme.</P>
    <P>As such those signing for credits are not an eligible category for participation on the programme.  Given present resource constraints I have no plans to make any further changes to the eligibility criteria as to do so would be at the expense of those currently eligible.</P>

      <P>It is currently the practice of a number of CEBs to make it a requirement that small firms in receipt of employment grants recruit unemployed persons from the live register. I would also endorse the recommendation of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment that CEBs would exercise their discretion to apply a higher rate of grant where the long-term unemployed are taken on by new or expanding firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 following representations to the Minister for Finance, I secured the removal of some restrictions to access by recipients of the Department of Social Welfare back-to-work allowance to CEB employment grants.  The restrictions were based on concerns about double-funding from Exchequer sources.  Under the revised arrangements, boards are now in a position to offer employment grants to project promoters who have been unemployed themselves and are &lsquo;own account&rsquo; operators and who are also in receipt of the back-to-work allowance, or the area <Col N="1686" /> enterprise allowance from an area-based partnership company.  Of course, the prohibition remains on the payment of a CEB employment grant to a back-to-work allowance recipient, other than in the circumstances outlined above.  It should be noted that persons setting up in self employment who have previously been unemployed may also apply to boards for capital grant assistance in lieu of employment grants.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned if regulations designed to avoid deadweight and inappropriate access to multiple sources of Exchequer support can be found to have an adverse impact on opportunities for participation by the long-term unemployed in the new jobs resulting from county enterprise board activity.</P>

      <P>The grant-aiding of forested lands is administered by my Department under the Forestry Act, 1946 which Act also controls the felling of trees.  Planting grants are paid subject to certain silvicultural environmental and eligibility conditions.  The main planting scheme at present administered by my Department is the CAP afforestation grant scheme under Council Regulation 2080/92.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation with other State agencies as regards listed sensitive environmental areas and application of this Department's guidelines on forestry development in relation to the landscape, archaeology and fisheries are conditions of grant aid.  Environmental impact assessment controls on forestry development, which apply above certain thresholds, arise under the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 349/89).  In addition, certain areas listed <Col N="1687" /> under the EU Directives on the Protection of Wild Birds (No. 79/409) and on the Protection of Natural Habitats (No. 92/43) are ineligible for grant aid as a condition of EU approval of the CAP afforestation scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will immediately waive the compliant/retention date for all sheep premia and others from 1 April 1996 instead of 18 April 1996, in order to ensure that the demand for meat products in Ireland is fully met from our own domestic market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under EU Regulation 2700/93, it is a condition of qualification for the ewe premium payments that eligible animals are maintained in designated holdings for a period of 100 days.  The dates of this period must be communicated to Brussels in advance.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the retention period commenced on 9 January and therefore will not be completed until 18 April.</P>
      <P>To waive this requirement it would be necessary to secure the agreement of the EU Commission and member states to an amendment of the EU Regulations. Such agreement is unlikely to be secured except in the most serious of circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that domestic demand for meat products cannot be fully met from available resources and therefore the measure which has been suggested is neither feasible nor necessary.</P>

      <P>The current review of disadvantaged areas was initiated by the appointment of the disadvantaged areas appeals panel in 1991.</P>
      <P>The panel requested submissions from individuals and groups who wished to have their areas considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas.  A survey of all areas for which appeals were received was carried out in 1992, and the panel made recommendations on the basis of data returned by farmers who were surveyed.  These recommendations were forwarded to the EU Commission in November 1993.</P>
      <P>A total of 309 appeals were received in respect of areas in Cork.  These involved about 8,800 holdings covering some 226,000 hectares.  All of the areas appealed were examined by the appeals panel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272, 273 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>In proposing the renewal of the six prospecting licences in question I have taken into account a number of factors, including the fact that neither I nor my Department have received any complaints about the activities of the two companies which hold the licences in joint venture since the licences were first issued in 1986, the two companies have complied with all technical and financial targets which were required of them and in fact exceeded them, and the investment that these companies have already made in exploration over these licence areas.  I also ensured that the companies had in place adequate insurance cover to meet any legitimate claims which might be made as a result of their actions in carrying out their approved exploration programme.  In this latter context I might mention that the minimum insurance cover normally now required by me for exploration activities is £1 million.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the failure of my Department to renew these licences in the absence of sound technical reasons could not be defended and would leave me, as Minister, open to the possibility of legal action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be stressed that the unrestricted or unregulated development of our mineral resources will not be condoned by me, my colleagues in Government or my Department.  In granting or renewing prospecting licences my Department issues guidelines for good environmental practice in mineral exploration which require that, in addition to compliance with laws and regulations for the protection of the environment, best contemporary practice in environmental management standards be maintained, environmental consequences of the particular exploration programme in each location be considered and planned for, that there be full consideration for and liaison with relevant landowners and regulatory <Col N="1699" /> authorities and that any damage to vegetation, land surface or landowner property which may occur be minimised and corrected without undue delay.</P>
    <P>Where disturbance of land or farming activity is expected there should be agreement with the farmer or landowner beforehand and if the damage exceeds that which has been agreed and compensation cannot be agreed in respect of the additional disturbance, I recommend the use of Teagasc or another mutually agreed arbitrator.  I am not aware that there has been any recourse to the use of an arbitrator in the past, certainly not in recent years.</P>
    <P>Licence holders are also advised of the necessity to ascertain the location of national nature reserves, national monuments, areas of scientific interest, gas pipelines, etc.  I have given an outline of what the guidelines contain but I think the Deputy will accept from the above that the document issued by my Department deals with this issue in a comprehensive way.  I have arranged for a copy of the guidelines to issue to him.</P>
    <P>I might also add that my Department advises the National Forest and Wildlife Service of all prospecting licences granted or renewed and supplies that service with a copy of the map of the prospecting licence area in each case to assist that service in identifying any areas of which my Department is not aware and giving an opportunity for the licensee to be notified before work on the ground commences.</P>
    <P>While the licence holder has rights of entry onto land this is tempered by the obligation to ensure that no undue interference is caused to the farm activities. It would not, for example, be appropriate for exploration activities to take place in a field in which crops had been planted unless there was a compensation agreement with the farmer or until after harvesting.  There is also the obligation on the licence holder to ensure that there is prior consultation with the farmer or landowner and, as I have indicated already, to ensure that <Col N="1700" /> there is prior agreement for compensation to be paid in respect of damage or disruption which might be expected to be caused.  There are also the protective rights enshrined in the environmental guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>I should stress that exploration activity, when carried out in accordance with the law and guidelines issued by my Department, rarely, if ever, results in any meaningful adverse effects on the environment.</P>
    <P>If commercial quantities of minerals are discovered the licence holders will obviously seek a State mining facility from me.  In order to get one they would first have to obtain planning permission from the local authority and a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is at that stage that it is appropriate to consider any objections which might be put forward to mining any particular mineral deposit.  Mineral deposits can only be mined where they are found.</P>
    <P>I can also advise the Deputy and the House that our current mining environmental standards are rightly regarded as being among the strictest in the world and it is my intention that they should remain so.</P>

      <P>The issue of a commemorative medal to mark the 50th anniversary of the formation of the FCÁ has been considered in detail.  However, I understand that no official medal was issued to mark the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Defence Forces or any anniversary of the Army, Naval Service or Air Corps and, therefore, it is not intended to issue an official medal to mark the 50th anniversary of the FCÁ.</P>
      <P>A list of events has been drawn up by the military authorities to commemorate the anniversary in 1996 and are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)The holding of regional parades to include the presentation of service medals and religious services.</P>

      <P>An 1850 telephone service (i.e. calls charged at local rates only) is provided by my Department to give assistance and information in connection with marine safety matters.  I think that this <Col N="1709" /> has been of benefit to the Department's clients and has helped to raise safety awareness.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that an interdepartmental expert group, chaired by the Department of Finance, is considering the general issues raised by him.  The expert group is expected to report in the near future.  Once the report is available Ministers will be better placed to consider these issues.</P>
