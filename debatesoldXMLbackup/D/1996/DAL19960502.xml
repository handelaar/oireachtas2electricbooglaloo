      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business today, I feel sure that Members would want very much to join with me in extending a warm welcome to a parliamentary delegation from Slovenia led by its Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zoran Thaler.  We express the hope that their visit to Ireland will be most happy and successful and I extend to them, on behalf of myself and my colleagues in Dáil Éireann, a hearty céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes to the seat of the Irish Parliament.</P>

Furthermore, we are anxious to continue the process of social partnership across a range of Government activities in the period following the expiry of the present programme. That continues to be a preoccupation of mine and the <Col N="2027" /> Government and discussions are ongoing to that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have replied extensively to previous questions on this matter, including reference to the importance of the policy questions involved in the legislation.  As the Deputy is well aware, the original purpose of the legislation was to address the outcome of the Keegan case which is an entirely separate matter from the one which the Deputy wishes to see included, and which the Government would hope to include, in the legislation.  That matter is <Col N="2032" /> being examined at present.  As I outlined at some length yesterday in response to the Deputy, it is important and prudent to take account of the court decisions in these matters so that there is the maximum degree of consistency between the court's interpretation of constitutional rights and the statutes passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the payment of temporary financial assistance to the Irish rendering industry to ensure the continuation of its operations until 21 May, 1996.</P>
      <P>As Members are aware, in accordance with the principles of Government accounting, legal authority for a new service, in the form of Dáil approval, must be obtained before any expenditure is incurred.  I have, therefore, come before the House at the earliest possible opportunity to move a motion in respect of a new service to provide temporary financial assistance to the rendering industry.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall the stark situation which livestock producers, slaughterhouses and renderers faced immediately before Easter.  Commercial outlets, either domestic or external, were not available for the meat and bonemeal being produced by the rendering industry. In the absence of alternatives and any form of cash flow from the sale of meat and bonemeal the rendering industry would have been forced to close its doors after Easter.  It was announced that as and from Easter Tuesday it would not take any more offal for rendering.  This would have resulted in the closure of all abattoirs, slaughterhouses and meat processing premises as national hygiene rules dictate that raw offal cannot be allowed to build up in such premises.  I contrast this with the current situation.  Last week 39,000 animals were slaughtered, a record for any one week in the last ten years in the meat processing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the Federation of Irish Renderers and agreed to provide a breathing space for that industry to enable it to continue to accept offal and maintain its activities on behalf of all sectors of the livestock industry.  The details of the <Col N="2034" /> scheme are as follows: it will run for a period of six weeks from 10 April to 21 May, inclusive; a fixed storage amount of £1.50 per tonne per week is payable in respect of stocks produced before 10 April, the maximum eligible amount is 10,000 tonnes &mdash; I was told at the time that there were stockpiles at this level for which there was no market; a fixed production amount of £150 is payable per verifiable tonne of meat and bonemeal produced in the period between 10 April and 21 May &mdash; this production assistance is limited to a maximum figure of 15,000 tonnes and this tonnage will also be eligible for storage assistance; in the event of any future disposal of meat and bonemeal produced in the six week period, any amounts received by the renderers up to £150 per tonne will be refunded to my Department; the maximum cost to the Exchequer of the scheme over the six week period should not exceed £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>I stress particularly the temporary nature of the scheme.  I do not want to leave anybody in any doubt about that. The general taxpayer should not be expected to continue to pick up the financial costs of arrangements for collection, treatment and disposal of offal. Clearly, these costs are a matter for discussion and agreement between the commercial parties directly involved as part of normal commercial business. What I have done is to make the services of my Department available as facilitator to those parties by establishing a framework for discussion.  I have assigned an assistant secretary to chair meetings.  Two such meetings have been held and further discussions are scheduled. I urge the various interests to make the best use of the opportunity presented and have a resolution in place by 21 May.  The scheme will not run beyond that date.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to anticipate the outcome, in the prevailing circumstances, if the fifth quarter, as it is commonly known, has diminished in value or certain offals have a nil value, that should be reflected commercially between renderers, meat processors and <Col N="2035" /> producers.  The two segments of the industry are linked and have close commercial contacts and it should not be an impossibility for them to resolve the matter between them, especially when a framework for discussion has been established.  Whatever system is introduced it will not involve any statutory levies.</P>
    <P>Commercial outlets for meat and bonemeal are restricted, but the rendering industry is a commercial sector producing a quality feeding stuff for commercial disposal.  It withstood serious difficulties in 1990 and went on to develop export markets for its product. It has also embarked on a programme of modernisation to ensure full compliance with new EU directives.  The disposal of livestock offal in the first instance can be considered an environmental issue.  I see the destruction of meat and bonemeal as a last option and know that this view is shared by the different elements of the livestock industry.  However, technical consideration is being given by a number of Departments and agencies to various non-commercial uses for meat and bonemeal in the event that such a situation has to be dealt with.  I am determined that we should be in a position to deal with all eventualities, including incineration or land disposal.</P>
    <P>It is also important to clarify the legal position as regards meat and bonemeal. There has been a prohibition on the feeding of ruminant meat and bonemeal to ruminants since 1990 in this country and, more recently, across the European Union.  In the United Kingdom, as part of the measures taken on 20 March, a ban on the use of mammalian meat and bonemeal in feed for all farm animals, including pigs and poultry, was introduced. The UK authorities have explained this was for control reasons rather than scientific considerations. This measure has not been adopted by the European Union nor are individual member states, including Ireland, being encouraged to take unilateral actions.  In those circumstances the United <Col N="2036" /> Kingdom is the only member state with such a broad based ban.  Our inquiries indicate that the rendering industries in continental member states are continuing to produce meat and bonemeal for the pigs and poultry sectors.</P>
    <P>Scientific discussions at which my Department is represented are ongoing through the EU Scientific Veterinary Committee on the various processes recognised as giving the best possible guarantees as regards killing BSE and sheep scrapie.  We are making every possible effort to encourage clear-cut scientific guidelines to produce the framework for the continued commercial use of meat and bonemeal by non-ruminants, subject to production at the correct temperatures and in approved and validated premises.  This will provide the basis for the continued commercial use of meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>On the general BSE issue, it is clear that further work needs to be done to defuse the situation in the United Kingdom.  The discussion at the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg this week represented a step forward, but the widely held view is that further amendments to the UK controls are needed to provide the required reassurances for member states.  It is also clear that recovery in beef consumption will be slow and much effort will be required to restore consumer confidence.  In that context the domestic market has fared better than most and some EU markets are showing small signs of recovery.</P>
    <P>The flexible intervention arrangements have been critical in removing the backlog of fat cattle.  Last week's kill was the highest in over a decade.  I have also secured an undertaking that the Commission will review the situation before the next Council in the context of income losses suffered by producers. A further 50,000 tonnes will be placed in intervention this month.  Up to 70 per cent of Irish cattle will be eligible.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to secure the reopening of markets continue.  I will travel to Libya in the middle of this month in relation to the live trade and an Iranian veterinary delegation is scheduled to come <Col N="2037" /> here soon after an exchange of veterinary letters at the highest level.  Every conceivable effort is being made to get these markets reopened.  I am in constant touch with ambassadors, both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The subsidy for the rendering industry is an important element of our strategy to deal with the crisis.  It has already proved its value in allowing the industry to continue to function normally at a very sensitive time.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House and thank it for facilitating me at short notice.  I understand the motion is not being opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion seeks Dáil approval to implement a memorandum of understanding signed by the Federation of Irish Renderers and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on 10 April.  By passing and approving this memorandum of understanding we will enable payment to be made on foot of the provisions of the temporary financial package drawn up in the memorandum of understanding to ensure that the rendering industry will continue to process raw offal despite the collapse in the market for meat and bonemeal.</P>
      <P>Since 20 March, when the British Government announced in the House of Commons that there may be a connection between BSE infected cattle and a new strain of CJD, consumer confidence in the meat industry has collapsed throughout Europe and further afield. That collapse of confidence has been exacerbated by the bad handling of the affair by the British Government.  This has had a huge negative effect on the beef industry in every country of the European Union.  It extends to those involved in the food business who render the offal which accumulates in the beef processing factories throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Renderers produce important products such as tallow, meat and bonemeal from the raw material intake.  These rendering companies handle offal, bone, fat, blood etc. from animals slaughtered at export and other slaughterhouse <Col N="2038" /> premises in the Republic.  Based on An Bord Bia statistics, average slaughterings over the five year period 1990-94 were 1,612,000 cattle; 4,323,000 sheep and 2,966,000 pigs per year.  These slaughterings in the Republic result in raw material from export and other slaughterhouse processing factories totalling 235,000 tonnes from cattle, 50,000 tonnes from sheep and 58,000 tonnes from pigs.</P>
    <P>In addition to these raw materials renderers also process waste materials from butcher shops, knackers' yards, agents and collectors and fallen animals. On average over the last five years raw materials from these sources amounted to 80,000 tonnes per year.  This means that the total annual processing of raw materials at rendering plants over the five year period 1990-94 was 423,000 tonnes.  About 12 per cent of this raw material is rendered down to tallow which is basically the oil in the raw material used for soap, candles, ingredients in cosmetics and so on.  A further 28 per cent of material is rendered down to meat and bonemeal and the remainder of the raw material, 60 per cent, is water.</P>
    <P>When BSE was discovered in cattle it was decided at European level, at the instigation of the then Minister for Agriculture, Michael O'Kennedy, to ban the use of meat and bonemeal as feed for cattle and other ruminants.  Meat and bonemeal, however, continue to be an important part of the feed for pigs and poultry, constituting 8 per cent of their feed intake.  Following the announcement on 20 March the UK banned the use of bonemeal for all animals.  In this country, meat and poultry producers decided voluntarily to stop using bonemeal in their feed even though it was not suggested that there was a problem with the feed of meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry and no evidence of BSE in those animals.  They are at present replacing meat and bonemeal with a high protein soya feed and the difference in price between it and the meat and bonemeal is £40 per tonne. <Col N="2039" /> However, there is a shortage of soya in the market, particularly in the production areas in Asia.</P>
    <P>Before the BSE problem arose again in March, we had been producing about 125,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal annually, 70 per cent of which was exported mainly to France, the Benelux countries and the UK in that order of importance and 30 per cent was used domestically, primarily by pig producers. Based on its present value of £170 per tonne, the value of the product is £21.5 million.  Since 20 March there has been no market at home or overseas for this product.  The renderers' association had discussions with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry who confirmed to them on Good Friday that the Department could not provide any assistance to the renders or do anything about the matter.</P>
    <P>On the basis that there was no outlet for their product, the renderers' association decided to close their plants the following Tuesday morning, 9 April. The implications of such closure were that the meat industry would be unable to slaughter as hygiene rules forbid the build-up of offal in plants.  This meant that the meat industry, on which 9,000 jobs depend, with 6,000 jobs in secondary linked industries, was grinding to a halt because renderers were told officially by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry that no assistance could be given to them in these extraordinary circumstances. Obviously, there would be no commercial value in taking a product which costs over £90 per tonne to render down, excluding wage and energy costs, if there was nowhere to sell it.  The Department had taken the extraordinary decision prior to the Easter weekend that this problem did not have anything to do with it.  Such was the abysmal contingency planning in the Department that it thought the problem would simply go away.</P>
    <P>Contact was made with the Minister over the Easter weekend to try to explain the gravity of the situation.  On <Col N="2040" /> realising that continuing inaction on his part to address the issues would compound the emerging crisis in the industry he quickly arranged for a meeting on 9 April.   Having been appraised of the magnitude of the problem by the industry at those meetings the memorandum of understanding, which is the subject of this motion, was agreed on Wednesday, 10 April. It must be emphasised that this is nothing but a temporary assistance scheme for the rendering industry, to run for a period of six weeks from 10 April to 21 May.  There are two elements to the scheme: a storage assistance scheme with a weekly subsidy cost of £1.50 per tonne of meat and bonemeal stored and a production subsidy of £150 per tonne for each tonne of meat and bonemeal produced.  The setting up of a subhead for this scheme was not sanctioned by the Department of Finannce until as late as 30 April.  It is only now, by passing this motion today as we enter the fourth week after the memorandum of understanding was agreed with the industry, that payment will be made in respect of the 14,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal which have been produced in the interim since 9 April.  It is estimated that up to 25,000 tonnes will have been produced by 21 May.  There is still no market for this product.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised as far back as 9 April when announcing the scheme that should an outlet be found for this meat and bonemeal product the production subsidy would be recouped.  He also emphasised that given the urgency of the matter a solution would have to be found within the industry as to how renderers would be paid for products for which there was no outlet and without which the meat industry would come to a halt.</P>
    <P>I understand that only two meetings were held since 9 April under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to seek to resolve the matter. The first meeting, held a fortnight ago, simply outlined the magnitude of the problem.  I understand a meeting was held earlier this week which set out the costs of replacing the meat and <Col N="2041" /> bonemeal value if a solution is not reached by 21 May.</P>
    <P>In assessing the replacement value and dumping costs per animal, taking a sheep as one unit, the following ratios can be arrived at for the purposes of rendering: sheep 1, pigs 1.8 and cattle 13.  Applying that ratio to the figures outlined, the total number of units processed at rendering plants last year was 30.61 million. Therefore, the meat and bonemeal value of one unit to a renderer was almost 70p.  Assuming the cost of dumping meat and bonemeal at £50 per tonne and knowing there were 125,000 tonnes last year, the cost of dumping the product is £6.25 million or 20.5p per unit. On that analysis, assuming a zero value for raw material and a dumping cost of £50 per tonne, the cost is 90p per sheep, £1.62 per pig and in the case of cattle, £11.67 per beast.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the cost per animal would be reduced if the market for meat and bonemeal were to reopen.  For example, if it reopened at a reduced price of £100 per tonne the replacement cost per animal would fall to 29p per sheep, 51p per pig and £3.72 per head of cattle as there would not be any dumping costs.  On the other hand, if the market remains closed and the product has to be dumped, the cost may be higher than £50 per tonne. Significant compensation will have to be made for the replacement value of the meat and bonemeal and dumping cost if no outlet is found.  It would be £27.5 million annually.  If a levy system is to be introduced at plants, it would mean a levy of 90p for every sheep killed, £1,60 per pig and almost £12 per head for cattle.  There is no agreement on who will bear this cost.  Neither the producer nor the processor has agreed to carry it.  The producer, facing unprecedented losses of between £100 and £150 per animal, cannot be expected to bear a further cost of £12 per animal.  It is difficult to see how the producer can avoid incurring these further costs as the alternative would be to bring the meat industry to a standstill.  If the cost were levied on the processor it would be <Col N="2042" /> passed on.  The Minister is not prepared to have a compulsory levy; he wants the industry to agree it rather than take tough decisions.  There is nothing new in that.  I hope he will seek compensation at EU level to assist in maintaining a rendering industry in this country It is crucial part of the food industry and a prerequisite for the continuation of the meat processing industry, which is already in crisis.  The industry cannot function without it.  Three weeks remain before termination of the temporary assistance agreement and there is no sign of the problem being resolved.</P>
    <P>As from 22 May we face a continuing crisis in the meat industry but we do not have any real idea of how to solve it. The Minister has three weeks left and it is time to get a grip on matters because the national interest continues to be under threat as a result of the failure to solve this grave problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that Deputy Cowen could not speak at greater length because he gave us more information than the Minister.  I was interested to hear some of the figures.  The Minister portrayed this as a solution to a big problem but it is a temporary, stopgap measure.  We are told that the Department will not spend more than £2.5 million but if this is retained, the cost will run to many million of pounds.  I cannot estimate how many and the Minister has not given us any figures on costs.</P>
      <P>The scheme proposed by the Minister will terminate in 19 days' time.  The date, 21 May, falls on a Sunday and, therefore, the measure will come to an end on the previous Friday &mdash; I presume no rendering will take place on Saturday and Sunday.  That means there are only 17 days left under which this measure will operate.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to come to the House and say he is introducing a scheme for which he wants the approval of the Dáil, but it will expire in 17 days.  The BSE problem will not end in 17 days.  The consequences of it will be with us for years and the Minister must take a longer term view than he is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2043" /> What concerns me about this matter is that it involves a nominal Supplementary Estimate for £1,000, simply to open a subhead, but once the subhead is open the Minister will continue to draw on it up to Christmas.  A few days before Christmas, just as the House is about to go into recess, he will seek approval for a second Supplementary Estimate for a huge sum of money and we will be told that since we are approaching the end of the year, the Dáil is about to go into recess and we have to make all the payments, the House must agree to it. That is what will happen, and that is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Neither is it satisfactory that a new scheme such as this should be debated in a perfunctory manner with Deputies not allowed to tease out the details. There is virtually no information on this matter in the Minister's speech.  Deputy Cowen quoted some figures which are frightening for the ongoing costs.  If he is right, this is an open-ended measure about which people will complain bitterly in the future.  They will ask why the Dáil did not do something about it when it was introduced, but the reason is the House cannot do so.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking back at the history of this.  As Deputy Cowen said, up to the Easter weekend the Department said this had nothing to do with it, that some other Department should solve the problem.  On Easter Sunday the Minister was approached about the matter and on Monday he dashed to Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of all the current clichés being pumped out through the media, the only one we did not hear was that a task force would be set up.  This is practically the only problem that has arisen in the past year or so for which a task force was not set up.  I wonder will such a body be set up shortly.  This whole process was carried on for optics rather than for reality.  We have Government by press release, press statements and so on rather than reality. There is no reality in what is happening. We have a serious long-term problem, the consequences of which will not go away, and the Minister has not dealt with it.  He suggests that it will disappear in 17 days, but that will not happen.  I do not know what the total cost will be over a long period and we have been given no indication of that today; it could be enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that the lobbying power of the meat industry and various aspects of it must be incredible.  If any other industry experiences a major problem there is not the slightest possibility of it being bailed out on the basis of a subsidy per ton of production.  If, for example, the electronics industry were to run into an insuperable problem in the morning does anyone think that the Department of Enterprise and Employment would ask this House to pass a subsidy of, say, £500 per computer produced, to run indefinitely, and introduce <Col N="2045" /> a Supplementary Estimate to that effect?  That would not happen.  It is remarkable that this industry is able to achieve such results.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know on what basis the money will be paid out.  Small amounts of State money are paid to individuals on the basis that they produce, for example, tax clearance certificates. Payments are subject to retention tax and penalising measures of that nature, but in this case millions of pounds will be paid out to people who in some cases, through their activities in the beef industry, owe the State tens of millions of pounds.  The people from whom the State is allegedly seeking to recover money are those who will be handed millions of pounds.  Many of the major rendering companies are wholly owned by processing companies &mdash; I do not know the exact proportion because, unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to get that information.  These are the people who owe the State millions of pounds and, wearing another hat, millions of pounds will be handed to them without any effort to set off one payment against the other.  That is not good enough.  There will be an outcry about this when the final cost is known. When this debate is read people will ask why the Dáil was not given the information or why it allowed the measure to go through without the information being given.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say what will happen when the measure expires in 17 days' time?  On what basis will payments be made?  Will they be made to companies the ownership of which owes the State tens of millions of pounds for continued malpractices in the beef industry? It is a joke that people who owe the State so much money will be given very large sums of money.</P>
    <P>We have no indication of how Britain is dealing with this problem.  It is certainly not bringing in a scheme of this kind.  The problem is much more serious for that country.  There seems to be no point in converting offal into a product that is unsaleable.  It would be much <Col N="2046" /> more sensible and much cheaper to dispose of the offal than introduce a subsidy, as we are doing.</P>
    <P>We were told over the Easter weekend that there are 2,000 people engaged in this industry.  The following Tuesday morning a senior official from the main union involved said that that was news to him and that the maximum number of people employed in the industry is about 400.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cowen, I regret very much that I do not have the opportunity to tease out this matter and to ask questions about it.  It is unsatisfactory that the House is asked as it were, on the blind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to examine what is happening now.  When he was in Opposition he complained bitterly about this type of thing.  It is a serious matter that we should be put in this position and it is totally unsatisfactory. I ask the Minister when he gets an opportunity to give Members of this House and the public proper information and lay at rest the many concerns people naturally have about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be precise on the time because I know it is important for everybody to have an input into this debate.  I am a little disappointed at the attitude of the Progressive Democrats but it is the usual one they adopt when retaining jobs in a vital industry is involved.  They talk about a blank <Col N="2047" /> cheque but the Minister said the maximum amount available in this package is £2.5 million.</P>
      <P>It is essential for the whole food industry in Ireland to ensure that the rendering industry, which is vital to that sector, is assisted in this crisis but it must be assisted also in the longterm either by way of examination by experts in Europe or elsewhere.  Veterinary and other advice must be available to us so that we discover the reason for discontinuing the use of this product in the non-ruminant sector.</P>
      <P>We accept that meat and bonemeal has not been used here in the feed of ruminants since 1990 but it continues to be used throughout Europe, with the exception of the UK.  It was suppliers in the UK who first raised this problem. Multinational companies such as Sainbury, Tesco, Marks and Spencer asked the meat processors here whether they were using meat and bonemeal.  Once that question was asked, a doubt was created in the minds of consumers about eating products from animals which were fed meat and bonemeal, albeit safe meat and bonemeal.</P>
      <P>Meat and bonemeal are produced by two factories in my constituency.  I was in touch with those factories this morning and they appreciate what the Minister is doing.  They realise if this action is not taken, there will be widespread loss of employment in my constituency and throughout the country.  Deputy O'Malley can misquote the figures or the trade unions if he wishes but when the figure of 2,000 was mentioned as being involved in this industry, the trade unions said they were only aware of approximately 400.  That is the unionised labour but, in addition to that, there are many other people involved in the industry including those who collect carcases, provide transport services, etc. If anything happens to this industry in my constituency, approximately 120 people will lose their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot apply the restriction proposed by the Progressive Democrats that money cannot be spent to protect <Col N="2048" /> employment.  The Department over which Deputy O'Malley presided as Minister was prepared to spend £20,000 per job to encourage a multinational company to set up in Ireland but Irish industrialists are involved in this industry.</P>
    <P>The Ronan family in Tipperary, for whom I have great respect, employs many people in Rosegreen.  They are not multinationals; they are not looking for £20,000 per job to retain the jobs at their factory.  Munster Proteins employs local people, has a local management and is Irish-owned.  These people are doing what we have always asked them to do &mdash; they are adding value to the product.  If we have only live exports, if we do not have factory processing and if we do not have added value on all our products, this industry will not develop.</P>
    <P>The rendering industry is worth almost £40 million.  The wage bill for the people in Tipperary is approximately £2 million per annum.  That is the total value of this package which the Progressive Democrats obviously resent but on which the Minister has put a cap of £2.5 million.  This is only a temporary measure and unless and until there is scientific evidence to prove that this product is suitable for feeding, some action will have to be taken to protect the workers in this industry, otherwise the whole food processing industry will be at risk.</P>
    <P>Meat cannot be produced on the shop floor, at the butcher's stall or through the abattoirs without the fifth quarter being processed.  If that is not processed it must be dumped but where do we dump it?  Land infill sites and tipheads have been mentioned but county council dumps cost a fortune in taxpayers' money to provide.  We are talking about dumping huge quantities of unprocessed material in tipheads.  What local authority can accommodate that?  My local authority certainly cannot.  For the past four years we have been trying to identify an alternative tiphead or land infill site on which to dump the normal refuse collection of South Tipperary County Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> This problem cannot be addressed simply by talking about the possibility of dumping material.  If it is dumped many jobs in the rendering industry will be lost and environmental problems will be created in each county.  The PD argument &mdash; they seem to have difficulties with certain people in the industry, particularly factory owners &mdash; is that we should disregard all that.</P>
    <P>The workers in my constituency should not be penalised for something that is outside their control.  This is a problem in an industry in my constituency which is controlled and approved by the Department.  It has the highest standards of processing, using the highest temperatures, and it meets all the environmental requirements placed on it.  People often complain about bad odours in the rendering industry, particularly those living in urban areas.  I have visited these factories and I am aware of the enormous investment they have made in order to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>We are facing a major problem and we cannot simply make jokes about the Minister going to the races or whether he was or was not at a Cabinet meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and I pay tribute to Deputy Cowen for insisting we have an opportunity to debate it.  As somebody who worked in the livestock industry for 14 years before coming into this House, I value at first hand the contribution of the rendering industry to this country.  I am from a constituency which has operated the largest rendering project in the country for the past 45 years, namely Premier By-Products in Ballinsloe in which the company employs people from at least 100 families directly and indirectly.  For everybody directly employed in the rendering industry <Col N="2052" /> there are at least two people indirectly employed in ancillary services.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this industry could be regarded as a contribution to the environment.  It makes a vital contribution to our environment in that it processes offal and dead animals from various outlets.  If such an outlet did not exist we would have a serious environmental crisis.  Each week the rendering industry collects from butchers from high street premises all the offal which they dispose of free of charge, take it to their plants and process it.  In addition they take into their industry, on a commercial basis, several other animals and products from many parts of the country. If we did not have such an industry we would have serious environmental difficulties.</P>
      <P>The industry is governed by two European Union Directives, 90/667 and 92/562.  It is a shocking indictment of State industrial policy when it is <i>de facto</i> stated in document No. 53 of State industrial policy that there will be no investment in projects relating to the production of greaves, inedible tallow or meat and bonemeal.  I call on the Minister to recognise the contribution this industry is making and to set in train industrial support for its modernisation, upkeep and development so that it can be expanded and jobs sustained. It is vital that its contribution to agriculture, food processing and the environment is sustained into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government decided on 20 March to ban the use of meat and bonemeal in feed for all farm animals, including pigs and poultry.  I cannot understand how pig and poultry producers here took a unilateral voluntary decision to do likewise.  I understand there was consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I cannot understand how such a decision would be taken because it is a statement by primary producers that they were not satisfied with what they were feeding their animals.  That is not a good signal <Col N="2053" /> to the international world and I understand that decision has affected our penetration of markets.  I call on the Minister and producers to lift that ban and to revert to feeding meat and bonemeal. If an analysis was carried out on other products which are being fed, they would not reach the high standards attained by meat and bonemeal, for example, the laboratory tests, the link with the universities and so on.  It is vital to take cognisance of the huge contribution of the rendering industry.  It is also vital under the Cohesion and Structural Funds programme, through the Department of the Environment, that these projects are made available to us with additional European support, that the rendering industry is allowed to link in to those so that they can be part of the modernisation of environmental services which are vital to projects and factories throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister understands the value of this industry.  If this industry gets into difficulty there will be a national crisis of mammoth proportions. Unless he maintains, and supports the industry and ensures we operate to the highest scientific and technical standards in all aspects of livestock producton, food production and industrial processes pertaining to rendering and unless the support and the market is available and the public is crystal clear about the high standards we have continually operated then Irish agriculture will experience a number of years of serious decline.  I ask the Minister to speak with his Cabinet colleagues, the State agencies and the farming organisations who are the primary producers, and that every opportunity will be provided to immediately revert to the 30 per cent consumption rate of meat and bonemeal which the domestic market was able to sustain until the present crisis.  I hope we will be able to expand and develop the rest of the markets internationally so that the rendering industry can continue to provide a valuable contribution to job creation and to the high standards of Irish products in foreign markets in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate.  In his opening remarks the Minister said: &ldquo;I would like to take Deputies back to the situation which livestock producers, slaughterhouses and renderers faced immediately before Easter.&rdquo; This was a dark week for Irish agriculture, Irish beef producers, pig producers and all those involved in livestock and poultry production because of the failure of the Department prior to that weekend to make a decision which would alleviate the problem because of the statement made by the renderers that they would not be in a position to collect materials that week.</P>
      <P>The Minister was slow to act and that week much slaughtering was lost.  It would have helped the industry and the primary producer if the Minister had made a decision.  That uncertainty has caused real damage to the beef and pig industries.  He went on to say he has made the services of his Department available as facilitator to those parties. This came about only because the maximum pressure was put on him. Every Deputy had phone call after phone call from meat processors, pig slaughterers and poultry processors asking what could be done.  Farmers' livestock which was ready for slaughtering was queueing up and a serious situation was developing.  We are now suffering as a result of the inefficient handling of the matter by the Government.  I do not blame the Minister as he has a difficulty at the Cabinet because of the parties with which he is linked.  I sympathise with Deputy Ferris, who is so pro-agriculture, but the Labour Party do not see it in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's perception.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to intervention, the Minister mentioned the highest kill ever seen.  Cattle prices have hit a new low here.  We are selling live beef cattle at 92p per pound.  That is the lowest price for many years.  Since this Government took office there has been <Col N="2055" /> a downturn in the beef prices.  We have failed to get refixing prices in Brussels and nothing has been done.  The beef industry has no confidence in the Government.  I understand that if the Minister does not continue this level of support after 21 May there will be another crisis.</P>
      <P>I am reliably informed by a processor, whom I will not name, that the cost could be as high as £4 per pig if there is not an outlet for the offal and that beef offal could cost as much as £35.50.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to examine new areas and to consider grant-aid.  Each meat plant or processor should have an incinerator on site.  I understand incinerators can be purchased cheaply. Because of pressure and low levels of profit the industry is not able to invest in incinerators, which are the way forward. I understand only two plants in the country have incinerators.  Grant-aid or a concession from the European Union would be the ideal solution to the problem.  People have lost confidence in meat and bonemeal and in offals and byproducts.  For that reason there will be a surplus for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>From my little knowledge of agriculture, many famous nutritionists over the years have talked about a 5 per cent or 10 per cent inclusion in ration formulations because of the importance of animal protein for the reproductive system. That will have to be replaced by other sources of protein.  Meat and bonemeal have a high level of protein. Feed prices are increasing.  I understand that soyabean meal which has 48 per cent protein costs in excess of £200 per tonne while this time last year it could be purchased for £150.  Wheat and maize are practically unobtainable at this time so that the Irish livestock industry is going through a traumatic period, especially the non-ruminant area, pigs and poultry, because of the high labour and feeding costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must address this crisis. I understand there are eight plants that process offals as renderers, some of which are owned by meat processors. <Col N="2056" /> As some of them have not always adhered to proper standards, an inspectorate should be appointed to carry out on-the-spot investigations at those plants.  As Minister for Agriculture, Senator O'Kennedy was the first person to ban the use of meat and bonemeal following a BSE scare.  I fear for the Irish agricultural industry, cattle farmers and livestock producers in general. After 21 May they will be held to ransom by the renderers.  I appeal to the Minister to promote the development of Irish agriculture and to have regard for the primary producer who has been neglected by this Government and is facing a downturn in prices.  The livestock and cattle industry is in a crisis.  Cull cows are making less than 70 pence per pound in factories, the lowest price in ten years.  This Government will have more livestock grazing dykes along roadsides than any previous Government. It will be worse than the days of the economic war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the contributions of Deputies and will provide them with a copy of the agreement and terms of the temporary financial assistance scheme for the Irish rendering industry, dated April 1996.  There is no question of me not making information available.  I have nothing to hide and will be happy to answer parliamentary questions on specific matters.  I am not sure to what Deputy O'Malley referred when he spoke about lack of information.  I was not aware of a proposal not to hold a debate on this matter.  I have been available at all times for such a debate and I do not have any difficulty in answering questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that has not been put in proper context is that we must acknowledge the concerns of taxpayers.  Before 20 March meat and bonemeal was worth £170 per tonne but because of a food safety scare it now has a negative value. That is a commercial adjustment and the same happened in 1990 when, rather than being paid for offal at meat factories, renderers were paid to take it away. A commercial solution was found at <Col N="2057" /> that time.  Pig and poultry feeders may discover that there is not a scientific basis for their voluntary ban.  The Department had no hand, act or part in its imposition.  There is not a legal ban.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I publicly called for this window of time to examine the possibility of doing what is being done in continental Europe.  I understand there are varying views between pig and poultry feeders and that poultry feeders might be more amenable to using this feedstuff.  The worst possible outcome would be that the meat and bonemeal would be cooked and dumped in landfill sites.  Discussions are taking place with the Environmental Protection Agency in that regard and I will do everything possible to prevent a crisis.</P>
      <P>Taxpayers cannot be left open to paying for an ongoing subsidy after 21 May. I have the figures from the Federation of Irish Renderers to which Deputy Cowen referred.  Irrespective of the press releases, I met the meat processors on Easter Tuesday morning. People did not want to know about this problem, they said it was up to me to resolve it.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty with meat and bonemeal across Europe and since 20 March it has been devalued.  No member state, other than the UK, has put a subsidy in place.  A subsidy of £180 million for one year has been provided in Britain, but it is taking 15,000 to 20,000 animals per week out of the food chain because of its over 30 months policy. We are not subject to an EU ban and, therefore, we must follow what is happening in the rest of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2058" /> Two meetings have taken place.  I was not impressed by the contributions of those who pretend the problem will go away.  Renderers are now placing a value on the depreciation of stocks and a figure of under £12 per head in the case of a bovine animal was mentioned. If that is the case it is a commercial reality for everybody.  It would be wrong to put in place a statutory levy.  That would introduce State bureaucracy for something that was dealt with in 1990 when meat and bonemeal was devalued overnight because of a BSE scare.  We will do everything possible to reopen export markets and assist in terms of domestic consumption of other species. There is no scientific evidence that BSE is transmissible across another species into a non-ruminant species, namely, an avian species or the pigmeat sector.  We must have regard for taxpayers and I will intervene in the talks between producers, processors and renderers if reality does not prevail.  However, I will not be railroaded into a position on 22 May which I was in on 9 April.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate in <Col N="2059" /> the Seanad Senators Lee and Norris expressed reservations about section 11 (4) (b) which empowers a port company to appropriate any part of its harbour to the exclusive use of any person for the purpose of any trade or profession in consideration of such charges as the company considers reasonable.  In particular, the word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; was strongly objected to.  I indicated I would be prepared to delete the word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; from the section and an amendment in this regard was approved by the Seanad.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>Section 13: In page 16, lines 9 to 15 deleted, and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) (a) A company may require&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  where the condition specified in paragraph (a) (i) or (b) of subsection (8) is satisfied, the owner or master of a ship,</P>
      <P>or</P>

      <P>being in either case a ship the navigation of which or the fact of its carrying goods or passengers or of any other circumstances referred to in subsection (1) that involve the ship will result, or results, in harbour charges being imposed by the company (whether on one or more than one occasion), to give to the company a bond, or such other type of security as the company specifies, for the payment of those charges.</P>

      <Col N="2060" /> (b)  The amount of the bond or other security that a company may require to be given under this subsection (other than in relation to harbour charges imposed in respect of a ship referred to in subsection (8) (b) shall not exceed 25 per cent of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the company has imposed harbour charges on the owner, master or agent concerned (`the person concerned') in each of two or more years prior to the making of the requirement, the average of the amount of harbour charges imposed by it on that person in such a year,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the company has imposed harbour charges on the person concerned in only one such year, the amount of harbour charges imposed by it on that person in that year,</P>
    <P>(iii)  in any other case, the amount of harbour charges the company estimates it will impose on the person concerned in the period of 12 months commencing on the making of the requirement.</P>
    <P>(8)  The conditions referred to in subsection (7) are&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that, before the making of the requirement referred to in that subsection&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the owner or master concerned has failed to pay harbour charges imposed by the company or, on two or more occasions, has paid harbour charges imposed by the company to the company after the latest date stipulated by it for their payment,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the case of the agent concerned, he or she has failed to pay moneys to the company which he or she has received from a person on account of harbour charges imposed on that person by the company or, on two or more occasions, has paid moneys so received by him <Col N="2061" /> or her to the company after the latest date stipulated by it for the payment of the harbour charges concerned,</P>
    <P>(b)  that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the ship concerned has not entered the company's harbour on any previous occasion and the company does not regard it as likely that it will enter its harbour again in the period of 12 months commencing on the entry concerned, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the owner or master of the said ship has not retained an agent to act on his or her behalf for the purpose of paying any harbour charges that may be imposed by the company in the circumstances concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Irish Ships Agents' Association objected to section 13 (7) of the Bill, as amended by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy.  The association was of the view that the bonding provision, as provided for in section 13 (7), contravened the law of agency, and that the provision might also be contrary to EU competition law rules.  Advice received by me from the Attorney General's office was to the effect that there was no valid legal basis to the objections raised by the association. Notwithstanding this, I undertook to reconsider the matter with a view to ensuring equity in relation to the provision &mdash; for example that ship owners, masters and agents are treated in the same manner &mdash; and limiting the bonding provision to cases where difficulties are being encountered.</P>
    <P>The amendments I proposed were agreed to by the Seanad.  The amendments, new subsections (7) and (8) provide that where there is an unsatisfactory record, for example where outstanding harbour dues are in arrears or where default in payment occurs, a company may require the owner or master of or the agent for a ship to give a bond or such other type of security as <Col N="2062" /> the company specifies to the company for the payment of those charges.</P>
    <P>The amendments also provide that the bond or security, as the case may be, that may be sought by a port company shall not exceed 25 per cent of the annual harbour charges imposed by a company on the owner or master of a ship or the agent for a ship &mdash; subsection (7) (b) (i) and (ii).</P>
    <P>The amendments also provide that in the case of a ship calling &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; to a port not operating through an agent and where there is no record, a company may seek such security from the owner or master of the ship in question in relation to the payment of harbour dues as it deems necessary.  I confirm that the majority of agents &mdash; in excess of 90 per cent &mdash; pay their principle's charges in full and on time, and the amendment as now proposed will not penalise or place any burdens on them for so long as they continue to pay in full and on time.  The amendments protect the port companies in relation to late payments and defaulters.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise, in case there is any doubt on the matter, that the new subsections (7) and (8) do not make ships' agents liable for their principle's charges.  These subsections provide &mdash; and I would draw particular attention to subsection (8) (a) (ii) &mdash; that where the owner or master has paid harbour charges to the agent and where the agent is late in handing these over to the port company or defaults in paying them over, and only in such circumstances, the port company may seek a bond or security from the agent concerned. The majority of ship's agents will not be affected by the new provisions. The amendments are acceptable to the Irish Ship Agents Association.  I commend them to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of this section, we have moved a long way since we started discussing this Bill.  The Minister listened attentively to the debate in Committee and in the Seanad.  The original fears of the ship agents have been addressed and the requirement in the <Col N="2063" /> draft legislation has been virtually removed.  The amendment deals primarily with defaulters whose numbers are quite low.  Where there is a history of good management and paying on time the subsections will not have a detrimental effect.  The House is, therefore, in a position to accept and welcome the changes now proposed.</P>
      <P>The broadening of the defaulting section to include ship owners and others as well as agents is also welcome because it was originally felt the finger was being pointed at ship agents and it was the Department's view that it would be possible for the harbour authority to deal directly with ship owners to the exclusion of ship agents who do a very good job and have a long history of promoting developments in this field.  For those reasons we can accept the amendments and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore not only for this provision but for a number of other provisions.</P>
      <P>In terms of giving a commercial mandate to harbour authorities, we are a little anxious at the delay in bringing the amendments from the Seanad so that we can complete this legislation and arrange to have the Bill enacted.  Given the purposeful efforts enshrined in the Bill and the significant expenditure which will be devoted to improving facilities, I do not know why there should be a delay in bringing the provisions to the House.  It looks as if we have lost some time.  Perhaps there are legitimate reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not lost time. In addition to the enactment of the legislation, there is much preparatory work to be undertaken in advance of the establishment of the harbour companies. It included a major study of the financial position of the various ports with particular reference to their pension position.  That has now been completed and work is in hand to address the pension problems in the respective ports.  In addition, work has also to be done to establish articles of association <Col N="2064" /> for the various companies and put a value on the assets of the companies with a view to establishing the value and level of share capital.  That work is under way.  A working group has been established with the Irish Port Authorities Association which has been engaged for a couple of months on the preparatory work necessary to establish the companies, and we are working towards an incorporation date for the companies of 1 January 1997.</P>

      <P>Regarding the pensions study, does the Minister envisage any obligation on the State in the short term to financially support those companies that hitherto have been unable to make provision for pension rights for their workers, and some of whom have argued that they made an investment in expanding port facilities as distinct from making provision in this vital area? What amounts are involved?  Will the Minister be in a position later this year to inform the House of the position in this regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage the State being required in the immediate term to take on any financial obligation for the pension schemes in the various port companies.  The port companies will be responsible for the establishment of pension funds and pension schemes for their employees.  It has been made clear to the harbour boards that they have to exercise that responsibility.  On Report Stage in the Dáil we introduced an amendment which, as a last resort, provides a guarantee in the event of any of the port companies not meeting their obligations to their employees so that, at the end of the day, the pensions of pensioners and employees will be protected. In the meantime we have made it clear to the port companies that the obligation is on them to meet the financial liabilities.  I do not have specific information on the estimated liability of port companies for the pensions of their pensioners and employees with me, but I will be happy to make it available to <Col N="2065" /> Deputy Smith, and to the House, at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since these liabilities are extraordinarily high in the case of two or three port authorities, if taxpayers are not to incur some liability, will that not necessitate the disposal of major assets?  Is any such proposal in train?  To what extent has the Minister been involved in directing harbour boards to engage in discussions on this proposition?</P>

      <P>The consultants' report is being assessed by my Department and the port companies.  The position varies from port to port on the extent of its liability and obligation to provide for pension schemes for its employees. However, I would expect that the rapidly growing trade of a number of port companies would be sufficient to enable them to generate the requisite income to provide for their pension schemes.  In the case of some port companies such provision has already begun; various means have already been devised whereby funds are being built up.</P>
      <P>We shall have to take it on a port by port and case by case basis.  We are working closely with the port companies to ensure that they meet their obligations in full.</P>

      <P>While not wanting to blow this matter out of proportion, in the transition from harbour boards to harbour authorities, the interests of employees will be crucial so that that transition can be effected as amicably as possible.  I am anxious to receive as much continuous information from the Minister as he can provide in regard to these developments.  While acknowledging that there are different options available to the harbour boards and new port companies, in terms of their trading position, assets and so on, it is vital that such matters be conducted openly, ensuring that appropriate provision is made for their employees.  Hopefully <Col N="2066" /> that transition can be done without having to resort to the precautionary provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Section 13: In page 16, line 24, after &ldquo;harbour charges&rdquo;, &ldquo;of an amount that, having regard to all the circumstances, is fair and equitable&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to enshrine a mechanism in the Bill whereby the local lights dispute between New Ross Harbour Commissioners and Waterford Harbour Commissioners can be dealt with to the satisfaction of both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to outline briefly the background to this issue.  Ships bound for New Ross Harbour must pass through part of Waterford Harbour.  At present such vessels are charged light dues at the same rate as ships proceeding to Waterford.  New Ross Harbour Commissioners claim that the charges imposed are not related to the cost of providing the lights and, in their view, are excessive, rendering New Ross port uncompetitive.  On the other hand, Waterford Harbour Commissioners <Col N="2067" /> state that the lights which New Rossbound ships avail of are sea lights and buoys and, consequently, are very expensive to install and maintain. Efforts to put in place an administrative arrangement to deal with this issue were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in the Seanad I said I supported the principle that the user or shipper should pay for services and facilities provided.  I also indicated my support for the New Ross view that charges of this nature should be fair and equitable and that there should be full transparency in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The amendments provide that such charges shall be fair and equitable having regard to all the circumstances.  The amendments also provide that, if the first-mentioned harbour considers that the charges so raised on ships proceeding to it are not fair and equitable and in the absence of agreement on these matters with the company raising the charges, if so required by either company, the matter shall be determined by an independent arbitrator nominated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>These amendments fully meet the demands of New Ross Harbour Commissioners. Details were outlined to Waterford Harbour Commissioners who raised no objections.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to what the Minister of State said and I had an opportunity to hear at first hand from both Waterford and New Ross Harbour Commissioners.  From the outset I considered the wisest course was to ensure that this problem would be resolved between them.  On the basis of any information I could glean, the historic experience between the two authorities would demonstrate that the charges appeared to be quite reasonable as far as Waterford Harbour Commissioners were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are anxious that there should not be any local or regional difficulties <Col N="2068" /> incapable of resolution.  Over a fairly long period we have had considerable opportunity to test the waters in regard to what might be feasible in this respect. I agree with the Minister that the &ldquo;user charges&rdquo; is the right direction in which to move, that they should be fair and equitable and that there be put in place a mechanism whereby, if any difficulties arise which cannot be resolved, a mediator or arbitrator can be appointed to resolve them.  However, I hope we shall never have to resort to such measures.  It is important that both these new port companies continue to operate effectively and co-operatively.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the amendments before us.  I am glad that there is, if not full agreement, acceptance that we have gone as far as we possibly can to meet the demands of both parties.</P>

      <P>Section 17: In page 21, between lines 34 and 35, the following inserted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) (a)  Subject to paragraph (b), a harbour master may attend formal meetings of directors of the company <Col N="2070" /> by whom he or she is employed and may, if the directors, in their discretion, permit him or her to do so, take part in the deliberations by those directors of any matter arising at such a meeting.</P>
    <P>(b)  The directors of a company may, where they are of the opinion that the attendance by the harbour master at a particular meeting aforesaid or at a part of such a meeting would not be in the best interests of the proper and orderly conduct by them of business at that meeting or the administration of the company's affairs generally, require the harbour master not to exercise his or her right to attend that meeting or a specified part of that meeting and the harbour master shall comply with such a requirement.</P>
    <P>(c)  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as conferring on a harbour master a right to cast a vote in respect of any matter arising at a meeting aforesaid.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the Harbours Bill, 1995, harbour masters sought to have the Bill amended to give them a statutory right to attend board meetings and to take part in discussions.  Deputies will recall that this matter was debated at length in this House.  Opposition amendments in this regard were not accepted by me on Committee Stage and on Report Stage because they would have given the harbour master a statutory right to attend board meetings and to attend all discussions and, in effect, would have given the harbour master the status of the director, except the right to vote.  The amendments would have given the harbour master extraordinary status and rights over and above all other servants of the board.  I also pointed out that harbour masters do not have a statutory right to attend board meetings under the Harbours Act, 1946, the existing legislative framework. In practice, they do in general attend and I could see no reason that <Col N="2071" /> practice should or would be discontinued.</P>
    <P>During the Seanad debate on the Bill it became clear that the mood of the House was threefold.  First, there was a wish to highlight and upgrade the responsibilities which are placed on the board in respect of safety of navigation. Second, and related to the first, was the wish that a stronger duty be placed on the board to consult the harbour master. Third, the board should be required to call in the harbour master to attend its meetings in so far as this was necessary to get his or her views on safety of navigation and related issues.  I agreed that those were reasonable objectives and I undertook to find a statutory formula to incorpprate them in the Bill.  I did this and the amendment I subsequently introduced was accepted by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 clearly establishes the principle that the harbour master has the general right to attend board meetings.  In other words, the normal position will be that the harbour master may attend at his discretion.  This will be solely in an observer and-or advisory capacity and he or she may only intervene when requested by the board. However, there may be occasions where particularly sensitive issues may come up for discussion, such as the assessment of performance of senior staff including the harbour master.  In such circumstances the board must, as an exception to the normal practice, have the right to discuss these matters in the absence of the harbour master.  The amendment provides for this possibility in subsection (b).</P>
    <P>This amendment strikes a fair balance between the view that a harbour master shall have an unrestricted right to attend all board meetings and the contrary view that such attendance should, in all circumstances, be subject to the total discretion of the board.  I stress, however, that this qualification to the right of attendance would not allow a board to make a general decision to exclude the harbour master from all meetings or from particular parts of <Col N="2072" /> meetings.  The board would have to address any proposal that the harbour master be excluded from a particular meeting or a particular part of a meeting by reference to the principles laid down in the Bill, having regard to the agenda items for discussion at that meeting and on a specific case by case basis.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister knows, we fought a long and tedious battle for the right of the harbour master to attend board meetings.  If I recall correctly, the Minister referred on Committee Stage in the Dáil, as he did today, to the fact that the 1946 Harbours Act did not make any such provision.  There have been phenomenal changes in the activities of harbour boards since 1946. While the harbour master's responsibilities were quite extensive in the 1946 Act, the range keeps widening.  His or her responsibilities are so great as regards safety and many other matters that the involvement of the harbour master at board meetings is to the advantage of the board.  The amendment provides that he or she may be excluded from a board meeting if sensitive matters are being discussed.  That is legitimate and correct.  However, it is good to recognise in Statute the important role which the harbour master can play at these meetings.  These provisions meet the requirements of the Seanad and the Dáil.  I compliment the Minister on these changes which will be welcomed by everyone in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that I pressed hard during the discussions in the Dáil and the Select Committee to grant a statutory right to the harbour masters to attend harbour meetings.  The Minister will recall how stubborn he was in opposing the amendment which was supported by all Opposition speakers.  The Minister has travelled a long road since that tedious discussion last summer.  I am pleased he has finally recognised the wisdom of the <Col N="2073" /> arguments we made and that he tabled this amendment, of which I approve.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that by writing this into the Statute Book harbour masters have a statutory right to attend board meetings.  That can only be withdrawn from them if the board members decide, for whatever reason, that they do not want them to attend particular parts of a meeting.  I presume that decison will be taken by way of a motion or a majority at the meeting of the board and that it will not be the prerogative of the chairman.  I ask the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
      <P>The Minister opposed the granting of a statutory right, but he now agrees to it.  It has limitations but it addresses the point I and Deputy Michael Smith made during our earlier discussions.  Irrespective of the lack of a provision in the 1946 Act, it was a long-standing practice for harbour masters to attend meetings throughout the years.  It was the intention of the parliamentary draftsman who drafted the original Bill to exclude the harbour master and to ensure that he could attend only if he was invited. He is now entitled to attend and he can only be stopped from doing so by way of special motion, which I accept.  I welcome the amendment and the Minister's conversion on this issue as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has found the right compromise. Deputy Molloy should remember there was all-party agreement that a formula should be found to give harbour masters the right to attend board meetings.  I say that as a former chairman of a harbour authority.  I accept that the Minister was sympathetic to the concept of allowing harbour masters to attend meetings. The majority of harbour authorities allowed harbour masters to attend and to participate in the discussions relevant to their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will give a statutory right to harbour masters to attend meetings but, on occasions, they may be asked not to attend parts of meetings if a sensitive discussion is taking place on matters not related to their function and <Col N="2074" /> which might cause a problem for them and for the members of the Authority. This amendment is skilfully thought out. I am pleased the Minister found a formula, as he indicated he would, which is not only acceptable to him but to the harbour masters who are enthusiastic about their right to attend meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their comments.  The distance I have travelled on this&mdash;or as Deputy Molloy expressed it, the extent of the conversion &mdash; is not quite as dramatic as he claimed.  If Members recall I expressed the view in Select Committee and on Report Stage that the <i>status quo</i> as it has applied under the 1946 Act did not seem to have posed a great difficulty in that for the most part harbour masters were enabled to attend meetings of harbour boards and did so.  The image being created of a harbour master sitting outside the door of a reluctant harbour board that was refusing to allow him admission did not tally with the understanding I have of the way boards do their business.  I did, however, have to address the amendment tabled in the Dáil and to reject it for the reasons I stated.</P>
      <P>I do not think it was ever at issue whether the harbour master should attend harbour board meetings as a general rule and I think we were all agreed on that but the issue was whether it was necessary to have it enshrined in the legislation and the best way of doing so. Having reflected a great deal on it as a result of the debate in the Dáil and Seanad and taken further advice, I was quite pleased that I was able to introduce an amendment which was approved by the Seanad and which appears to have the approval of this House.</P>

      <P>During the Seanad debate I indicated that I was happy to accept Senator Tom Fitzgerald's suggestion that this section be amended to provide that performance audits be carried out by a suitably qualified person and that there should be a time limit for the carrying out of the audits.  Approprimately drafted amendments were agreed to.  The amendments provide that they shall be completed within a period of six months from the date of the appointment of the suitably qualified person to perform the audit.  It is only reasonable that such a period should be allowed for performance audits at the bigger ports such as Cork and Dublin.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be taken for granted that any harbour board worth its salt would appoint a suitably qualified person without having it specified. If the position were other than that there would be a loss of confidence in the ability of those authorities to do more difficult jobs than this one.  It is always good to have time limits but I am not sure of the appropriate time limit. Obviously in smaller companies, shorter <Col N="2076" /> periods would be fine but in larger companies a longer period would be required.  Time limits are important but clearly there has to be flexibility to exercise discretion as it is most important that the report point out the deficiencies and problems and be prepared on the basis of improving future performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 29 requiring these public bodies to undertake a performance audit is a very welcome addition to legislation of this kind. Amendment No. 9 places a time limit on the provision of that report.  If the amendments are accepted section 29 will read:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may at the end of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the period of 3 years beginning on commencement of this section, and</P>
      <P>(b)  each subsequent period of 3 years beginning on expiration of the last previous period,</P>
      <P>appoint a suitably qualified person to carry out an examination as to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the performance by a company or companies of its or their function and to report in writing to the Minister the results of the examination, such an examination and a report shall be completed by the said person within the period of 6 months from the date of his or her appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little disturbed by the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context.  Will the Minister say whether it is a requirement of the legislation that all the harbour companies will undertake a performance audit report at the end of three years after the legislation comes into operation?  Is it the intention that this clause will be exercised in the case of each harbour company in existence?  I would not like to see the provision being written into the Bill, but not intended for use, except in extraneous circumstances.  I would certainly be happier to see the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather <Col N="2077" /> than &ldquo;may&rdquo; but I did not table an amendment along those lines.  This is not the strongest wording but it is the Minister's intention.  Presumably his successors will take heed.  Performance audits are something I welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome addition to the Bill.  Will the Minister elaborate on the following point?  Until now it has been difficult for workers employed in the docks or workers employed directly by harbour authorities to secure information concerning the financial activities of the port even though they would be partly responsible for the profits that might accrue to the harbour.  With this Bill allowing for the election of a worker director will the provisions for a professional performance audit and the new arrangements for the appointment of harbour authorities mean the annual financial report of each harbour authority be made available to the Members of this House, the public and, in particular, to the workers and those engaged in the operation of the docks?  I would appreciate information on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for welcoming this new provision whereby companies will be required to carry out performance audits.  That is just one of a number of new provisions in this legislation, the other major one is the requirement that the chairperson of the company report to the Minister separately from the normal annual report.  New arrangements are being provided in this legislation for reporting and the accountability of these companies.</P>
      <P>The companies will be required to carry out the performance audits.  We are currently working with the various harbour boards and Irish Port Authorities Association on preparations for the establishment of these companies, including the preparation of the articles of association.  I am looking at the possibility of including in the articles of association the requirement that the performance audits be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy Bell <Col N="2078" /> relates to information available to workers in the various ports.  For the first time they will be entitled to directly elect their own representatives to the boards of the harbour companies and like every other director will have available to them the information presented to the board.  When the harbour companies are established under companies law they will be required to carry out the normal duties to their accounts and present their reports which will be made available in the same way as the reports of other semi-State companies are made available.</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage in the Seanad I advised Senators I had no objection to amending section 30 (6) to provide that the local authority directors shall be elected members of a local authority or local authorities.  I pointed out however that, in the case of the Galway port company for example, it may be decided that of the three directors to be appointed, two should be nominated by Galway Corporation and one by Galway County Council.  Similarly careful consideration will have to be given to the question of the appointment of local authority directors to the board of the Shannon Estuary ports company where at present five separate local authorities have representation on the board of Limerick harbour commissioners.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that the three local authority directors shall be elected members and the amendment also gives the necessary flexibility in the appointment of local authority directors to the boards of such companies as Cork, Galway and the Shannon Estuary ports company.  I would remind Deputies that once the legislation is enacted regulations prescribing the nominating local authorities and the manner in which directors are to be selected will be made by the Minister for the Marine, following consultation with the Minister for the Environment. Such regulations will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, either House having the power to annul them within the next 21 sitting days.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage I asked the Minister if it was envisaged that the directors would be appointed from the membership of the local authority and he gave a cast iron guarantee that would be the position.  I did not have any great fears after that.  Nevertheless, enshrining it specifically in legislation leaves one in <Col N="2080" /> no doubt as to the position.  I fail to understand how the membership of a local authority, where they are in the majority, would propose other than what is provided for here.  However, in the unlikely event that the members of local authorities would be so gracious as to overlook their own membership and appoint somebody from the executive instead of an elected member, the Minister of State is making sure that the elected members are those from whom directors shall be appointed.  It adds to what was an already acceptable position and I have no objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was hoped the Minister would make known his intention in regard to the number of members to be nominated by each local authority, where more than one local authority will be the nominating body for membership of the new harbour companies. It seems the Minister does not intend to make that information available to the House because he has indicated that he intends having consultations with the Minister for the Environment, prior to making any announcement.  One would have assumed the Minister had ample time to consult the Minister for the Environment prior to now, and that, on the final Stages of this Bill, he would outline his intention to the House.</P>
      <P>There is keen awareness of an interest in his decision about who the nominating bodies will be and the number that each of the nominating bodies will be able to nominate where there is more than one local authority claiming some attachment to the business of the port and which traditionally had its members nominated to the harbour commissioners. What is the Minister's intention in this regard?  He was asked this question on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  It was also discussed by the special committee. We have had no indication from the Minister as to what he proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister of State mentioned the possibility of two nominations, one from Galway Corporation <Col N="2081" /> and one from Galway County Council, but he did not say that was what he proposed to do.  I do not know why it is taking so long to make this decision or announcement.  It is the only aspect of this new development that has not yet been clarified.  I assume from what he has just said that he will not inform us now either.  It is nearly 12 months since we first debated this in this House.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give me some information about the &ldquo;prescribed manner&rdquo; referred to in the amendment?  The amendment states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall appoint three members of a prescribed local authority or local authorities (each of whom has been nominated for the purposes of this subsection in the prescribed manner by a prescribed local authority or local authorities).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have access to information on the &ldquo;prescribed manner&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Both on Committee and Report Stages a lengthy discussion took place on this issue.  My harbour authority in Drogheda, and indeed the harbour authority in Dundalk, has multiple local authority representation. Drogheda has Meath County Council on one side, Louth County Council on the other and Drogheda Corporation in the middle.  Traditionally, the method of nomination provided that each local authority was represented.  I am glad the Minister is taking this on board.  It is best done by regulation, rather than by inserting the formula for representation directly into the Bill.</P>
      <P>The regulations should be flexible enough to provide for agreement between local authorities on the basis of political representation because many harbour boards, particularly my own, have been dominated by one or other political grouping over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If two parties control the local authority after the AGM, it simply means that a grouping of parties can take, and does take, the total representation of the local authority on the harbour authority. I ask the Minister to bear in mind <Col N="2082" /> that this has been the traditional way. It can occur that virtually all the local authority representatives on a harbour authority come from one particular grouping.  To date, if that occurred in three local authorities, it would mean that the virtual control of the harbour authority was vested in the hands of elected representatives from that one political party or grouping, whatever that grouping might be.  This formula will ensure that the Minister can make the regulations in consultation with the Minister for the Environment in, I hope, a flexible way which will allow for the fair representation of local authority representatives which will reflect, at least as far as possible, the representative strengths of the local authority area and will not be dominated by any one party or group.  I ask the Minister to keep that in mind when he drafts the regulations under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>They insisted it be written down in black and white and so it has been.</P>
      <P>On the question of what local authorities are going to be represented and in what number of the various harbour companies, the Bill provides that that will be decided following consultation with the Minister for the Environment. I suppose it is probably fair to say that, in respect of some of the harbour authorities, the local authorities concerned tend to suggest themselves.</P>
      <P>There is a particular problem in relation to some of the harbour companies. In the case of the Shannon Estuary, five local authorities were represented on the board of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  The Shannon Estuary port company touches on the boundaries of several local authorities, which would obviously have an interest in the port.  The same situation arises in Waterford.  While Waterford port is associated with Waterford City, a part of the new Waterford port at Belview is located in County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>All of those considerations must be taken into account.  I have not yet made a decision as to the local authorities concerned and the numbers of representatives from each local authority.  I extended an invitation to Members of these Houses to express some views on the matter but, while some individual Members have taken up that invitation, the number who have done so is small. The invitation is open.  If there is a view as to which local authorities should be represented on which port companies.  I am certainly open to hear views on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major issues which arise are as follows.  Where a port is located in a town or city, should the local authority of that town or city have two out of the three positions and the attendant county in that area have the remaining one? Where the harbour involves a number of local authorities, should the representation be spread evenly among those local authorities?  Two matters must be prescribed: first, which local authorities will appoint members to which boards; <Col N="2084" /> and second, the manner in which the appointments are to be made.  I have not finalised these regulations but my intention is to follow the well established norm in the local authority system for the appointment of members to various bodies and boards, in other words, the use of the grouping system.  That would probably get over the difficulty to which Deputy Bell referred.  If a particular political group has a majority of one on a local authority, the practice which had existed prior to the introduction of the grouping arrangement whereby the winner takes all would be avoided.  The grouping system would provide for a more even and fairer distribution of positions on that port authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The grouping system would be acceptable and quite satisfactory in the circumstances where a local authority was nominating more than one member to the new company, but that will not be the position, in my view, in quite a number of local authorities.  It seems the Minister is skirting around this issue and I do not blame Members of the House for not coming up with proposals when the Minister responsible is not indicating his view on this matter.</P>
      <P>Is there the possibility that some alternating arrangements can be made? While I accept it would dilute the impact of the elected members on the company, it would be more satisfactory from a democratic point of view because some local authorities, who will not have the opportunity to participate in or elect a director to the company, will be alienated in a number of cases.  We must face up to that dilemma.  While I accept the grouping system is fine, it will not solve the problem in a number of cases, particularly in the mid-west.  Has the Minister given any consideration to the question of alternating membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Michael Smith, but in the three local authorities straddling the Drogheda Harbour Authority area, the grouping in one is Labour and Fianna Fáil, in <Col N="2085" /> another it is Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and in the third it is Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  There is probably a balance of some sort.  A rota system would be the fairest one in that case but I do not think it would give continuity to the new companies as there would be too many changes within the term of office and this would not be good.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reference would be acceptable to the majority of political parties and would give an opportunity to the smaller party representatives and, indeed, independent representatives to have some chance of nominating members.  Such a system has been proven with regard to nominations to vocational education committees, health boards and other subsidiary bodies.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister intends adopting that formula.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of a harbour board for many years.  I was nominated by the old transport union on one occasion to represent dock workers in my local area.  I was also nominated by Wicklow Urban Council and Wicklow County Council on different occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been successful under any of the systems, as has been the case in most elections.  When I was Minister for the Environment I was pleased to introduce a quota system, particularly for nominations to health boards and other boards to enable all those concerned to have an equal opportunity to be nominated.  I appreciate that a quota system will not work <Col N="2086" /> in cases where there is only one board position and that a vote must be held. Such nominations are not always as a result of a vote.  After elections or annual meetings board positions on various bodies and subsidies must be filled. Some local authority members prefer to be nominated to one board rather than another.  Some of us may consider that we should have sought nomination to harbour boards, but positions must also be filled on health boards, vocational education committee boards and tourism boards.  Civilised local authorities will try to agree nominations to various boards without confrontation and give everybody concerned an equal opportunity in terms of who will be chairman or vicechairman in cases where a rotation system operates.  It is something like the European idea of the De Hont system where so may points are allotted for number of board representations held.</P>
      <P>A quota system will not work well in cases where there is only one position and there is one nomination from an urban council and two from a county council.  In such cases it is up to each local authority to nominate members, as they do for other subsidiary boards.  If that system does not work, the Minister should have a fallback position whereby a quota system will operate where two positions must be filled.  He would need to be greater than Solomon to decide on a nomination for one position in an urban area where there are two local authorities looking after the same harbour, as has been the case traditionally in Wicklow and Arklow.  Perhaps we do not have all the wisdom in regard to this matter.  Before the structure of the harbour boards is changed to the new one proposed, we should ascertain from them what they consider is fair and reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion a person who was not a member of the local council was nominated to the harbour board.  He was an outstanding person and we all thought he should be a member of the <Col N="2087" /> harbour board.  It is possible not to confine harbour board positions to members of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet made a final decision as to the make-up of the local authority membership on harbour boards and the local authorities from which they will be drawn.  One of the options to which I have given some thought is that suggested by Deputy Smith, the possibility of a system of alternation.  However, I foresee some difficulties arising with that relating to continuity and balancing the interests between one local authority and another.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy asked about the prescribed manner in which nominations will be undertaken.  It can be consulted in the regulations when they are made. They will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will be available in that way.</P>
      <P>Somebody said that we are probably skirting around this matter.  The issues involved are not mysterious.  In the case of port authorities, such as Arklow, Wicklow, Dundalk, Drogheda and Galway where there is an immediate urban authority and a county council, the main issue is deciding the mix as between the urban and county council membership of the harbour board.  The mix I have heard mentioned most in these discussions is the option of nominating two members from the urban authority and one from the county council.  I have mentioned that a number of times during this debate and I have not heard a great deal of opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is more complex in the case of a port authority such as Shannon. I appreciate the reluctance of members from the counties concerned in regard to this matter.  The Shannon Estuary stretches across parts of counties Clare and Limerick, Limerick city, counties Kerry and Tipperary north and local authorities in those areas have representation on the board of Limerick Harbour Commissioners.  It will be <Col N="2088" /> more difficult to reach a decision on nominations to such harbour boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister decides to appoint one member from a county council to a harbour board, he should ensure that member comes from the electoral area which surrounds the harbour authority area.  In the past members from authorities in west Wicklow were nominated to the Wicklow Harbour Board.  That area includes Blessington and the lakes, but people who have a direct interest in their local area and have been elected by people from urban and county areas close to the harbour should be nominated to the harbour board.</P>

      <P>The Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy debated this issue on 26 July.  The Minister said that local authorities will nominate members and the nominated members will then be appointed by the Minister for the Marine.  The number nominated from the various local authorities will be decided by the Minister for the Marine following consultation with the Minister for the Environment. Nine or ten months have passed since that matter was discussed, yet in May 1996 the Minister cannot inform the House of his intentions regarding representation of local authority members in the new harbour companies.  It is not good enough for the Minister to tell us in May 1996 that he will consult with the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister for the Environment and the Minister's party are in Government and they have had ample opportunity during the past nine or ten months to have had all the consultations necessary to resolve this matter and to have informed the House of the Minister's intentions regarding representations from the nominated local authorities before the Bill is passed by Dáil Éireann.  This raises many questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have asked me not only about this issue but about the delay in finalising the Bill.  They have asked what has been holding up the Harbours Bill. <Col N="2089" /> Why has it taken so long to finalise the Bill?  There is no explanation as to why it has taken so long to pass this Bill.  The select committee dealt with it fairly expeditiously.  We had long discussions under various sections, but we skipped through them fairly quickly.  There was a recess in August but the committee, of which Deputy Bell is chairman, resumed in September.  What consultations must take place which the Minister could not have had during the past nine or ten months or longer since the Bill was first published and passed by Cabinet?  He must have had some idea about what he would do.</P>
    <P>The delay in making a decision on this matter has made people suspicious. The Minister is not prepared to state his intentions in the Dáil because he knows they will have repercussions; he wants to deal with the matter surreptitiously by way of regulation when the Bill is on the Statute Book and cannot be altered.</P>
    <P>Where is the openness, transparency and accountability in this?  This Minister had nine or ten months to deal with the simple issue of representation by local authorities on the new harbour companies, yet he still has not made up his mind on the matter.  What is he doing?  I know from experience that the Minister is effective, efficient and competent and, unlike many of his colleagues, he has been willing to listen to arguments by Opposition parties.  He stands out as a shining light among Ministers who have brought legislation before the House. He is willing to be open, accountable and transparent on other issues and I would like to know the mystery about this issue.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities, who gave excellent service on the old harbour boards since the introduction of the 1946 Act, are in a vacuum and will have to await some kind of diktat following the enactment of the Bill.  The Minister has not been prepared at any stage during the debate to outline the intentions of the Government or the Minister for the Marine on the issue. <Col N="2090" /> His statement that he will have consultations &mdash; he made the same statement last July &mdash; raises suspicions.  This is not in keeping with his track record for doing business and I appeal to him to give a reasonable explanation for his delay in making a decision on this matter. Is it the case that his proposals on representation will not be palatable and will cause problems among local authorities? In other words, local authorities can fire all the shots they want after the Bill is enacted but it will not be possible to change it.  We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke and to let the Minister deal with the matter by way of regulations. We will have an opportunity to discuss the regulations and express our displeasure about those proposals with which we do not agree but the Government has a majority and we will not be able to do anything about them.  We might agree with some or all the proposals and I would like to know why the Minister is reluctant to be open, transparent and accountable on this issue, which he said is not a mystery.</P>

      <P>I am not skirting around the issue, I am asking a direct question about the Galway port company.  Would it be acceptable to the Deputy if the representation constituted two members of Galway Corporation and one member of Galway County Council?  I would like an answer because this principle will apply to most of the other ports. Lest the Deputy accuses me of being coy about the direction of my thinking, that is it.  A decision has not yet been made on the matter but this is the formula which should be used in the case of, for example, Galway, where two local authorities are involved.  The Deputy said I had nine or ten months to deal with the issue but I have been waiting for a reply from him for nine or ten months about the Galway port authority. I am now giving him an opportunity to state if the representation on <Col N="2092" /> the Galway port authority should include two representatives from Galway Corporation and one representative from Galway County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a simple question about the way the locally elected members would be nominated to all the harbour companies.  I did not come in here to speak for Galway Corporation and I have no problem in accepting the formula put forward by the Minister if that is the one he wished to use. However, I want to know the facts.  The Minister has a duty to put his proposals before the House so that they can be discussed before the Bill is enacted. However, he is not prepared to do that and has sought instead to turn the issue back on me.  If he proposes that there should be two representatives from Galway corporation and one from Galway County Council on the Galway harbour company I will accept that formula.  I merely want to hear his proposals.  He made a mountain out of the representation on the Galway port company but refused to give information about all the harbour companies on which local authorities will be represented.  Why is the Minister afraid to outline his intentions to the House?  He has expressed his intention in regard to the Galway port company and I want to know why he cannot do the same in relation to the other companies so that we know the position.  Why has it taken him nine or ten months to have inconclusive consultation with the Minister for the Environment about representation on harbour companies?  He did not answer my question about whether consultations had taken place and I can only assume that they did as it would be abnormal if they did not.  I am sure Government <Col N="2093" /> Deputies have been in contact with the Minister and Minister of State about this issue.  They are as interested as I am to know the Minister of State's intentions. This does not keep me awake at night but it is part of my responsibilities as spokesperson prior to accepting the Bill which was the subject of a thorough examination on Committee Stage, to extract information in regard to the Government's intentions.  However, there is a great reluctance to give it to us.  I do not understand this.  The Minister of State said there was no mystery about it, so, why create one?  That is what he is doing in refusing to give us the information.</P>

      <P>In the case of my constituency I have no hesitation in saying I would like to see two members of the urban council and one member of the county council on Dundalk Harbour Board and one member of Meath County Council, one member of Louth County Council and one member of Drogheda Corporation on the Drogheda Harbour Board.  If four places were available, I would argue there should be two members of the corporation and one member from each of the county councils on the board.</P>

      <P>I disagree profoundly with Deputy Bell.  As Members who have experience of Government know, issues arise from time to time on which it is not possible to reach consensus.  If one were to wait for the recommendations of local authorities etc., one would never have a decision.</P>
      <P>I have no brief to defend Deputy Molloy, but it would be strange if the only reason the Minister of State could give for not making up his mind, is that the Deputy failed to reply to a direct question put on 26 July 1994.  We are trying to tease out this matter to reach a resolution, but in the final analysis, some hard decisions will have to be taken which will not please everybody. It is important that we go as far as we can to allow the new companies to develop in the way we want them to.</P>
      <P>The time has come to make up our minds on these matters.  We have made some suggestions to help the Minister of State.  It is important that we move forward on a positive note and make some decisions.  The Minister of State should not be convinced by the arguments made by Deputy Bell who chaired the select committee extraordinarily well. As I am sure the Minister of State appreciates, the buck stops at his desk and he must make a decision when it is not possible to reach agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have liked to have participated in the debate on this Bill, but I am chairman of a committee which, unfortunately, takes up much of my time.  The Deputy has the same problem, he would like to speak about matters in which he has been involved for almost 30 years as a member of various boards and give the Minister of State advice and information, but, as has been said, we would not be here today if this was the only item at issue.  Everyone <Col N="2095" /> would agree this is not the reason the Bill has been delayed for one year.  It is nonsense to suggest, therefore, that the Minister of State cannot make up his mind.</P>
      <P>Everyone would agree that the boards should be smaller in size.  One could solve the problem of representation by increasing the number of representatives of urban and county councils, but one would end up with boards of a ridiculous size of up to 20 members. The Minister of State has, therefore, made the right decision.  We have argued for additional places as, traditionally, local authorities have been represented on such boards.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the proposal that there should be one county council member and two urban council members on harbour boards.  It could quite easily be the other way round.  If the turnover of the board of which I am a member was £20,000 lower per year, strange as it may seem, it would be taken over by Wicklow County Council. This was the cut-off point.  The board had the lowest turnover followed by Arklow.</P>
      <P>The matter is more complicated in the case of the Drogheda Harbour Board on which three councils are represented. Where it is more straightforward, for example, in Galway, Wicklow, Bray and other areas, most would agree that there should be one county council member and two urban council members on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>We have come a long way since the Bill was first mooted. One of the factors which concerned people was the proposed reduction in the number of local authority members. It was suggested initially that there would be only one local authority member on harbour boards, but following representations from all sides of the House we have arrived at a position where there will be three representatives. This is essential to maintain liaison between harbour boards and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> Like Deputy Molloy, as a former chairman of the local harbour board in Galway, I am aware of the advantages which flow from the liaison between members of the local authority and the harbour board.  I am glad to say their relationship is excellent.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in accepting the proposed figures.  It is logical that, since the harbour board is based within its functional area, Galway Corporation should have two members on the board. As the board deals with several matters which affect the county council, it is also entitled to representation.  There would be nothing to stop the county council from selecting a member of the corporation to be a member of the board as happened on the last occasion when a member of Deputy Molloy's party was appointed.  I am sure the county council will select the best person for the job.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that responsibility is being passed from Dáil Deputies who will no longer be eligible for membership.  I have been a member of the board in Galway for 17 years and will be replaced by someone with an interest in its development.  I have every confidence in the Minister of State as he is following the correct line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy McCormack has reminded the House of the distance we have travelled in relation to local authority representation on harbour boards.  This Bill originated from the report of the review body on commercial ports which recommended initially that there should not be any local authority representation on the boards of port companies.  However, the Government decided that there should be, in the interests of local democracy and copperfastening the relationship which exists between local ports and local authorities.  The Government is committed to a strong degree of local authority representation on the boards and has decided that three directors should be appointed by local authorities. This will give them substantial representation as the total membership of the board is 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> As regards the composition of the boards and which local authorities should appoint which members, no decision has yet been made but when it is it will be in the form of regulations which will be laid before both Houses. Members will have an opportunity to debate them if they wish and to table a motion if they are dissatisfied with them.  One would be led to believe by some of the contributions made today that there is great dissatisfaction.  I will be happy to defend the decision that will be made.  I thank Deputies for their helpful and informative debate on this issue.</P>

A member of Galway Corporation who is in Deputy Molloy's party <Col N="2098" /> was not able to get elected from the corporation because of the pressure for places.  As the person concerned would have a good input to make on the harbour board, Galway County Council very generously decided to nominate him despite the fact that he was a member of the corporation.  It was a unique gesture in local politics.  I am glad we nominated Councillor Martin Connolly because he has served well and has made a great input to the board.  I am sorry we will not have an opportunity to do it again.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 30.</P>
      <P>In page 28, after line 48, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  The Minister shall, in selecting one or more persons to be appointed as a director or directors of a company (not being a director or directors to whom a preceding provision of this section applies), consult with&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland (or any successor of it),</P>
      <P>(b)  the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (or any successor of it), and</P>
      <P>(c)  such other persons as the Minister considers appropriate,</P>
      <P>and each of the said persons may, following such consultation, recommend to the Minister that a particular person or persons be appointed as such a director or directors and the Minister shall consider such a recommendation.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that while I did not accept proposed amendments to the Bill to provide for statutory representation by chambers of commerce on the board of new port companies, I advised that it was my intention that the ministerial directors would, in general, be drawn from the professional and business community. I also advised that it was my intention to invite recognised bodies such as IBEC, chambers of commerce and so on to recommend persons for consideration for appointment as directors. I accepted in principle an amendment tabled by Senator Fitzgerald during the Committee Stage debate in the Seanad that the Minister before appointing ministerial directors should be statutorily required to consult with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. <Col N="2100" /> However, I indicated I would like to broaden the consultancy provision to cover cases where there are no chambers of commerce in existence, such as Foynes, and also to provide for consultation with other bodies such as IBEC, leisure and other interests as may be deemed appropriate.  The amendment approved by the Seanad meets these requirements and I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have prescribed in primary legislation that the person who will carry out the audit for the new companies will be suitably qualified.  We have prescribed for the elected members of the local authorities and for trade union representation.  The main emphasis in the provisions in the Bill and the thinking behind them was to give a commercial mandate to harbour boards in the new companies.  We fought as diligently as we could to obtain for chambers of commerce a statutory right to be represented.  This is an extremely important matter.  I understand an amendment was tabled in the Seanad and the Minister has gone as far as he deems necessary to meet it.</P>
      <P>The amendment has been considerably diluted.  The Minister will consult with a range of organisations.  We should indicate the willingness of the House to recognise the contribution those in the business profession could make towards the enhancement and development of the new companies.  It is illogical to provide for trade union and local authority representation without providing for the direct statutory nomination of a person from the business community.  Perhaps in the final analysis such a person will be appointed by the Minister, but why not go the whole way and provide for that?  We tried at all stages of this debate to reach agreement and there were very few divisions. A positive response was forthcoming from the Minister in this House and in the Seanad &mdash; I pay tribute to our colleagues in the Seanad for their interest in this matter and the wide-ranging debate there on all Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> This amendment is only a token concession which is not what we had in mind.  We indicated to the Minister in the strongest possible way what we believe is necessary.  Failure to provide in the legislation for representation by the business community sends out the wrong message.  There are many good measures in the legislation, but the Minister should have gone the whole way and met the arguments put forcefully in both Houses.  I recommend that he take the bull by the horns, give statutory representation to chambers of commerce and indicate a willingness to accept their contribution, as he has done in other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The original thinking behind the proposal to change harbour boards, as set up in 1946, to harbour companies was to create a greater business focus at board level of harbour companies.  That was the overall intent of the Murphy report, yet having accepted the broad thrust of the report the Government has made major alterations to the original proposals <i>vis-à-vis</i> the matter we have been discussing, granting representation to local authority members.  It is extraordinary that while the Government thought fit to make changes of that nature, it is not prepared to give the same statutory right to the business community to representation on harbour boards, considering that was the original intent of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation provides a statutory right for worker representation on the boards.  The trade union-worker aspect is adequately provided for, as are local authority members, although we do not know how satisfactorily until we see the regulations.  Yet the business community which traditionally played a very strong role on the majority of harbour boards is being denied the statutory right to nominate a member.  As Deputy Smith said, this amendment has very little significance in the way it is worded. There is provision for consultation with chambers of commerce and IBEC &ldquo;or <Col N="2102" /> such other person as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.  There is no clause to the effect that the person should be from the business community.  It could be anybody, even the Bishop of Galway. I do not see how the Minister can justify sloppy legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have experience of legislation and was involved on one occasion in a review of a programme for Government. I ensured that the language relating to consultation and consideration was eliminated as far as possible because I realised it meant nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I learnt rapidly that even though the Government may state that a matter will be considered, it may later oppose it.  The Minister said that he will agree to consultations, but they are not binding.  He may consult with the people involved and they may submit names to him, but that means absolutely nothing. It is like tipping the hat to the gentry. The Government looks in the right direction, and people should be grateful for that, but it proceeds in the opposite direction.  This is sloppy legislation and is unusual in the way it is written.</P>
      <P>The House should take a stand on this issue.  The Opposition has a duty to ensure that legislation means something, and clauses that mean nothing should not be included.  I realise the Minister may have had a difficulty in the Seanad in that the Government does not have a clear majority there and he did not have sufficient numbers to support his opposition to representation by chambers of commerce.  He, therefore, caved in on a weak measure that got him off the hook.  In this House, however, where the Govenment has sufficient numbers the Minister is seeking support for an amendment that has no meaning whatever.  It is demeaning to include this amendment in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (c) is so global in its intent that the Minister can do whatever he likes.  He may appoint another local <Col N="2103" /> authority member, another worker representative, another trade union representative or even a fictional Senator. The amendment is so global I am surprised the Minister suggested it.  It states that &ldquo;such other persons as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo; may be appointed, but who would they represent and in what way must they be appropriate?  It simply adds to the Minister's list of political nominees to these boards.</P>
    <P>I previously sought by way of amendment on Committee Stage to provide on a statutory basis for representation by the business community through the chamber of commerce structure.  I have no objection to including IBEC, an organisation that represents employers and businesses.  It is, however, unacceptable that other persons whom the Minister thinks appropriate may be added.  Does that include his programme manager or his director of elections from Dún Laoghaire?  I am surprised the amendment has been put forward in such a form.  Unless the Minister comes up with a reasonable explanation or agrees to change the wording I cannot support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the remarks of Deputy Molloy.  In the past it was traditional that trade unions be represented on harbour boards &mdash; usually the person appointed was a full time official of the union operating on behalf of the majority of members in the docks area or a union representing larger ports.  Prior to the appointment of the previous harbour authority a directive was issued by party headquarters telling local activists of the party to ensure they got their union cards from the local union headquarters.  Suddenly they were all representatives of that union &mdash; the majority of them had never even held union cards &mdash; to the exclusion of the full-time officials responsible for the operation of the docks labour.  That was done deliberately but not by a Democratic Left or Labour Minister.</P>

      <P>The distinction between worker-director and local authority representatives and chamber of commerce representatives is simple but significant. Local authority representatives must stand before the people to get elected before they can be nominated to serve on the harbour authority.  The worker-director must stand before his fellow workers in an election to be democratically elected by them.</P>
      <P>Anybody can become a member of a chamber of commerce.  They are non-elected people; they do not have to stand for re-election and some of them represent very minor interests.  They do not have to stand for any form of election.</P>

      <P>All that is required of them is to have a business interest in a local town.  They simply make an application and are then accepted into membership. They do not have to stand before all the traders in the town in order to gain membership of a chamber of commerce.</P>
      <P>Approximately 25 chambers of commerce, including the two in my constituency, have communicated with me in regard to this matter.  I explained to them that the way in which the Minister proposes to proceed will be to the benefit of the chambers of commerce, not to their detriment.  Rather than having a fixed number of two representatives on the authority, they may well have eight because it is logical that the Minister of the day will not nominate local authority members in place of people who run commercial businesses.  The Minister made it clear on Second and Committee Stages that he would welcome nominees from the chambers of commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the authority goes outside the <Col N="2105" /> ambit of the chambers of commerce because there are many successful business people who would be well suited to serve on the new harbour companies who are not members of chambers of commerce.  Many of them live in my town.  It is wrong to compare local authority nominees, who have to stand before the people, and worker-director nominees, who must stand before their fellow workers, with people who are not required to stand for any election.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister nominates more than two chamber of commerce members in my constituency to the authority.  I am confident that will be the case in County Louth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputies Smith and Molloy and my constituency colleague, Deputy Bell, in their support for the nominees of chambers of commerce.  Having been a member of various municipal authorities over the years, I am of the view that harbour boards are not particularly suited to domination by members of local authorities.  I refer particularly to the very small harbours.  I accept Deputy Bell's point that nominees from various councils are elected by the people but that does not keep ports viable.  In fact, if the small port in my town of Dundalk, for example, had been depending on business emanating from Dundalk Urban District Council or Louth County Council, it would have closed 100 years ago.  The people who kept that small harbour open were those who had a vested interest in doing so, namely, business people who used it for various reasons.  The port struggled along for many years with the support and commitment of local business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have any docker representatives in Dundalk; that system was dismantled many years ago.  I do not see any reason trade union members should be represented on boards in the Dundalk area.  I support the rights of the chamber of commerce and other business people, who have kept the port open over the years, to have a seat on <Col N="2106" /> the board.  I hope the Minister, who must be aware of similar situations around the country, accepts that.  He should give a mandate to the chambers of commerce to put forward their own nominees and not resort to the old custom of nominating hacks of whatever party.  In opposition we can all say that various practices are wrong but we do the same when we are in Government.</P>
    <P>A blanket approach cannot be adopted to this problem because the difficulties in Drogheda, which has docker representatives, are different from the problems in Dundalk.</P>

I live within 200 yards of the docks and I know Dundalk port would have closed but for the personal support of business people who, virtually single-handed, ran the local harbour office.  I support the reasonable request by Deputies Smith and Molloy that full representation should be given to business interests, whether they are members of a chamber of commerce or any other business community in a particular district.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I want to thank Deputy McGahon for his support.  We have tried in this debate to avoid divisions but we genuinely believe the Minister must move further in regard to this issue.  I have the greatest respect for the democratic system which I have been honoured to serve for a long time.  I am under no illusion that I am any more important because of that and, perhaps, <Col N="2107" /> less important than a number of people who never engaged in the democratic system, those who create jobs and those who have the entrepreneurial bent &mdash; some of whom are elected to this House.  The greatest need here is to create jobs and to have people working. I have never thought that those who stand for public office have superior rights.</P>
      <P>The Minister should go the extra step and avoid divisions in this House as far as possible because all sides genuinely want to solve problems.  In this instance the Minister is offering a token concession which is not enough.  The whole thrust of the Bill is to have the business orientation and the commercial ethos engendered in the boards.  I plead with the Minister to take that final step.  That is no diminution of the respect I have for people who are elected.  We are merely pointing to where we see these boards going and how we want to place the business community.  Those who create jobs, those who, as Deputy McGahon said, sustained these little ports for years should stand equal &mdash; we are not asking for a concession &mdash; to other representations which are being put on a statutory footing in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are few issues on which I disagree with my good friend and colleague, Deputy McGahon, but we always disagree when it comes to the difference between employers and trade unions.  I admire him for admitting in public many times that he has no time for trade unions.  He repeated that this morning and said they would not be permitted if he had his way.  I respect his point of view but that would not be the view of the vast majority of people not only in County Louth but in Ireland. Every organisation has a trade union. The Garda Síochána has two trade unions.</P>

      <P>The Army has two trade unions.  Every Member of the House is <Col N="2108" /> involved in one way or another in a trade union as are the staff of the Oireachtas.  I accept everybody is entitled to their point of view but I do not share the Deputy's view.  For the information of the Deputy, the representation in Dundalk Harbour Authority always included the full time official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union.  The workers on the docks in Dundalk are members of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union and the staff of the harbour authority are members of IMPACT &mdash; a major trade union in the public service &mdash; so too are the workers in Drogheda.</P>
      <P>I am not saying members of the chamber of commerce should not be members of the new harbour companies. On the contrary there should be more than a fixed number but it would be impossible to fix a number of nominated people to a board when they are not elected members.  The best way to get party political hacks on the boards of new companies would be to tell them to join the Chamber of Commerce and we will ensure the Minister of the day appoints them.</P>

      <P>The long debates in this House and in the Seanad were not on the issue of whether there should be professional and business representation on the boards of the harbour companies, because that is entirely accepted, but on the type of that representation The review body which examined our commercial ports made the core recommendations on which this legislation is based.  That body did not recommend that there should not be representation from particular interests. On the contrary it recommened that the best available board should be appointed by the Minister.  However, a <Col N="2109" /> case was made on the position of local authorities.  I have heard some criticism outside this House of the Government's decision to permit local authorities to have a right of representation on the boards of the harbour companies.  I have heard no such criticism either in this House or in the Seanad.  I do not know whether some criticism is implied in respect of the decision to appoint local authority representatives.  If it is being suggested, because of that decision, that there should automatically be some type of representational board drawn from particular bodies having the right to nominate members of the board I should point out that the review body specifically recommended that that should not be the case.  One of the difficulties which the review body identified with the existing structures for the governance of our ports and harbours was that there was too much representation from vested interests.  In fairness, it had in mind the confined community of interests who trade and operate in and around our ports.</P>
      <P>A decision was made, and there is some confusion here, that there should be a balance on the board as between management and labour representatives. I use the term &ldquo;labour&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;I&rdquo; on this occasion.  The management representation would be the chief executive of the board and the labour or worker representation would be employees of the company who would have the right to elect one or two, depending on the size of the port company, worker directors.  That is in line with the policy of successive Governments to extend worker representation in our semi-State companies.  It is a modest representation although it reflects the size of the labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's intention is to ensure that the best possible board of directors is appointed to manage and run the commercial semi-State companies being established to manage and run our commercial ports.  I have also made clear repeatedly that it is our intention to appoint to those boards people with appropriate professional competence <Col N="2110" /> and business backgrounds who can bring to those boards their business experience and abilities.  This legislation establishing commercial companies to run our ports can be given practical effect when the boards are appointed. The intention is that the appointees to these companies would be of good professional and business calibre.</P>

      <P>Another matter of importance, of which the Deputy did not experience a great deal, is that of trust with Government colleagues.  I am happy to say that is an experience I have enjoyed since coming to office.  The issue is not whether people from the business community or with business experience or a business background will be appointed to the board of these companies.  That is assured.  The question is how that representation will be achieved.  It was argued here and elsewhere that the chambers of commerce in the respective towns should have an automatic right of nomination to the boards of the port companies.  I rejected that argument here and in the Seanad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain later.  We are talking about 12 semi-State companies. I have great respect for chambers of commerce and pay tribute to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dublin chambers of commerce, with which I am most familiar.  Chambers of commerce vary from area to area.  A number of them could legitimately claim they represent <Col N="2111" /> the business communities which the ports in their areas serve.  There can also be rivalry between business organisations with different business interests in certain areas.  A short time ago we talked about how we would decide the weighting of various local authorities where different interests are involved. A range of business organisations, such as the Irish Ships Agents' Association, the Irish Exporters' Association and IBEC, who have a direct involvement in various ports sought representation on the port companies.  In response to an amendment from Deputy Smith on Report Stage we decided to widen the remit of the companies by giving them a brief for leisure type activities as well as traditional commercial port trading activities.  This includes bodies such as the Irish Sailing Association and the Irish Federation of Marine Industries who sought representation on the boards on the basis that they represent business interests in port activity.</P>
      <P>Following a reasoned debate in the Seanad, I believe the best approach is to enshrine in the legislation the principle of business representation on the boards and to provide a mechanism whereby prior to appointing the representatives there should be formal consultation with chambers of commerce, because much of the debate centred on them, and with IBEC because of its national dimension as a business organisation. We also decided that, based on their port activities, there should be consultation with organisations such as the Ships Agents' Association, the Irish Chamber of Shipping, the Irish Exporters' Association and the Irish Federation of Marine Industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation prior to the appointment of directors is not an invention or, as Deputy Smith said, a sop to the chambers of commerce.  That principle is already enshrined in the case of worker directors where we provided that if their number is less than 30, trade unions should be consulted and there <Col N="2112" /> should not be an election.  The consultation process in this case is similar.</P>
    <P>I gave assurances here and in the Seanad about the intention to appoint directors with business experience and of good calibre.  Given the principle enshrined in the amendment, the procedure I set down for a formal process of consultation with named business organisations and the possibility of extending that to other business organisations as appropriate, I am surprised at the less than generous response from some Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not often fall out with my colleague, Deputy Bell, and Deputy Gilmore is a good Minister. However, I am peeved at the use of the words &ldquo;vested interests&rdquo;.  What is wrong with vested interests?  Does the real world not spin on vested interests?  It has been argued that harbour boards are part and parcel of the local authority set up.  That may be so, but that is not the correct approach.  One cannot compare a harbour board with the functions of an urban or county council.  Their functions are miles apart.  While I accept there should be a place at the table for local authorities, they are over represented and, to use the Minister's words, vested interests are under represented. The Minister referred to various organisations such as the Ships Agents' Association and Irish Exporters' Association who should have a seat at the table because of their commercial involvement in keeping ports open.  They depend on the ports, can attract importers and exporters and, in turn, create jobs.  What jobs can representatives of urban or county councils or trade unions attract?  What business activity, in a nautical sense, can they attract to a harbour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system was probably set up when the State was formed and it has acted as a depressant for business in the case of small harbours.  There should be less political participation on the boards and more places for people who can attract economic activity to the harbours and, in turn, create employment. <Col N="2113" /> Urban or county council representatives are not in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>Let us give a vote of confidence to the people who stimulate business activity in our towns and accept that there is a good side to vested interests.  It is when they are abused that problems arise.  We should support people with a vested interest in their towns and harbours.  I would like greater representation of people with vested interests on harbour boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to introduce a discordant note into the debate, but it is outrageous of the Minister to assume because we are making this case for the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland we are against representation for workers and local authority members.  We are approaching this matter in a genuine way.  We are not against the participation of others.  What we are talking about is balance.  In this instance we have argued cogently that it is wrong not to accord to the business community the same statutory rights as are accorded to elected local authority members and workers, and it is absurd to interpret that as being against representation for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That some review body did not recommend it, is often trotted out as an excuse for not doing something.  May heaven save us from review bodies, their reports, and recommendations which were not implemented in the past.  Inevitably review bodies propose a totally independent board, which would mean appointing people who know nothing about the business in question. When appointing boards as a Minister, I selected people who had vested interests, because it would be impossible for someone to give good service on a board without knowledge of the business, and the only way one can have such knowledge is to be in some way engaged in the business.  It is not true that we cannot trust people if they have a vested interest.  If a person has 30 years experience in a business and employs 30, 40 or 100 people, that <Col N="2114" /> should be recognised as a national contribution by that person and on the basis of such results and experience I would be prepared to appoint him to a board. We are far too shy in this House about standing up for people who do such work, as if there was something wrong with making profit, engaging in enterprise and doing something for the country in terms of giving employment. When the Minister says he would have difficulty in appointing somebody like that on a statutory basis, he should remember there will be 12 members on each board and he will nominate at least seven or eight of them.  We are asking for one statutory appointment; the rest will be open to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This House should not divide on this matter.  We have all set out to improve this legislation as it progressed through the Houses.  There is no real difference between us on this question.  The Minister has the scope and the numbers and there is nothing to stop him from doing what he was able to do in other instances.  He has prescribed for matters that are not nearly as important.  We have asked the Minister to face up to reality and recognise the work, involvement and participation of the business community.  He should take the bull by the horns and let us have no further debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's attitude is wrong, illogical and contradictory and displays a bias against the business community. Ministers have been wrong before.  I remember a Minister for Tourism and Transport, Mr. Childers, a very able Minister and a man who made few mistakes, telling me during my first month as a Member of this House that there was no future for Galway Harbour, that the future of ports and shipping was influenced by developments in shipping which was moving towards containerisation, that the type of ship would change, that the goods Ireland exported went out through the east coast and only the east coast harbours or ports could prosper.  He said there was no future for a harbour on the west <Col N="2115" /> coast and he would not grant the money I was seeking to deepen the harbour in Galway to enable larger vessels to enter and turn in the harbour and discharge or bring out a cargo.  Mr. Childers was adamant about that on the basis of research he had carried out.  Subsequently the Minister's constituency benefited greatly from ro-ro activities and is still benefiting with the rapid expansion of Dún Laoghaire.  Galway harbour is still there, 31 years later &mdash; I am not saying that was because of my persistence in eventually getting the money to deepen the harbour.</P>
      <P>My point is that Ministers can be wrong, despite their belief that they are properly motivated in making decisions. In this case the Minister is very wrong. There is a serious principle involved here.  The Minister has granted statutory representation to two groups, to employee representatives and to elected local authority representatives but is refusing to give statutory representation to the business community.  It has been said by Deputies McGahon and Smith that harbours cannot thrive without business activity.  The leaders of business, in exercising their judgment, generate the business for the harbours and have been responsible for the importation and exportation of goods.  It does not make sense to deny statutory representation to the main harbour users.  I do not know whether the Government is refusing to agree to this amendment or due to some ideal of the Democratic Left the Minister is opposing the amendment.  I do not find it easy to understand where the Minister is coming from on this other than from his political background and his ideological outlook in regard to business; perhaps he is throwing all that aside and saying he supports business activity, that he sees the necessity for it to create employment but nevertheless he will not give it representation on this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could cave in and go on to the next section, but if we do that this section will be cemented into place and it will be some time before the House <Col N="2116" /> again discusses major harbour legislation of this nature.  Because this is major new legislation establishing a whole new way to control and run the harbour business we have a duty on the Opposition side &mdash; I am glad to see support from some Government backbenchers &mdash; to insist that the legislation is put together in a way that is workable. It is inconceivable that the harbour users should end up without representation on the harbour board.  There was a suggestion at one time that that should be the ideal.</P>
    <P>Rather than accept those recommendations the Minister sought to construct these harbour boards along his own lines.  He advanced solid proposals for local authority, employee-worker representation but ludicrous ones for representation of the business community. How can he expect any need for these harbours unless business people use them?  How can he expect the harbour companies to operate in the most effective, efficient manner if those with most knowledge, experience, most reason to ensure that a harbour is successful, are not allowed representation on the board?  Despite how busy some of these business people are, and have been, it is remarkable that they have made themselves available to participate, as members of harbour boards, in their discussions.</P>
    <P>Having served as a member of the Irish association which governs the various harbour boards and on my local harbour board, my observations of meetings of both lead me to the conclusion that business and harbour users' representatives have made the greatest contribution, without whom we would not have experienced the success we have.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister wanted harbour masters excluded from participating in harbour board meetings but he caved in, for which we thank him.  In future they will have a right to attend board meetings and can be excluded from participation in certain circumstances, but only by a decision of the whole board.  The Minister's proposal had been to exclude <Col N="2117" /> the one member of the board or staff with overall responsibility for the movement of shipping in and out of the harbour, for all the facilities required, from the safety and other points of view, for traffic management, the flow of goods through the port and all the arrangements to be made about ships on the high seas en route to and from a harbour. The Minister wanted to exclude the harbour master, not the harbour secretary, from such meetings but we overcame that problem.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the business community, the most important influence on the degree of business conducted through any harbour, will be excluded from membership of those boards. When this Bill is passed, political appointments will be made &mdash; I have seen it happen frequently in the past &mdash; when the Minister and parties in power will want to know how many seats they will have to fill.  They will be filled by political appointees whose knowledge, interest and commitment to the development of harbours and business flowing through them will not be of primary concern.  Unfortunately, that has been the track record of some parties in Government on all sides.</P>
    <P>I had hoped my party would not participate in that kind of practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have travelled that road sufficiently long now.  All parties recognise the temptation and pressure to appoint political supporters to such boards.  As Opposition spokesperson on the Environment, when the Fine Gael and Labour parties were in Government, the present Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Minister for the Environment introduced a Bill proposing a change in the manner in which members of An Bord Pleanála would be appointed.  It was on the basis of nomination by certain national representative organisations, such as engineers, architects and others involved in planning and development.  That was the then proposal of the Leader of the Labour Party who remains its Leader.  Now, within the radical overall structural changes being effected in all harbour boards, the method of appointing two categories of members is being laid down in statutory form with which all sides of the House agree.  However, representation of perhaps the most crucial interest to the development of any harbour and business flowing through it, the business community, will not be statutorily provided.  How can the Minister of State justify that illogical decision?</P>
      <P>The proposal contained in this amendment is even worse.  The Minister has not answered one of the questions I posed in relation to subparagraph (c) which reads: &ldquo;such other persons as the Minister considers appropriate...&rdquo; Appropriate on what basis; appropriate for what purpose, in what way?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, perhaps the reality is that if this Bill is passed in its present form when it comes <Col N="2119" /> to making these appointments, his role will not be as dominant as here where he is deemed to be acting on behalf of the Government.  I assure him that, when it comes to selecting nominees &mdash; wherever there are no restrictions on appointing representatives of any particular group &mdash; such decisions will not be left in his hands.</P>
    <P>I take this stand from my knowledge and experience of the system as it has operated to date but, judging by the Minister's response so far, I find it difficult to agree to this amendment in its present form.  I recommend that the Minister avails of the forthcoming break to consult his senior Minister &mdash; a reasonable, sensible businessman himself whom I would have thought would be very supportive of the business community &mdash; on the necessity to grant the business community statutory representation similar to that granted other representative groups.  He should bring the views expressed here by the members of Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and an able, experienced backbencher of the Government parties, to the attention of the Minister, when he may well return with a somewhat different approach from that he has adopted so far.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies Molloy and Michael Smith know, I chaired the Committee Stage discussion on this Bill when we had one of the lengthiest ever discussions on this matter.  There is nothing in the Bill which excludes port users from being appointed to a harbour board.  While there is much talk about vested interests on the part of members of such boards, what about the most important vested interest, the workers, who contribute most to generating the wealth from which administrative costs <Col N="2120" /> are met?  Members tend to talk about members of chambers of commerce and the like as though dock workers did not exist.  I am proud to have been associated with the Minister of State, at one stage having been one of his bosses in the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.</P>

      <P>The absence of workplace policies which facilitate the reconciling of family and working life is a major consideration for parents who wish to have a career outside the home as well as fulfil family responsibilities.  A number of Irish employers have implemented policies to help reconcile family and working life and I welcome the Employment Equality Agency's booklet as a means of encouraging more employers and employees to adopt some of the best national and international practices in the area.  The agency's booklet shows that family friendly policies can help reduce costs and boost a company's economic performance.</P>
      <P>These policies are best put in place by agreement at the level of the enterprise in response to the particular needs of the employer and employees.  The imposition of one model across enterprises generally is not considered appropriate.  The agency will continue to support such initiatives through its information services.</P>

In the recently agreed EU Directive on Parental Leave, which I supported, an individual right to working parents to parental leave will also be introduced.  Recognition of the <Col N="2122" /> need to reconcile family and working life is also a consideration in the context of the current review of holiday legislation.</P>
    <P>However, as the Employment Equality Agency points out, formal legislation is only one factor in creating a family friendly work environment. Child care is also a key measure in this area.  I welcome the involvement of more employers in developing and supporting such initiatives.  My own Department's pilot child care project to support development of child care facilities in disadvantaged areas for working parents and parents seeking work seeks to prompt greater child care capacity through local employer and community partnership.</P>
    <P>The reconciliation of work and family responsibilities encourages job loyalty, retains skilled employees and results in better motivated and more productive staff.  The agency's action plan for the development of family friendly workplaces is aimed primarily at individual employers and their workers.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, such policies will particularly benefit women as they continue to shoulder the major share of family responsibilities.  In launching the booklet the agency's chairperson, Ms Kate Hayes, urged provision of family friendly measures in an equal opportunities context.  Forthcoming legislation will strengthen the application of equality principles in employment and it will also provide further support for women to access and participate to their full potential in the workplace.  Side by side family friendly policies and improved statutory provisions will significantly improve the position of women in employment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the workplace is changing rapidly and that there has been an increase in flexitime, part-time working, job sharing and various other measures to suit present needs?  Will he also agree it is important for women to have an opportunity to work outside the home and that these schemes should be developed <Col N="2123" /> for them?  Is the Minister aware that the rate for women working outside the home, at 35 per cent, is the lowest in the OECD?  We must develop these systems urgently.  I ask the Minister, in the context of the new national plan drawn up with the social partners, to press for the inclusion of family friendly initiatives in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods.  The workplace has changed and continues to change rapidly.  Women's participation in the labour force is now at 35 per cent, but it was only 28 per cent in 1971.  Some 50 per cent of all women in employment are married.  The booklet published by the Employment Equality Agency is excellent and I urge employers to study it and to work out ways to make the workplace more family friendly.  That will be to their advantage as much as to the advantage of the women who may work there.  Two examples of where the child care provisions are supported are Dublin Corporation in the public sector and Elan Pharmaceuticals in Athlone in the private sector.  We welcome these improvements.  I will draw to the attention of the negotiating partners the need to progress a family friendly environment in the workplace in the context of a future plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an excellent report which pinpoints the need to provide family friendly initiatives in the workplace. I congratulate the Minister on his initial step in providing measures for disadvantaged areas in particular. However, I urge him to go further because the situation is changing rapidly. While the numbers have increased to 35 per cent since 1971, there will be a more rapid increase over the next five to ten years.  It is important to make preparations for that.  I appeal to the Minister not to leave this report on the shelf but to act on it by organising seminars, etc. to get this message across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Woods <Col N="2124" /> for his comments, which I appreciate. The Employment Equality Agency has my full support and encouragement in its work in this regard.  I will discuss with it the possibility of holding seminars to expand our knowledge on this subject. This will be a matter for ongoing discussion between the social partners in the context of a new national plan when negotiations begin.</P>

      <P>While there are no immediate proposals to introduce legislation to provide adoptive leave for both parents, the question of leave for workers, whether men or women, to facilitate combining work and family responsibilities will be examined in the context of the implementation of the Directive on the Framework Agreement on Parental Leave.  Political agreement on this directive was reached at the Social Affairs Council on 29 March 1996.  The directive is on the agenda for adoption at the forthcoming Council on 3 and 4 June 1996 and it must be implemented in Irish law within two years of its adoption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were dealing with the Adoptive Leave Bill we put forward a proposal that men and women should be treated equally in that regard.  At that time we had the opportunity to introduce equal treatment in adoptive leave, bearing in mind that the European Union would be bringing in parental leave provisions in due course. I still think it is important that we have equal treatment in adoptive leave.  Does the Minister not consider that it would be appropriate to amend that Act to <Col N="2125" /> give men equal treatment in relation to adoptive leave as it probably will be subject to challenge in due course? Does the Minister consider that the Adoptive Leave Act should be amended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation for adoptive maternity leave was based on the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women who recommended that adoptive leave confined to women be introduced.  That legislation was prepared during the period of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, was published during the period of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government and was passed by both Houses during the term of this Government.  It was an equalising measure and was intended as such on the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in that it brought adopting mothers into line with natural mothers.</P>
      <P>The question of providing leave for adopting fathers would have to be considered in the context of leave for natural fathers and that whole question will be examined, as I have said in my reply, in the context of the implementation of the new directive which will be adopted at the forthcoming EU Council on 3 and 4 June 1996 when the whole subject will be up for review.  I will be examining that whole question on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing the Bill, the Minister relied on the fact that Fianna Fáil was involved in the initial draft of the Bill.  The difference was that I was on the opposite side of the House doing some other business and it was my task to look at the Bill from the equal treatment point of view. I believe the Minister should provide equal treatment for men and women in relation to adoptive leave.  The view we put forward has been borne out by the parental leave directive where it has been made very clear that leave in the case of adoptive leave is not a medical matter.  I made this point at the time. We know what should be done and how <Col N="2126" /> it should be done but we have to wait until Europe tells us to go ahead.  That is what bothers me about this.  The Minister says he does not have immediate proposals.  After the June meeting will he look at the situation and come back to us with proposals at an early stage? We will co-operate with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question will be considered in the context of the implementation of the new directive to be passed by the Social Affairs Council in June.  Deputy Woods would probably agree with me that the question of providing adoptive leave for fathers could not be considered on its own and would have to be considered jointly in the context of parental leave for natural fathers.  I do not think one could be dealt with in isolation as that would be inappropriate and would cause major problems.</P>
      <P>The question of parental leave must come up for consideration pursuant to the directive and in that context the whole question will be examined in my Department.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the recommendations contained in the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community impact on a wide range of policy areas which are the responsibility of a number of Ministers, the Government established an interdepartmental working group to consider its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> The report of the interdepartmental working group was considered by Government on 26 March 1996 and a strategy was approved as a response to the report of the task force.</P>
    <P>This Government strategy contained a range of initiatives which included the setting up of a special unit in the Department of the Environment to monitor the implementation of the five-year strategy for traveller accommodation put forward by the Minister for the Environment.  It approved in principle, <i>inter alia,</i> the construction of 3,100 units of traveller accommodation and the proposals put forward by the Departments of Health and Education in the context of the report of the interdepartmental working wroup.  The timing and phasing of the implementation of the elements of the Government strategy would be agreed with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>What is necessary now, and what I understand is happening, is that relevant Departments are finalising plans of action with the object of securing the financial allocations necessary to implement their respective elements of the Government strategy.  While it is a matter for each Minister to evaluate progress in the areas for which he or she is responsible, I will, of course, maintain an active interest in how the implementation process develops.  I am committed to the achievement of the targets contained in the Government strategy relating to the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody found the discussion on the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community very helpful. Would the Minister consider having the type of monitoring system that is in place for implementing the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women put in place to implement the task force report?  I am aware of the special unit in the Department of the Environment dealing with traveller issues, but we are talking about wide-ranging plans and I believe their <Col N="2128" /> implementation should be co-ordinated. Does the Minister accept that he is ideally placed to co-ordinate this, not merely having a watching brief but reporting on it on a regular basis?  Will he indicate whether that is possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the position is quite comparable to the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the monitoring arrangements we have in connection with that. The bases are somewhat different.</P>
      <P>The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community makes suggestions in section (k) on the co-ordination and implementation of the report.  It provides that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, as part of his or her responsibility for co-ordinating Government policy in relation to traveller issues, should monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.  As I said earlier, I will maintain an active interest in the development of the implementation process but it will be a matter primarily for the individual Departments and their own programmes.  The Minister for Health will have responsibility in the health area, the Minister for Education in the education area and, of course, the Minister for the Environment will have responsibility in the environment area, which is the big one. They will have their own independent monitoring groups within the Departments for that purpose and they will monitor what is happening on the ground in the various local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time Deputies will be able to raise with each of the Ministers concerned the progress of these plans in the context of their own departmental responsibilities.  My role will be that of maintaining an active interest across the spectrum, watching how the implementation process develops and helping in any way I can.  The funding and operation of the development schemes, as recommended in the task force report, will be dealt with by the individual <Col N="2129" /> Departments which have skilled people to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister will hold a watching brief and I accept that. I realise that different types of tasks are involved in the implementation of the task force's recommendations and those of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  Nevertheless, I submit to the Minister that there is a danger of fragmentation in the implementation of the recommendations.  While it may be relatively easy, because of the special unit being set up in the Department of the Environment, to ensure that the strategy in relation to accommodation is implemented, I am afraid that we may not get the necessary commitment in the other areas.  Knowing the Minister's commitment, I wonder if he would consider publishing a report from time to time on the implementation of the recommendations of the task force.  He may not want to give a specific answer now.</P>
      <P>I submitted, for priority answer, a question relating to the equal status legislation which is very pertinent to the issues in the task force's report.  It underlines, as the Minister rightly pointed out, the importance of the equal status Bill for the travelling people. Unfortunately the question was disallowed because of repetition.  The answer I received was that no further progress had been made since the last time I submitted a question of this type, which would have been the previous occasion on which we had Equality and Law Reform Question Time.</P>
      <P>This is very pertinent to the issue of travellers and the task force recommendations. Can the Minister reassure me about its progress?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The equal status Bill is currently being drafted.  The position <Col N="2130" /> remains the same.  I hope to have it published towards the end of the current year.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there need be or will be fragmentation in the implementation of the report on the travelling community.  The areas of responsibility in the departmental categories are quite clear and firmly established.  The principal Departments involved are Environment, Health and Education but others are also involved.  I will be directly answerable in respect of items such as the equal status legislation, employment equality and so on.  The other Departments will set up their own programmes.</P>
      <P>The primary object of the Department of the Environment is the provision of 3,100 units over the period of the plan.  There will be a special unit within that Department and it will be open to Deputy Keogh and others to raise questions on the progress there from time to time.  I am sure that it will be possible for the House to devise some arrangements, perhaps on an annual basis, to review and debate overall progress, just as we are debating the report at the moment.  I will be happy to have an eye to progress generally across the spectrum of the recommendations in the report.  Ministers themselves will be answerable to the House for their own areas of responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to report further to the House on my programme of measures to protect and support the family and the institution of marriage.</P>
      <P>The House will already be aware of the unprecedented programme of reform of family law and of administrative measures which were promoted in the run-up to the divorce referendum. Those measures included the Family Law Act, 1995, the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995, special social welfare legislation and tax measures, the establishment of new law centres, the reduction in waiting lists in law centres as well as the development of counselling and mediation services with the assistance of Exchequer funding. I can report progress over recent months on several fronts.</P>
      <P>The Maintenance Act, 1994 was, on the basis of an order made by me, brought into operation with effect from 25 November 1995.  On that date the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance Payments, which the 1994 Act enabled Ireland to ratify, entered into force between the State and 52 other contracting states.  That convention provides for a central authority system under which a person in a contracting state seeking maintenance from a person in another contracting state can be assisted in taking an action in that state. Our central authority for the purpose of the convention has been established in my Department.  The 1994 Act also enables the State to enter into special agreements with other states on reciprocal arrangements for the recovery of maintenance payments.  Such arrangements will exist between the State and all the federal states in the USA with effect from yesterday, 1 May 1996 following an order made under the Act on 30 April 1996 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2132" /> The Family Law Act, 1995 will come into operation with effect from 1 August 1996 on the basis of an order made by me on 16 February 1996.  That Act strengthens the law in relation to orders of the court in financial support of spouses and children following breakdown of a marriage; introduces a new type of order called a financial compensation order under which the court has power to assign a life insurance policy in favour of a spouse and dependent children: introduces a new type of order called a pension adjustment order under which the court in separation proceedings can assign an interest in an occupational pension to a spouse and dependent children; increases the age of dependency of children for the purpose of maintenance, at present 16 years or 21 years if school going, to 18 years and 23 years, respectively; gives power to the courts to order lump sum maintenance payments and secured maintenance payments in favour of a spouse and dependent children in any maintenance proceedings, not just judicial separation proceedings as heretofore; gives new power to the courts to make orders in support of spouses and children where a foreign decree of divorce or separation in respect of the marriage concerned is entitled to recognition in the State; enables the court in certain family law proceedings to order social reports from health boards or from probation and welfare officers in relation to children who are the subject of such proceedings; enables the court to provide that an attachment of earnings order may be made at the same time as an order for the payment of maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Act also increases the age of marriage from 16 to 18 years and provides for three months of notice of marriage. The Minister for Health, whose Department has responsibilities in relation to the Office of the Registrar of Marriages, recently initiated a programme of information in relation to those new provisions.</P>
    <P>The Domestic Violence Act, 1996 came into force on 27 March 1996.  It strengthens the power of the courts to <Col N="2133" /> make orders for the protection of persons in the home whose safety or welfare requires it because of the conduct of another person in the home; extends that protection to cohabitants subject to certain conditions; and strengthens the powers of arrest of gardaí to intervene in domestic violence cases.  The provision under the Act under which a health board may, in special circumstances, seek protection on a child's behalf becomes effective from 1 January 1997.  An explanatory leaflet on the various remedies under this legislation has been made widely available to all interested groups and individuals.  I can say at this early stage that experience of operation of the Act would already seem to indicate that the legislation has addressed in large measure the particular needs of victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>On 25 January 1996, on my initiative, Ireland was among the first group of signatories of the Council of Europe Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights.  That convention complements the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which has been ratified by Ireland.  The expressed object of the Council of Europe convention is to promote the rights of children in family proceedings affecting them, to grant them procedural rights and to facilitate the exercise of these rights by ensuring that children are informed of them and allowed to participate in the proceedings. The convention is at present being examined with a view to its early ratification.</P>
    <P>My Department is preparing proposals for submission to Government to improve, among other matters, aspects of the law on guardianship of children, the giving of evidence by children, and nullity.  In the preparation of those proposals various recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are being taken into account.</P>
    <P>Access to support services continues to be developed and improved.  Four new civil legal aid centres were opened in 1995 and there is provision in Exchequer funding of the Legal Aid <Col N="2134" /> Board for 1996 for a further four law centres to be opened.  Preparations for the establishment of those further centres by the Legal Aid Board are at an advanced stage.  I should also like to mention that, following consultations between my Department and the board on the form of regulations for the purposes of the Civil Legal Aid Act, the regulations are in the course of being formally drafted.</P>
    <P>These are the family law measures which have engaged or are engaging the attention of my Department, and, of course, other Departments have been or are engaged in matters which come within their own areas of responsibility. The Government's strategy in relation to the family continues to be one of strong active support and I think the House will agree that the matters I have outlined are very indicative of that approach.</P>

      <P>The Minister in recent statements has said that the divorce Bill is ready for the Dáil so I take it that it is virtually, or in all practical terms, ready.  Of course, it is awaiting the outcome of the present proceedings in the Supreme Court.  However, in the course of the debate before the referendum on divorce the Government agreed to go further over a period in terms of protection for children.  It agreed to have a plan for the future which would provide for additional measures, such as enhancing the status of marriage, greater emphasis on counselling, notwithstanding what has been done to date and noted by the Minister here today, helping families in need, providing time-out for parents, improved mediation services and a whole range of activities, including a commissioner for children &mdash; of which the Government might have its own version.  There was general agreement here and the Taoiseach joined in agreeing in general terms the <Col N="2135" /> need for a five year action plan in conjunction with the putting of the referendum to the people.</P>
      <P>According to recent reports from the Law Reform Commission, the family law system is now not just regarded as being in crisis &mdash; the crisis is now chronic.  It needs urgent attention.  The Minister did not mention it when he referred to his list, although it is possibly among the matters he would regard as being under another Department.</P>
      <P>These measures require attention. They require a plan in conjunction with the new legislation.  It is that further plan and those further developments on which I would like to hear the Minister. I want a commitment that those developments will be treated with the same level of urgency as is evident in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the divorce Bill is virtually ready and is awaiting the outcome of the proceedings before the Supreme Court.  I thank Deputy Woods for the excellent document which he and the Fianna Fáil Party prepared on this question in September.</P>
      <P>He must agree that many of the matters recommended and suggested by him in his report have been, and continue to be, implemented.  I would refer to the huge increase in counselling moneys which the Government has provided, and which were also provided by the Government of which both he and I were members.  This funding has changed the counselling services and put them on a different basis, enabling them to expand their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of counselling for children is a matter which I continue to raise on an ongoing basis with the counselling agencies.  More and more of these agencies are becoming aware of the need to have more specialised counselling provided for children.  Some agencies are already responding to that and it is good to see it.  The Government is doing its job in this regard.  As a result of increased Government funding, <Col N="2136" /> hugely increased and more proficient services are being provided all around the country.  It is good to be able to report that to the House and I am sure Members appreciate it.</P>
    <P>The mediation service is being expanded substantially.  The Government's new centre in Limerick will be opened formally later this month. Advertisements for additional staff are being published at present.  I will be dealing at greater length with that service in reply to another question.</P>
    <P>With regard to law centres and the availability of advice to families in difficulty, I have referred on many occasions to the huge sea change which has taken place in that service since the Department of Equality and Law Reform took over responsibility for it.  It is a changed service.  The morale is high in a way in which it has never been before.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest admiration for the people, who are of the highest calibre, working in the offices established in the new areas.  A good deal of legislation has been introduced, including the Family Law Act, the Domestic Violence Act and the Civil Legal Aid Act.  A children's Bill dealing with a number of matters is being prepared in the Department. Any unbiased commentator would agree a great deal of effort on the monetary, administrative and legislative sides has been made by the Government. I concede that many of the projects were initiated by the previous Government.  I appreciate the resources made available to my Department at that time which continue to be provided. This is an ongoing process and it will continue with the support of the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, as the Minister said, more resources have been made available for mediation and counselling services.  The Minister specifically mentioned counselling for children. Will he indicate if there is a degree of co-ordination with the psychological service in the Department of Education in this regard?  If there is such co-ordination, it should be explored.  Will the <Col N="2137" /> Minister agree that early intervention in terms of a psychological service in schools is often helpful?  Will he indicate if there is co-ordination with the counselling services, to which he referred, in cases of family difficulties?  Has that been explored and, if so, to what degree?</P>

      <P>I do not have specific information to hand as to what degree of consultation may take place between the counselling institutions and the Department of Education.  I am sure the Department of Education would have information on that, but I imagine that at a professional level there must be some interplay between them.  I have emphasised to the counselling agencies, which receive substantial amounts of Government funding through my Department to provide such essential and important services, the need to expand specific child-orientated counselling and they are responding.  One of the agencies has set up a separate entity for it, Teen Between, and it has advertised that quite extensively.  Many of the other grant-aided marriage counselling agencies have also been active in this regard.  We have ongoing discussions with the agencies and the increased funding made available to them enables them to pay more particular attention to that matter and to provide training for their counsellors.  It is important that should be done.  It is a skilled occupation and not everybody is suited to it. ACCORD, the biggest such counselling organisation, with which the Department has a strong and fruitful relationship, is careful in terms of the people it recruits as counsellors.  I am happy with its work, the rate of progress and that it puts the money it receives from my Department to good use.</P>

      <P>It is our objective to support the Minister and strengthen his hand in obtaining the necessary resources having regard to the new legislation.  The Minister did not reply to the question about the chronic crisis in the family law area.  The crisis will <Col N="2138" /> become much worse when the provisions of the legislation in question are implemented.  As the Minister said, the series of new Acts is valuable, but the resulting increase in the number of cases has increased the pressure on family courts.  Once the provisions of the new legislation are implemented the pressure will further increase.  Advance planning is required to expedite cases in the family law courts.  I accept this is not the Minister's direct responsibility, but I ask him to request his Cabinet colleagues to address this matter in advance of the enactment of that legislation.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Woods said, the provision of family courts and court organisation in general is the responsibility of another Minister, the Minister for Justice.  I am sure the next day she takes questions, the Deputy will discuss this matter with her and she will be happy to explain to him the Government's programme in this area.  I am aware she is intensively examining the recent report of the Law Reform Commission, will take note of what it says and make plans accordingly.  The House will be aware that as an interim measure the Government announced the appointment of an appreciable number of new judges to the District and Circuit Courts as well as other courts, but the District and Circuit Courts deal primarily with family law matters.  The provision of those new judges will go a long way towards bringing the backlog under control and I look forward to that being done with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>Each Minister is responsible for implementing the gender balance policy in her or his area.</P>
      <P>My Department monitors progress in appointing women to State boards on a regular basis and I am currently examining ways to make the policy more effective.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that substantial progress has already been made in relation to gender balance on boards.  Women's representation in all appointments, including external nominations from nominating bodies, increased from 15 per cent in 1992 to 25.3 per cent at 1 February 1996 and from 17 per cent to 32.5 per cent of ministerial nominations in the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It appears not anybody in his Department is designated to oversee what might happen in terms of achieving gender balance in other Departments. The issue of gender balance was discussed here previously, particularly on one occasion when the issue of women as secretaries of Departments was discussed.  The Government has actively promoted the issue of gender balance, but I question if, at times, it overrides other considerations and if some people may be promoted on the basis of gender rather than merit.  Will the Minister comment on that?  The Minister referred to the appointment of the new judges, but I wonder if the issue of gender balance rather than the merits of the candidates concerned was taken into consideration?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenneally's question raises complex issues under national and European law and major advances in this area are occurring at European and national levels.  Merit is a key factor in terms of promotion, but the Deputy's question relates to the issue of nominations, primarily to State boards.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question referred to gender policy which covers a wide area.  The Government's policy in that regard is to attain a minimum representation of 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men on State boards and we are working towards that goal.</P>
      <P>It is not just this Government which is hot on this issue; it was also the policy of the previous Government.  Progress has been made and I hope to attain the objective during the lifetime of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied &mdash; I accept that one can never be fully satisfied until an objective is achieved &mdash; with the progress made in ensuring 40 per cent representation by women on State boards?  What is his view on the gender balance at senior level in Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be satisfied until the objective has been attained and we must work towards it.  I am not sure to what specifically Deputy Keogh is referring but appointment to a position depends on the number of applicants and who they are.  For example, a post could be advertised for which there was no woman applicant.  The situation varies from case to case and one has to look at the overall picture.  This subject was neglected for many years and there is a huge backlog of imbalance to be worked through.  Many factors have adversely affected the involvement of women in the middle and upper management ranges in the public and private sectors. This imbalance must be tackled in many ways and the Employment Equality Bill, which I hope to publish shortly, will address this in large measure.  There is also an attitudinal aspect which must be addressed.  Both angles have to be taken into account and the Government is attempting to give a lead in this regard by encouraging gender balance and equal opportunities.  This is our primary aim rather than preferential positions which may give rise to some difficulties <Col N="2141" /> under European law.  Equal opportunities are attainable and these are a prime objective of Government policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I know negotiations are taking place but does the Minister agree that the embargo on recruitment to the Civil Service where one post in three was filled is a factor in this issue? Will he deal with my earlier question about promotions to judicial positions?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Judicial appointments depend on the eligible people.  The number of women at the Bar from whom the Judiciary is drawn is considerably smaller than the number of men. The pool from which these appointments are drawn is not, therefore, balanced. I hope there is a move towards equality of opportunity from which the pool could be drawn.  The filling of appointments depends on each case but the Government is concerned to ensure that the maximum move is made in that direction, consistent with the vacancies which arise and the qualified applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that people are appointed on merit and that women who do not get certain posts may not have the necessary ability. However, my experience is otherwise in that women who have the ability and merit do not seem to be able to get into top positions.  This is probably because men usually decide who gets the job. Perhaps the Minister should be looking at the composition of the interview and selection boards.  There is probably a general requirement for one woman to be appointed to such boards but consideration should be given to having 40 per cent representation by women on them.  Last year in reply to a parliamentary question I was informed that there were 40 women at principal officer level, the key level.  If women cannot obtain principal officer posts then they <Col N="2142" /> cannot be appointed as assistant secretaries or secretaries.  The structures are very important and the Minister should ascertain the inhibiting factors and bring them to the attention of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex question and many learned reports analyse why these factors apply.  We could spend much time discussing these issues if the Ceann Comhairle allowed us but I am sure he would not.  Suffice it to say that the kind of scenario depicted by Deputy Woods whereby a suitably qualified woman does not get a position because she is a woman is totally unacceptable and must not and should not apply.  The Employment Equality Bill will be designed in large measure to ensure that this is not acceptable, is regarded as discrimination and is unlawful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be all of those things but that is what happens.  The Minister said that the pool of women from which judges are appointed is smaller than the pool of men.  Does he agree that even though there are fewer men than women in the educational sphere, amazingly it tends to be men who are promoted?  Notwithstanding the long overdue Employment Equality Bill, will the Minister agree that it is within his remit to ensure that the 40 per cent objective is attained in the Civil Service?  Women are being prevented from attaining senior positions in the Civil Service for the reasons outlined by Deputy Woods.  However, there seems to be a degree of unwillingness to challenge this anomaly, I would like to know whether the Minister can effect change or whether we have to wait for legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of appointments in the Civil Service is governed by the appropriate legislation for which the Minister for Finance has overall responsibility.  Any questions relating to its detail should be addressed to him, especially if a particular case is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> The legislation in place since the mid-1970s governing employment equality and equal treatment is being updated. Provisions will be introduced which will be of assistance, but it is not just a matter of introducing legislation as attitudinal change is required.  It also requires determination on the part of women who have been discriminated against, within the meaning of legislation, to do something about it, as many of them do successfully.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency has skilled personnel available who will advise those who care to consult them as to their rights and the remedies.  If there has been discrimination, the agency will assist them in having their rights vindicated in the appropriate manner.  I urge any woman who feels that she has been discriminated against to consult the agency to obtain its advice and do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the learned books on the subject.  If he were to appoint to interview boards some of the many women with experience in business who are very sharp and bright and know what is needed, he would get better results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that what is needed is critical mass in terms of the number of women at senior level.  A woman who hopes to advance within any organisation does not want to point to legislation to prove her point, rather she wants to be appointed on merit and given an equal chance.  The odds, however, are stacked against women.  It is disgraceful and outrageous that there are so few women at senior level in the Civil Service which should give a lead. The issue of women as specific role models could be addressed by appointing them to State boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue. Instead of retreating behind legislation does the Minister accept that he should take a more pro-active approach in securing equality of treatment and opportunity for women, particularly within the Civil Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I am doing.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that women should have a role in all the institutions of State, pervading through influential positions on State boards, to build up the critical mass needed.  I am working strongly, as is the Government, to achieve this.  Let us take the composition of the Legal Aid Board as an example.  All the members of the board appointed during the currency of the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fail Government were men whereas 50 per cent of the new board recently appointed by me are women.</P>
      <P>We are and will continue to make progress.  The situation is improving as a result of Government action and decision.  I will be working with my colleagues in Government to proceed with this rate of improvement to build up the critical mass needed, something successive Governments signally failed to do. Much work remains to be done, but I intend to continue working to achieve progress in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12, 15, 18 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I have not yet received the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities although I understand that the commission expects to submit it to me shortly.  Good progress has been made by the <i>ad hoc</i> establishment group since I set it up in April of last year and I am advised that the work on drafting the provisional constitution for the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities is close to completion.  The interim council is due to be set up at a national convention in Dublin Castle on 25 June next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission has been examining the current situation of people with a <Col N="2146" /> disability, including people with a mental handicap, and the organisation and adequacy of existing services, both public and voluntary, to meet their needs. The commission's report is expected to recommend the most far-reaching proposals for ending the marginalisation of people with disabilities since the foundation of the State.  Its recommendations will, I am informed, involve a combination of legislative solutions, new policy initiatives and new structures for delivery of quality services within a framework of rights, not charity.  Until I receive the report, however, and have had the opportunity of considering its specific recommendations, I do not consider it appropriate to comment further on what it may contain.  I am looking forward to receiving the commission's report and will give its recommendations very careful consideration to see what measures will be required by me, and my colleagues in Government, to improve the position of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>An officer of my Department is a member of the monitoring committee on the employment of people with disabilities which operates under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> IBEC is also represented on this committee which pays particular attention to the issue of facilitating the employment of people with disabilities in both the public and private sectors. My Department also maintains contact with IBEC with a view to exploring possibilities for improving the employment prospects for people with disabilities in the private sector.  In this way, I am kept informed of developments and can consider any actions, in my area of responsibility, which might be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The commission's report, I understand, will deal comprehensively with the issue of the training and employment of people with disabilities and will be making recommendations geared towards significantly improving the employment prospects of people with disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all looking forward to the publication of the commission's report.  The Minister seems to think, if I understood him correctly, that it would be inappropriate to act on a variety of issues which may have been raised with the commission in the many submissions it has received, including access, mobility and the implementation of building regulations, until he receives its report.  Has a watching brief been kept and recommendations made in the interim, such as the dishing of footpaths, to alleviate these difficulties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a large number of submissions on a wide variety of matters have been made to the commission.  We must await its report and recommendations on how best they may be implemented.</P>
      <P>I do not have the data to enable me preview the recommendations or their manner of implementation.  However, when I receive them I will examine them carefully.  The commission will deal with a wide range of matters covering all aspects of the lives of those with disability.  I am proceeding with the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill without awaiting the commission's report.  Both measures will impact substantially on the lives of people with disability.  Other matters will need to be examined when the commission's report is published.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister pursue his goal through legislation or incentives for voluntary action?  Since the early 1980s we have been encouraging the development of access to buildings, sporting facilities, education, jobs and so on.  Deputy Keogh mentioned footpaths, roads, etc.  Although a great deal has been done voluntarily, progress in these areas is far too slow.  Legislation must be introduced to ensure that there is access to all new buildings and facilities. It should not be an option at this stage.  How is Part M of the building regulations monitored?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Building regulations are a <Col N="2148" /> matter for the Minister for the Environment and I suggest the Deputy raises them with him.  As regards legislation and voluntary incentives, both have a role to play.  Every possible step will be taken to change attitudes.  The response has varied from firm to firm and agency to agency.  For example, Aer Rianta has done wonders in this regard.  My Department introduced an incentive scheme, which culminated in a series of programmes on RTE dealing with the work done by many companies in the public and private sectors.  It was remarkable to see what was achieved on a voluntary basis.  The scheme is being renewed this year.  I agree with the Deputy that voluntary incentives on their own will not achieve what is required.  The legislative element involved must be provided in a calculated and measured way.  The legislation being prepared will provide a reasonable balance and we will discuss the detail during its passage through the House.</P>

As regards equality of services, particularly for those with mental handicap, the Minister is aware that thousands of people are inappropriately placed.  Such people cannot fight their case and are unable to avail of the services they require.  The Minister for Health would be able to give the numbers involved off the top of his head.  We do not need reports or recommendations but rather a Government that is prepared to make funds available.  Will the Minister do so?</P>

This was specifically mentioned in the commission's update last November. Building regulations might be the specific responsibility of the Minister for the Environment but is the Minister saying that the recommendations, which would make life easier for people with disability, will be ignored until the final report is issued?  My father is disabled and most of the time he is a prisoner in his home because of the lack of facilities in this city.  I accept that there are wide ranging issues but the Minister's Department should act upon recommendations which could make life easier for the disabled.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the points made by Deputy Keogh.  The report has not been issued nor have any recommendations been made.  A large number of submissions was made to the commission but I cannot act on the recommendations until I receive them, which I understand will be soon.  As far as building regulations are concerned, the Minister for the Environment and his staff are responsible for building and <Col N="2150" /> construction matters, local authority issues and so on.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Keogh has a specific complaint or information about that matter she should raise it with the Minister for the Environment.  If the reply is unsatisfactory from an equality point of view she can then refer it to me and I will be happy to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the debate on this Bill I have been <Col N="2201" /> very receptive to amendments and suggestions made by all sides of the House on aspects of the legislation.  The principles of the Bill are not in any way politically divisive.  There was general agreement on all sides of the House about the desirability of introducing legislation to provide a commercial focus for our major ports.  I was very happy to take on board many of the contributions and suggestions made by Members of this House and the Seanad, particularly as many Members who contributed have experience of membership of harbour boards.  It is worth recalling that in the course of the debate on the legislation 77 amendments were made by the Dáil on Committee Stage and a further 41 on Report Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and 28 were made by the Seanad, many of them at the suggestion of bodies which are interested in port activity.  In view of that I am disappointed at the tone of some of the debate today, particularly on this amendment.  It seems to be based on a wish to dredge and trawl for some issue on which to create a political row.</P>
      <P>Specifically the suggestion was made that the Government does not intend to provide for representation of business interests on the harbour companies, but nothing could be further from the truth. I repeatedly stated in this debate that the members to be appointed to the boards of harbour companies will be drawn from business and professional interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the suggestion by Deputy Molloy that I have a bias against the business community and his attempt to paint an ideological caricature of a Democratic Left Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing that every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Deputy Molloy that it is an honour to pilot this <Col N="2202" /> Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will establish ports as semi-State companies with a clear commercial focus.  The aim is to increase trade and tourism through our ports and to reduce costs for port users so that business and industry can compete more effectively in the European market.  I remind the Deputy also that I am responsible for port development and overseeing a programme of investment of £135 million in our ports aimed at improving facilities at ports for the benefit of business and industry and ensure they can compete more effectively and get better use from our ports.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to what has been called vested interests.  I did not invent the term &ldquo;vested interests&rdquo; in the context of harbours.  That term was used by the review body when it examined the existing structures for the management and governance of our harbours.  It considered the position where there are harbour authorities of up to 29 members, with appointments made by chambers of commerce, the Irish livestock trade, IBEC, the ICTU, shipping interests and so on.</P>
      <P>The review body concluded that large representative boards of that kind were not conducive to the type of business ports must do in the competitive world in which they operate.  It recommended that the boards should be significantly smaller than they are at present and that what it called &ldquo;vested interests&rdquo; should be excluded from being represented on the harbour boards.</P>
      <P>The specific recommendation of excluding vested interests has not been accepted by the Government.  There is nothing to prevent somebody involved in a company operating at a port being nominated to the board of that company, subject to the usual requirements about conflict of interests, declarations, etc.  It is wrong to put forward the idea &mdash; as if it were an invention of mine &mdash; that because somebody was engaged in commercial activity at or near a port they were <i>de facto</i> excluded from representation on the port company.  That practice will not be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle at stake here, namely, <Col N="2203" /> the question of representation by the business community, is accepted by the Government and it has been repeated many times that the members of the port company will be drawn from the business and professional communities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy signalled his intention earlier to divide the House on this amendment but I remind him that the amendment establishes that principle clearly and provides for a system of formal consultation with a range of bodies, chambers of commerce and IBEC.  As I <Col N="2204" /> indicated earlier, it also provides for the facility to extend the range of bodies which can be consulted to include, as appropriate, where a port has particular leisure interests, for example, the various bodies representing those interests. That is a reasonable proposition.  It is clearly underlining in the legislation the Government's intention to ensure that the best people are appointed to manage and govern our port companies and that they have suitable commercial business experience and competence.</P>

      <P>It was brought to my attention that it was unclear whether section 41 as passed by Dáil Éireann applied to retired persons in receipt of pensions from harbour authorities.  I thought existing harbour authority pensioners were protected under sections 96 and 12 (1) (a) (i), but I accept those sections are vague and unsatisfactory.  I undertook to clarify the matter and did so on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that port companies continue to pay pensions to retired employees. Amendment No. 14 is a technical amendment inserted on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork Port has a pension fund of £13.6 million which needs to be increased to approximately £19 million. Dublin Port does not have a pension fund, but a fund of approximately £50 million is needed.  A total of £32 million is required to fulfil past liability and <Col N="2207" /> approximately £18 million for future liabilty. Limerick Port has a fund of £1.3 million which needs to be increased to approximately £2 million.  Waterford Port does not have a fund, but one of about £4 million is needed.  The position in the other ports varies.  In many cases insurance type schemes operate which have been provided for in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Pensioners and employees of harbour boards need not be concerned about their pensions, they will be paid.  This amendment provides belt and braces security for retired harbour company workers.  Irrespective of what happens their pensions will be paid.</P>
      <P>The question of how funds will be established is not as clear cut.  A firm of consultants has examined the financial positions of the various ports and published a report on the matter.  At departmental level we are discussing with the various port companies the requirements they will have to meet to establish pension funds.  While the legislation provides a guarantee that if worse comes to worst the State will pay the pensions, it has been made clear to port companies that the responsibility for establishing pension funds rests with them.  We expect the companies to ensure they can establish the necessary funds.  I am confident they can do this because, due to the growth in the economy, port activity is increasing rapidly and their trading positions are improving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland is responsible for establishing standards for a wide range of products and processes and for the certification of these standards.  This work is undertaken in direct co-operation with Irish industry together with international regulatory authorities under the auspices of the European Commission and other standards agencies which have a recognised world-wide remit.</P>
      <P>In the interests of individual consumers and to facilitate growth in trade and commerce, the mutual recognition and achievement of established standards is an absolute essential in the contemporary world.  The main purpose of bringing this Bill before the House is to establish the NSAI as an independent and autonomous agency and in so doing to underpin and enhance its role in the development and certification of a wide range of standards.</P>
      <P>The need to establish this agency on a legally independent basis results from a requirement of the European Commission and the necessity for the NSAI to have an administrative structure which is seen to be independent of all other client agencies.  The current administrative and operational status of the NSAI, as a committee within the ambit of Forfás, is not in line with these requirements and accordingly this legislation will give effect to the change in its status which my Department has been independently advised as being legally necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2210" /> The principal purpose of standardisation is to facilitate trade and to establish common criteria for particular products or processes.  Standardisation seeks to achieve: protection of consumer interests by ensuring adequate and consistent quality of goods and services; economy of effort, materials, energy consumption in the production of goods or the provision of services; enhancement of public safety, health and protection of the environment; and the elimination of technical barriers to trade.</P>
    <P>The agreement of all interested parties is essential if the benefits of standardisation are to be achieved.  The main advantages which agreed standards confer are: the limitation of unnecessary variation in design and manufacturing procedures, giving more stability to production and marketing for the manufacturer and simplifying procurement for the purchaser; the interchangeability of component parts giving access to wider markets for the manufacturer and a choice of suppliers to the purchaser; improved communications and information exchange between the manufacturer and the purchaser by reference to standards documents containing agreed requirements for design and performance; and increased confidence that goods ordered will comply with the required criteria and that quality and reliability can be assured.</P>
    <P>The degree to which any product or process functions satisfactorily depends on the adequacy of the relevant standard specifications and the assurance of conformity to those standards.  This clearly is an increasingly important task and one which has been well delivered to date in this country by the NSAI.</P>
    <P>The NSAI currently operates a semiautonomous committee of Forfás and was established under section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1993.  Its functions are the promulgation and formulation of standards on behalf of the Minister and the certification of products and processes that comply with these standards.  The NSAI was originally set up under section 17 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961 to assist and advise the board of <Col N="2211" /> the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards (IIRS) in relation to standards. In this context the IIRS was required: to formulate for the Minister in accordance with his directions specifications for such commodities, processes and practices as the Minister may from time to time request; with the consent of the Minister, to declare any specification so formulated to be a standard specification for the commodity, process or practice to which it relates; to make recommendations to the Minister as to the provision and use of standard marks for commodities, processes and practices which conform to standard specifications, and to test and analyse commodities, intended for sale or for use by the public, for the purpose of ensuring conformity with standard specifications and encouraging the standardisation of commodities, processes and practices, or generally, with the object of ascertaining for the public benefit, the characteristics of such commodities.</P>
    <P>The 1961 Act provided for the development of a body of standards by reference to existing national and international norms, provided for standards related to public health and safety and contained powers to make these standards mandatory.  It also established an Irish Standard Mark scheme under which Irish manufacturers can, under licence from NSAI, demonstrate that their product meets the performance and safety requirements of a particular standard relative to that product.</P>
    <P>In discharging its statutory functions, there are two broad categories of service which NSAI provides &mdash; standards development and product and process certification.  These services have now become central in their significance and an important aspect in enhancing the competitiveness of our industry and services sectors.</P>
    <P>The standards development service provides Irish industry with the opportunity of making an input to national, European and international standards. It does this by means of its standards membership scheme and its national consultative committees.  The standards membership scheme provides Irish <Col N="2212" /> industry with up-to-date information on developments in relation to standards and technical regulations at national, European and international level.</P>
    <P>Frequent meetings are held throughout the country at which the standards and technical regulations are explained and individual manufacturers are invited to demonstrate the effects of standards and regulations on their businesses.</P>
    <P>In addition NSAI has established 14 consultative committees, each one dedicated to a particular business sector, in which requirements for individual standards or the Irish position in relation to European or international standards is determined.</P>
    <P>The certification service operated by NSAI has had a dramatic impact in Ireland over the past five years.  The fact that over 1,000 Irish companies are now registered to the ISO 9000 series of standards for quality management systems indicates a clear recognition of the importance of developing and improving management systems.  By end 1997 there will be over 2,000 Irish companies registered by NSAI.  Each company registered remains subject to a continuing programme of monitoring inspections for as long as their registration is valid.</P>
    <P>Product and process certification is also an important service provided by NSAI.  With increasing numbers of products being submitted for certification as complying with specified requirements in the EU directives, demand for this service is expected to continue to grow.</P>
    <P>A range of additional EU directives, which seek to reduce the barriers to international trade and give reality to the concept of a common market, are currently under discussion or in the process of being implemented.  Compliance with these requirements will involve continuing growth in the service of product certification provided by the NSAI.</P>
    <P>The elimination of technical barriers to trade was recognised by the EU as a priority task in the programme for the completion of the Single Market.  Since the adoption by the Council of a new <Col N="2213" /> approach to technical harmonisation and standardisation in 1985, the harmonisation of European industrial standards addressed in EU techinical legislation has become an essential instrument in achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the European Commission recognised that a major problem was being encountered in the development of regulations and directives designed to increase safety and remove barriers to trade across the entire Community.  The difficulty specifically related to the inclusion of technical specifications in the body of the regulations and directives. It was decided that they should specify only the essential requirement, quality, performance and safety, and devolve responsibility for drafting the relevant standards to the European standardisation bodies, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI.  This freed up the process and several new approach directives have since been adopted covering a diverse range of products such as toys, machinery and medical devices.  The European standards bodies are given mandates to provide manufacturers of the products concerned with a set of technical specifications recognised in the directives as giving a presumption of conformity to the essential requirements.</P>
    <P>In a separate initiative, the Commission has given these harmonised European standards a prominent role in opening up public procurement markets. Directives on public supplies and works, telecommunications, transport, energy and water supply require purchasing entities to refer to national standards, transposing European standards, with a view to ensuring that manufacturers in all member states have an even chance to obtain these public procurement contracts.</P>
    <P>In more recent times the EU is negotiating mutual recognition agreements on standards with third countries US-Canada, New Zealand-Australia and Japan to name a few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This serious problem has obtained in Ballyvaughan for the past four or five years, with raw sewerage flowing from the bay to a tract of land located about one and a half miles outside Ballyvaughan, known locally as &ldquo;the Ryan&rdquo; and a sandy beach about the same distance from the town.  Bearing in mind the many different walks and other attractive tourist amenities in the area, this problem must be tackled expeditiously.</P>
      <P>The raw sewage is seeping from manholes right along the coast road, near the pier in Ballyvaughan, affecting dwellinghouses, restaurants and public houses in the area.  Indeed the direction of the wind determines whether residents can open their windows.  There is no question of my attempting to exaggerate its consequences since this has already been described as a public health nuisance by the supervisory environmental health officer of the MidWestern Health Board.</P>
      <P>It will be readily appreciated that Ballyvaughan is a high tourist amenity area where a number of extra dwellings, both permanent and holiday homes, are being constructed.</P>
      <P>The problem is perceived not only as a public nuisance but a health hazard to local residents.  I am informed it is further exacerbated by the fact that, although pipes take this raw sewage out to sea &mdash; because of a mal-functioning valve &mdash; the incoming tide brings it back to the shore.  I hope the Minister will seek urgent funding and assist Clare County Council to remedy this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the associated problem of an inadequate water supply in Ballyvaughan where, last summer, many local residents had to draw their own water supplies from old wells.  These wells need to be cleaned and the pipes leading from them into reservoirs also require urgent attention.  Clare County Council installed a borehole just outside <Col N="2215" /> Newtowncastle, on which residents of Ballyvaughan must rely for their water supplies, which with old wells &mdash; when the pipes leading from them to the reservoir have been attended to &mdash; would help to alleviate the local water supply problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will inform the House of the position of the Doolin-Lisdoonvarna water supply scheme &mdash; at present under examination in Brussels &mdash; which I understand will be grant-aided from European Union Cohesion Funds.  I am also informed that Clare County Council awaits approval to advertise for tenders from contractors to undertake this project.  Perhaps the Minister can inform us when it is expected that project will commence.  I brought these matters to the attention of the Minister today because they should be dealt with immediately.  I hope we hear good news from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the inability of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to attend but I am happy to reply on his behalf.  I thank Deputy de Valera for raising the matter and I assure her that I will bring the matter to the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to give a brief outline of Clare County Council's proposals for Ballyvaughan and other locations in the Burren and north Clare area.  Ballyvaughan is located on the periphery of the Burren. Its existing sewage collection and treatment system was constructed in the 1960s and comprises a collection system and septic tank treatment which discharges to the bay by way of a short sea outfall.  The village has grown since the system was put in place and the population also increases significantly during the tourist season.  Other towns in the Burren region have also experienced substantial growth, particularly as regards recent tourism related development. Lahinch, for example, is one of <Col N="2216" /> the centres designated under the resort area initiative.</P>
    <P>In order to meet its water and sewage needs a grant of more than £600,000 was recently approved.  This year the Department of the Environment is providing more than £121 million for water and sewerage schemes around the country. This represents an increase of more than 10 per cent on the 1995 figure. Approximately 40 new schemes, with a final value of £200 million, will commence construction this year.  In addition to the Lahinch scheme, two major sewerage schemes at Sixmilebridge and Killaloe, costing £2.7 million and £2 million respectively, are among the schemes scheduled to start this year.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment is taking full advantage of the valuable financial assistance being provided under the Cohesion Fund, which applies to transport and environmental projects. The Department has submitted applications for 75 water and sewerage projects, costing more than £400 million, to the European Commission for approval. So far, 37 applications, involving projects worth more than £200 million, have been approved.  As far as the applications related to projects in County Clare are concerned, three major projects, costing £50 million, have been prioritised and submitted to the European Commission for approval.</P>
    <P>The Burren and north Clare water services plan is an integrated water supply and sewerage proposal which will address the urgent water supply and sewerage needs of the main population centres in the Burren region, including Ballyvaughan.  The principal objective of the proposal is to protect the delicate Burren ecology system.  A key element is to provide essential environmental infrastructure for the necklace of towns along the Burren periphery.  Stage one of the Burren scheme, costing approximately £10 million, involves the construction of a water supply and sewerage scheme at Lisdoonvarna as well as the planning and design of future sewerage schemes at another eight locations, including Ballyvaughan.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council has not yet developed detailed proposals for a new <Col N="2217" /> sewerage scheme at Ballyvaughan.  It is intended, however, that stage one of the Burren scheme will provide the necessary finance for the preparation of such a proposal.  The construction of the scheme would then be considered as part of stage two of the overall proposal.</P>
    <P>The Burren proposal was submitted to the Commission in November 1994. To date there has been no decision by the Commission on the application. Pending the securing of funding, it is not possible to advance the planning of the individual elements including the Ballyvaughan scheme.  I note the Deputy's concern on this matter and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister for the Environment with a view to pressing the Commission for a decision in the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, for coming to the House to deal with an industrial dispute at An Post. The background to this problem is that a unilateral decision was made at senior management level of An Post to recruit externally for four senior secretaries. Approximately 20 internal staff applied for the jobs and I understand one was successful.  The salaries of these senior secretaries are approximately £100 more than the people with whom they are working.  The jobs were advertised as clerical assistant-typists, but are being paid as clerical officer-typist.  The advertising process was not transparent and the workers believe it was dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of anger among the work-force is apparent from their decision to take strike action.  The low paid workers are concerned about their prospects of promotion and are angry at the way management has dealt with this issue. This shambles has resulted in 260 workers being suspended today and the <Col N="2218" /> likelihood of an all-out strike from 5 p.m. tomorrow by 430 employees.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of senior management in this case has been deplorable.  I support change at An Post, the introduction of new technology and automation, but this should take place in consultation with workers and their trade unions. The fact that there is a prospect of 480 people going on strike is a sad indictment of the type of senior management at An Post.  Senior management has acted in a dictatorial manner in taking unilateral decisions on recruitment outside agreed procedures.  This will result in serious disruption to many essential services provided by An Post, such as savings certificates and bonds, bill payments for gas and telephone and other services.  The prospect of disruption to social welfare payments will have devastating consequences for thousands of social welfare recipients.  The behaviour of senior management is totally unacceptable. Management should bring staff with them when implementing changes, rather than acting in such a way as to invite conflict.</P>
    <P>The Minister should intervene to ensure that management follows normal industrial relations procedures, restores confidence and morale among the work-force and ensures that this all-out strike, which will have devastating consequences for the employees and for the public, does not take place.  We, on this side of the House, are aware of many outstanding problems at An Post and we know that blame can be placed on both sides in many disputes.  Steady progress is being made on many issues.  It is a pity this matter has grown to this level and that an issue involving four people could mean that 480 people will go on strike.  I call on the Minister to intervene directly to ensure this conflict goes no further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing his time with me.  The Civil and Public Service Union has served seven days' notice on An Post with effect from tomorrow at 5 p.m.  The first protest action will take place at the GPO on Saturday and picketing will resume on <Col N="2219" /> Tuesday, 7 May.  The industrial action arises from a dispute over the filling of four secretarial posts, which were previously internal promotion opportunities. Only one of the present appointments is an internal appointment and three are external.  The appointments were made at a different point on the scale than previous similar appointments.  There was no consultation, negotiation or agreement with the CPSU on the appointments or the procedures for the appointments.</P>
      <P>It appears that An Post is seeking to establish a two tier appointment and payments system, depending on the separation of internal and external appointment procedures.  As a result, over 200 members of the union are currently off the payroll and there is a danger that the dispute will escalate into an all-out strike not only for the 430 people who will be immediately affected, but also for other An Post employees.  Proper promotion procedures must be adhered to because that is a basic principle of industrial relations and workers' rights.</P>
      <P>An Post is making considerable profits with the co-operation of the unions and the workers.  There is ongoing rationalisation but there must not be unilateral developments.  Management also has its responsibilities.  I call on management to bring about an urgent settlement to this dispute which could escalate into an all-out strike and affect a huge number of services and people throughout the country.  It could also jeopardise any future good relationship between the workers and the management of An Post.</P>
      <P>Over recent years An Post has been bedevilled by industrial disputes.  Will the Minister indicate today whether progress is being made to resolve this dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies for raising this issue.  Everyone shares their concerns about the potential impact of this dispute.  Approximately 400 administrative staff, members of CPSU, based in headquarters at the GPO and in College House are in dispute with management <Col N="2220" /> over the filling of secretarial posts for senior managers in the company.  A range of complicated issues are involved.</P>
      <P>An Post initially advertised the vacancies internally and then externally. The interview panel established for the competition was chaired by an independent person and selected two candidates, from An Post and one from outside it.  The central feature of the dispute is that CPSU is of the view that the candidate appointed from outside the company is being paid more than the internal appointee.  The CPSU contends also that the external candidate was appointed to a different grade from the internal appointee.  The company's position is that the rate of pay is the same for both candidates and the salaries of the successful candidates are in keeping with their level of experience.  Management and CPSU negotiators held direct discussions on Tuesday, 23 April and agreed proposals to resolve the dispute emerging from that meeting, however, the proposals were rejected by the majority of members of the CPSU.  As a result, strike notice was served on the company on Friday, 26 April to expire on Friday, 3 May at 5 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that direct talks are continuing between CPSU and management in an effort to resolve the dispute.  I take this opportunity to urge the parties to continue their negotiations in an attempt to resolve this dispute. The services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available to assist the parties in dispute, if required.  I invite the parties to avail of the services of the Labour Relations Commission if the outcome of their negotiations is unsuccessful.</P>

      <P>As the matters to be raised by Deputies O'Rourke and Harney are very similar it is suggested that each Deputy should make her contribution and the Minister <Col N="2221" /> for Enterprise and Employment will reply to both, if that is satisfactory.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we finally managed to get this matter on the clár. We were facilitated by the Ceann Comhairle earlier in the week on other matters.</P>
      <P>This week there was very sad news for part of south-west County Dublin and unless steps are taken immediately there will be a second industrial disaster there.  Rathcoole and Tallaght are only up the road from each other.  The loss of 800 jobs at Packard Electric represents a very serious blow to this area of Dublin but to have another 400 plus jobs in the balance at Airmotive Ireland is beyond belief in the present climate.</P>
      <P>The dispute has been ongoing for a month and has received constant exposure in the media but so far the Minister and the Department have adopted a hands-off attitude.  In many instances that can work but from time to time there is a clear demand for a hands-on approach.  This is one of them. We now face a situation where the remaining 325 staff at Airmotive will be laid off from tomorrow.  During the past month an estimated £7.5 million worth of business has been lost.  All of its contracts are in serious jeopardy and the company's long-term future will be irreparably damaged unless some action is taken quickly.</P>
      <P>This aircraft engine refurbishment facility is wholly owned by Aer Lingus. As a State company one would have expected the Government to show serious concern for those about to be laid off.  The Minister has power under the industrial relations Act to come forward at a point in a dispute &mdash; this point has been reached in the Airmotive dispute &mdash; and I urge the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton to act under those powers otherwise my genuine fear is that we will have a very serious matter on our hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Airmotive Ireland does very valuable work but unfortunately an impasse has <Col N="2222" /> been reached.  A number of staff has been laid off and by tomorrow the remaining staff are to be laid off unless something happens.  My concern is for the extended area of south-west Dublin which is suffering from extensive damage to employment.</P>
    <P>It is time to come to grips with this dispute.  I am quite well aware that there are faults on both sides of the dispute.  I have not taken on board just the complaints and representations made to me from one side but am aware of the serious difficulties both with management and workers in regard to this dispute. We should take an overview.  If it is as serious as I think, I urge the Minister to come forward with his proposals to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse everything said by Deputy O'Rourke.  The news of the ongoing dispute at Airmotive Ireland coming in the wake of the announcement that Packard Electric will pull out in July with the loss of 800 jobs is news that the people of Dublin South-West do not want to hear.  As Deputy O'Rourke has said, this ongoing dispute places the entire plant in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>Airmotive Ireland is a subsidiary of Aer Lingus and manufactures jet engines for airlines, in particular for Lufthansa.  The dispute centres around 83 craft workers who are looking for a special 10 per cent approval payment which would be an extra £30 gross per week.  The company has made it clear it has lost almost £8 million of business since the dispute began.  Airlines will not do business with a company that cannot guarantee when jet engines will be available and these craft workers are crucial to the availability of jet engines because they sign off on the jet engines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute has been with the Labour Court on two occasions and as Deputy O'Rourke said it is not a one sided dispute by any means.  Certainly, if there is not intervention and another last attempt to have independent arbitration or ministerial involvement I am very concerned that we will see the end of <Col N="2223" /> Airmotive and the loss of 433 jobs in Rathcoole which is very close to Tallaght. Many of the workers in Airmotive come from Tallaght and Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that time is of the essence and I appeal to the Minister to get involved directly or have the agencies of the State, the Labour Court and other agencies that deal with disputes of this kind involved straight away.  Certainly from tomorrow the livelihoods of all of those workers are in doubt and Dublin South-West will suffer enormously.  The Opposition are making a responsible effort to highlight this dispute.  I am not suggesting it will be easy to resolve this dispute but if we do not make an effort, we stand a serious chance of losing another employer from the area in a week when we have had nothing but bad news.</P>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to raise this on the Adjournment this evening.  I hope that as a result the Minister will be able to intervene or involve the machinery of the State in a last ditch effort to bring an end to the dispute so that production can continue at Airmotive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The ongoing dispute at Airmotive stems from a claim by a number of unions &mdash; the AWEU, the TWEU and SIPTU &mdash; who are seeking payment of a 10 per cent approval payment to approximately 80 craftspersons. The dispute was the subject of a conciliation conference hosted by the Labour Relations Commission.  It was not possible to reach agreement at that conference and the matter was subsequently referred to the Labour Court <Col N="2224" /> for investigation.  The court, in a recommendation dated 12 December 1995, did not recommend concession of the claim. The recommendation was not accepted by the workers concerned and strike action, involving a number of the work force, subsequently commenced on 1 April.</P>
      <P>The company subsequently issued protective notices to the remainder of the work force.  As a result, there have been a number of lay offs and it is possible that further lay offs may take place if the strike action continues.  The responsibility for the resolution of an industrial dispute is ultimately a matter for the parties directly involved, availing where required of the assistance of the dispute settling agencies of the State such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  I do not therefore consider it appropriate for me to intervene directly in this industrial dispute.  This is not a novel position but is a policy calculated not to undermine the labour relations machinery which has a proven track record.  This policy was adhered to by my predecessors.</P>
      <P>Our system of industrial relations leaves it up to the parties to accept or reject a recommendation from the court.  Clearly, it is not in the interests of the parties to this dispute to have disruption caused to the company or hardship caused to individuals as a result of lay off.  In the circumstances, I strongly urge that careful reconsideration be given to the Labour Court's recommendation, particularly in the light of the damage being done to the company and the hardship being suffered by the work force.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, 8 May 1996.</P>

    <P>The family mediation service of my Department is a professional confidential service which enables couples who have decided to separate or who have already separated to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a trained mediator, without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  All issues are included in the negotiations, such as ongoing parenting of the children, the family home, family finances, <Col N="2152" /> pensions, property and any other issues relevant to the separation.</P>
    <P>The current waiting period for couples availing of the family mediation service in Dublin is approximately 14 weeks.  I believe that measures currently being taken to develop the service and the development of a network of private mediators will bring about a substantial improvement in that position.</P>
    <P>As part of a programme for development and expansion of the family mediation service, two new posts of area mediation co-ordinator are being created, one for the existing family mediation centre at the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin and one for the new centre at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick.  The official opening of the new premises at Limerick is scheduled to take place later this month.  Applicants for these positions will be sought through a competition to be organised by the Civil Service Commission. The persons appointed from this competition will be responsible for delivery of a quality mediation service, with the assistance of a team of mediators, each for his or her own geographical areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The appointment of area mediation co-ordinators will facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice, who have the necessary training and experience and otherwise meet the standards set by the family mediation service, to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre.</P>

      <P>The Task Force on the Travelling Community recommended that, under the proposed equal <Col N="2153" /> status legislation, an equality authority or commission would have the powers and resources to require institutions or organisations to develop equal status policy programmes.  This recommendation, in common with other task force recommendations relating to equal status legislation, will be taken into account in the development of the equal status Bill, which is currently being drafted.</P>

      <P>A pilot childcare initiative scheme was introduced by my Department in 1994 and has continued into 1995 and 1996.  A sum of £800,000 has been included in my Department's Estimates in 1996 for the initiative.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is to assist with the establishment, on a pilot basis, of childcare measures utilising the skills of trained local people, to enable local residents to undertake education, training, retraining and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do in the absence of a childcare facility.  Grants are confined to groups in designated areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd.  This is an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local economic and social development in co-operation with relevant area partnership companies established by the Government in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An evaluation of the pilot childcare scheme to determine its effectiveness in achieving its objectives is under way and <Col N="2154" /> I am awaiting a report in the matter, which will be available later this year. Discussions between officials of my Department and members of the staff of ADM are ongoing with regard to the 1996 allocation of grants under this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 19, 30 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The waiting periods for legal aid applications in each of the 26 centres of the Legal Aid Board as of 31 March 1996 are set out in a tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.  In nine centres the waiting time was one month or less, in another nine centres the time was two <Col N="2155" /> months or less, in three centres the time was between two and three months, and in the other five centres the time was between three months and six months. This compares most favourably with the position that pertained in 1993 at the time I first took over as Minister with responsibilities in relation to legal aid. At that time the waiting period in half of the board's 16 centres was between one month and seven months and in the remainder it ranged from eight months and up to 14 months.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to ensure that the board has the resources to expand and develop its services consistent with its need to provide legal aid and advice as widely and as quickly as possible throughout the country.  The extra resources provided over the past three years, 1993, 1994 and 1995, has led to an increase in the number of full-time centres from 16 to 26 and it is my intention to open a further four centres this year at Newbridge, Navan, Tullamore and Cavan.</P>
    <P>Staff numbers in the same period have more than doubled and, notwithstanding the constraints on Civil Service staff numbers, an additional 20 posts have been authorised for the four new law centres and extra staff has been made available for the board's head office.  This inevitably had brought about a dramatic reduction in waiting lists and significantly improved access to justice.  These matters, however, continue to be subject to review and where waiting lists, for whatever reason, are unacceptable they will be addressed by the board in consultation as necessary with my Department.  Staffing levels in the board are now unprecedented and I am confident that the board will use those resources to the optimum extent possible to ensure that all centres can deliver a good and efficient service.</P>
    <P>While I have no plans to open further law centres in Dublin the new centres for counties Kildare and Meath which border on Dublin, should help alleviate the pressure on the Dublin centres, in particular those of Clondalkin, Tallaght <Col N="2156" /> and Blanchardstown.  The Legal Aid Board is committed, as I am, to improving the services of the Legal Aid Board and to provide an efficient and cost effective service to the public.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the board has special procedures in place to ensure that in certain cases, such as where the protection of a person from domestic violence is concerned, there is no delay in handling such cases.  To reduce the waiting lists which existed at the beginning of 1993 the board availed of private solicitors under a pilot project established for the purpose.  The pilot project is at present confined to the Dublin area pending completion of a review of its operation.  I am satisfied, however, that this private solicitor project has much to contribute to the enhancement of the quality of service provided by the Legal Aid Board.</P>

This section deals with the availability of capital allowances in relation to construction or refurbishment of certain multi-storey car parks and defines what is meant by &ldquo;relevant local authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment included the administrative counties of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown as well as the administrative counties of Fingal and South Dublin in the definition of &ldquo;relevant local authority&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The report of the study group on the development of the psychiatric services &mdash;<i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; forms the blueprint for the development of the psychiatric services into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a key recommendation of the report was that there should be a shift in the delivery of services for the mentally ill from a predominantly institutional to a community based approach in caring for and treating persons with mental illness.  The emphasis on such a service is on outpatient treatment and day care services.</P>
      <P>In line with this recommendation, health boards have been restructuring their psychiatric services with policies of developing a comprehensive range of community psychiatric services, including day hospitals and day centres, rehabilitating and discharging patients from their various institutions to community residential accommodation and developing acute psychiatric units at general hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has been made across all health boards in implementing these policies.  A total of 15 acute psychiatric units attached to general <Col N="2162" /> hospitals have been developed and provide almost 10 per cent of all psychiatric hospital residential care.  Admissions to the parent psychiatric hospital in whose area they have been provided have virtually ceased.</P>
    <P>Six more such units are at planning stage.  The number of day places and community based residences for former psychiatric inpatients continues to grow. At the end of 1993, the most recent year for which published figures are available, there were 3,147 day places available, an increase of 211 over 1992 and 2,556 residential community based places, an increase of 115 over 1992.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the continued development by health boards of their services in line with <i>Planning for the Future.</i> I have provided additional capital and revenue funding in 1994, 1995 and 1996 to underpin this commitment. In 1994, an additional £2 million was provided to the boards, £3 million in 1995 and £750,000 has been provided so far in 1996.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any concerns which have been expressed regarding progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the policy document.  I am satisfied with the progress to date while recognising that much remains to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Overall responsibility for animal drugs rests with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. However, health boards are empowered under the Poisons Regulations, 1982, as amended, to grant licences to persons, in respect of premises situated within their functional areas, to enable such persons to sell, offer or keep for sale, those poisons listed in Part II of the First Schedule to the Regulations.  Such licences, unless cancelled or suspended, continue in force for two years.</P>
      <P>The regulations impose certain restrictions and limitations on licensees with special restriction applying to veterinary antibiotics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty of enforcing the regulations in the case of licensed sellers falls mainly on the health boards.  They may, at all reasonable times, for the purpose <Col N="2164" /> of ascertaining whether there has been a contravention of the regulations&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) enter premises of any class or description (non-pharmacy), or any vehicle or travelling shop; (b) inspect any substance which is stored or offered or kept for sale at such premises; (c) require the production of, and inspect and, if they think fit, take copies of any document or of any entry in book at such premises and (d) take (without payment) samples of poisons or of any substances stored, or offered or kept for sale, at such premises for test, examination or analysis.</P>
    <P>The factual data required by the Deputy are of an operational nature and are not available in my Department. Undoubtedly, the ongoing industrial action by environmental health officers will have an impact on this and other aspects of their responsibilities.  As in the case of all other groups of public service employees, the resolution of the EHO's dispute will have to be pursued through the normal industrial relations machinery in the context of negotiations under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement for the public service.  Any further comments on my part would be inappropriate.</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, provides entitlements for any employee who is pregnant, who has recently given birth or who is breast feeding.  It entitles such employees to 14 consecutive weeks' maternity leave.  The Act also entitles such employees, if they so wish, to additional maternity leave of up to four weeks, which must follow on immediately from the maternity leave.  During pregnancy and for the 14 week period following the birth, employees are entitled to time off work during normal working hours, without loss of pay, for ante-natal and post-natal medical care.</P>
      <P>The Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, provides an entitlement to a minimum period of ten consecutive weeks' adoptive leave for female employees, commencing on the day of placement of the child.  In addition, such employees are entitled to avail of additional adoptive leave of up to four weeks, following immediately on the period of adoptive leave.  During the 14 weeks' maternity leave and ten weeks' adoptive leave all employment rights, other than the right to remuneration, are guaranteed. Employees who fulfil certain social security contribution requirements are entitled to payment of a social security benefit for these periods.  Under both pieces of legislation, special leave in certain limited circumstances, is available to fathers and to sole male adopters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, where because of risk in the workplace or arising from nightwork, and where it is not feasible to either remove the risk or provide suitable alternative work, an employee <Col N="2166" /> can be granted leave to protect her health and safety under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>All of the above entitlements are subject to the employee providing the required notifications to their employer. Following any absences authorised under the Acts, an employee has the right to return to work in the same employment and under the same conditions as existed prior to the absence. Disputes regarding any of the above entitlements can be resolved before a rights commissioner or on appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Protection against dismissal in connection with the exercise of any rights under both Acts is also provided.</P>

      <P>The comments, which I assume the Deputy refers to, as set out in one of the daily newspapers of 25 April 1996 are, first, an acknowledgment of the unprecedented volume of legislation in family law in recent years and particularly so over the past two years by way of such measures as the Maintenance Act, 1994, the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.  That recent spate of legislation culminated, as was promised in the Government's programme, in the holding of the referendum on divorce. However, there continues to be a need, in my view, for a process of updating our laws in the family law area.  For that reason my Department, in addition to being on the ready for publication of a Family Law (Divorce) Bill in the event that the way is cleared for this by the <Col N="2167" /> Supreme Court in the case that is before it, is preparing proposals to update aspects of the law on, among other matters, guardianship, the giving of evidence by children and on nullity.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibilities for fund-raising in relation to legal aid, mediation and counselling and I will continue to strive for devlopment of those areas, subject to budgetary constraints. Major increases in recent years in Exchequer funding of those services has already led to significant growth. Details of funding in 1995 and 1996 are set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54, 55 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the inquiry by Price Waterhouse into the operation of the 1995 leaving certificate art examination is now at a very advanced stage.  Their report will be comprehensive in its treatment of the <Col N="2180" /> relevant issues.  It will ensure that matters such as Departmental records, delivery of materials and follow up action by my Department are properly presented in their correct context.  This full and proper presentation is essential to the process of drawing conclusions and making recommendations.  For this reason it would not be appropriate at this stage for me to comment selectively on individual matters in advance of receiving the report.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the report which I anticipate receiving shortly will provide all information relevant to this issue together with firm conclusions.  At that stage I will be in a position to deal fully with the Deputy's questions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is, in effect, 15 separate questions seeking detailed information on the operation of the investment-based naturalisation scheme.  It has never been the practice to disclose the kind of detailed information sought by him.  The scheme is operated as per the following terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1 December 1994 to 30 April 1996, ten persons were naturalised <Col N="2184" /> on foot of applications which were processed in accordance with these terms of reference.  A sum of £10.5 million was invested by them in areas of industries which included alcohol production, engineering, food processing, computer software, timber processing, energy production and fabric manufacturing.  Six of these investors were naturalised in 1995 and the other four in 1996.</P>
    <P>In addition, ten persons were naturalised in the same period as a result of applications which had been approved prior to the terms of reference etc. arrangements coming into force.  A sum of £11.5 million was invested in total by these persons in the medical research, timber processing, shipping and mining areas.  All ten of these persons were naturalised during 1995.</P>
    <P>Details of all naturalisations are published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil.</i> Details of some of the above cases were published in 1995 and the remainder will be published during 1996.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Terms of Reference of Advisory Group on Investment-linked Naturalisation.</P>
    <P>1.  To consider applications of naturalisation based on investment in the State received by the Minister for Justice and referred to the Group and to make recommendations to the Minister based on the Group's assessment of the job-creating or job-maintenance capacity of the investment.</P>
    <P>2.  The Group will examine each application for naturalisation based on investment, with the assistance of evaluation/advice from relevant agencies where necessary and, in making their recommendations, will apply the following criteria:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Substantial residence must be purchased and retained in ownership for a period of at least 5 years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the 2 years following naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(b)  the level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least £1 million per applicant.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where the investment is in the <Col N="2185" /> form of a loan it shall be for a duration of at least 7 years at an interest rate not greater than 1 per cent below the representative Government bond yield on the secondary markets, or not greater than 1 per cent below DIBOR, whichever is lower.  The loan shall be made by the applicant direct to the firm concerned, without involvement by any intermediary.</P>
    <P>The loan arrangement shall be transparent and open to scrutiny and shall be such as to prevent the loan being factored or sold on.  The loan shall not be secured by the assets of the company in which the investment is to be made.</P>
    <P>(d)  As ordinarily naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period: at the very least 5 years.</P>
    <P>(e)  The number of jobs created or maintained must be readily quantifiable and arise from the investment only.</P>
    <P>(f)  Audited and certified confirmation of the investment to be available to the Group from an established auditing firm of accountants to the effect that the investment has taken place in accordance with the rules of the scheme for naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(g)  The investment will be monitored by Forfás to ensure that the conditions of the investment are being maintained and, in the event that they are not, will inform the Group who, in turn, will inform the Minister for Justice with a view to revocation of citizenship.</P>
    <P>(h)  Police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in country of origin (and, if required, from the Police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or maintained substantial investments) together with express permission to the authorities in Ireland to enquire behind it.</P>
    <P>(i)  Annual certification by the established auditing firm of accountants to Forfás that the investment is <Col N="2186" /> being maintained for the appropriate period.</P>

The person did get an acknowledgment and of course it was always the intention to follow this up once detailed Garda observations were received.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present assessing the pharmacy needs at Mountjoy Prison.  The proposal for a temporary part-time pharmacist arose specifically in the context of the needs of the proposed detoxification unit which is being set up in the prison to provide structured detoxification for drug addicts.  In relation to the pharmacy needs of the prison as a whole, my Department has been assessing whether it would be feasible to set up an arrangement for a local pharmacist to supply pharmacy services to the prison.

    <P>The work of the Commission on the Family is well advanced.  The commission has held six meetings to date since it was appointed in October 1995 with more frequent meetings of working groups.  Much of the detailed work on the different issues of concern to families is initially being prepared for the commission by working groups comprising commission members with relevant expertise.</P>
    <P>One of the commission's first priorities was to initiate a major programme to encourage submissions to assist with its work.  To date, over 280 submissions have been received.  Submissions have been received from every part of the country from individuals, families and small groups working in local communities. I understand that the commission is very pleased with the response and in view of the interest shown has extended the deadline to 15 May 1996.  The commission is providing a freefone advice desk for those who want to make a submission. The freefone number is 1800 30 55 00.</P>
    <P>To celebrate UN International Day of Families on 15 May 1996 the commission is holding a forum for local, voluntary and community groups from different parts of the country.  At the forum representatives of the broad spectrum of groups who have made submissions to the commission will speak about their own experience in relation to the issues which are important to families.</P>
    <P>The commission is also undertaking a special research project to assist with its examination of the needs and priorities of families and has commissioned an expert report on the situation of families in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Family has been asked to make its final report to Government by June 1997 and in that report to make recommendations on how families can best be facilitated in <Col N="2190" /> the support and development of individual members.  The commission has been asked to provide an interim report by October 1996.</P>

      <P>The regulations referred to by the Deputy make provision for the terms and conditions under which qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses are entitled to receive dental, optical and aural benefits under the treatment benefits scheme administered by my Department.  In the case of serving members of the Defence Forces, entitlement to those benefits is limited to the provision or repair of dentures and optical appliances.  This reflects the fact that the Department of Defence operates a health scheme for those members covering primary dental and optical treatment but excluding the provision of dentures, spectacles, contact lenses or hearing aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that the limitation on benefit applies only for the duration of the member's period of service and entitlement to the full range of dental <Col N="2191" /> and optical benefits is restored on discharge from the Defence Forces.  In addition, the limitation does not apply at any time to the dependent spouses of serving members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the length of time the regulations in question have been in force, I will have the position of Defence Forces members reviewed in consultation with the relevant authorities to see what changes, if any, might be considered appropriate at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provides for the introduction of Class A PRSI for community employment (CE) workers commencing such employment on or after 6 April 1996.  In addition, provision was made for existing CE workers (i.e. those who commenced CE prior to 6 April 1996) to be given the option of paying Class A PRSI, if they wished, or of continuing with their existing Class J PRSI.  Existing CE workers were given until 30 April 1996 to exercise that option and those who opted for Class A PRSI will continue to pay Class A for the duration of their employment on CE.  It will not be possible for them to revert to Class J at a later date.</P>

      <P>The only existing <Col N="2192" /> FÁS scheme for which changes are being introduced is the community employment (CE) programme.</P>
      <P>With effect from 15 April last, CE has been split into two distinct options:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Part-Time Integration Option: which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with reasonable prospects of employment and whose prospects of obtaining mainstream employment would be enhanced by participation on the programme.</P>
      <P>Both men and women (married or single) who fulfil any of the following eligibility criteria can participate on this option: those over 21 years and on unemployment benefit (UB) or unemployment assistance (UA) for at least 12 months; those over 21 years and on lone parent's allowance for over 12 months; special categories such as those referred by the NRB or travellers on the live register or on lone parent's allowance for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>2.  Part-Time Job Option: which is aimed at long-term unemployed people with poor employment prospects.</P>
      <P>Both men and women (married or single) who fulfil any of the following eligibility criteria can participate on this option: those over 35 years and in receipt of unemployment assistance (UA) or unemployment benefit (UB] for over three years; those over 35 years and on lone parent's allowance for over three years; special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are over 35 years or travellers who are over 35 years and on the live register or on lone parent's allowance for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>The above changes have been implemented to better target the programme at the long-term unemployed so that they may share in the benefits of economic growth with other sectors of society and have been introduced against a background where long-term unemployed people are often bypassed in job selection.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious industrial relations situation at Airmotive Ireland; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that protective notice issued to all employees one month ago and that a substantive number have now been made redundant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ongoing dispute at Airmotive stems from a claim by a group of unions who are seeking payment of 10 per cent &ldquo;approval payment&rdquo; to approximately 80 craftspersons. The matter has been before the Labour Court, but the court, in a recommendation dated 12 December 1995, did not recommend concession of the claim. The recommendation was not accepted by the workers concerned and strike action involving a number of the work-force subsequently commenced on 1 April 1996.  While a number of lay-offs have occurred as a result of that strike action, it is understood that no redundancies have taken place.</P>
      <P>As I have said in the past, the resolution of an industrial dispute is ultimately a matter for the parties directly involved, availing, where required, of the assistance of the dispute-settling agencies of the State, such as the Labour Court.  Within this context our system of industrial relations leaves it up to the parties to accept or reject a recommendation from the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, it is not in the interest of the <Col N="2194" /> parties to this dispute to have disruption caused to the company or hardship caused to individuals as a result of lay-off.  In the circumstances, I would urge careful reconsideration of the Labour Court recommendation of 12 December 1995.</P>

      <P>A review of the operation of the quota system in Ireland was recently carried out by my Department, in consultation with the farming organisations, representatives of the dairy industry and technical advisers.  The question of an alternative quota year was addressed. The overall consensus of that review was that an amendment to the EU legislation for the purpose of changing the quota year should not be sought at this time and that the disadvantages of a calendar quota year outweigh its advantages. I share this view and therefore do not intend seeking an amendment to the regulations on this point.</P>
