      <P>Before proceeding with business I am sure Members would wish very much to join with me in extending a most warm welcome to the Honourable Zoltán Gál, Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament, and his parliamentary colleagues who are happily with us today.  I express the ardent hope that their stay in Ireland will be most happy and successful.  On behalf of Dáil Éireann I extend to them a most hearty céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>For the past few weeks I have asked for a debate in Government time on the BSE crisis.  I ask the Taoiseach again this morning to allow a full-scale debate next week on the BSE crisis, particularly the latest development.  That we have agreed to allow a third country market to create new barriers, excluding Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan, is a dangerous precedent for any market, particularly agriculture.  We have had six debates in the House on that matter and to the best of my knowledge five of them have been taken in Private Members' time.  Will the Taoiseach agree to my request?</P>

      <P>Given that the Taoiseach said yesterday the Government does not intend to proceed with the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality and has therefore abandoned one of the pillars of openness, transparency and accountability, at what stage is the freedom of information legislation?  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is busy trying to cap the earnings of low paid workers, but what is she doing about the freedom of information legislation?</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his intervention yesterday which ensured the answering of parliamentary questions to which we had sought replies for some time.  Will he intervene once again this morning to ensure that Questions Nos. 2, 4 and 21, which were not answered yesterday for some strange reason, are answered today in advance of the debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The offer of providing answers to those questions was volunteered by the Government.  It was not sought by the Opposition whose quarrel was with the Chair in regard to the decisions to rule out questions.  Contrary to the false statements made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on radio this morning, the Government volunteered to provide the information.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn should not use the privilege of the radio to say things that she knows she could not say in the House because they would immediately be contradicted as false.  What Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said on radio this morning was false.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Belgium is gripped by one of the most horrific cases in its history, the paedophile sex scandal in respect of which Marc Dutroux has been arrested.  In houses which he owns the bodies of two eight year old girls and two teenagers have been discovered.  He is in custody pending the completion of the investigation and trial.</P>
      <P>One may well ask what relevance that case has in Ireland.  It is very relevant.  If it occurred here he could not be held in custody pending trial.  The only grounds on which bail could be refused are an apprehension that he would not attend trial or interfere with witnesses.  I ask those who object to the Government's proposals to consider that fully and ask themselves if they want this situation to continue where somebody who has virtually confessed to these charges would still be at large pending trial.  That is the situation arising from the decision in the O'Callaghan case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the most liberal bail laws in Europe. This is not something of which we should be proud and was not the intention of the founding <Col N="250" /> fathers of this State or when the 1937 Constitution was drafted.  Prior to the decision in the O'Callaghan case judges exercised their discretion and took into account a wide range of issues when considering whether to grant bail.  The most important of these was the seriousness of the charge.  It was virtually unheard of that someone charged with murder would be released on bail.</P>
    <P>There was a range of other reasons bail could be refused.  These included the nature of the evidence in support of the charge, the likely sentence, whether further offences were likely to be committed, the possibility that illegally acquired property could be disposed of while on bail and so on.  As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in the O'Callaghan case all these reasons were rejected as being unconstitutional.  It is significant that Judge Murnaghan specified all these reasons in the High Court in deciding O'Callaghan should be refused bail.  His decision was overturned by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to change the law.  Attempts were made to deal with the matter by legislation when Fine Gael was last in Government.  As a consequence of the changes in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 made by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, there was a reduction in the number of offences committed on bail.  In 1983-84 the figure stood at approximately 8,000 per year.  Following the introduction of restrictions it fell to approximately 2,500 but it has crept up again in recent years.</P>
    <P>An examination of the offences committed on bail suggests that it was the numbers of petty crimes which fell rather than the numbers of serious crimes.  That is why Fine Gael has campaigned for some time for a change in the Constitution to restore to the courts the discretion they had before the O'Callaghan case found it to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I have always believed the balance has been too much against the victims of crime and too much in favour of the criminal.  The reason it took so long to change the Constitution was that Fine Gael was not in Government.  In Opposition we vigorously campaigned on this issue.  Five or six years ago I tabled a motion to change the Constitution, but it was defeated by the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  Two Bills were subsequently tabled by Fine Gael but both were rejected by Fianna Fáil.  It is a little ironic to hear the Fianna Fáil spokesman complain about delays when they caused them.  The criticism of the Progressive Democrats is also odd given that they opposed Fine Gael's earlier efforts to change the Constitution.  However, I am glad Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats now support the move to change the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad all parties support it and have rallied behind the Fine Gael banner to change the Constitution.  Opinion polls also <Col N="251" /> suggest that the people support Fine Gael on this issue.  I hope all parties will campaign to ensure this change is accepted.</P>
      <P>We have the most liberal bail laws in Europe. For those concerned about civil liberties, we are moving into line with Europe.  The proposal is in line with Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is not a question of introducing draconian measures or restrictions on civil liberties; we just want to bring our Constitution into line with the prevailing situation in Europe.  It is not before time that all parties supported the Fine Gael position to change the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of a return to the gruesome punishments of the past where people were hanged, drawn and quartered or transported to other countries.  Neither am I in favour of the surreal law of the Islamic fundamentalists where people are beheaded or their limbs amputated.  I was not in favour of the attempt in Alabama to reintroduce the chain gangs, which has now been abandoned.  However, I am in favour of protecting the innocent victims of crime to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>Some people would argue that it is wrong to detain an unconvicted person in custody, yet everyone, including the Supreme Court, accepts it is proper to detain an unconvicted person in custody if there is a likelihood the person will not attend their trial.  Surely it is proper and should be constitutional to give back to the courts the discretion to detain someone in custody who was caught red handed, like the Belgian I mentioned earlier, and who is likely to commit further crimes before the trial?  Surely it is proper that somebody involved in a heinous crime such as murder, rape or bank robbery and against whom the evidence is overwhelming should be deprived of his liberty pending trial rather than giving him the opportunity to kill, rape or rob another innocent victim in the meantime?  I am reminded of the Leixlip bank robbery some years ago which ended with loss of life.  I was the Opposition spokesman for justice at the time and it was relevant to note that those involved were out on bail.  We must consider if the real crime is to release such offenders into society on bail where they can commit further such offences with impunity.</P>
      <P>I have complained about the delay in changing the Constitution but I am now glad all parties support the Fine Gael position.  I ask all parties to do more than just support the Fine Gael proposal in the House.  I ask them to campaign because the people are the final arbiters.  We cannot change the Constitution without the people's consent, so I ask all parties to join the Fine Gael campaign to ensure these changes are accepted on 28 November.  I hope there will be an overwhelming vote in favour of bringing our bail laws into line with Europe and ensuring that the balance is restored in favour of the victims of crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposals to change the Constitution in relation to the bail <Col N="252" /> laws.  The suggested wording is reasoned and balanced. It states:</P>
      <P>Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
      <P>The decision in the O'Callaghan case in 1965 needs to be reconsidered.  Members will be aware that in the O'Callaghan case bail could only be refused on two grounds &mdash; the likelihood that an accused will not turn up for trial or will interfere with the witnesses or with evidence.  Members have said we have a liberal bail regime in this State.  However, the right to liberty is not an absolute right as it also involves responsibilities. Society has a right to protect itself.</P>
      <P>The balance needs to be tilted in favour of the victims of crime and for the good of society.  In the past year we have heard that the victim is never heard in the criminal justice process. Because crimes are now so horrendous we need to change our thinking and to examine the role of victims more thoroughly.  It is estimated that a staggering 5,500 indictable crimes are committed each year by people on bail.  It is important to highlight why we need this change.</P>
      <P>I draw Members' attention to the Tony Felloni case where it emerged he was repeatedly granted bail over a three year period before finally being jailed earlier this year for 20 years for heroin offences.  He was a major heroin dealer and the litany makes for shocking reading.  He was arrested in August 1994 at Belclare Park, Ballymun, with heroin worth £150,000; in January 1995 at Kinsealy Lane with heroin worth £75,000; in July 1995 at Dominic Street Flats in the north inner city with heroin and cash and in October 1995 with heroin and £7,200 in Irish pounds and sterling.  In January 1996 he was finally remanded in custody when a drug squad officer told the court he was satisfied that Felloni was about to secure a forged passport and flee to South Africa.  That was a shocking situation. The trial is now over and he has been jailed for 20 years, but it shows how the major organised criminals and drug barons are abusing our liberal bail regime.  It is obvious that, during the time that major drug dealers are out on bail, they continue to plan and execute some of their major crimes.  That is a situation which any decent society cannot tolerate.  Examining that example alone, we can see how necessary it is for an extension to the bail law regime and the occasions when a judge can refuse it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil Bill involving a constitutional referendum was voted down in this House 13 months ago.  Why?  Certainly Deputies from within the Government brought forward civil libertarian arguments as to why the bail regime did not need to be changed.  It seems to commentators, this side of the House and the general public that the Government was divided on how to proceed on the bail issue.  As Deputy O'Donoghue <Col N="253" /> said last night, certain members of the Government were seen to be talking tough and voting soft when they went through the lobbies opposing this very measure we are about to agree to in the next few months.  The Minister for Justice said on the RTE programme &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; many months ago that there would be changes to the bail regime and a referendum.  For some reason, that did not happen until now.  People know that the Government was paralysed by indecision and different philosophies and that ideologies within it were unable to agree a serious course of action for which society and public opinion were crying out.  The real change came during the summer when there was a landslide in public opinion demanding action on organised crime.  It would be fair to say that the shocking murder of Veronica Guerin brought about that real demand and landslide in public opinion for the Government to do something.  One of the big issues people identified at the time was that drug barons such as Felloni seemed to be getting away literally with murder and abusing our tolerant criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>Why is nothing ever done in this country unless there is a tragedy or some shocking event to spur people into action?  My experience as a public representative, albeit short compared to some, has been that we know what needs to be done in many different areas.  We send letters to Ministers, Government Departments and agencies. We know what needs to be done, but nothing is done.  However, when there is a tragedy or accident, a terrible and shocking event, then all arms of Government and the Oireachtas are spurred into action.  That is not the way we should proceed, it should not be the politics of the last atrocity. We know the problems and experience them in our everyday life.  As public representatives, we have a lot to offer because we know what is going on in the big wide world and are actively involved in many different issues.  Let us try to deal with them.  We do not need a shocking murder to spur us into action.  We must deal effectively with the problems.  At the time of the Guerin murder, the perception was that the Government had to be seen to be decisive.  Thankfully, demands for a bail referendum were brought to the top of the agenda.  That is possibly one of the most decisive matters in regard to crime and the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>One issue which needs examining regarding the consequences of this referendum and the following proposed legislation is the pressure which will be placed on our prison system.  There will obviously be provisions for increased releases of existing prisoners.  That must be a consequence of what the people are about to decide and we will return to the famous revolving door system. People do not want that or an increase in temporary releases which will lead to a further increase in crime.  They want the provision of additional prison spaces to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>In the package announced by the Minister earlier this year, she made provision for an additional <Col N="254" /> 400 prisoners at the new remand prison at Wheatfield, an additional 125 extra prison places at the main prison at Castlerea, an additional 60 prison places at the women's prison at the Mountjoy complex and 55 extra prison places in the new wing at Limerick Prison.  That looks well in a press release but we need to know when the prison places will be made available and under what timescale.  I understand some of these places are merely at the planning stage.  We should be more radical in bringing prison places into existence. Even as it stands that programme is inadequate to deal with the new circumstances which will arise from the restrictions on obtaining bail.  That is the kernel of the issue, it is worrying and we will have to deal with it because we do not want to create another crisis in an attempt to solve this one.</P>
    <P>We must also seriously examine the annual cost of keeping a convicted criminal in prison.  It has been stated during this debate that the cost in Ireland is far higher than in the UK and many other similar western regimes.  There is no need for this.  Will the Minister investigate why the annual cost for keeping someone in prison is so much higher here?  If we can tackle that we will be better able to deal with the potential problem of prison spaces.</P>
    <P>Drug addiction is one of the major issues affecting our communities.  It is relevant to this debate because some of those refused bail will be drug addicts and there is a strong possibility that they will commit another crime while on bail.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, such people can be correctly described as a walking crime wave.  We must further examine how to tackle drug addiction and the drug pushing which is afflicting our communities, particularly in Dublin and on a lesser scale in other towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Some initiatives, such as &ldquo;Operation Dóchas&rdquo;, have been announced recently.  It is welcome to see gardaí on the beat because we have been calling for that for years.  The only reason the scheme was announced was that communities had decided they could bear no more so they took the law into their own hands.  If they had not taken the initiative by starting patrols themselves, the new Garda actions would not have happened.</P>
    <P>Within the last two weeks I attended a public meeting in Dublin's north inner city, with three other Members of the Oireachtas.  We witnessed a trial by the community of four alleged drug pushers; the jury consisted of about 300 people in the hall.  The alleged pushers were facilitated in that they were allowed to make a case in front of the &ldquo;jury&rdquo;.  It was a cheap form of justice &mdash; a vote was taken as to whether these people should be allowed to stay in the community.  However, communities are frustrated so they do things for themselves.  The &ldquo;trial&rdquo; may have been a little short on evidence but there is no doubt that the official functions of the State were being challenged in that process.  It is finally dawning on <Col N="255" /> the organs of Government that the problem must be tackled.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of treatment, including treatment for those who are refused bail if the referendum is passed.  That must be a necessity.  I welcome the plans announced by the Government within the last ten days to eliminate the waiting lists for treatment.  I hope it succeeds but something radical is needed.  We must put our heads together and provide the resources for treatment.  This is the most serious issue facing many of our communities, as it threatens the fabric of society.  If we do not deal with it now, late in the day though it is, the position will become irreversible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the law and order measures to deal with drug barons which we passed during the summer, particularly the Act dealing with proceeds of crime proposed by Fianna Fáil, which provides for the freezing and subsequent disposal of assets of suspected criminals if they cannot show the assets were legally earned, and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, which provides for the setting up of a new Garda-led unit to target criminal assets, featuring gardaí and officials from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  These two Acts are effective legislative measures.  I appreciate that the Minister for Justice may not be able to report at this point on the success of those Acts but the Oireachtas must monitor their operation, so we should receive a report in due course on how they have been implemented, what success they have had and whether we need to bring forward further legislation.  Another issue which should be tackled is the huge delay between the arrest of an alleged criminal and the trial date.  It does not take too much imagination to work out how to deal with that &mdash; we need more judges and speedier procedures.</P>
    <P>According to the opinion polls these measures will be supported by the people, although we must campaign vigorously.  This change to the bail regime is not the ultimate solution to the crime problem, much more needs to be done.  I welcome the fact that all parties now support the Fianna Fáil view that a bail referendum is needed but I regret that some of them voted against our proposals 13 months ago.  In particular I welcome the conversion of the Labour party, which was on record as being opposed to changes to bail.  That party has changed along with public opinion and that is for the good of the country.  I believe this measure will be supported.</P>

      <P>The sad reality is that this Government inherited phenomenal problems <Col N="256" /> resulting from the ineptitude of Fianna Fáil.  Not only have we inherited a huge potential bill and the tragedy of hepatitis C from Fianna Fáil while in Government, we have also inherited a huge bill, entailing hundreds of millions of pounds, involving equal payments to women on social welfare.  We have also had to pay huge EU fines and forfeit EU money because of the behaviour of Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey finally recognises that this city and the country has a drugs problem.  It has this problem because of the inaction of Fianna Fáil over the past ten years when the first drugs epidemic hit in the middle 1980s.  The party did nothing, resulting in the destruction of communities and leaving the Government to try to catch up by chasing the dragon of heroin abusers, drug pushers and dealers.  The sanctimonious sentiments expressed by Deputy Haughey are enough to provoke a saint, never mind me.  I am not easily provoked but hypocrisy annoys me intensely.</P>
      <P>Regarding the list of seven clauses setting out the grounds on which a judge may refuse bail for a charged person, will the Minister address my concerns regarding the apparent addition of the seventh clause which is concerned with whether the accused person has a substance addiction? According to <i>The Irish Times</i> of Friday, 11 October 1996, Judge Cyril Kelly sentenced Luigi Felloni, the son of Tony Felloni, to six years on heroin dealing charges.  The judge remarked on sentencing this person that he must serve three and a half years in prison and then go to the Coolmine therapeutic centre in March 2000.  The Judiciary and the Department of Justice appear to be making remarkable statements recently which are the combination of woolly thinking and unthought through policies.</P>
      <P>Why did the judge pass such a strange sentence? One would assume that prisons were the most therapeutic communities, where after serving a sentence of, say, three and a half years, one would be drug free.  Is the judge saying that the prison system is so incapable of dealing with drug addicts that on the release of every prisoner he sentences, including this person, he must serve time at the Coolmine therapeutic centre?  That is a terrible indictment of the Department of Justice and the prison regime.  Why would a prisoner leaving a prison require to be detoxified or treated in a therapeutic community?  Why Coolmine? Is this and other treatment centres provided by the Eastern Health Board to be seen to be an extension of the prison system?  If this is what is happening, how are we to accommodate those non sentenced addicts in the community who are queuing for these services?  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today, it is reported that Judge Kieran O'Connor sentenced a man to spending one year at a drugs treatment centre, the Le Patriarch Centre, Skibbereen, County Cork, instead of five years in jail, as was his intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are between 7,000 and 9,000 drug addicts in Dublin city.  Many of them are responsible for the most outrageous crimes.  Nobody could <Col N="257" /> imagine the terror in the heart of a bus driver when, after arriving at a terminus after a long, hard day, he finds a blood filled syringe pointed at his jugular vein.  Nor could anyone imagine the terror in the eyes of young and vulnerable shop assistants in small grocery stores within the inner city and other parts when people similarly point blood dripping syringes.</P>
    <P>The logic of the refusal to grant bail on the grounds of subsidence addiction has major ramifications for the prison system.  It is clear from the two newspaper reports to which I referred that judges are deeming the prison system to be an inappropriate location and are sentencing people to drug treatment centres such as the Coolmine therapeutic centre.  These centres have not the capacity to cater for judges transferring sentenced people to them.</P>
    <P>Given that this Bill will be passed and in the absence of proper drug treatment services there is the prospect of a dangerous merry-go-round where drug addicts will be arrested, the courts will be able to refuse them bail for four months and will transfer them to Mountjoy where they are unlikely to be weaned off their addiction.  Judges are already accepting this.  According to today's newspapers it costs £45,000 per year to keep a prisoner in jail.  If we are to keep people on remand for four months this will cost £15,000 per head.  The Minister should look at her budgetary situation.  Is it not better, given the inevitably large numbers of drug addicts who will be presented to the courts, that we should have a remand hospital, not only to service those who will be refused bail for four months or will serve longer on remand but all drugs addicts who must be taken out of the prisons network?  Such a remand hospital should be categorised in the same way as we categorise Dundrum Hospital as an institution for the criminally insane and Arbour Hill for sex offenders.  We need to separate drug addicts from the mainstream criminal world of Mountjoy and other prisons. If £45,000 per year is to be spent on them in Mountjoy it makes sense that such money could be better used in creating special remand hospitals for them.</P>
    <P>There are more then 500 people waiting to use the therapeutic or other treatment services in the State, especially in Dublin city.  It will be ironic if they must wait even longer because judges are sending people to drug treatment centres.  Will the Minister explain how she will address the phenomenally difficult and tragic problem of drug addiction in the prisons?  Will the Department of Justice get its act together and establish some liaison with those judges who appear to be making up the rules as they go along and to be doing their best with regard to the sentencing of drug addicts?  I hope the Minister will give me satisfactory answers and I wish her success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Byrne, on the prison system and the need for radical action in regard to treatment. <Col N="258" /> Deputy Haughey weeped crocodile tears about the inaction of the Government on this issue.  However, I remind the Deputy that his party was in Government for a considerable period and if it was so concerned about the issue, it was in power long enough to have done something about it.  This Government is addressing the problem.</P>
      <P>The matter is serious because provision is being made for the deprivation of liberty of a person before a court on the new grounds of where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by him or her. This follows the wording of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that liberty may be deprived when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent a person committing an offence.  The provisions of the Bill are not out of line with the European convention.</P>
      <P>The background to this matter is the Supreme Court decision in the O'Callaghan case where two grounds for deprivation of liberty were specified, the possible interference with witnesses by the accused and the likelihood of the accused absconding.  That case was important because it dealt with an incident where a person was remanded in custody for a considerable period. The Supreme Court took the view that the person's rights had been infringed because the case had been delayed and described it as a form of preventive detention.</P>
      <P>At that time, in the mid-1960s, there was considerable concern that the right to liberty was a constitutional right and there should only be the minimum level of interference and this should be laid down in guidelines by the court.  The court was specific in that respect when it stated that there was no place in the bail system for any form of preventive detention.  It placed a huge premium on the right to liberty with regard to the basic principle in criminal law that one is innocent until proven guilty and one's liberty cannot be deprived without due process.</P>
      <P>The danger now is that the balance may be tilted in the other direction and the deprivation of liberty could continue along the lines of the position prior to 1965 when, on the word of a garda which was accepted by the judge, a person was remanded, pending the production of the book of evidence, which often took a considerable time.  There was also other delays in the court procedures.  As we are aware, court procedures are notoriously slow in terms of expediting cases and the result is that a form of preventive detention may arise.  It is important that the provisions as indicated in the general terms of the Bill are strictly enforced to ensure the system is not abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar regime operates in Britain where it is possible to lock up a person because they are a potential offender.  However, the percentage of recorded offences committed by people on bail is higher there than in Ireland.  The level here is approximately 4 per cent but the level in England and Wales where similar provisions to those in <Col N="259" /> the Bill operate is higher.  This aspect should be taken into account.  The problem of offences committed by people on bail will not be solved by the introduction of a Bill to change the law to deprive people of their liberty.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill is the drugs crisis and the tragic assassination of well known journalist, Veronica Guerin.  It was only then that the national consciousness recognised the epidemic of drug abuse, particularly of heroin, in the capital city and the need to address the crisis.  The response has been as one would expect if there is a breakdown of law and order, or somebody is assassinated, but the danger is that it may not take into consideration all the other aspects.  The drugs crisis in not a new problem in Dublin.  It has been with us for approximately 20 years and has been repeatedly brought to the attention of the authorities.  However, it was not addressed.</P>
    <P>Professionals in the area, in terms of the Government and State agencies, are culpable for the current position and democracy can be undermined by the climate of fear and crime which has been created by the failure to address the drug epidemic.  Successive Governments have not shown proper leadership dealing with the problem by targeting resources, recognising the extent of the crisis or putting legislation in place until now.  The Garda Síochána has been most remiss in not concentrating on the drugs problem.  It did not target its personnel or resources and it did not adopt a sophisticated system to deal with it. It allowed the terrible cancer of drugs to spread in the city's ghettos while it concentrated on other issues.</P>
    <P>The medical profession has not taken the problem seriously.  Most general practitioners refuse to treat drug addicts and those who treat them volunteer to do so.  It is a scandal that in the general medical service doctors can opt out and state they will not treat particular patients with drug addictions for various reasons.  There is no such thing as a family doctor as far as this illness is concerned.  The Eastern Health Board has not provided treatment services.  It is a scandal that less than half of the drug addicts who volunteer for treatment can avail of services.  Heroin addicts attend meetings in the city and volunteer for treatment but nobody can tell them where to go to avail of it.  If they go to one of the few clinics which exist they are placed on long waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The problem must be redressed.  The organs of the State have been remiss in dealing with the problem in the past and highly paid professionals have not done their duty.  I hope the legislative measures we are putting in place now and those which were recently announced by the ministerial task force will do a lot more.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is in regard to prisons.  We need a new remand prison that is well serviced and which has all the necessary facilities to deal with drug addicts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this very important debate.  When I spoke on the introduction of my party's measure to deal with the deficiencies in the bail system, on 9 May 1995, at column No. 1173 of volume 452 of the Official Report, I said: &ldquo;I welcome the introduction of this Bill which is a positive measure and a genuine attempt by the Fianna Fáil party to try and come to terms with the ludicrous situation which currently exists in the operation of our bail laws.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister did not then see fit to accept our measure and save the country a year and a half of criminals running free, committing acts of robbery, violence and intimidation and generally bringing our system of criminal law and accountability into disrepute.  This was a year and a half of time wasted because the Minister could not accept that our measure was doing what she would have to do one day herself.  To be fair to the Minister, she was only part of the Fine Gael dog which was being wagged by the Labour and Democratic Left tail.  We need hardly recall her early morning declaration of her intention to seek a change in the bail situation only to have it quashed within days by her partners in Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had to bear the brunt of the public odium and contempt for that dictated decision in the intervening time, but she is the Minister for Justice.  She has the responsibility and is the only person who could institute the necessary change.  That this change is coming at last is a good thing, but we have had to endure a year and a half of ministerial inactivity waiting for the nod from the left before she was allowed to perform as Minister.  It has been a year and a half since this party presented her with a golden opportunity to initiate the relevant changes which she turned down.  On 4 October 1995, at column No. 1144 of volume 456 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
      <P>Whenever I stand up to speak in this House, I always try to treat the subject in a realistic fashion.  I will do no less when speaking of the need to restrict the granting of bail by the courts, because I believe that it is a commonsense course of action to take.</P>
      <P>I have had no reason to change my mind on the subject.  This is not just common sense, but one of the most pressing needs in the legislative programme today.  Many of the heinous crimes which have been committed since Fianna Fáil framed its proposal might not have happened if the laws on bail had been changed at that time.  I regret it has taken the Government another year to get its act together and give the people the kind of protection they expect and deserve.  I said then that it was a common sense provision and I fail to see why the Minister has seen fit to drag her feet on this matter and expose the people to unnecessary risk in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will come as no surprise if I give this proposal to amend the Constitution a cautious welcome.  I <Col N="261" /> am pleased that after such a long time, movement can now be seen in the direction in which everyone, with the possible exception of the Minister, knew we had to go sooner or later.  I would have preferred if it had been sooner and that the people would have seen this House take positive steps to curb the repetitive criminal element in our society long before now.  However, I welcome this provision, even if it is late.  I know the people will welcome it also and will say that it has not been introduced before time.</P>
    <P>This Bill to amend the Constitution is only a first step, but I trust that if the Government can convince the population to change the Constitution, it will follow up with speedy, comprehensive and sensible legislation along the lines outlined in the Minister's statement last week.  We are often accused of having more repressive provisions in our legislation than are considered healthy by those who set themselves up as experts in such matters.  It is gratifying to see, however, that our bail provisions up to now have been far more liberal than those provided for in the definitive European Convention on Human Rights and that the changes proposed at the moment go no further than that document envisages for the population of Europe.  Let the Minister immediately assure the population of this country that what this House envisages goes no further than reasonable people would consider reasonable, and that the expedition into change in the matter of bail will not give the person in the street any cause for concern.</P>
    <P>Bail is a necessity only for those who have been charged with a crime and many so charged still will not and cannot have their bail opposed by the State.  However, the hands of the State and the Garda should not be automatically tied by the ludicrous bail ruling which we have endured since 1965.  It will, in time, be a source of mystery to historians why this situation was allowed to exist for three of the most troubled decades we have endured in our short history.  Refusal of bail should be available in the case of those who pose an ongoing threat to our society because of their aspirations, lifestyle, their perceived intentions, or their habits.  Where it can be reasonably established that they are an ongoing threat, bail must, for the sake of our society, be denied.</P>
    <P>If we have at last extracted a commitment from the Minister to attempt to curb the availability of bail for the criminal or alleged criminal, then we must also ask her to outline her plans to deal with the inevitable rise in the prison population.  Will she make provision for better and more humane accommodation?  Will she provide more appropriate accommodation for the many prisoners at present in detention?  Will she further provide for a speedier system of justice, which will keep prisoners on remand, incarcerated for only the minimum time before their trial?  Will she uphold the principle that justice delayed is justice denied?</P>
    <P>I realise that she went some of the way recently with the appointment of more judges, but that is not enough.  The back-up resources in the form of <Col N="262" /> personnel and funds must also be provided.  Proper buildings must be made available and Garda numbers increased to provide for faster investigation and detection of crimes.  The people need to be reassured and this proposal today is only part of that reassurance.  We cannot always depend on increasing prison space to solve our criminal justice problem.  It must also be approached from the point of view of keeping people behind bars for the shortest desirable time and of steering them off the criminal path before they get enmeshed in crime.</P>
    <P>The best way to deal with a potential criminal is to see that he does not become one and the process must start early in life.  That means providing the social services necessary in the areas most at risk, implementing youth and social programmes in areas where we know there will be problems in the future.  In short, the Minister must invest now in the children who will be the adults, and who may be the criminals, of the future.  We are assured that the Minister for Finance is awash with money at the moment and his greatest problem is to decide to whom to give it.</P>
    <P>Let me make a few suggestions.  He might give some to our primary and secondary schools which are struggling to stay afloat.  School boards, principals, staff and parents' councils are hustling for money to pay for oil for heating, to paint schoolrooms whose colour has changed only by fading in the sunlight of 30 years and whose classrooms are devoid of even basic teaching aids.  He might invest some of his riches in remedial teachers who are denied to the most needy of areas for the flimsiest reasons.  These teachers could make an investment in our children and the wider society, which will be reaped a hundredfold in ten years' time.  Can we afford to wait to see the mistakes we are making now?</P>
    <P>He might consider investing in those voluntary agencies who are dealing with the results of failed or non-existent drug-policies of this Government. He might like to support those at the forefront of the fight against drugs in our cities and towns and recover the initiative from organisations whose motives are, to say the least, suspect.</P>
    <P>He might substitute some of his ready riches for the money he plunders from the coffers of the national lottery at present.  That money was intended to provide funds for sport, voluntary social services and the arts, and successive Governments have shamelessly robbed the young and disadvantaged of their rights from this fund. Dipping in to the lottery is akin to stealing from the child's money-box, from the alms-box of the poor or from the collection tin of the leper.  Now that the Minister for Finance has discretionary money available, it is incumbent on him to give it to the people who are looking after the social needs of our most disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Withholding bail cannot be our only response to crime problems.  We must be more positive and proactive than that.  If we are to discharge our function in this House we must consider the social problems and start to deal with them now.  It is as <Col N="263" /> simple as this: if we educate our children properly and given them the facilities and a proper infrastructure for healthy pursuits in their leisure time, we can at least reduce the number who will turn to crime.  There will be fewer people to whom we will have to refuse bail and fewer will fall foul of the law.  That has been proven in many inner cities elsewhere and we must learn from them. Without that commitment and investment, what we do here today will be merely a holding operation.</P>
    <P>This is only one of a number of measures crying out for implementation if we are to realistically address the rise in serious crime.  We need to examine ways of keeping children from roaming our streets in the small hours of the morning, making parents more responsible and accountable for their children's actions and keeping track of people on temporary release from prison or on bail.  I am talking about electronic tagging and, while I accept this is still in its infancy, I do not see any reason we should not at least examine the system closely.</P>
    <P>Last May I called on the Minister to consider setting up a databank of DNA samples which would be immediately available in the investigation of serious assault, rape and murder and which would solve some of those crimes almost instantly.  I know this suggestion will horrify civil liberties groups, but I am more interested in the civil liberties of innocent people than of those who commit serious crimes and evade detection because we stubbornly refuse to avail of the advances in modern science.  If some people had their way we would not yet use fingerprinting techniques.  However, they would quickly change their minds if they or their families became victims of thugs and criminals.  We must be realistic and serve the people we represent.</P>
    <P>There is no trauma in giving a DNA sample which can be easily taken from blood, saliva and so on.  I am professionally assured it is possible to take a DNA sample at birth without any risk to babies.  The proof of its acceptability by the public and their understanding of its necessity is evident in the percentage of people who readily co-operate with the police.  There is a perception that genetic fingerprinting has more uses and advantages than drawbacks and that not all cases in which the system is used are ones of murder, rape and assault.  Sometimes DNA sampling is used merely to identify conclusively the parentage of a child.  The successful prosecution of the X case depended on the availability of a DNA sample.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic in our fight against crime. The denial of bail in some circumstances is a necessary part of that fight as is a necessary curbing of individual freedom.  I do not have any difficulty with that.  All my instincts and soundings tell me the people do not have any difficulty with that either and we would be negligent not to do what is proposed.  I have no doubt the people will formally approve the proposal in the referendum.</P>

People had reservations about whether that was the right way to proceed but she persisted and has now achieved her objective.

Ten years ago we did not talk as much about the drugs problem but it is now of paramount importance that we take action to curb the evil use of drugs.  One cannot be more focused on the necessity to make changes in the bail laws than when we read about a noted drugs criminal in the Dublin area who committed a succession of crimes while out on bail.  For many people that exposed the hypocrisy of the current position where a person can get bail and commit further crimes while out on bail.</P>
      <P>The proposed measures clearly set out the cases in which bail will apply.  That is desirable. Another issue to which the Minister has responded is the necessity for a bailsman to put the money up front.  The current position is that if a person goes bail for an individual he is not required to lodge the bail money.  The Minister inherited the neglect of previous Administrations with regard to our criminal justice system and the absence of legislation.  She has responded magnificently since her appointment as Minister for Justice and a great deal of legislation has been passed by this House.</P>
      <P>The main watershed in focusing our minds on crime was the murders of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe in my constituency of Limerick West, and of Veronica Guerin which has been referred to here on many occasions.</P>
      <P>As reported in the media the gardaí appear to be much more proactive in their fight against crime and have made many advances, particularly with regard to the murder of Veronica Guerin and the evidence they have collected in the Dublin area.  They appear to be tackling the problems of illegal handguns and the laundering of drug money.  I compliment the gardaí on their success in that regard and urge them to continue with this proactive approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment also Chief Superintendent Michael Fitzgerald and the Garda authorities in my constituency, who experienced the trauma of having one of their members murdered, on their efforts to apprehend the people responsible for that crime.  A criminal gang has operated, almost with impunity, in the same area for a long period and its members are suspected of carrying out <Col N="265" /> raids on banks and post offices.  The current investigations will I hope root out the criminals who have operated in the west Limerick-north Kerry area.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and the people who are critical of her proposals with regard to the prison system should recognise the tremendous advances being made in providing more prison spaces for criminals.  I have no doubt there will be a positive response from the people when this proposal is put to them in the referendum.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on the bail referendum which is clearly part of a package to tackle crime and must be seen as such.  It is a balanced response to a difficult problem.  Ireland has not updated its laws on bail as other European countries have done and as highlighted by the report of the Law Reform Commission.  It is interesting that we are more lax where bail is concerned.  That has fuelled public concern about crimes committed by people out on bail, particularly hardened criminals.</P>
      <P>I welcome the detailed changes to the law the Minister intends to introduce in addition to putting the amendment to the people. This is the only part of the package against crime that will be put to the people in a detailed way.  I hope people will follow the debate and use their vote and that we will have a good discussion on it because it is important that the people are well informed.</P>
      <P>In proposing a change like this, we also have to take into account that one of the factors leading to the need for it is the growing drugs problem. Huge numbers of people in our prisons are drug addicts.  As those of us who represent Dublin constituencies know, addicts out on bail or who are out having served a prison sentence get into a spiral where they are continually committing offences to get enough money on a daily basis to feed their habit.  The bail referendum is just part of a package to tackle crime and must include tackling the drugs problem in a realistic and proactive way.  I welcome the fact that treatment will be more readily available next year, because I am not satisfied with the length of time addicts have to wait for treatment at present.  The waiting lists are far too long and that certainly feeds escalating crime and muggings in the Dublin area which need to be tackled.</P>
      <P>The Opposition parties should be generous in their response to the Minister's proposals.  For 30 years this problem has been talked about, but nobody has tackled it.  The Minister has tackled it consistently in recent months and is now putting this referendum to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also look at other elements of the package.  The criminal justice system and the courts system have been in need of reform for many years, and there has been a very proactive approach to this by this Government and by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in particular. Her term as Minister for Justice will go down as <Col N="266" /> a reforming period in the courts and prison systems. It should also be acknowledged that this Government has taken a more proactive approach to the question of prison spaces, and the prison building programme is the most proactive in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed referendum I wish to mention two issues.  One is the role of victims in the criminal justice system.  We have to get more of a balance between the rights of victims and those of the accused.  This bail referendum will help in that regard.  As a woman who has observed the criminal justice system and women's experience of it over many years, I know that there has been great dissatisfaction on the part of victims with their experience within the system. They feel it has not been sensitive enough to their needs.  There is even more work to be done on that in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to comment also on the question of the rights of the accused.  As we extend detention to seven days, which we must do, given the organised nature of criminal activity and because of the drugs problem, we must continue to be vigilant about the rights of the accused and the possibility of miscarriages of justice.  We must look at the videotaping of interviews and make sure the highest standards apply.  It is important in a modern democracy to get this balance right.  I believe we will, but we need to be vigorous and continuously monitor this aspect as well.</P>
    <P>The package will have to include continuing and more developed liaison between local communities and the Garda Síochána.  There has been growing frustration, but it is important to take note of a report issued recently by the Merchant's Quay drugs project in my area, which stated that some of the vigilante activity is focusing on addicts, needy people themselves, who are being made scapegoats while the more organised criminals behind them are not dealt with.  I have heard consistently from constituents that they cannot understand why drug trading has gone on uninterrupted in many of their communities to date.  I have nothing but praise for the efforts of many local liaison gardaí in communities where they have developed strong relationships with the community, as is the case in parts of my own constituency. That must be developed and clearly needs to work much better in other areas.</P>
    <P>The bail referendum is one part of a package which has many aspects but it is, nevertheless, an essential part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much debate in this House in recent months on the issue of bail, much of it fuelled by the expert report of the Law Reform Commission which was published last year, following which the Minister for Justice stated that she would move towards changing the law.  It has been cited by those against the proposed changes that the Law Reform Commission report did not call for a referendum or for the type of legislation envisaged by the Minister for Justice, if the referendum is carried.  However, <Col N="267" /> that is not the full story.  It is important that in the context of the Law Reform Commission's report there should be a reference to its analysis on the law of bail.  Significantly, the Law Reform Commission stated categorically that by international standards Ireland has the lowest number of remand prisoners and remains the only jurisdiction in western Europe that has not introduced comprehensive bail legislation in recent years. Throughout the Law Reform Commission report there are references to the fact that the grounds for refusing bail under our bail regime are unduly restrictive, while it has been argued by people opposed to change that few crimes are committed by people who are out on bail and that, therefore, there is no real need to change the law.  I am not in a position to argue with the figures put forward by the Law Reform Commission, and I venture to suggest that few people are.  They state that in 1993 27 per cent, just over a quarter, of detected armed robberies in this State were committed by persons out on bail.  That is a high figure which underlines the need for legislation to tighten up our bail regime.  The vast majority of law-abiding citizens within the State are calling for change. The Garda Síochána, through its various associations, is calling for change.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is on record as stating that the balance of our criminal law is not weighted in favour of the citizen.  That requires change, and that is exactly what the legislation, consequent on the passing of the referendum, will allow for.</P>
      <P>When we last discussed this matter, in the context of Deputy O'Donoghue's Private Members' Bill last year, I stated I had two major reservations about changing the bail regime.  There was first the inordinate delay between the time of arrest, charge and caution and the time of trial, the absence of a remand centre and the overall prison regime under which simply to remand people on bail we had to release convicts from prison.  This did not do anything to ensure confidence in the criminal justice system.  It is important to address the matters of prison spaces and delay.  Since the debate on bail more than a year ago there has been considerable progress in reducing delays in criminal trials.  It is important that the Government aims for an acceptable target known to people.  For example, three months in most cases is sufficient time to allow the State to gather evidence with a view to holding the trial.</P>
      <P>This year alone 17 or 18 judges have been appointed and for the first time ever the criminal courts in Dublin and throughout the country sat in early September.  This should increase the level of efficiency, and it is important in the context of any legislation we might introduce to remand more persons than are being remanded at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Hugh Coveney, who has been given special responsibility by the Government in the area of prison building, that the 400 place remand <Col N="268" /> centre at Wheatfield is ahead of target.  I recall the fuss created by Deputy Harney and others when the Government's prison building programme was announced.  She said it would be well into the next century before we would have that 400 place remand unit in Wheatfield.  My understanding is that it will be completed in 1998.</P>
    <P>Ultimately any reduction in the numbers of persons out on bail or any increase in the numbers of persons who will be remanded prior to trial, will be a matter for the courts.  The courts will measure each bail application before a judge makes a decision.  It will not be written in stone, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>I urge every citizen to become informed.  I fear that much of the debate is clouded by academic and technical arguments to the detriment of citizens. I hope we have an interesting campaign, and there is no complacency because most of the 166 Deputies in the House support the referendum. However, we will have the fundamental pillar of the democratic process &mdash; the vote of the people. I look forward to a large turn out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and bemoan the fact that it is 13 months after the action should have been taken.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Kenneally, will forgive me if I differ slightly from his criticism regarding the delay on the Bill.  I would not hold the Minister for Justice responsible for this delay.  Even when Fianna Fáil put forward its proposal on bail she would have been happy either to accept that Bill, as she did in the case of the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, or a similar one, had she been allowed by other elements in the Cabinet, notably Democratic Left and the Labour Party.  I am always amused to listen to the history lessons from Deputy Eric Byrne.  He starts every debate by reciting a litany of ills in society, all of which can be laid firmly at the door of Fianna Fáil.  I would not like to dwell too deeply on Deputy Byrne's background or that of his former party or parties.  It is probable that he has contributed much more to the woes and ills of this country than Fianna Fáil ever did. Deputy Costello who was playing the same tune should not forget that during the past 20 odd years his party has been in power as long as Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>We will accept Deputy McGahon's suggestion of collective responsibility. I will not point the finger except to say that when Deputy O'Donoghue introduced his Bill 13 months ago it would have been accepted if Democratic Left and the Labour Party were not in Government.  My experience of the Labour Party in Government is that it reacts to a headline in <i>The Irish Times.</i> The unfortunate headlines in <i>The Irish Times</i> following the deaths of Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin certainly changed its suit in relation to civil liberties and it realised what most of us on this side and quite a number <Col N="269" /> in the Fine Gael Party realised 15 or 18 months previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have every opportunity to read that next week, if that arises. It is necessary to criticise these people in the House.  We talked about untouchables before. We in this House should not regard anybody as untouchable.  I do not want to introduce a note of acrimony to this debate but certain things have to be said.  I strongly believe Democratic Left and the Labour Party have much to answer for in the delay which ensued in relation to reforming the bail laws.  I make no apologies to anybody for saying that.</P>
      <P>My main concern is to inquire of the Government what exactly it intends to do in providing information to allow the public make a fair and honest decision regarding the proposal to change the Constitution.  I pose that question having regard to the judgment in the McKenna case.  On a number of occasions on the Order of Business I asked the Taoiseach what action the Government proposes to take in this referendum on foot of the McKenna judgment and I have not got a satisfactory answer.  Will the Minister tell the people how the Government intends to conduct this referendum campaign?  As Deputy Flanagan rightly said, it is probable that the 166 Deputies in the House support what the Government is doing on this occasion.</P>
      <P>However, I hope it does not adopt the line that because everyone in the House agrees with the amendment other people should not be facilitated in putting forward their case.  Some legitimate concerns have been raised by Deputies and people outside the House, but the rights of victims should take precedence.  I fully support the amendment and will do everything in my power to ensure it is passed.  However, as a democrat I believe people who oppose the amendment for genuine reasons should equally be able to put their case so that the public can make a reasoned and fair decision.  It is imperative that the Government lets us know immediately how it will ensure fair and impartial information is provided to the public.  I have no doubt about the decision which will be made but I want to know how the information will be put before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first referendum since the judgment in the McKenna case &mdash; it is the first referendum to which the judgment must be applied &mdash; and what the Government does on this occasion will lay down a marker for all future referenda, on which there may not be unanimous agreement in the House.  The Government should move immediately on this issue and either bring forward its Bill or accept the Fianna Fáil Bill on the setting up of an independent referendum commission. No Deputy wants a constitutional action to be taken after the passing of the referendum <Col N="270" /> or for this measure to be struck down because the Government is perceived to be acting illegally. The only way this can be avoided is by setting up an independent referendum commission.  Fianna Fáil proposes that the commission should consist of proven independent people and, in this context, reference is made to the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the President of the Law Reform Commission plus two other suitably qualified people, for example, a person on either side of the argument &mdash; there are legal people on both sides.  This commission should be given responsibility for putting forward fair and impartial information on the implications of this amendment in the context of the freedoms we enjoy under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil was in Government I have no doubt the Opposition would demand such a commission and would refer to transparency, accountability, etc.  The Government must ensure there is no cloud hanging over this referendum or no doubt about its constitutionality.  The only way to ensure this is by setting up an independent referendum commission.  The personnel to whom I referred are not civil servants and do not work at the behest of the Government; rather they are servants of the State and act independently.  They have shown their independence from Government at all times and will continue to act independently of it.  The Fianna Fáil proposal is eminently suitable and constitutional.  It will address the judgement in the McKenna case, remove any doubts about the constitutionality of the referendum and ensure that fair and unbiased information is given to the public.  I appeal to the Government to set up this commission immediately and to either accept the Fianna Fáil Bill or introduce a similar Bill.  Anything less will be seen by the public and, possibly, the courts as unconstitutional. I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to this proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan said extra prison places are being provided.  I am concerned that after the enactment of the legislation we may not have sufficient places for people on remand.  I acknowledge that extra places have been, and are being, provided but I am concerned that convicted criminals will be let out of prison to free up places for people on remand who have not been convicted. The Government should consider setting up a separate centre for people on remand so that places are available.  Will a person who is remanded without bail for four months or longer and found not guilty at the end of that time be entitled to sue the State?  This question has probably exercised the minds of constitutional lawyers and I would like an answer to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am glad the public will have an opportunity to express their views on this matter by way of referendum.  I appeal to the Government to ensure there is no doubt about the constitutionality of the referendum or anything done during the course of it.  I ask it to accept the Fianna Fáil Bill on setting up an independent <Col N="271" /> referendum commission or to bring forward legislation to meet our concerns in this regard.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dempsey on his very reasoned speech; I have always admired his contributions to debates.  We experienced a difficulty one time at the Committee of Public Accounts but he has matured since then and has put forward a reasoned suggestion to the Minister.  As an independent-minded Deputy, I would like to see more consensus in the House instead of the ridiculous nonsense which passes for business.  I do not attend the farcical Order of Business, the likes of which would not be seen at Billingsgate fish market.  The Order of Business is a joke and no commercial business could be run on a similar basis.</P>
      <P>We should put the Civil War and the variations of that theme behind us and seek consensus on issues on which, as Deputy Dempsey said, 166 Deputies agree.  On Deputy Dempsey's fears about the necessity for a fool-proof result from the referendum, the parties in Government should consult with Fianna Fáil and the poor dears, the Progressive Democrats, to reach consensus. The nonsense of who did or did not do something has reached laughable extremes, but I will not go down that road.  Suffice to say the Fianna Fáil suggestion that the unfortunate Minister, Deputy Owen, invented crime is ludicrous. Crime has been endemic in society for many years.  Cancer does not appear overnight, it is many years agrowing, and we must take collective responsibility for the shambles Irish society is in today.  In the last 30 or 40 years Deputies have sat on their backsides while crime bosses built up empires.  There are no economic problems at present.  In addition to the nixer industry, we have created a social welfare paradise.</P>
      <P>In every county, certainly in this city, there is fear of crime.  As people approach old age the need for security increases.  Cases are reported of elderly people in Dublin who lock themselves into their apartments on winter evenings at 4 o'clock.  That illustrates the extent of fear.  We are grappling with the recent problem of drugs, which frightens every responsible parent.  There are many more serious problems than drugs such as alcoholism, which kills many people and leaves families deprived.  That problem has not been addressed in an honest manner by this Assembly. It is easier to target and curtail the cigarette industry.  Seductive bullshit advertising of alcohol is offered to the children of the nation every ten minutes on television, with the consequence that hundreds of children aged 15, 16, 17 and 18 years are bringing children into the world for flyaway fathers.  That is part of the overall problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> This debate is set against ever-increasing crime. By Irish standards, murder is rampant.  Last year 41 people were murdered.  Hundreds of people are raped, but in many cases it is not reported because of the shame attached to it.  Armed robbery is common.  Virtually every shop in my town, which is probably no different from any other, has a barricade over the window at night and the doors are also barricaded.  Some robberies in the main street in Dundalk have been effected through the roof.  This is because of the ineffectiveness or lack of police presence. Governments have been complacent about crime, which is the biggest source of public irritation. The certainty is that this referendum will be carried by an overwhelming majority.  Only the offbeat clients, civil libertarians, will write aggrieved letters to <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>The question must be faced of whether we as politicians or judges and the courts system make the laws.  The bail system did not evolve from laws enacted here, although we stood idly by.  It was decided upon by judges who allowed people out on bail while charged with heinous crimes.  I am concerned, as is the average person in the street who does not get his knickers in a twist about points of law, as people in the law business do, that people charged with grievous crimes of murder and rape, horrendous crimes which have been downgraded by the legal profession and politicians who stood idly by and allowed such a system to prevail, are allowed out on bail.  People accused of murder, rape and savage battery or assault, where the evidence is supported by the local superintendent, should not be allowed out on bail.  Regardless of the strand of society from which the person comes, he should be held in custody until he is convicted or released by a court. That is what the people want.  They do not want fancy lawyers nit-picking about points of law. They want simple decisions.  Anybody who has listened to or read reports of court cases in recent years will be aware of the totally inappropriate sentences handed down by most judges because of the liberal ethos that has gathered apace.</P>
    <P>Another farcical practice for which blame must lie with the judicial system and the legal profession is the right to silence.  What person accused of serious crime should have the right to silence?  It should be mandatory on everyone of us to explain where we were at a particular time. If the finger is pointed at a person, he should be required to give an explanation, and if he refuses to give a rational explanation or even to speak, it should be held against him as evidence of guilt. The farcical right to silence was not conceived in Leinster House; it was conceived by clever barristers paid grotesque amounts of money to ply their trade.  That has resulted in the scales of justice being tilted against the victim.  It is time the judicial system and politicians wished up to the fact that people are frightened not only of drug barons but of local vandals, families in every town who pay recurring visits to jail.  Statistics prove that recidivism is rampant.  About 85 per cent of <Col N="273" /> offending criminals are recidivists, which illustrates that the system is not working.</P>
    <P>Radical and draconian measures must be introduced to deal with the problem.  The Garda Síochána needs to be overhauled.  In the same way as sub-post offices have been closed, in my county Garda barracks in Collon, Blackrock and Castlebellingham are locked at 8 o'clock at night. One hundred years ago when the British were here and there was no crime they were open all night.  We now have police and Civil Service lines when the animals are out at night.</P>
    <P>There was a riot recently on a Saturday night in a disco in Ardee &mdash; another hell hole &mdash; when a young man was severely assaulted.  He was struck by two assailants while lying strapped in an ambulance.  The police in Navan, almost 30 miles away, were called but they did not take a statement in the hospital until the following Monday afternoon.</P>
    <P>The system under which police barracks are closed at 8 p.m. is crazy.  We have part time policing and a Civil Service mentality but that is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>There is a need for every party in the House to support unambiguously and welcome the amendment, to stop nit picking and to get behind the Government which I encourage to consider Deputy Dempsey's reasonable suggestion of an independent commission.  If necessary, it should speak to Fianna Fáil &mdash; there are many good legal brains on the far side of the House &mdash; to reach a consensus so that the amendment will not be challenged.  That is the way forward.  We should not engage in mock battles but seek greater consensus in producing legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which I sincerely hope will be agreed but I cannot allow the opportunity pass without reflecting on the comments of Deputies McGahon and Dempsey. I support civil liberties and make no apology for doing so.  Deputy McGahon and President Bill Clinton may have difficulty with the &ldquo;L&ldquo;word but I do not, I proudly consider myself to be a liberal. Perhaps Deputy McGahon should speak to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, about the issue and perhaps we should reflect on how quickly we take our civil liberties for granted.  We are exercising in this House the liberty to speak and represent the people.  We should not take them for granted.</P>
      <P>I deny the snide suggestion, made continuously from the Fianna Fáil benches in particular, that in some sense the Labour Party has been sitting on its hands and refusing to grasp an obvious solution to our crime problems, nothing could be further from the truth.  My colleagues and I represent constituencies in this city where there is a serious crime problem with the attendant serious social problems. There is also a major drugs problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deny any notion or suggestion that we are soft on the perpetrators of crime, the contrary is the case.  This does not mean that we do not support <Col N="274" /> due process or the right of an accused person to a fair trial because we do.  I support the entitlement of an accused person, however heinous the crime of which they are accused, to proper representation in court and the notion that people accused of crimes are innocent until proven guilty in a proper court of law by their peers.  This has been a tenet of our legal system for many centuries, although it is not adhered to in every jurisdiction. There are jurisdictions where the onus of proof has been reversed, where it is up to an accused person to prove they are innocent.  I would resist any suggestion that we should move towards such a system here.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves what the refusal of bail means.  It means that somebody not convicted of any crime remains in jail.  There are many well established democracies in Europe, including Italy, France and Spain, where a large percentage of those in jail have not been convicted of any crime but are on remand.  We should be very slow to go down that road.</P>
    <P>As other speakers mentioned, this brings up the issue of prison accommodation.  The Minister for Justice has obtained the Government's approval to provide additional prison places over the next year for which I commend her but, as we all know, this is not enough.  If the amendment is passed, as I believe it will, it will not be enough in the changed circumstances.  We would then be in the bizarre situation where remand prisoners would be denied temporary release and kept in jail while people convicted of crimes would be released to make places available for them.</P>
    <P>I have suggested in the past that the system of temporary release is legally dubious.  It amounts, in effect, to an arm of the Executive, the governor of Mountjoy Prison, overturning a decision of the Judiciary taken in some cases only 24 to 48 hours earlier.  This will not stand up to challenge.  It is a system we simply cannot stand over in this House.  It saps public confidence and the morale of those involved in the legal system, be they gardaí or judges.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment as there are circumstances &mdash; I said this 13 months ago when Fianna Fáil introduced its Bill &mdash; in which we cannot in conscience allow an accused person out on the streets.  It stands to reason that if somebody with a serious drug addiction is accused of a crime in court, in all likelihood that person will not be able to sustain that dependency without committing further crime immediately.  It would be irresponsible in the extreme to allow circumstances where that person had an automatic constitutional right to bail.  If for no other reason, I support the amendment to prevent this from happening as it does daily in our courts.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at the amendment in conjunction with the other measures introduced by the Minister.  The measure she announced of a four months review is an important one.  The delays in the courts are unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that somebody accused of a serious crime will not appear in court for several years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> This is bad from the point of view of the prisoner on remand in jail for a crime of which they have not been convicted.  It is also extremely bad from the point of view of witnesses and the victim.  It is not good for the system as inevitably over time the memory of witnesses fades and evidence becomes less good.  The delays in the system, therefore, have to be eradicated.  I welcome the moves made by the Minister in appointing new judges and lengthening the legal term but that is only the start of the process.</P>
    <P>It is important that an application for bail should not become a pre-trial, that somebody should not be tried when the application for bail is made.  The Minister introduced safeguards to ensure that this will not happen but I suspect the greatest safeguard is the training and disposition of judges.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment, which is properly balanced.  It provides safeguards on which those who believe in civil liberties will insist but it will also get at those people accused of serious crimes who should not be out on bail.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter.  I fully support the measure being taken by the Minister and the Government.  The Minister is to be congratulated.  When the referendum is passed, not only will the public, who feel unprotected because of the liberal bail laws, breathe a sigh of relief, so also will the Garda Síochána and the law enforcement agencies which have had to put up with the sight of people walking out of court and laughing in their faces after getting bail on serious charges.  It will redress the balance in favour of the Garda, which is what we want.  Our laws are too liberal. However, the liberal agenda has backfired in this country and has caused untold suffering to the citizens who are the victims.  Legislation has favoured the criminal and the O'Callaghan decision in 1965 caused untold misery.</P>
      <P>For the past year or 18 months it has been almost impossible to live in an estate in my home town of Dungarvan because of thuggery.  The chief protagonist assaulted people at will.  He was then brought to court and remanded on bail. However, he continued to assault people.  He was charged with causing grievous bodily harm, but he walked free from the court because he had so terrorised the people when out on bail that they were afraid to give evidence against him.  Something serious must be done when law and order breaks down.  This referendum will help to redress that situation because we cannot allow lawlessness to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the most important measures the Minister has taken in the fight against crime. People living in estates and complexes are terrified. I met three different families from the estate I mentioned over the weekend and they pleaded with me to rehouse them.  This shows the magnitude of the problem in a provincial town, not in Dublin inner city.  People say they will rehouse <Col N="276" /> drug dealers and thugs.  Where will they be rehoused?  Such a solution only moves the problem from one place to another.  Reforming the bail laws will help because it will make these people realise that they cannot terrorise people and then walk free from court laughing in the face of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is time to tilt the balance of the law in favour of the public and the victims and this measure will help to do that.  We must take the thugs off the streets.  This referendum will be carried by a huge majority as the people cannot wait to get into the polling booths to cast their votes in favour of this change.</P>

      <P>One thing we do not want when the people have cast their votes is a court challenge to this legislation.  We have been lax in this regard in the past, so we should be more careful. There will be widespread &mdash; perhaps even unanimous &mdash; support in the House for this measure which will be reflected throughout the country at the end of November.</P>
      <P>I come from a constituency where a person was badly beaten up by someone on bail.  I have no doubt what the reaction will be in that neighbourhood. There is no reason it should not be possible to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is &ldquo;reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person&rdquo;.  That means someone will be sent to prison without being convicted of the crime.  That is the kernel of the argument made by those who oppose this change.  There is a daily record of crimes committed by people on bail.  The fact they will appear in court at a later stage is an incentive to commit further crime because the offences will be dealt with together and the sentence will not be increased by much. This action is the minimum required to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>It is disturbing to read about Irish citizens in other European countries who are held for a long time without getting their day in court.  We should ensure that when this referendum is passed, as it will be, there will be no delays in the court system. Great efforts are being made in this regard and extra judges have been appointed, some of whom are doing excellent work to clear backlogs. It is essential that there are no delays when this new system is introduced.  The Minister has made considerable efforts to extend the number of places in our prisons.  If we want to introduce change, we must introduce parallel measures to ensure there are minimum delays in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their broad welcome for this Bill.  Some Opposition Deputies took the opportunity to criticise what they described as delays in bringing this matter forward. <Col N="277" /> The important thing now is for all sides of the House to unite in explaining to the people why the proposed amendment is desirable.  As regards the alleged delays, I repeat what the Minister for Justice said last night.  Successive Governments have grappled with the issue of bail for the past 30 years and this is the first Government to have brought forward effective proposals to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>While accepting the Bill in principle, some Deputies &mdash; Deputy O'Malley in particular &mdash; raised questions about the effectiveness of the wording of the amendment. These were legitimate questions, but I assure the House that these issues were already considered in detail during the preparation of the wording.  Deputy O'Malley's main concern was that the standard of proof required might be so high that the referendum will only affect what he described as marginal cases.  In devising an amendment, the Government was conscious that an appropriate balance had to be struck.  On the one hand, it is undesirable to bring about a regime where bail is refused in relation to the commission of minor offences.  On the other hand, it would be pointless to introduce a burden of proof which would mean that the new bail regime would rarely be invoked for serious offences.  The Government examined a wide range of formulae before deciding the wording before the House.  In the end, it opted for a formula which closely follows the provisions of Article 5.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government believes the test involved to be a reasonable one, but it also has the great advantage of sticking so closely to the wording contained in the convention, it would be likely to withstand any challenge which might be made to it in the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made the point that the Government had so far only explained its case for the proposed amendment by reference to the legislation which it would introduce if the amendment is passed.  I do not believe this to be the full picture, but it is the case that it is the wording of the amendment which the courts will primarily have regard to.  The reason the Government made available the proposed outline is to help inform public debate.  It should also be borne in mind that, while the wording of the amendment enshrines the fundamental test relating to bail, which is that refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence, it allows provision to be made by law to that end.  The outline which has been made available sets out the criteria to which the courts should have regard and no case has been made which suggests the courts would take the view that those criteria are not relevant to the question of reoffending.  The legislation also makes it clear that a court, in deciding whether bail should be refused, does not have to conclude that a specific offence will be committed.  Again, no case has been made that this would transcend the power <Col N="278" /> to make laws which will be enshrined in the amendment.  I do not believe there will be any question of a court needing evidence that a specific crime will be committed if a person is to be refused bail.  Instead, a court, on the basis of the criteria set out in the legislation, will, to a large extent, make its decision in the light of a person's previous record.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey inquired what the Government will do to ensure proper provision of information to the people and its approach to the McKenna judgment.  The Government is precluded by the judgment from the expenditure of public moneys to campaign for a particular outcome to the referendum.  The Government will obviously comply with this.  The Minister for Justice announced yesterday that it is proposed to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> commission to provide the public with impartial information on the issues involved. The Minister for the Environment will announce details of this shortly and I believe this will go a long way to meet the concerns Deputy Dempsey and others raised.</P>
    <P>While appreciating the points made during the debate, the Government remains satisfied that what is proposed is a workable and balanced approach.  Other issues raised during the debate have already been dealt with in the Minister's opening contribution.  We now face a public debate on the bail referendum.  Many of the issues mentioned during the debate in this House will no doubt be reflected in that public debate.  I am sure that all sides of the House will contribute to the public debate in an effort to convince the people of the merits of what is proposed.  Again, I thank all Deputies for their generally constructive contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule provides that provision may be made by law for refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  I am puzzled as to why the Government decided it should refer to a serious offence as opposed to an indictable one. I am not aware of any definition of &ldquo;serious offence &ldquo;as interpreted by an Irish court.  I am aware that, under the 1937 Constitution, there is a reference to a minor or summary offence.  It is of fundamental importance that people have confidence that this provision, when inserted in our Constitution, will have some considerable meaning.</P>
      <P>The history of the implementation of our bail laws is to a large extent to be implemented.  For the last year in respect of which records are available, in the Dublin Metropolitan circuit, 1989 cases could have been taken by the authorities to estreat or forfeit bail moneys.  In only one case of the 189 was an application made by the authorities and that was unsuccessful.  Various attempts by me to establish accountability for this have failed.  My criticism that the estreatment of these bail moneys was not pursued has been met by a deafening silence.  It is of considerable importance in that context to ensure that existing bail laws are enforced because, if we do not, there will be a genuine feeling in society that the provision may not make the change which people and this House want.  In that regard, there is an urgent need for a remand centre.  Recently, a judge in a criminal court said he wanted to impose a custodial sentence on a person convicted of burglary but would not do so because the person concerned would be out in no time laughing at the judge and the system.  We must not reach the stage whereby we continue a liberal prison regime and people are given temporary release on the sole criterion of insufficient space while people are remanded in custody prior to their trials.  It is of considerable importance that dangerous criminals, who are likely to commit indictable offences if admitted to bail, are remanded in custody.  Inasmuch as that is important, it is also fundamental that we end the system whereby people are given temporary release from Irish prisons on the sole criteria that there is insufficient space to hold them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984 made a genuine attempt to change the bail regime.  The Oireachtas decided that anyone who committed an offence while on bail would receive a consecutive sentence.  That intention had considerable merit but gradually the courts began to interpret this to mean a consecutive suspended sentence. As word went out to the criminal world that one might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, the number of offences committed by people on bail increased.  Between 1990 and 1995 the number of offences increased from 2,500 to approximately 5,500.  Once people feel there is no deterrent to <Col N="280" /> committing an offence while on bail they will offend.</P>
    <P>I have suggested for some time that two linchpins are required, the first being the bail referendum, which is now coming to pass.  The second relates to reducing delays in criminal trials, about which my party is increasingly concerned.  The legislation proposed by the Minister for Justice provides that an individual is entitled to make an application to the court after four months if his trial has not been held and if he has been remanded on custody instead of being allowed bail.  This will mean there will be an application for review in every case when a person is remanded in custody, because no serious criminal trial is held within four months.  There is a need to terminate the preliminary examination procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became Taoiseach in December, 1994, 56 people have ceased employment with my Department and in the offices and agencies for which it is responsible.  None of these cases involved extraordinary severance arrangements because all were fully in accordance with the long established norms for such arrangements.</P>
      <P>Seventeen resignations followed from the change of Government and severance arrangements in these cases were as laid down by Government, which provide for compensation of one month's pay or two and a half week's pay per year of service, whichever is the greater.  The other 39 cases concerned permanent Civil Servants and comprised 24 resignations, 12 retirements and three dismissals in respect of my Department and the offices and agencies under its aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says these are not extraordinary severance arrangements, but the fact that there is a norm in the regulations does not mean that they are not extraordinary.  Would he accept that there is much public disquiet that State officials who do not perform their duties competently are remunerated in this way, yet the victims of State agencies, such as the hepatitis C <Col N="283" /> or the Father Brendan Smyth victims, are not looked after in the same way and do not get the same generous terms from the State when they are neglected by it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms in the case of permanent civil servants upon which retirements or resignations are catered for are laid down by law passed by the House and are part of the terms of employment of people in that category of employment.  These were appropriate terms to be agreed by the Dáil and were applied in accordance with established legislation by the Government in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that the only way we can get accountability from the public service appears to be to bring into force generous severance terms to get rid of people?  We have seen three examples in the past months where individuals who were not performing their duties in a competent fashion and who the Government considered should go, for whatever reason, were given very generous packages including generous pension arrangements. Will the Taoiseach not accept that this is not good for the country, nor for accountability and that it causes much public disquiet?  Would he also accept that we must look at conditions of employment to ensure that we can get accountability by those who do not perform their duties competently?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is aware that there are procedures in existence for the dismissal of civil servants as well as procedures for early retirement and resignation.  I have given examples from my Department where, of the 39 cases of permanent civil servants who have ceased to be servants in the Department of the Taoiseach or agencies under its aegis, 24 were resignations, 12 were retirements and three were dismissed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in saying there is no procedure for dismissal.  However, if one is dismissing anybody from a job exacting requirements exist with regard to standards of proof. These also exist in the private sector.  The Deputy is aware of the unfair dismissals legislation which applies.  I doubt if the Deputy would suggest that any employee should be subject to summary dismissal without recourse to the principles of natural justice and the appropriate legislation being applied in their case.  This society is governed by the rule of law.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach correct in stating that these matters are governed by legislation passed by the House?  Is it not the procedure that in the case of Government or State agencies wishing to make an amicable settlement with an individual, whether it involves the transfer of functions, the closing of an agency or where there is less than satisfaction with the individual, a negotiated settlement is worked out with the agency <Col N="284" /> or Department which is then sanctioned by the Department of Finance?

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of all resignations and retirements from office that took place during my term of office at the Department of the Taoiseach and agencies under its aegis, the relevant terms of the legislation were abided by and any settlements made, either in terms of the basic provision for lump sums for years of service, added years or whatever, were in accordance with the legislation.</P>
      <P>There is no current legislation which deals with the position of temporary civil servants and those engaged in political advisory work.  There were a number of resignations in that category during the early days of my term as Taoiseach.  These included those who had been associated with the previous Administration.  The severance arrangements for those people are not provided for in law because there is no legal basis for temporary civil servants.  However, it is the intention of the Government to make such provision in forthcoming legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney appears to consider that we do not have sufficient power in the area of dismissal of officials or that the terms are too generous in respect of the dismissal of officials.  The Deputy and her party will have an opportunity to put their views forward in the debate on the Minister and Secretaries legislation which will come before the House in due course.</P>

However, in view of Cabinet confidentiality I cannot ask the Taoiseach about the cases of the three people who were dismissed to which he referred because presumably he will tell me that I cannot know why they were dismissed. Would he not accept that there is a reluctance here to suspend people, for example, on full pay?</P>
      <P>The former chief medical officer of the Blood Transfusion Services Board obtained a very generous package including full entitlements.  We are now to have an inquiry, yet that person will not suffer financially.  It may have been part of the agreement with him that we would be unable to open up the case.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that this is wrong, that it causes public disquiet and that it means we do not get proper accountability from those who are incompetent in the public service?</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to misunderstand the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality if she thinks that I would be unable to give information about dismissals.  I can give any information the Deputy wishes about people who have been dismissed.  The only aspect governed by the absolute rule of Cabinet confidentiality is the discussion at the Cabinet table about the matter. There is, and was in the case of the beef tribunal, disclosure of the documents prepared for Cabinet. It was merely discussion at the Cabinet that was rendered inadmissible for disclosure by the Supreme Court, not the documents and not the decision.  If the Deputy wants details of the dismissals from the Civil Service I will provide her with that information.  I will not be prevented by Cabinet confidentiality from giving the Deputy any information she wishes about people who have been dismissed.  It is public information.</P>

      <P>I am answering questions with regard to the Department of the Taoiseach and people under my aegis.  The Deputy and Deputy Harney appear to be pursuing matters concerning other ministries and situations and I am not prepared to answer questions on that because they do not arise here.  As far as my Department or Departments under its aegis are concerned, no amnesties have been provided to anybody with regard to their resignation from office.  If a case is referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, he can take whatever steps he decides should be taken.  It would then be a matter for the courts to decide in accordance with the law whether an offence was committed.</P>
      <P>A matter which Deputies should consider in the wider European context is that these societies are governed by the rule of law.  The law exists to protect those who are unpopular in addition to those who are popular.  We should not allow the norms of law to be set aside as a result of strong, realistic and well based public concerns about a particular issue.  Whether a person is being prosecuted or dismissed from their job, they are entitled to the same protection of the law as everybody else.  The House should be aware of this point and Deputies should be proud that the House in its long existence has established the rule of law in an exemplary manner.  We should not seek to diminish those rights in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the issues raised by Deputies in these questions were covered in considerable detail in my Statement to this House on Thursday last.  It would not be the most beneficial use of Question Time to repeat here all the points that I made. <Col N="288" /> However, it may be useful to make the following points.</P>
    <P>The agreement reached in Belfast early yesterday morning is very much a step in the right direction in advancing the talks process.  It represents the correct response from democratic politicians to those who attempt to mix violence, as in Lisburn last week, with politics.  It may offer &mdash; and I emphasise &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; hopeful signs of progress in the remainder of the opening plenary, leading to negotiations in the three strands. However, the decommissioning issue, which has now been reached on the agenda for that Plenary, remains to be resolved.</P>
    <P>Any eventual agreement will have greater prospects of securing the necessary allegiance and support if all shades of political opinion in Northern Ireland contributed to it in a climate of peace. The democratic consensus, which exists North and South on non-violence, is an open one; anyone can join and it is our earnest wish that everybody will join, on the basis of an unqualified commitment to democratic politics and the credible abandonment of violence for political ends. However, as I stated last Thursday last, no one, armed or unarmed, has a veto.  We will carry forward the democratic political process, including addressing all of the issues of concern to Nationalists and Unionists, with or without Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>At the root of the democratic consensus, largely embodied by the multi-party talks, is an agreement that the means for handling, managing and attempting to accommodate difference is the political process only, without any fallback positions to violence or force.  The parties at the talks, many with diametrically opposed constitutional and political aims, share that consensus.  Therefore, the Government will continue to do everything possible in the talks to secure an agreed outcome, irrespective of whether Sinn Féin joins the process or not.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work for the maximum level of consensus in the talks where the contribution of each and every party, irrespective of size, will be seen to matter.  Accordingly, the Government have, in the talks and otherwise as appropriate, maintained contact with all the delegations there.  Nevertheless, agreement between the SDLP and the UUP is vital to reaching the sufficient consensus threshold. For that reason, the Government, in the multi-party talks, has had an intensive round of bilateral and trilateral consultations with, in particular, the British Government, the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government will explore every possible avenue with a view to securing the necessary progress in the talks.  The British Prime Minister and I reviewed the position at a meeting on 5 October.  Since then, there has been intensive contact between officials in my Department and No. 10 Downing Street.  For obvious reasons, I cannot give details of all such contacts, which are at an unprecedented level of <Col N="289" /> frequency.  However, I assure the House that an Anglo-Irish Summit will take place whenever such a move, in the judgement of the British Prime Minister and myself, would be of most benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government, the Northern Ireland political parties and church leaders as well as others to bring about reconciliation and agreement in an environment of peace.  That requires compromise on all sides.  Restoration of the IRA ceasefire and the maintenance by the loyalists of their ceasefire would help enormously to widen the space for that to happen.  I hope that the IRA will heed the calls of many people, such as Bruce Morrison, who placed special emphasis on a restoration of the IRA ceasefire at our recent meeting.  An IRA ceasefire is long overdue and it is time the outmoded and counterproductive use of violence was abandoned for good.  If Republicans are committed to peace, as they say they are, let them call a ceasefire now and make it a credible one.</P>
    <P>The Government was concerned at the withdrawal by the UDA prisoners of support for the peace process, especially since they played such an important role in bringing about the loyalist ceasefire of October 1994.  At the same time, the Government welcomes the fact that the prisoners have indicated they have not withdrawn their support for the ceasefire itself and that the UDP leadership, as well as the PUP, continue to urge restraint.  In that regard, I again support the calls of many people that the loyalist paramilitaries should not respond violently to the deliberate provocation of the IRA bomb attacks in Lisburn. We welcome the indications that these calls are being heeded.</P>
    <P>The loyalist ceasefire has made an enormous contribution to peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  The decision on a ceasefire was right. Violence only brings loss.</P>
    <P>The UDA prisoners' unease points up the need for the credible restoration of the IRA ceasefire on the basis that it will hold in all circumstances, a speedy movement into substantive and meaningful negotiations, and further confidence building measures, including measures affecting prisoners, so that everyone can see that peace confers real benefits on all.  What we need and what the Government is working intensively to bring about, is a balanced approach to enable these requirements to be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has answered a great range of questions.  I will ask about the more important issues which arose in the past few days.  I welcome the small positive step evident in the agreement of the agenda and the movement into some kind of meaningful talks.  Will the Taoiseach substantiate what he has said regarding the contacts between the SDLP and the UUP?  Does he believe something concrete was achieved yesterday and can he see useful forward movement? <Col N="290" /> I agree with the Taoiseach that we still need the IRA to heed the calls of every political party to reinstate the ceasefire.  I also agree with his support for the Loyalist groups' continued restraint in the face of intimidation by IRA elements. What would happen if all our efforts to achieve a ceasefire were successful?  It would be very helpful at this time if both Governments, particularly the British Government, were unambiguously clear about their intentions.  The Taoiseach has stated his position fairly clearly on this matter. What are the Taoiseach's views on how it would be treated by the British Government and the Unionist parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The parties to negotiations must demonstrate that they are committed to exclusively peaceful means of resolving disagreement. That means they cannot retain the option to return to violence.  A commitment to peace means exclusive commitment to peaceful methods in all circumstances.  That is apparent from the first of the six Mitchell principles.</P>
      <P>The Mitchell principles require those entering talks to be committed to the disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.  They are required to agree that such disarmament be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission.  They are required not only to renounce force but to oppose the use of force by others to influence the outcome of negotiations, to agree to abide by any agreement reached at all party negotiations, and to resort only to peaceful methods to express any disagreement with the outcome.  Punishment beatings and killings must stop.  The Mitchell principles are quite exacting and it is agreed by all that anybody entering the talks has to show they mean it when they say they are committed to those six principles.</P>
      <P>The Lisburn bomb is not consistent with the Mitchell principles and neither was the bank raid in Adare.  The terms for entry to the talks are set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules which require that the parties entering talks must establish commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and have shown that they abide by the democratic process.  I emphasise the words &ldquo;establish&rdquo; in that sentence.</P>
      <P>The challenge to demonstrate commitment to the Mitchell principles and to show they are willing to abide by the democratic process rests on the shoulders of the members of the republican movement.  Members of the republican movement shot Detective Jerry McCabe, killed the soldier in Lisburn and killed by bombing the people in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for the republican movement, against that background, to show that it is committed to the Mitchell principles and to establish that its commitment in terms of politics is to exclusively peaceful methods.  That is a challenge for it and we should not allow it to shift the focus to some other entity and say that somebody else is imposing a condition, a barrier or inventing a precondition. That does not arise.  The Mitchell principles <Col N="291" /> are very clear.  The legislation is there.  The requirements for participation in the negotiations are set out in the ground rules.  It is for the republican movement to devise the best way of establishing the things that clearly need to be established.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I assume that if those requirements are fulfilled the Taoiseach believes Sinn Féin could take its place in all party inclusive talks.  I assume that is the logical conclusion of what he is saying.  Can I take it that if the republican movement complied with the Mitchell principles and the matters he outlined, the Taoiseach does not see any difficulty with Sinn Féin taking its position in all party talks?</P>

      <P>In case anybody misunderstands me, I do not regard the Mitchell principles as an empty formula which people can somehow comply with in a formal way by, for instance, signing a piece of paper stating that they agree with the Mitchell principles.  It is very important that the republican movement shows that it abides by the Mitchell principles in reality, not just in form.  We, the law and the Mitchell principles are looking for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, a Ceann Comhairle, if each time I ask a 20 second question and get a five minute reply, I cannot operate Question Time.  I am trying to ask a simple question but the Taoiseach restates his position each time.  I asked the question to which I wanted an answer at the outset.  The Taoiseach knows the Official Report of the proceedings of this House is scrutinised carefully by others and it would be helpful if he were more definite in his replies.  The question is simple.  If the Mitchell principles, as outlined extensively by the Taoiseach, are followed, does he believe Sinn Féin can take its place at the all-party talks, or is he talking about a timeframe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the relevant legislation which states that the invitation to participate in the talks must be based on the fulfilment by a party being invited of the requirements set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules.  The relevant portion of paragraph 8 of the ground rules is, as I have said, that <Col N="292" /> the party establish &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;establish&rdquo;&mdash; a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods which show &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;show&rdquo;&mdash; they abide by the democratic process. There is also a reference in paragraph 9 to an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire but it is important that the requirements set out in the relevant legislation, which have been agreed to by all, be abided by.  It is important that parties also comply in full, in reality and in conviction, with the Mitchell principles, not simply as some formula to be adopted for a tactical purpose.  Tactical gestures are not relevant at this stage.  Real commitment to exclusively peaceful methods are now needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the definition of &ldquo;establish&rdquo; and &ldquo;show&rdquo; mean a time scale?  Is the Taoiseach referring to a timeframe following the completion of the substantial Mitchell principles? What is the Taoiseach's definition of &ldquo;establish&rdquo; and &ldquo;show&rdquo;?</P>

Many people were deceived by statements to the effect that the previous IRA ceasefire would hold in all circumstances. It did not hold in all circumstance and, therefore, great care needs to be taken by those who wish to convince that they have established a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods. Great care will be required on their part to ensure that this time they establish it in a way that will hold in all circumstances and that there will not be a second deception.</P>

      <P>I am not aware there has been any contact with Sinn Féin by any officer of the Government since the Lisburn bomb, although I cannot say that categorically.  I cannot check whether a call may or may not have been received but I am not aware of it.  I made it clear in the House last week that we are only allowing the possibility of communication for the sole purpose of achieving a credible &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;credible&rdquo;&mdash; ceasefire by the IRA that will actually hold in all circumstances.  On balance, it is probably better to allow at least the possibility of contact if there is some possibility that evidence could be produced that such contacts might <Col N="293" /> be helpful to achieve a genuine, credible ceasefire by the IRA, but it is a matter of fine judgment. It is not a straightforward matter.</P>

      <P>Meetings have taken place from time to time with all the people the Deputy mentioned but I cannot recollect any recent meeting, if &ldquo;recent&rdquo; is meant to imply in the past two or three weeks.  Furthermore, I do not necessarily think it is particularly useful for me to give an account of every clergyman I might meet because if I say I have met Fr. X or Mr. Y, and failed to refer to another, that could be seen as misleading the House.

That being the case, will the Taoiseach cut off contact with Sinn Féin as a way of showing that the Government is getting tough and is serious when it demands a ceasefire before dealing with Sinn Féin, either at Government or at official level?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already demonstrated in a forthright way in this House my attitude to the ambivalent attitude of Sinn Féin to violence.  I stated that I believe the tactic of the gun in one hand and the bomb in the other is one that was originated by the National Socialist Party of Germany. That tactic should not be used in this jurisdiction, or in this century, and it should not be condoned in any way by democrats.  That lesson should be learned by everybody because many people in Germany thought they could tame those who were using such methods.  They were the ones that were tamed, as history shows, and we should be careful about this matter.  I do not agree with the Deputy that all contact should necessarily be broken off.  If there is evidence that such contact can contribute to a verifiable ceasefire, then it is useful.</P>

I have already outlined the purpose of such contact in previous replies &mdash; I do not have a photographic recollection of every precise nuance of words I have used but the Deputy knows the purpose of these contacts.  They are not for the purpose of discussing the weather, the general political situation or anything of that nature.  They are only focused on obtaining an early and credible IRA ceasefire.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach find it difficult, as I do, to reconcile the view held by those who say we should cut off all contact with Sinn Féin because it refuses to condemn the Provisional IRA with the view that we should ask Sinn Féin to go to the IRA and ask it to restore the ceasefire, which is necessary if we are to have inclusive all-party talks?  Is that not a contradiction in terms in that we are asking Sinn Féin to condemn while also asking it to deliver?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of those is the reason we have allowed official level but not ministerial contact to continue.  The reason we do not have political contact with Sinn Féin is that Sinn Féin is associated with the IRA and the IRA is killing Irish people.  It is not appropriate that there should be contact at a political level with an organisation which is linked to an organisation that is killing people in this jurisdiction, in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  It is the killing by the IRA that causes the problem.  If they would stop the killing, stop the beatings, and stop all intimidatory tactics involving the treat of force, there would be no problem in having political contact. It has nothing to do with whether or not they utter the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo;.  However, I regard it as disgraceful that the vice-president of Sinn Féin could not condemn the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  It was a political disgrace that a person given the benefit of our airwaves could not bring himself to condemn the killing of Garda Jerry McCabe, but that does not affect the issue in terms of whether political level or other contact should be maintained with Sinn Féin.  There is no political level contact because of IRA killing.</P>

      <P>I would again emphasise to the Taoiseach how important it is that we have clarity on this issue.  Everybody in this House condemns violence.  We all want to see a permanent ceasefire with no going back and no further betrayal and are working on our questions on that basis. It is very important, and it has been recognised by the Taoiseach, that all strands of opinion, including Sinn Féin, be at the talks.  If there is a permanent ceasefire and reassurance about not going back to violence, what else has to be done before Sinn Féin can enter into the talks?  Will there be a time gap from the time of a ceasefire until Sinn Féin can enter into talks?  Without using the formula of words he has used, will the Taoiseach clarify that?  If a time gap is envisaged, how long will it be?  If this question has yet to be clarified between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, will the Taoiseach agree to meet the British Prime Minister and clarify it so that everybody will know where they stand?  Rather than commenting on the past, let us look to the future.</P>

      <P>What I have said is that the republicans, Sinn Féin and the IRA, have got to establish that this time their commitment to peaceful means is genuinely exclusive, that it is not one that involves the possibility of reverting to violence at any time or in any circumstances. Part of the problem in republican thinking has been an obsession with the British, an obsession with saying that the British have got to tell them what they should or should not do or that the British have created a new obstacle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement today that when the Governments deems it necessary to have a summit they will have a summit. It would be useful to do that.  The original peace process of August 1994 and September/October 1994 began long before the Mitchell principles were introduced in February 1996, and there was an unwritten timeframe involved in the first ceasefire &mdash; people believed nothing would happen for three months.  The peace process drifted on for 17 months.  The IRA was still wrong to break the ceasefire when it did, but what I am trying to establish is whether, if the Mitchell principles and all the other matters the Taoiseach put on the record, with which I have no difficulty, are complied with, there is on the part of the Taoiseach, the Government or the British Government a belief that time must elapse in order to establish that the conditions have been fulfilled.  Does the Taoiseach believe that we have to wait months or years?  The difficulty is that people who want a ceasefire cannot answer that question.  I cannot answer it.  I am asking what is the Government's answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It all comes down to a simple question of belief.  Do the Governments believe the IRA when it says it has given up violence for good and will never return to it?  It does not come down to some sort of formula.  It comes down ultimately to belief.  It had a ceasefire which was supposed to hold in all circumstances.  Since then the IRA has killed four people, because its ceasefire was abandoned by it unnecessarily.  It will come down in the end not to some sort of formula about timeframes but to the hard question of whether we believe this time that it will never go back to violence, to punishment beatings, that its commitment to total disarmament is genuine. Ultimately it will boil down to a question of belief.  The talks are there now and Sinn Féin can, of course, if it is able to create that belief, enter the talks according to rules that have been laid down.  I have referred to section 2 of the revelant legislation, paragraphs 8 and 9 of the ground rules paper and so on.  Deputy Ahern referred on a number of occasions to what he called &ldquo;an unwritten timeframe&rdquo;.  There was no unwritten timeframe that I was ever briefed about.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, stated clearly that there were no unwritten or other agreements.</P>

I am not aware, therefore, of any unwritten timeframe of three months or any reference to 1 January.  Deputy Ahern has been referring to 1 January here.  No such indication was given to me by Deputy Reynolds, or by Dr. Mansergh who also briefed me before I became Taoiseach, that <Col N="297" /> any unwritten agreement of that nature was entered into.  As the Deputy was in Government at the time of the ceasefire it is not helpful that the Deputy should be suggesting there was such an unwritten agreement unless he has evidence of it, and I do not believe there is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The detection of fraud and abuse of social welfare scheme is an integral part of the work of my Department and all departmental staff.  The control and compliance activities undertaken by the Department include carrying out inspections of employers in relation to PRSI obligations, inquiries of claimants in relation to their entitlement to payments, reviews of means and other selective interviews by investigative staff, matching of data from different scheme areas, medical examinations and so on.</P>
      <P>There are some 570 staff engaged specifically in the control of fraud and abuse of the various social welfare schemes at local, regional and national level.  This includes 383 regional staff and 187 at central level who are engaged in work related to control.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in an earlier reply of 9 October, additional resources to these are being assigned to tackle fraud abuse in the social welfare system.  These resources will be allocated as quickly as they can be made available, trained and put in place in their appropriate locations. The Department has so far deployed five additional specialist control officers and the balance will be assigned as they become available during the remainder of the year.  The enhanced programme for management of the live register which I have put in place is an ongoing one with as yet an indeterminate timescale.  The situation will be kept under continuous review and if more resources are necessary, they will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently put in place an enhanced programme of measures to tackle social welfare fraud and abuse, in particular, of unemployment payments.  All new claims for social welfare are carefully scrutinised to ensure that claimants understand their obligations, that they provide full and accurate information on their circumstances and that they are aware of the support services available.  To assist with this a new more detailed claim form has now gone into use.  A programme of six monthly interviews of unemployed <Col N="299" /> persons is being put in place to review people's continued eligibility.  Persons who are considered to be at particular risk of fraudulent claims will be subject to special review and, where appropriate, more rigorous signing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Claimants will be expected to register with FÁS; those who refuse offers of appropriate training and development opportunities will have their entitlement reviewed.  New improved arrangements for the transfer of information between FÁS and my Department are being put in place to facilitiate access to appropriate training and employment opportunities by claimants and to ensure that my Department is fully informed of claimants' responses to offers from FÁS.  Social welfare local offices are currently launching a major campaign to verify recorded addresses of unemployed claimants which will include a programme of home visits and other spot checks.  Special questionnaires are being issued to validate addresses and to reinforce conditions for the receipt of unemployment payments. Already more than 20,000 forms have been issued and the programme is continuing.</P>
    <P>A publicity campaign is planned for late October-early November to mobilise public disapproval of social welfare fraud and to increase public awareness of the anti-fraud campaign.  A consultancy study is being prepared to review and advise on the current anti-fraud and control measures.  Additional staff are being assigned to work associated with the control of fraud and abuse of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a programme of employer inspections which will result in some 9,000 employers being investigated by the end of the year to ensure they are meeting their PRSI obligations.</P>
    <P>Experience in Ireland and internationally shows that it is very difficult at any time to estimate the level of abuse and/or of fraud of the social welfare system.  However, the levels of detected abuse, with their resultant overpayments of benefit, of underpayments of PRSI, show that there is a continual level of abuse, perpetrated by a minority of claimants and employers.  This abuse can range from minor short-term irregularities to serious deliberate fraud of the system.</P>
    <P>I am determined to tackle fraud and abuse of the social welfare system effectively and to apply the full rigour of the law to those employers and claimants who deliberately set out to defraud the system.</P>

      <P>During Question Time sessions in the past year or more the Minister stated that fraud in his Department was minuscule and was not a problem.  About six weeks ago the Minister informed the country there was widespread fraud, that 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the live register was fraudulently claiming.  Has the Minister carried out an assessment of the structures and the audit within his Department?  Clearly, they must be inadequate in view of this level of fraud.  What <Col N="300" /> precise steps has he taken to identify and rectify those inadequacies within his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the Deputy a fairly extensive outline of the steps taken by the Department to enhance its control procedures.  On the question of fraud it should be borne in mind that there are a number of ways in which over payments may be made in relation to social welfare.  Incorrect payment occurs as a result of error or incorrect or incomplete data. Abuse occurs when its recipients fail to reveal circumstances which might affect entitlement, for example, increased capital, a spouse commencing work etc.  Fraud is a deliberate attempt by an individual to claim a payment to which he or she is not entitled, for example, by making false declarations, personation, current working and claiming, collusion by employers or employees in enabling an employee to retain social welfare improperly while working full time, the employer thereby avoiding paying PRSI or PAYE on behalf of the person employed.</P>

      <P>In the nature of things it would not be possible to say that a person signed off the live register because of fraud or for any other reason as the vast majority of people sign off without informing the Department of Social Welfare as to the reasons.  These people may be taking up a job, starting training or education, going abroad etc.  In the press statement issued on the September live register figures we pointed out that a number of factors led to the decrease. In any event, there is a seasonal decline in the numbers signing on in September when schools reopen and cleaners and temporary teachers who signed on during the summer return to work.  A number of companies also recommence work in September after the summer period.  It is difficult to identify precisely the reasons a person signs off the live register, but a significant proportion of the signing off took place during the latter half of September following the publicity about fraud.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary for me to meet the Minister for Justice about this matter. When the Department identifies deliberate fraud it makes sure that the Chief State Solicitor's office is made aware of it.  It also prepares the evidence and brings cases to court.  All cases of overpayment by claimants or non-payments by employers are examined for their potential to <Col N="301" /> prosecute them.  At the end of the day it is not for the Department to apportion blame in the sense of deciding that a criminal act has been perpetrated. This is a matter for the courts and where we can produce the evidence to that effect we bring cases to court.  There are later questions today on the number of prosecutions last year and this year and I will be happy to deal with the issue in my reply to them.</P>

      <P>The total value of bills in respect of legal costs from solicitors acting on behalf of women who have initiated legal proceedings arising from the delay in according them equal treatment under the Equal Treatment Directive in cases in which costs have been paid to date is £4,331,768.  The amount paid in these cases following negotiations by the Chief State Solicitor and in some instances, on adjudication by the taxing master, which include two cases in which a further balancing payment may have to be made, is £2,257,140.  This is a significant saving for the State by my Department and the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</P>
      <P>I have obtained legal advice as to the extent to which the amounts paid to individual solicitors and the names of such solicitors should be divulged and I have been advised that because of the terms upon which some of the cases were settled, I should not at present make known the names of all the solicitors involved.  I have arranged, however, to have the matter examined further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is most unsatisfactory.  We are talking about £4.331 million of taxpayers' money paid to solicitors involved in equality arrears payments.  We know from earlier replies from the Minister that some solicitors were paid in excess of £500,000.  This House and the public are entitled to know who <Col N="304" /> obtained the money.

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will correct the Deputy again.  The figure claimed was £4.331 million, but the figure paid on foot of those claims was £2.257 million, a significant saving on the claims made by solicitors.  The problem I have in terms of divulging names is that it was only this morning I received legal advice on what I might or might not do in regard to certain solicitors and I need time to examine that advice.  I treat everybody fairly in terms of the information I give in this House and I propose to provide whatever information I am enabled to give under legal advice in the House or by way of letter as soon as the amount of information I can give is clear to me.</P>

      <P>That is most unsatisfactory.  On 20 June this year the Minister said he paid £616,000 to one solicitor and £500,000 to another. It is not good enough that the destination of taxpayers' money is not made known to the House. This is the third time I have raised this matter.  I will ask my colleagues in the Committee of Public Accounts, who as we saw earlier this week are able to establish where taxpayers' money goes, to get to the root of this matter.  The Minister is refusing point blank to give the names involved and there is no good reason for that.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly was that my Department introduce a once-off £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary organisations in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.  Subsequently, I established a National Advisory Committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out <Col N="305" /> Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána &mdash; Neighbourhood Watch &mdash; are represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved.  The scheme is being operated on a once off basis.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided funding could be provided for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>The scheme, entitled a scheme of community support for older people was advertised on Wednesday, 29 May 1996 in the national newspapers. The scheme is open to any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people. Information on the scheme was disseminated through my Department, that is headquarters, regional and local offices and through the networks of the various organisations represented on the National Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>The deadline for receipt of applications was 28 June 1996.  This was to allow time for my Department to assess all applications and to ensure that those most at risk benefit from the available funds before the onset of the winter months.  The scheme is being administered in each of my Department's regions with the aid of a regional advisory committee which mirrors the composition of the national advisory committee.</P>
      <P>A total of 425 applications have been received from voluntary organisations catering for approximately 11,103 individuals.  These include late applications.  To date, 297 groups have been approved for funding catering for approximately 6,263 individuals aged 65 years and upwards. Applications received after the formal closing date were and are still being considered, in the light of resources still available under the scheme. It is expected all the available funds will be spent very shortly.  It is proposed that the scheme will be evaluated by the national and regional advisory committee to assess its effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the scheme towards the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I will launch a campaign next week to provide elderly people with specific information and advice on how to improve personal security both inside and outside their homes.  This will involve a mailshot to 320,000 pensioners and is being co-ordinated by the Departments of Justice and Social Welfare. The mailshot will include a letter signed by both Ministers and a number of relevant information leaflets etc. on security issues for older people.</P>

      <P>The scheme was constructed on the basis of discussion and consultation with voluntary organisations.  I remind the Deputy the task force was established on my initiative.  The report was available from the task force and a decision was made by Government on establishing the scheme within a matter of weeks, which is unique in terms of the way task forces operate.  It is a matter of some pride on my part and on the part of the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, that we co-operated and co-ordinated our work with many voluntary organisations and other Departments in this area.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be evaluated towards the end of the year by the national co-ordinating committee and the regional co-ordinating committees on which my Department and other agencies, including voluntary organisations, are represented. Their proposals and suggestions on how we can further help the elderly to feel secure and safe in their own homes and communities will be considered by me.</P>

      <P>While the task force did an admirable job in an expeditious manner earlier this year, it still took the Minister until 30 May to issue a press release.  The unfortunate voluntary organisations had less than three weeks in which to complete and return the forms.  Following the exertion of pressure they were given additional time to submit late applications but that was not the way to operate the scheme.</P>
      <P>The thugs who viciously attack and beat up elderly people &mdash; regrettably, this happened again in Wicklow last week &mdash; are looking for money.  Will the Minister agree that it is penal to apply a notional rate of 10 per cent to the small deposit accounts held by pensioners?  It is five times the rate of return on any normal small deposit account.  Does he have any plans to reduce this figure to the prevailing rate?</P>

While a closing date was set in terms of advertisements, no application submitted after that date has been refused.  Applications are still being considered.</P>

      <P>As the Minister and Minister of State will be aware, I submitted a comprehensive scheme to the task force based on my knowledge of rural communities, the essential part of which was that the person in danger should first alert one or two neighbours using a simple press button system.  Without casting any reflection on the Garda Síochána, if such a system was introduced the neighbours of the person concerned would be able, at the very least, to give a description of the vehicle used and perhaps to take action.

      <P>Funding can be provided to assist voluntary groups in providing small-scale security equipment such as the strengthening of doors, windows, window locks, door chains and locks, security lighting and socially monitored alarm systems.  A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of formally launching such a system in Wexford.  It is a national system under which people in any part of the country can key in numbers in a unit in their home, including a personal device which they can hang around their neck, to alert a neighbour, the Garda Síochána, the health authorities or whomever they choose.  The funding available from my Department can be used to acquire such a system.</P>

      <P>One or two neighbours with access to a phone who know the terrain and are aware of the difficulties should first be alerted when there is a problem, using a simple press button system.  They would be in a position to observe, perhaps furtively without having to take any action themselves, to gain information which would be of value to the Garda Síochána in pursuing the van or car used.  That is the key to solving the problem in rural areas.</P>

      <P>When I was in Wexford I met an elderly woman who lives on her own and has had the system to which I referred installed. She explained that one night there was a power failure.  A neighbour who had a key was immediately alerted and called to her house to check that she was safe.  When they discovered that she was still asleep in bed they did not disturb her and went home.  When they told her the following morning what had occurred she was reassured that this could happen while she was fast asleep. I agree with the Deputy that no matter what technology is used, unless there is someone who can respond, preferably a neighbour, the system will not be effective.</P>

      <P>Since becoming Minister, I have taken a number of important steps to improve the relationship between the statutory and voluntary and community sectors as well as the specific supports provided by my Department for local community development initiatives. These include expansion of the community development programme from 70 projects, including island projects and a number of family resource centres, and an annual budget of £2.45 million in 1994&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue my reply.</P>
      <P>These include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;expansion of the community development programme from 70 projects, including island projects and a number of family resource centres, and an annual budget of £2.45 million in 1994 to some 100 projects overall and a budget of £4.46 million in 1996;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a commitment to the proactive targeting of 30 new areas for establishment of new CDP projects over the next three years and the establishment of an expert technical group to assist and advise me in that regard;</P>
      <P>&mdash;enhancement of the role of the advisory committee to the Community Development Programme, on which projects and support agencies are represented, as a model of good practice in involving the community sector in decision-making and the development of a strategic partnership for social change;</P>
      <P>&mdash;expansion of the money advice and budgeting service programme from some 25 projects and an annual budget of £750,000 in 1994 to over 40 projects and a budget of £1.96 million in 1996; the expansion of this service so as to make it available throughout the State will be complete within the next year;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;establishment of a once-off £2 million scheme of grants for community support of older people, under which grants are available for community and voluntary organisations to provide certain security equipment <Col N="310" /> and systems at the homes of vulnerable older people;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an increase of over £2.5 million in my Department's total budget for support of community and voluntary activity since 1994, bringing the total to £11.37 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>&mdash;rationalisation of the relationship between my Department and the Department of Health in the area of support to voluntary organisations and the transfer of certain individual grants and the respite care scheme and part of the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations to the health services; this transfer was made in the interest of a more coherent system of statutory support for social service providers and eliminated the need for such organisations to apply to two sources for funding for the same services;</P>
    <P>&mdash;reform of the administration of the grant schemes operated by my Department; the schemes have been regionalised to ensure that those making recommendations on grants are closer to the communities they serve and can make assessments based on local knowledge and priorities;</P>
    <P>&mdash;transfer of the NSSB to my Department and strengthening of its role in the development of a network of community information centres, including provision of funds for computerisation of the network;</P>
    <P>&mdash;commissioning of a major independent review of the Combat Poverty Agency, the first of its kind since the Agency's establishment. The review, which will be published shortly, sets out recommendations regarding the future strategic direction for the agency. The results and recommendations from the review are being used as a key input into the development of the next three year strategic plan for the agency which is currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Perhaps most important of all, the announcement of the development of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy; the strategy is being developed in partnership with the national anti-poverty networks and in extensive consultation with the widest possible range of local community groups;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The National Anti-Poverty Strategy is designed to fundamentally change the way in which Government tackles the issues of poverty and social exclusion and has involved a widespread consultation process with the voluntary sector, including the national networks, which are funded by the Combat Poverty Agency so as to support the participation of the community sector in policy-making at national level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;establishment of a commission on the family to advise the Government on policy and support <Col N="311" /> for families, on which the voluntary community sector plays an active part;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Finally, I have as already announced obtained Government approval to publish a Green Paper on the role of the voluntary community sector and its relation with the State; the Green Paper &mdash; which is in place of an earlier decision to publish a White Paper &mdash; is intended to stimulate further debate and to facilitate further engagement between the statutory and voluntary sectors in relation to the issues involved.  The debate to be facilitated by the Green Paper will help shape future Government policy in relation to the voluntary community sector.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Green Paper, the expansion of the money advice and budgeting service and the operation of the scheme of community support for older people are the subject of separate questions to me on today's Order Paper.  This allows me the opportunity to give more detailed information on these areas, which I will not go over now.</P>
    <P>The steps already taken and future plans I have outlined represent a significant package of measures in support for the community sector and a significant development in the relationship between the sector and the statutory sector.  I am committed to further enhancement of the role of the sector and of my Department's support for local community groups in the fight against poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no concept of the problems in the voluntary sector when he continues to give such replies.  The Minister has misled the House on at least four occasions in the past 12 months about the voluntary sector and the promise to publish the White Paper.  When he took office two years ago a White Paper had been drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order for the Deputy to say I misled the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us he will now publish a Green Paper, not a White Paper which was ready for publication when he took office.  The voluntary sector has moved from a Government statement of definite intent to one of broad intent.  Will the Minister apologise to the people in the voluntary sector who trusted his assurances as regards the publication of a White Paper?  He has reneged on the promises he made on 5 October, 14 November, 22 February and 20 June in this House.  People in the voluntary sector do a great deal of fund raising.  They believed a <Col N="312" /> White Paper was ready to be published when the Government collapsed.  However, it has now been changed to a Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's concern for the voluntary sector.  When she considers the extensive reply I have given, I am sure she will recognise my commitment to the voluntary sector which is unmatched by any previous Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister cancel the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the reply she will see that rather than publishing a White Paper, which was already out of date when I took office, it was more important to initiate measures which would be of assistance to the voluntary sector and would involve it, as I have done, in a range of activities in which the Department is engaged.  We have already discussed the task force on security for the elderly, the national anti-poverty strategy and the commission on the family in which the voluntary sector is engaged.  I have done more to involve the voluntary sector in the process of consultation and decision making than any previous Minister.</P>
      <P>It would be irresponsible to publish a White Paper which was already out of date when I took office and is even more out of date now.  We need to address the current issues, not those of three or four years ago, not only in relation to funding but also in relation to the relationship between the Department of Social Welfare, the health boards, the local authorities, FÁS, etc., which deliver a service.  We also need to look at how they relate to the voluntary sector, which also provides services, and we must ensure that there is coherence in the areas of financing and decision-making.  I will provide some more information on the Green Paper, if the Deputies are not too impatient, which relates to terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point trying to pretend the White Paper is out of date.  It was ready in December 1994 when Deputy De Rossa became Minister.  We asked him this time last year what the delay was in publishing it.  He said he wanted to have his own input into it and would publish it before the end of the year.  On 14 November, he said he would publish it early in the new year.  On 22 February, he said he would publish it shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <P>We must proceed by way of questions.  It is not a time for statements. The Deputy will put her contribution in the form of a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter because the Minister will not answer any question we put to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister would reply to the questions asked of him.  There is the basic question of whether he will apologise to the voluntary sector, apart from the apology he owes to this House for misleading us on four different occasions.  Then there are the excuses he used.  He said he was a new Minister so he wanted his own input and he used the tired old cliché of blaming the previous Administration.  Then he said he would have to wait for his Cabinet colleagues to examine it so he blamed them for further delays. All we have had is one excuse after another over the past two years delaying the much needed White Paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is straightforward. Why did the Minister mislead us on four occasions and then add insult to injury in September of this year by announcing we were going back to a Green Paper instead of publishing a White Paper?  That is a straightforward question, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Perhaps we could have a straight answer.</P>

      <P>It must be obvious to the Deputy that if there was a White Paper ready for publication in the Department when I became Minister and it was a good one dealing with the necessary issues, I would have been only too delighted to publish it and claim credit for it.  The fact is it was a nonsense.  It was out of date when I arrived in the Department.  It is even more out of date now.</P>

      <P>Verbatim was established in Limerick in 1979 by Verbatim Corporation of the US to manufacture floppy discs.  In 1990 Verbatim was taken over by Mitsubishi Kasei Corporation which became Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation in 1994, one of Japan's leading chemical, plastics and computer media companies with sales of US$15 billion in 1996.</P>
      <P>In recent years the company has been faced with increasing competition from low cost countries and the prospect of product obsolescence.</P>
      <P>Arising out of a review of the worldwide floppy disc market, Mitsubishi Chemical decided that employment at the Limerick plant would reduce by approximately 220 people to approximately 180.  The House will realise, of course, that while the support agencies play an important role in helping industry to develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment and the competitive intensity of the market segment in which a company positions itself.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is continuing to work with management at the Limerick plant to see whether additional products or functions can be assigned to the Ireland Verbatim operation.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has also continued to explore other opportunities for investment in the Limerick area generally.  For example, the Deputy will be aware that last month I announced the establishment of PKS Information Services, a computer outsourcing and systems integration company who are creating 126 jobs over three years. Other announcements in 1996 were the 60 job expansion at Schaffner Interpro and the 27 new jobs at Form Grinders Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further employment opportunities for the Limerick area are also being actively pursued and I am hopeful that these will be productive. <Col N="317" /> The services of the industrial development and training agencies will continue to work to promote employment in the Limerick area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said IDA Ireland continues to work with management at the Limerick plant to see whether additional products or functions could be assigned to the Verbatim Ireland operation.  However, today's edition of <i>The Examiner</i> quotes an IDA spokesman as regretting the Verbatim announcement but saying he fully understood the commercial reasons behind it.  If one was feeling benign one might regard that as a practical statement but it does not tie in with the Minister's assertion that the IDA continues to work actively to see if additional functions or product making could be assigned to Verbatim.  What has the Minister and the IDA done to protect the remaining jobs and, if possible, prevent further job losses?  There seems to be a distinct complacency in the IDA statement which does not match the Minister's remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy there is no complacency on the part of either me or the IDA. The agency has worked with Verbatim for a considerable time and looked at other possible product developments.  Most people recognise that the floppy disk technology in which Verbatim is involved is being superseded by CD-ROMs, for example.  That has meant a dramatic change in the company's market position.  The IDA strategy with Verbatim, the strategy of many other countries in similar positions, is to look at new product development opportunities.  The agency and the company have looked at one possibility and are actively working together on other possibilities. As the Deputy will appreciate, having worked in this Department, the difficulty is that even with good early warning systems some projects inevitably do not survive, given the nature of business competition and changing technologies.  Our strategy with Verbatim is to seek to redirect the company into areas of the marketplace which can grow, thrive and provide secure employment.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the loss of these permanent full-time jobs, after the job losses in Packard, Semperit and Tambrands, is a worrying trend?  To what does he attribute this trend?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Redundancies in Ireland are at an all-time low.  In terms of the five year average we are at our lowest point for many years.  There is not a widespread desertion of Ireland by companies, international or otherwise.  There is no &ldquo;flight of the earls&rdquo;.  At times companies get into extremely difficult market conditions; they may face competition from low cost countries or be working in areas of technology which are being superseded.  That creates pressure and every country in the world experiences a natural turn around of types of industry, some in decline, <Col N="318" /> others in growth.  Ireland has been extremely successful in positioning itself to avail of high growth companies, as can be seen from the fact that the IDA's record is even better this year than last year, which was better than the year before.</P>
      <P>The projects mentioned by the Deputy are large but individual cases do not indicate a trend from the point of view of Ireland's ability to attract overseas industry.  We have had good overseas companies who have been here for long periods but individual companies get into difficulties at times and closure and downsizing are parts of commercial life, unfortunately.  This Government's strategy &mdash; which I think is the only strategy to pursue &mdash; is to redirect ourselves into areas of high growth, where job prospects are secure.  We are vigorously pursuing this strategy.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks as if Verbatim was set up many years ago.  In early February 1987 the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Noonan, made the dramatic announcement of investment of £60 million in that firm.  On that occasion he promised that a great number of new jobs would come on stream. Can this Minister say how much of that £60 million was invested in Verbatim and how many jobs it realised?</P>

      <P>It had a period of growth and would have reached its peak about 1989, when it employed roughly 600 people.  The company has had a long history in Ireland and it was successful when that market was on the crest of the wave. The IDA has worked with the company in looking at new areas of technology but unfortunately today's announcement reflects Verbatim's inability to identify new product opportunities for its Limerick plant.  However, we are continuing to look at new opportunities with the company.  The floppy disk market has become extremely difficult &mdash; it is subject to severe pressures from low cost countries and there is excess capacity.  It is this which has driven Verbatim to make its decision.  I am confident there are job opportunities in the pipeline for Limerick and I hope new projects will materialise.  I am heartened to see that last year 9,000 more people were at work in the mid-west region.  The area has a strong, buoyant economy and I intend to vigorously pursue job opportunities for Limerick.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer my question.  It is regrettable that so many full-time and part-time workers have been laid off.  I asked the Minister whether the £60 million investment announced in February 1987 was made and how many jobs it realised.</P>

      <P>The information available to me does not contain the investment sums.  I know grant payments were made to the company which realised 620 jobs at peak in 1989.  The company has unfortunately not been able to maintain its competitive position in this market and, as the Deputy says, it is extremely regrettable that 220 jobs have been lost.  However, I am confident that replacement industry can be found for Limerick and I am heartened by the buoyant nature of the mid-west economy, which is attractive to inward investment.  We can look forward to good opportunities for the future.</P>

      <P>The £60 million would have related to the company's investment.  The IDA has standard grant agreements, as the Deputy is aware, and it only makes grant payments in accord with capital commitments.  My information is that it made substantial grant payments and the jobs were largely realised at the time of the investment.  There would be normal &ldquo;pay back&rdquo; clauses if the company failed to realise the commitments; grants are not paid if the jobs are not realised.</P>

    <Title>Hepatitis C Infection: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In making this statement before the Dáil, it is right that I should at the outset show where <Col N="425" /> there is common ground between the Government and Opposition.  The tragic death of Mrs. Brigid McCole, leaving her 12 children without their mother, was a major personal tragedy, and the focus on this personal family tragedy has raised public attention about the hepatitis C crisis to a degree unprecedented since my predecessor, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, brought the matter to the attention of the House in February 1994.</P>
      <P>What is now acknowledged is that what occurred is nothing less than a public health disaster. The number of persons involved, the fact that some of the originally infected women became blood donors, leading to both men and women being subsequently infected through blood transfusions, and that a second infected donor in 1989 caused the infection of another cohort of persons, underlines the enormity of the disaster.</P>
      <P>All these victims of hepatitis C have been seriously affected in their lives, their welfare, their health and in their future.  There is common ground also in describing the events which occurred at the time as a scandal.  It must also be acknowledged that the events in question occurred in an institution created under statute, and for which I, as Minister for Health, am now politically accountable to this House.</P>
      <P>There is common ground too in our recognition that what has occurred is a source of deep distress, justifiable anger, and a requirement to know and understand what occurred.  However, in making this statement, and in bringing the motion to set up the Tribunal of Inquiry before the Dáil tomorrow, I accept too that I have obligations to this House and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>For the House, the public and the victims themselves to pass judgment, it would be helpful if I briefly reflected on the issue of parliamentary accountability and how I see my responsibilities to the House.  I am accountable to the Dáil for what I do or neglect to do as Minister, and for what is done in my Department.  The essence of that accountability is the giving of accurate and complete information, in so far as it is known to me or my Department at the time the information is given.  The question of responsibility or blame is a different matter which must be determined on the facts of each case, usually by the courts.  I am, and will continue to be, fully accountable to the Dáil, which is the primary forum in which I must discharge this obligation.</P>
      <P>With regard to charges and criticisms which were laid against me, I will always endeavour to set out the context and the full facts as known to me.  Sometimes these facts may not be palatable, in so far as they may not fit with the perception of those making the charges, but I always hope, particularly when we are dealing with matters of such public importance, that the assessment of my responsibility would be based on these facts rather than on other considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discharging this accountability I must, in common with all Ministers past and present, adhere to the separation of powers under the <Col N="426" /> Constitution.  I cannot usurp the functions of the Judiciary or compromise the process surrounding the discharge of its functions.  Neither can I make judgments on negligence or culpability in relation to any matter that is already before, or may come before, the courts.  If there is not an acceptance of this reality then we do not have a basis on which we can have a constructive debate on this or any other matter of public contention.  I hope we can also establish common ground on the concept of accountability and that Deputies, especially former office holders, will agree that the position I have set out in respect of a Minister's accountability to the House is fair and accurate, and no different from what was demanded of them when they held office.</P>
    <P>Serious charges have been laid against me.  It has been claimed that the State in the conduct of its High Court case in the action taken by the late Mrs. McCole delayed and obstructed the plaintiff from beginning to end.  I deny this.  It is simply not true.</P>
    <P>The State denied liability in the action.  My strong legal advice was and is that the State is not liable and that no admission of liability should be made.  Those who have criticised me for not admitting liability on behalf of the State pretend that the BTSB and the State are the same entity with the same case to answer.  If I were to accede to the demands being made on me to admit liability on behalf of the State I would be accepting liability on behalf of all Ministers and all officers of the Department who dealt with the BTSB over the years, and in terms of impending court cases back to 1970.  If I were to do so, I would, as I have said, be acting against all legal advice, and indeed against my own judgment of the State's culpability in relation to the people who have been infected as a direct or indirect result of the distribution of infected anti D product.  I ask those in Opposition who criticise me for taking this stance to say what they would do if placed in the same situation.  Recognising the adversarial nature of our court system and the need to be equally fair to those against whom allegations are made and to the plaintiffs, would they ignore the legal advice, their own assessment of the situation and the obligation to reasonably protect the legitimate interests of the taxpayers?  I very much doubt it.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with a number of particular allegations.  Far from there being delays in the State entering its defence, the State delivered its defence when the plaintiff's claim was adequately particularised by her lawyers, which they had failed to do when they delivered their statement of claim on behalf of the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>On the question as to whether the State delayed the discovery of documents, dates for completion of discovery were set by the court and adhered to by all parties, including the State.  The State sought and was granted two working days' extension of time for filing its affidavit of discovery &mdash; Monday, 1 April 1996 instead of Thursday, 28 March 1996.  Some 5,000 documents were <Col N="427" /> discovered, and made immediately available by the State parties, of which a small number became the subject of dispute which was resolved between lawyers of the respective parties without ultimate recourse to the court.</P>
    <P>I now wish to reflect on the manner in which issues were prepared for court in the adversarial system with which we are all familiar.  Pleadings are the means by which the issues to be tried by the court are both netted down and clarified so that not only the parties, but also the court, which otherwise knows nothing about the matters in controversy, can know what matters need to be adjudicated upon and the evidence which will be required to establish or refute those matters. What may appear to be convoluted or tortuous descriptions of highly charged allegations are sometimes recited, and must be denied in detail, otherwise they are deemed to be admitted.</P>
    <P>In Mrs. McCole's case, assuming the alias Brigid M. Roe, her lawyers made a large variety of allegations of wrongdoing on the part not only of the BTSB but also the State parties and the NDAB.  The State rightly called for matters to be properly established.  The means of establishing these questions was a matter for her lawyers. They could either provide documentary evidence of the matters as the case proceeded or prove them by evidence in court.  Exchanges of correspondence and documents between parties, with other interlocutory proceedings such as discovery, and interrogatories which in fact occurred in the McCole case, even further net down matters at issue.  It should never be assumed, therefore, that a position quite rightly taken by a party at the very earliest state of proceedings will necessarily reflect the attitude of that party on the eve of the trial.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question as to whether the State invoked the statute of limitations, I have said already what every lawyer knows, positions taken at the earliest stage of proceedings will not necessarily reflect the attitude of that party on the eve of the trial.  In respect of the statute of limitations one should look at the defence delivered by the State parties to understand what precisely was pleaded: &ldquo;In so far as the date of acquisition of the plaintiff's condition alleged in the statement of claim in or before 1980 and not the date of knowledge as defined in the Statute of Limitations is pleaded, such claim herein, if any, is barred by the provisions of the said statute.&rdquo;  A plaintiff is required to give reasonably specific details of the occasions on which important events are said to have occurred and this detail was missing from Mrs. McCole's statement of claim.  In pleading this, and in the notice of particulars, the State required her lawyers to specify the occasion on which they alleged she contracted hepatitis C or the occasion on which she became aware of having contracted such a serious condition.</P>
    <P>Why did the State contest anonymity?  A number of plaintiffs represented by the same firm of <Col N="428" /> solicitors issued writs against the BTSB, the NDAB and the State using aliases and giving their solicitors' offices as their addresses.  On 7 September 1995, the solicitors notified the defendants of the true identities and addresses of the plaintiffs.  However, in the one case they chose to progress ahead of the others, they declined to say who she was until 27 September 1995.  This was Mrs. McCole's case.</P>
    <P>On 22 September 1995, Mrs. McCole's counsel was told that, while the confidentiality of her medical condition and other intimate matters would be maintained by the State parties, as a matter of constitutional law the client could not proceed under an assumed identity.  This was confirmed in subsequent correspondence.  Her counsel and solicitors took a different view and ultimately she brought a motion before the High Court seeking a ruling on the point.  Their application in this regard was decided on 14 February 1996 by Miss Justice Laffoy, who dismissed it. The court in its judgment stated it had no jurisdiction to allow the plaintiff to prosecute her proceedings using a fictitious name and to do so would contravene Article 34.1 of the Constitution which requires justice to be administered in public. The judgment is available to anybody who wishes to read it.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is, like everyone else, bound by the provisions of the Constitution.  It is not open to him to ignore the explicit provisions of the Constitution, irrespective of whether he likes them.  Some Deputies opposite need to realise that under this Government, the State is governed by laws and not by lawyers.</P>
    <P>Mrs. McCole's initial application for an early hearing was withdrawn by her lawyers and when it was ultimately re-entered on 26 April 1996 it was pointed out that the case would not be ready for trial in June as her lawyers requested.  The President of the High Court adjudged it should proceed on 8 October 1996.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The date, 8 October, not only permitted her case to be listed in advance of thousands of other waiting litigants, who did not have recourse to a compensation tribunal, but also enabled her lawyers to amend her claim substantially on two subsequent occasions and make a considerable number of interlocutory applications to the court for reliefs considered necessary to her case, even in the summer vacation.</P>
      <P>While the State stated the case would not be ready for trial in June, it is clear from these details that the case on behalf of the plaintiff was not fully ready either.  In fact one of the major issues in respect of the case, which is also an issue specifically for the tribunal of inquiry, that is, the issue in relation to the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, was introduced for the first time by the plaintiff's solicitors by way of an amendment to the statement of claim on 23 July 1996.  They were not ready and the judge adjudicated that 8 October was the appropriate date.  He gave Mrs. McCole an early hearing on the basis that neither side was ready.</P>
      <P>The issues above convince me once more of the unsuitability of the courts as a vehicle for awarding compensation in cases arising from tragic events with a large number of plaintiffs who have broadly similar claims.  I was convinced of this when, as Minister for Justice, I set up the compensation tribunal to deal with the victims of the Stardust tragedy.  I am equally convinced I made the correct decision in this case when I advised the Government to set up the compensation tribunal for hepatitis C victims.</P>
      <P>The compensation tribunal provided enormous and unprecedented advantages to hepatitis C sufferers. It has been made clear that if claimants prefer to pursue the more cumbersome and costly route of maintaining their claims against the State before the courts, the normal rules of court procedures will not be waived to give them the same advantages which are available before the tribunal. This remains the State's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> Victims are offered an unprecedented forum where their claims are, in effect, unopposed. Unequally among persons entitled to compensation, they can obtain it without any opposition, with no risk of cross-examination.  The State, the Minister and the BTSB are not represented before the tribunal; only the applicant and the applicant's lawyers and witnesses are heard.  It is not surprising that none of the 140 awards has been rejected.  I ask the House to contrast this with the court system which is adversarial with all which that implies.</P>
    <P>On reflection, would not the solicitors for the plaintiff have served their client better if they had advised her to go to the compensation tribunal early this year?  Is it not accepted in the legal profession that the tribunal is working well and that Mrs. McCole could have received a significantly higher award by going before it?  She would not have had to face the enormous stress of court proceedings.  Could her solicitors not, in selecting a test case from the hundreds of hepatitis C cases on their books, have selected a plaintiff in a better condition to sustain the stress of a High Court case?  Was it in the interest of their client to attempt to run her case not only in the High Court, but also in the media and the Dáil simultaneously?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If we are to review the conduct of the case by the State, have not the solicitors for the plaintiff a case to answer also?</P>
      <P>I have been charged with changing my position by setting up a judicial inquiry.  I have altered my position in the light of what has occurred and it is now my view that setting up a judicial inquiry is vital in the interests of victims, their families and the public interest.  However, before I am further criticised for changing my position, I wish to explain my previous position.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government set up an informal inquiry to be conducted by a group of experts under the chairmanship of Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien.  In retrospect, it might have been better if a full judicial inquiry had been set up at that time, but I fully understand, taking the circumstances of the time into account, why it was not established.  The excellent public spirited expert group produced its report in January 1995.</P>
      <P>The report was welcomed by all interested groups and was generally regarded as conclusive. It was believed it had not only got to the heart of the matter, but also filled in much of the surrounding detail.  This was the position for nearly 12 months.  The expert group report was the bible on the issue and nobody called for a judicial inquiry.  In approximately March this year, solicitors for the plaintiff amended their first statement of claim.  A statement of claim is not a statement of fact; in effect, it is a statement of allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> A statement issued to the press by Positive Action at approximately the same time was critical of the Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien report. The discovery of documents in preparation for the High Court case led to further allegations.  By the time the High Court hearing was fixed on 26 April 1996, the content and conclusions of the expert group report were under pressure.  When I answered questions in the House on 1 May 1996 I was asked if I would set up a judicial inquiry to inquire again into the events.  I refused on the grounds that the criticisms of the expert group report were allegations and not proven facts and that the truth or otherwise of these allegations would be tested in the High Court in the McCole case which was set to commence on 8 October 1996.  I said that this, in effect, would be a judicial determination of events and if there were gaps and inadequancies in the expert group report, the High Court proceedings would be likely to fill them.</P>
    <P>I have been accused of changing the position I took in the Dáil on 1 May when I subsequently spoke in the Seanad on 20 June 1996.  What I said in the Seanad is consistent with what I said in the Dáil.  I cast it in different terms, however, as on 7 June 1996 the Chief State Solicitor received a letter from Messrs. Ivor Fitzpatrick, solicitors to Mrs. McCole.  The letter referred in detail to what I said in Dáil Éireann about a judicial inquiry and went on to point out that the plaintiff, the late Mrs. McCole, did not want her case to be used by the State as a judicial determination of events, and that she wanted to proceed as a private citizen in her claim for compensation.  I quote the relevant paragraphs:</P>
    <P>These statements in the Dáil give the clear impression that the Minister for Health and the Government intend these proceedings should be used to clarify, in the public interest, the significant and outstanding questions regarding the source of the hepatitis C infection for the numerous victims who have become infected with hepatitis C through anti D.  Thus Mrs. McCole's case is being used in a manner which was never intended by her.  It is being used for other purposes than the purpose of vindicating her personal right to bodily integrity, through the medium of compensation.  Her case is being used by the Minister and the Government to deal with controversies which in the context of these proceedings are of no concern to Mrs. McCole. Though Mrs. McCole obviously has an interest in the questions which are being raised recently in the public domain, she does not seek to pursue that interest through the medium of these proceedings.  And she resents and instructs our firm to resist any attempt by the Minister for Health to draw her into such a role.</P>
    <P>The letter to which I refer is why I couched my remarks differently in the Seanad.  There is now no court case.  I cannot say with certainty if and when a case will be taken in the High Court.  I <Col N="432" /> cannot say with certainty if such a case would be a judicial determination of the issues.  I now believe that the establishment of a judicial tribunal is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>I have previously mentioned the discovery of documents in preparation for the McCole case in the High Court.  I want to refer now to one item of discovery and to the allegations that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, and I misled the House when asked to comment when this item of discovery was made public by solicitors for the plaintiff.  The nub of the charge being made against us is that dockets in a file which the expert group did not see indicated that a clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis had been made in respect of the 1976 plasma donor, that this proved that the BTSB in 1976 knew that what it was dealing with was infective hepatitis, that the expert group did not know this and that, contrary to its own Protocols for other classes of donor, the BTSB continued to use the woman's plasma for the manufacture of the anti D product, which was the source of the subsequent infection.</P>
    <P>What I have said is a fair summary of the allegations which were made and continue to be made.  It is quite clear that a new file with new documents was discovered.  What is in contention, as far as I am concerned, is whether the expert group knew that the BTSB knew it was dealing with a possible case of infective hepatitis in 1976. It seems that the expert group report makes it quite clear that it did know, and that in fact while the expert group did not see the file of the documents which had been discovered, it had acquired similar information elsewhere which it had taken into account in the report.</P>
    <P>According to the expert group report, in November 1976 the female donor became jaundiced and the BTSB stopped using her plasma.  On 18 November 1976 the BTSB ordered tests for hepatitis B on all samples of plasma taken to date from the female donor.  These samples subsequently tested negative for hepatitis B in UCD Virology Department.  Samples from the female donor, the original pools for five batches of anti D immunoglobulin and the batches themselves were sent for RIA testing to Middlesex Hospital. On 15 December 1976, Middlesex Hospital reported that all samples it had received tested negative for hepatitis B.  In December 1976 the female donor recovered fully.  The BTSB apparently concluded that the jaundice was due to environmental factors and decided to resume using her plasma for anti D production.</P>
    <P>This is the summary in the appendix but it is more fully dealt with in the report itself.  Is it not clear from that summary that from November to December 1976 the BTSB thought it was dealing with infective hepatitis of the hepatitis B type? Why else would it have ordered tests for hepatitis B?  When the tests both from UCD and Middlesex Hospital proved negative the BTSB, according to the expert group, apparently concluded that the jaundice of donor X was due to environmental factors.  We now know its conclusion was <Col N="433" /> incorrect.  Donor X had neither environmental jaundice nor hepatitis B.  She had hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>I have never argued as to the culpability or otherwise of the BTSB in respect of these events. I cannot do so as Minister for Health.  It is for the courts to decide culpability and negligence.  It would be totally improper for me to do so.  I am informing the House that I based my view, when I issued the press statement in support of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, on the report of the expert group.  I believe that a letter subsequently on 27 May 1996, from Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien to Deputy Pattison, Chairman of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, supports my position.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in respect of the information on the file in question, donor X's treating clinician did not speak to the expert group.  If he gives evidence before the tribunal of inquiry, this evidence may be of great significance.  I am stating the position as I understood it on 1 May 1996. I gave the House my interpretation of what the expert group was saying in its report.  I did not mislead the House on that or any other occasion.</P>
    <P>I now wish to return to my position in respect of the BTSB.  In addition to my Department I have statutory responsibilities and obligations in relation to health boards and specialist bodies under the aegis of my Department, such as the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Irish Medicines Board, successors to the National Drugs Advisory Board.  My role and responsibilities in relation to the BTSB are governed by the provisions of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, and the assumptions on which it is based; the terms and intent of the relevant establishment order and the accepted conventions of our public service regarding the responsibilities of Ministers and their Departments in relation to executive agencies under their control.</P>
    <P>The Health (Corporate Bodies) Act was intended to provide the Minister with a legally efficient means of establishing a body which would discharge a specialist executive function, under the governance of a suitably constituted board, which would be likely to discharge that function more appropriately and expertly than could be done from within the Department; which would be a centre for expertise and which would have a large measure of autonomy in the discharge of its task, subject to the controls set down in the relevant establishment order, mainly in relation to personnel, finance and audit matters. The model relies heavily upon the professional competence and integrity of the specialist staff employed in agencies such as the BTSB, and the general competence of boards to exercise their role, to identify and address potential problems and to bring those they cannot address to notice in a timely fashion.</P>
    <P>It would not, therefore, be either appropriate or viable for me or my Department to separately engage the expertise to enable me to question the minutiae of the operations of bodies under my <Col N="434" /> aegis.  Neither would it be appropriate or effective for me to issue directives to the body on the conduct of its business including the defence of cases taken against it in the courts.  The BTSB is a separate legal entity; in this instance the case against it is different in content and range from the case against the NDAB and the case against the Minister for Health.  As I have already informed the House, and as I will now outline in greater detail, I did not at any stage attempt to direct the BTSB or the NDAB &mdash; now the Irish Medicines Board &mdash; in the decisions they took in defending any of the court cases taken against them.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised for not admitting liability on behalf of the State as if it and the BTSB are one and the same entity with the same case to answer.  They are not the same entity and they do not have the same case to answer.  They are separately represented and have separate legal teams.  If, as certain Deputies suggest, they are one and the same, why are all the plaintiffs proceeding separately against both?</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I have a supervisory function in respect of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, and arising from the exercise of that function I would like to deal with three issues. They are the appointment of the acting chief executive officer and CMO, the lodgment issue and the acceptance of liability by the BTSB. Deputies have criticised me as Minister for Health for taking measures to restore public confidence in the blood supply.  The House must appreciate the essential importance of our blood supply to the daily workings of our acute hospital services.  At any one time we have only a three day supply of blood to meet the demand for blood in our health services.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for the action taken on 5 April 1995 in assigning Professor Sean McCann and Mr. Liam Dunbar to the medical and administrative posts at the BTSB.  The urgent need to take steps such as management restructuring to restore public confidence in the BTSB as a means of ensuring continuity in blood supplies did not allow for any avoidable delay in vacating the posts of chief medical consultant.  Given the terms of Dr. Walsh's contract of employment, any alternative to voluntary early retirement would not have produced an outcome for many months, if not years.</P>
    <P>I also make no apology for the approval I gave to a major consultancy project at the BTSB undertaken by Bain &amp; Company who had world wide experience in the area.  A consultants' report was published in May 1995 and the recommendations made complement the recommendations made in the expert group report concerning the organisation and management of the BTSB.</P>
    <P>In regard to the lodgment issue, on 15 May last, on the advice of its lawyers, the BTSB made a lodgment into court in accordance with Order 22 Rule 1 of the rules of the Superior Courts.  It was open to the lawyers for the late Mrs. McCole to advise her to accept this lodgment at the time. The lodgment was not accepted.  I reiterate that the lodgment by the BTSB in this case was made in accordance with the rules of the superior courts and is a procedure open to all defendants <Col N="435" /> involved in litigation.  This lodgment was made by the BTSB on its own behalf.  I was not aware the lodgment was being paid into court by the BTSB prior to its being made.  I was informed by the BTSB subsequent to the lodgment.</P>
    <P>Order 22 Rule 1 (1) states that pleadings should not disclose the fact that money has been paid into court or the amount thereof, nor can communication of such moneys be made to the judge.  I have been criticised for not disclosing the fact of the lodgment to this House.  I am sure Deputies will understand that I was not in a position to make such a disclosure.</P>
    <P>On the question of admission of liability, a further accusation has been made by some Deputies that I knew for some time that the BTSB intended to admit liability and did not inform the House.  The BTSB informed officials of my Department on 16 September 1996 of its intention to admit liability in the case in question.  On 17 September 1996 I was informed by officials of my Department of the BTSB's intention to admit liability.  I understand the admission of liability was conveyed by letter on 20 September 1996 by the solicitors for the BTSB to the solicitors for the plaintiff.  On 24 September 1996 I informed the Government of the BTSB's admission of liability.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has informed me that it undertook, with counsel, an extensive review of the facts of the case which go back over 25 years.  The various allegations made in the proceedings were put to such witnesses as are available to give evidence and a range of experts at home and abroad was also consulted.  On consideration of this extensive review, and following legal advice, the BTSB decided to admit liability in the late Mrs. McCole's case in relation to her claim for compensatory damages for negligence.  I am not aware that the admission of liability by the BTSB is due to any so-called &ldquo;new revelations&rdquo; in relation to the case as claimed by some Deputies.</P>
    <P>There is much speculation about the ultimate settlement in the case and a Deputy has alleged that the State's &ldquo;fingerprints are all over the settlement agreed with the late Mrs. McCole's solicitors&rdquo;.  In relation to the settlement in the case in question, I was not consulted by the BTSB in this regard.  This settlement was a matter between the plaintiff and the BTSB and the State was not involved.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to get this opportunity of making a statement to the House setting out the facts as I know them in relation to a range of issues which have been the subject of controversy in recent months.  Later I will endeavour to respond as fully as I can to the issues which Deputies raised during this debate.</P>
    <P>With the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry, which we will discuss tomorrow, we will have put in place the ultimate mechanism available to this House to establish the truth of one of the greatest and saddest of public tragedies since the foundation of the State.  We must address the <Col N="436" /> mistakes of the past, deal fully with their implications and implement what we learn about how to make matters better.  The Government has already agreed a comprehensive health care package for the victims of this tragedy and put in place a scheme of compensation which is working very well.  If, as a result of the findings of the tribunal of inquiry, there is a need to amend the terms of reference of the compensation tribunal, I will do so promptly.</P>
    <P>I am committed to funding research on hepatitis C so that we can understand more about this newly described disease and assist the medical and scientific community throughout the world in its efforts to improve the outlook for all those who suffer from the illness, however acquired.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and proper that we address the failures of the past.  It is also important that we give support to those who provide a vital public service, based on the generosity of voluntary donors and the confidence of users in its services. It is a truism that it takes a long time to build the reputation of a blood bank, but a very short time to destroy it.  Those of us in this House have a particular duty of care in how we address any issue which impinges on the supply of blood and blood products.  Those who serve on the board of the BTSB, those who are charged with its management and those who bring their technical expertise to bear on trying to provide a safe and reliable service must, at this difficult time, be given our wholehearted support in implementing fully the many changes that have been recommended in the consultant's report on the BTSB and the expert group report.  Equally, we must be careful not to do anything which would discourage voluntary donors or increase the stress on those who must receive blood or blood products as part of their treatment and care.</P>
    <P>Every country in Europe currently has some problems with blood or blood products.  There is an acceptance that one can never do enough in ensuring quality and safety in this vital area.  It is not an easy job in the best of times.  It is certainly not easy now for the BTSB to cope with implementing improvements while dealing with the legal and other demands arising from the problems which occurred in the past.  The board and staff of the BTSB are fully committed to ensuring that we never see a repeat of the mistakes of the past.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, make a special appeal to my colleagues in the House, and to the media commentators, to be mindful of our ongoing need for a safe, reliable and trusted blood transfusion service. Many people in the BTSB and in the hospitals are devoting their time and energy to ensuring this.  We should not do anything which makes their already difficult job even more demanding or indeed impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the 30 minutes available to me because it is important this evening to establish facts and get answers to a number of questions many of us <Col N="437" /> have to ask.  I am appalled by the tone of the Minister's contribution.  I do not believe he has yet understood the anger, frustration and bitterness felt by all victims of hepatitis C.  It is a tragedy that members of Positive Action and other victims of hepatitis C walked out of the public gallery in protest at what they heard in the Minister's contribution.  I do not believe the Minister has shown any sympathy or compassion for, or understanding of, the level of anger and frustration being experienced.</P>
      <P>The Minister's lack of compassion, understanding and sympathy is proven in an issue I raised here with the Minister regarding the performance of the State's legal team during the second court hearing following Mrs. McCole's death.  I condemn again, in the strongest possible terms, the fact that every other legal team represented in court that morning offered condolences to Mr. McCole and to his 12 children, with the exception of the State's legal team.  Will the Minister outline the reason for that?  Was an instruction given to that effect?  Who was the State's legal team?  The Taoiseach accused me this morning of using the privileges of the airwaves to make certain allegations that I was not prepared to make in the House.  That is extraordinary considering that an eminent predecessor of his could say, &ldquo;do not bother me with the practice, what about the theory?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In a controversy that has run for two years one would expect the anger to abate after that period of time.  It has not abated.  This is the 22nd time the Opposition has had to raise this issue in the House.  As each new disclosure came, the anger increased.  It increased also when, as it seemed to everybody, the truth was being continually hidden. Every attempt made to get at the truth has been frustrated, regardless of what the Minister said in his lengthy contribution.</P>
      <P>The expert group was not given the full facts. It was established by the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and I am glad the Minister accepts that was the right decision at the time and that had he been Minister, it is the decision he would have made.  When the expert group reported to the Minister, he accepted, as did everybody including lawyers and Members of this House, that it was the bible, that all the facts were contained in that document.  We have now discovered that the expert group was not given the full facts.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister some specific questions that have failed to be answered.  When did the file in relation to infective hepatitis come to the attention of the board of the BTSB?  When was that information delivered to his Department by his Department's representative on the board? When was it subsequently brought to his attention as Minister?  Why was that information not given to the House?  Why did the Minister and his Labour Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, continue to tell this House that the bible was still the bible and that nothing had changed in relation to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> The Minister had an obligation to state in the House that an element of the report was not full and accurate.  If he had given that information, there would not have been a need for all the debates we have had in the House.  It would not have been necessary for the Minister to wait for a television programme to admit that, because the expert group did not have the full facts, their report was not final.  I still believe, as I did at the beginning, that the files should have been passed on to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and I still feel that should be done by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has all the information and has not been prepared to give full and frank answers to parliamentary questions.  A judicial inquiry is always the last resort.  That is what we now have.  It would not have been necessary if the Minister had honoured the promises made by Fine Gael in Opposition that they would fully answer parliamentary questions and hence avoid the necessity ever again for a tribunal of inquiry. In the past 18 months we have pursued the Minister relentlessly &mdash; he acknowledged that fact during our last debate on the hepatitis C affair. Throughout that time there was an attempt in this House to cover up the scandal.  Part of that cover-up was when the Minister told the House the expert group had the full facts although he knew, for quite a substantial amount of time before he faced up to it and stated it here, that they did not have the full facts.</P>
    <P>The result of that cover-up, and of all the dragging of information from the Minister and his Department that went on in this House and outside it, was that many victims were forced to go through torture.  They wanted the truth, but they did not get it.  For 18 months the Minister put them through the torture of having to establish the truth by pursuing actions through the courts. The court case related to compensation but it was, above all else, an attempt by the McCole family, and by Mrs. McCole in particular, to answer a number of questions that, it is hoped, will now be answered by the tribunal of inquiry in relation to how she got the infection, when she got the infection, and who was responsible for it. Those questions were not answered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's and the Government's U-turn on the matter.  It is clear from the terms of reference, particularly in paragraphs 3, 6 and 8, that the Minister has capitulated.  It is only because the cover-up was foiled that the truth can now finally emerge.  It is an awful tragedy that the truth only came out in instalments, in the same way as the Blood Transfusion Service Board, ignoring its own simple management regulations, delivered death by instalments to people.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about beef, cattle or export credit insurance.  We are talking about men, women and children, but mostly women, who were infected with a deadly disease by a statutory agency under the aegis of the Minister.  The State knows all the information and has known it for quite some time, but we have to have a judicial inquiry to establish the facts.  Although the Minister <Col N="439" /> knew the facts surrounding the controversy he refuses to answer parliamentary questions or to tell when he first knew of the 1976 file.  I accept that quite late last night he answered 18 of the 21 parliamentary questions and supplied answers to the other three questions, but I still believe that, even though he told me in relation to one of the questions today that he would make a statement on the matter to the House today, there are still aspects of that parliamentary question which have yet to be answered.  I hope we will get those answers before the end of the debate this evening.</P>
    <P>Is there a policy now on admission of liability, not by the State but by the Blood Transfusion Service Board?  It admitted liability in the McCole case.  It will now admit liability in the case currently before the court.  Is this to be done piecemeal or will it say straight out that there is a policy on admission of liability and the board will not force every single victim to get that admission in court?</P>
    <P>I found extremely discouraging yesterday's disclosure that up to 40 people who had tested positive for hepatitis C in 1991 were not told until 1993.  I found it even more disturbing to hear a Blood Transfusion Service Board official say if it were to happen all over again she would handle it the same way.  I was criticised for calling that a guinea pig project.  That criticism is not warranted. These people were being used as human guinea pigs.  It was suggested last night that there was no reliable test for hepatitis C available during those years.  Let me remind the Minister that in paragraph 3.85 of the Hederman O'Brien report it is stated:</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that a sufficiently reliable test for routine screening of blood donors for hepatitis C became available in 1991.  This test was introduced in Ireland on 1st October 1991.</P>

      <P>The person representing the Blood Transfusion Service Board last night stated she had no difficulty with the fact that from 1991 to 1993 patients' blood was taken as if it were a donation that would be manufactured into various blood products, but it had been taken not for that purpose but to be sent to the Munster division of the Blood Transfusion Service Board to be tested there for hepatitis C.  The implication was that the test for hepatitis C was not sufficiently reliable at that time for the persons to be told they had hepatitis C.  There was no suggestion, for example, that they should undergo a biopsy.  Such testing was carried out without their consent and without their knowledge. They were not told during those three years that there was a question mark over their blood, or that it was being taken for testing purposes. Permission was not even sought for that to <Col N="440" /> be done.  Yet, in the Hederman O'Brien report it is clearly stated that there was a sufficiently reliable test from as early as October 1991.  To be fair, the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, made that clear when he came into this House to answer questions from quite a large number of Opposition Deputies.</P>

      <P>That is not the point. The point is that there was a sufficiently reliable test, and the Blood Transfusion Service Board continued to take blood from donors, send it to Munster, and have it tested as if there were no sufficiently reliable test.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board was playing with people's lives, and those persons who had hepatitis C and who tested positive for it were denied health care over that two year period.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board now tell us there was minimal risk.  I suggest they tell that to the McCole family.</P>
      <P>Should the Blood Transfusion Service Board not at that time have referred all of those victims for liver function tests or indeed for biopsies? They should have.  One specific question that perhaps the Minister could answer is whether the same standards were applied in Dublin as in Cork.  If all of this work was going on between 1991 and February of 1994 in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, why was that information not made known by the board to the Minister or the Department, or was it made known to the Department or the Minister?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred in his interview on Sunday on RTE radio to the fact that there was infection in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s.  I would like to know what he means by that because the 1980s contamination, as far as I am aware, has not emerged before &mdash; donor X related to 1976 and donor Y related to 1993.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We strike a raw nerve every time we criticise the Minister and he gets terribly upset.  The reason I criticise him is that I believe he is the first Minister for Health who is in possession of all the facts.  Therefore, political responsibility rests with him.  He is the person charged with that political responsibility in respect of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I feel strongly that the Minister has failed to keep the public health interest to the fore in all this.  Nobody is looking after the public interest and on that basis the Minister's judgment has been flawed.  The Minister as the political master with responsibility should have made the decision that the State should not continue the cover-up that was going on.  They looked for the victims, the truth, admission <Col N="441" /> of liability, an apology and a statutory tribunal.</P>
    <P>I regret that in some of the questions answered last night the Minister started to hide behind either today's debate or the tribunal.  I want to know very specifically when did the Minister first know of the file on infective hepatitis?  When was he first told about it?  When was the Department told?  When did his official who was nominated to the Blood Transfusion Service Board become aware of it?  Despite the Minister's claim in this House that he would give full and frank information, as of yet we have not been able to secure the names of all the board members of the Blood Transfusion Service Board since 1976.  I appreciate the Minister may not have that information with him but I would appreciate if he would make it available to me this evening.  It would be important for us to have the names of all the divisional heads in the Blood Transfusion Service Board during that same period.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a specific question in relation to the tribunal of inquiry.  Was any assurance given when the former chief medical officer of the Blood Transfusion Service Board was given his severance payments that that would absolve him of being called in front of any inquiry or court case ever again in the future?  It is important for us to establish that in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was given legal advice that the State should not admit liability and he has repeated it this evening.  Who gave him this advice?  I do not accept there is a distinct difference or a Chinese wall between the Department of Health and the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  In the terms of reference of the tribunal he has broken down the Chinese wall.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in the House last week that he would look at the possibility of amending the scheme of compensation.  He seems to be indicating in his speech this evening that that amendment would only take place in the context of a report coming from the tribunal of inquiry. Is it not necessary now to amend the scheme of compensation because of various events that have taken place?  It is not meeting the needs of all the victims going before it.  It is important that that would be established now.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said publicly about the tribunal. It is absolutely essential and necessary, and would be in line with decisions made by previous Governments, that a Government decision be made directing Government Departments and State agencies to produce all documents and all information in their possession for the period which the tribunal covers to the tribunal so that any attempt at frustrating the work of the tribunal would not be successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a case in relation to the court case and anonymity.  While some are quite happy to be named publicly, there is great concern which I think the Minister appreciates among certain of the victims.  They may not have told their extended families, their neighbours may not know and most of them have not told their <Col N="442" /> employers that they have hepatitis C.  If they want to go before the tribunal of inquiry, and it is necessary that some should, will the Minister by way of amendment to the terms of reference or by way of statement to the chairman of the tribunal ensure that certain of the work of the tribunal can be done on a confidential basis or in camera?  When I talk about certain of the work I am talking about the victims.  That is a genuine concern.  Those who wish to remain anonymous have important evidence that should be brought to the attention of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>Who authorised the legal strategy in the Brigid McCole case?  Now that the Blood Transfusion Service Board has admitted liability in that case and in a subsequent case, what extra was discovered by the trawl of documents in the Blood Transfusion Service Board that its legal team advised it had no option but to admit liability? The Minister told me in response to a parliamentary question that no person was appointed by him in 1996 to look at all the documents.  Was any person either within the Department, an adviser to the Department or somebody appointed by the Government, a civil servant, a non-civil servant, a lawyer, a medical doctor who may have visited the Blood Transfusion Service Board at some stage during this controversy between 1994 and now to look at the documentation and to see for himself or herself what the actual position was?  I have a concern in relation to that and I would like the Minister to get advice on that before he answers, as he did in the parliamentary question, that no such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Was anybody appointed specifically, since this controversy arose in the past 18 months, to examine the files and did something come out of that examination that brought the Blood Transfusion Service Board to change its mind?

      <P>I am amazed that the Minister in his contribution entered into the blame game which he vilified last week.  Referring to Mrs. McCole's solicitors, he said:</P>
      <P>Was it in the interest of their client to attempt to run her case not only in the High Court but also in the media and in the Dáil simultaneously?...</P>
      <P>On reflection, would not the solicitors for the plaintiff have served their client better if they had advised her to go to the compensation tribunal early this year?</P>
      <P>The Minister scorns the solicitors for the late Mrs. McCole.  Will he accept, even at this late stage, that the truth would not have come out but for that court case?  We would not be debating the establishment of a tribunal tomorrow were it not for the determination of the late Mrs. McCole to continue with her court case despite the overwhelming attractions of going to the compensation tribunal which is so extolled by the Minister even today.  I am not surprised Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is appalled at this because I am equally appalled.</P>
      <P>This debate deals mainly with the public accountability aspect of the matter.  Tomorrow we will debate the terms of reference of the tribunal. The Dáil record on the handling of this matter, which has become known, to use the Minister's words, as the hepatitis C scandal, speaks volumes about the inability of this House to be an inquiring body or to hold the Government of the day to account.  Much is said about parliamentary accountability.  This is not merely a trendy slogan, it is fundamental to our system of parliamentary democracy.  This Administration, which owes its existence to the failure of a previous Administration to be accountable in terms of the extradition of a priest to Northern Ireland to face charges, has shown it has the memory of a goldfish when it comes to learning lessons about accountability.  Whenever the State is confronted with allegations of maladministration or a degree of culpability across a range of areas &mdash; for example, justice, health, health boards, the probation service etc. &mdash; this House does not have any chance of getting information.  It is important to remember that the Government is not only accountable to the Opposition but is accountable to all Members of the Dáil.  When asked questions by Deputies, including backbench Government Deputies, the Government must account to the Dáil which represents the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach volunteered as a courtesy, and only while under severe pressure, to have answers given to questions which had been ruled out of order last week on the grounds that they anticipated a Private Members' debate and which fell victim to the same rule this week because of this debate.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn <Col N="444" /> and I received replies to these questions last night and today.  However, these replies follow the same tired minimalist pattern which has become depressingly familiar to Deputies who table questions.  Last week the Minister had the gall to say that we had not put down enough questions and that the Progressive Democrats had a new found interest in the matter as it had never tabled questions on it.  However, the Official Report will show that one third of our priority questions to the Minister since he took office have related to hepatitis C.  It is a depressing indictment of Dáil Éireann and of our powers to hold the Government to account that we have been forced to resort to the establishment tomorrow of a judicial tribunal to establish the facts, all of which are within the possession of the State or the State authorities.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning the exhausted women and their representatives have led the charge. When we were being thwarted with minimalist replies to parliamentary questions their anger kept them going.  When we were obstructed either by being ruled out of order or receiving unsatisfactory replies from the Minister it was the women who kept on going.  They continued to brief Opposition leaders, they negotiated their own medical services, they negotiated with the Department of Health and they ensured that they would get the best.  While the medical package they received was good and to their satisfaction, they wanted their rights vindicated and to know what happened.  They were always entitled to this information.</P>
    <P>During the past ten days further information on this matter has continued to emerge from private sources, documents given by frustrated victims and leaks.  There has been some accountability by the Minister today and we have received decent replies to the questions we continually put to him.  However, up to now the Minister has been more forthcoming to the media than he has been to the House.  We recently had a debate on supposed Dáil reform.  Of course, this was not radical Dáil reform as the Government rejected the proposal for changing the system of answering parliamentary questions.  The Progressive Democrats proposed a root and branch reform of the way in which parliamentary questions are vetted and ruled out of order under the repeat rule or the anticipatory debate rule, all of which are procedural objections to the giving of information.  Any procedure which subjugates the right of the Dáil to receive replies to questions legitimately put should be abolished.  What aspect of the public interest is served by the anticipatory rule which ruled our questions out of order last week and this week?</P>

      <P>They were replied to as a matter of courtesy.  The Government promised openness and a type of glasnost in terms of the workings of the Dáil, yet we have had none of this. Instead this Administration has been very retentive in terms of information and has followed the same old pattern of giving Deputies as little information as possible and using the same old answers such as &ldquo;The Deputy did not ask the right question&rdquo; or the famous remark by a civil servant during the beef tribunal in respect of a reply drafted by another civil servant, &ldquo;That should confuse the Deputy&rdquo;.  This is still happening on a daily basis, as can been seen from the way I am thwarted by the replies given to my parliamentary questions.  Nothing has been done to enhance or improve the role of this House as an inquiring body.  While the Government has grown more influenced by spin doctors and the media, the role of the Dáil has been further diminished.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the tribunal were announced last night.  Apparently they include &mdash; and I welcome this &mdash; the responsibility of the Minister for Health and his Department in their handling of the matter from the beginning up to the present.  It is clear that the demands of the Opposition and the concerns expressed by many people who have an interest in this matter have been taken into account.  The Minister has separately agreed to fully account to Dáil Éireann and the tribunal.  When I asked the Minister yesterday the precise nature of the material obtained on discovery relating to the BTSB in the late Mrs. McCole's case prior to the settlement of that case he replied: &ldquo;Material discovered between parties to legal proceedings are exclusively for the use of these parties and cannot by law be disclosed to anybody not involved in the proceedings&rdquo;.</P>

Are we to take it from this that all future questions will be ruled out of order or answered in this fashion, in other words referred to the tribunal?</P>
      <P>Now that the tribunal is to be established, the Minister probably envisages that today will be the last day he will be asked to account for this matter.</P>

      <P>Yesterday we learned that up to 40 blood donors who tested positive for hepatitis C in routine screenings in 1991 were not told they had the virus until two years later.  Yet again we are getting the truth by instalments.  During the past ten days more information on this matter has been forthcoming than was the case.  This has not come from official sources or in replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister or indirectly to the Department of Health, but has been obtained slowly by extraction.  This follows the pattern of accountability by this Administration.</P>
      <P>There has developed an artificial divide or border as between the two aspects of the hepatitis C scandal.  After all the questions, whether they were taken, ruled out or replied to by way of courtesy, we still do not know when the Minister for Health was first aware of the diagnosis of infectious hepatitis in donor X and the existence of a file which clearly indicated that diagnosis. That is a crucial question in terms of the Minister's accounting to the House, and that is the main question today, but I do not think we will get an answer to it.  The Minister will not say when he was first aware of the diagnosis of infectious hepatitis in donor X, and that goes to the heart of our questioning today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the BTSB informed officials in his Department on 16 September 1996 of its intention to admit liability in the McCole case.  That admission of liability was conveyed by letter of 20 September by the solicitors of the BTSB to the plaintiff's solicitors and on 24 September the Minister informed the Government of the admission of liability.  He claimed that he was not consulted by the BTSB on the settlement and that he did not brief the Government on it.  I find that difficult to believe.  Is he saying that even after the discovery of the crucial file in the course <Col N="447" /> of proceedings in March, six months earlier, he was not informed by anybody, even his legal adviser, that the discovery of this document was of monumental importance, that the game was up and liability would have to be admitted?</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, inform Dáil Éireann on 28 March 1996 that the discovery of this document and file, showing that the BTSB had known of the existence of infective hepatitis since 1976, was not new information? That baffles me and the Minister in his statement today still has not properly explained how the Minister of State could say that was not new information.  Why were we accused of codding women?  Who is codding who?  Why did the Minister continue to strongly encourage victims to opt for the compensation tribunal?  Why did he ignore calls from Positive Action and Members on all sides of the House for an extension of the closing date for the compensation tribunal?</P>
    <P>The McCole family made public the harsh, narrow and threatening terms on which settlement was offered to it by the BTSB on 20 September. In a letter of 21 July 1996 the Chief State Solicitor pointed out, on behalf of the Minister, that the scheme of compensation approved by the Government offers the women seeking compensation a number of benefits which cannot be achieved in litigation.  They were outlined as privacy, informality, speed, compensation in two stages and a lack of requirement to establish negligence, everything but the truth.  There was no problem with money, but the truth was not forthcoming. The compensation tribunal skirted the issue of liability.  It skirted the truth.</P>
    <P>Immediately following the admission of liability the Minister, on behalf of the State, distanced himself from it, and the State still maintains that position.  I expressed my surprise at the time and referred to it as a politically convenient fiction, and perhaps it is also a legally convenient fiction. We do not know what precisely is the case against the State in this matter.  All we know is that the State vigorously denies liability.  To quote the Chief State Solicitor, liability is &ldquo;repudiated&rdquo;, and that remains the case.  Yet the terms of the settlement in the McCole case were based on Mrs. McCole dropping her case against the State and the National Drugs Advisory Board as well as the BTSB.  There is, therefore, a connection.  If the settlement was based on her dropping the case and her claim against the other two defendants, they must be connected.</P>

      <P>At 1 p.m. today I received a reply, as a matter of courtesy, to one of the questions previously ruled out in which I asked the Minister for Health whether proceedings were initiated or pending against the BTSB from outside the jurisdiction in regard to hepatitis C infection or blood products, if so, the status of such proceedings, the jurisdiction involved and that a statement be made on the matter.  The reply, which is confusing, as it is probably meant to be, states:</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that it has been advised by its legal representatives that proceedings have been initiated in seven cases from persons outside the jurisdiction claiming that they have contracted hepatitis C from blood or blood products made available in Ireland by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.

      <P>From the expert group report we know that the BTSB exported 225 doses of anti-D product to other countries over a number of years.  Some doses were supplied for research purposes while others were for clinical use.  Most of the product went to the United Kingdom but some doses went to the United States, Switzerland, Finland, Denmark and Germany.  The report states that the BTSB has written to all those supplied with the product.  It was confirmed to the expert group in a letter dated 16 August 1994 that &ldquo;to date, no report of seroconversion following use of product supplied abroad has been received&rdquo;.  I presume it is still the case that there have been no reports of seroconversion in respect of any of the products supplied abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the expert group was debated in this House on 22 February 1994.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, informed the House that the BTSB had informed him on Thursday, 17 February 1994 that evidence had emerged that there was a &ldquo;possible link&rdquo; between the product anti-D immunoglobin and hepatitis C.  From the Minister's contribution at that time it is clear that he was not provided with adequate information.  In light of what we now <Col N="449" /> know, it is interesting to read his contribution, which illustrates how little information he was given by the Department of Health.  There was no mention of the 1991 letter from the Middlesex hospital.  To say that there was a possible link, three years after that letter was received, is inaccurate because at that point it was a scientific fact that there was a definite link.  The then Minister went on to reassure the public, as was his duty, that there was no need for alarm.  Since he was not aware of all the facts at the time, he stated that the BTSB had been magnificently proactive.</P>

      <P>The Minister also stated that we have a blood transfusion service that is the envy of Europe and that, &ldquo;the board is determined, as I am, to ensure that that fine reputation is preserved, and that will be done in a completely open way so that the people's anxieties are allayed&rdquo;.  In light of what we now know, that makes compelling reading.</P>
      <P>The then Minister appointed the expert group to look into all aspects of the matter.  It is now clear the BTSB did not give access to vital documents which were subsequently revealed in the late Brigid McCole case.  It is clear it had inaccurate information about the six women who had developed clinical jaundice some weeks after receiving anti-D in 1977.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group makes interesting reading.  There is hardly a mention throughout of the Department of Health, the extent of its knowledge, involvement or supervisory role.  It is very much focused on the BTSB. We now know, because the Minister admitted as much, that the expert group did not receive full co-operation from the BTSB in its inquiry and that these matters will be fully examined by the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response to the events during his term of office was to accept the report of the expert group and to establish a tribunal which was specifically instructed not to inquire into the circumstances in which 1,600 women became infected.  Its purpose was to pay the money.  Does the Minister now accept that if his preferred approach of the compensation tribunal had been accepted by all the victims, including the late Mrs. Brigid McCole, the most serious cover up in Irish medical history would have gone undetected?  It is palpably true that if the court case had not gone ahead we would never have seen the documents which were concealed and a tribunal of inquiry would not have been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has alleged that he always wanted the truth to come out by way of the Brigid McCole case but I still believe that every trick in the book was used to obstruct the case by claiming the statute of limitations, forcing the plaintiff to reveal her name, threatening costs if she pursued aggravated damages, opposing an early <Col N="450" /> hearing and putting forward medical evidence to contradict the late Mrs. McCole's medical evidence as to her state of health.</P>
    <P>The Minister justified forcing the plaintiff to reveal her name on the basis that it was a decision of the court.  If the defendants, the State or the BTSB, had not objected and agreed to the plaintiff's request for anonymity as happened in the haemophiliac case, she would not have been forced to reveal her name during the case.  They did not have to play hard ball.</P>
    <P>The big battle appears to rest in the State's repudiation of a claim for aggravated damages. Given that the BTSB has admitted liability which is no longer at issue, is prepared to pay compensatory damages but continues to deny aggravated damages, I went to the trouble of looking up a recent case in the Supreme Court which described the difference between the two.  Ordinary compensatory damages are calculated to recompense a plaintiff for the harmful effects of a wrongful act and-or for moneys lost or to be lost and-or expenses incurred or to be incurred by reason of the commission of the wrongful act. That is what the BTSB was willing to admit and what the compensation tribunal pays out without an admission of liability.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Supreme Court described aggravated damages as follows: compensatory damages increased by reason of (i) the manner in which the wrong was committed, involving such elements as oppressiveness, arrogance or outrage; (ii) the conduct of the wrong doer after the commission of the wrong, such as a refusal to apologise or to ameliorate the harm done or the making of threats to repeat the wrong or (iii) conduct of the wrong doer and-or his representatives in the defence of the claim of the wrong doer plaintiff up to and including the trial of the action.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;aggravated&rdquo;, &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo; or &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; are interchangeable and arise from the nature of the wrong committed and-or the manner of its commission which are intended to mark the court's particular disapproval of the defendant's conduct in all the circumstances of the case and its decision that it should be publicly seen to have punished the defendant for such conduct by awarding such damages, apart from its obligation, where it may exist in the same case, to compensate the plaintiff for his damage.</P>
    <P>The victims of the negligence of the BTSB which has been admitted under the circumstances which have become public, even as far as we know them, would merit the awarding of aggravated damages.  Does the State or the BTSB or anybody else have a leg to stand on in light of the following: to knowingly use plasma from a donor who had infective hepatitis to make anti-D; to continue using anti-D even after six women became jaundiced in 1977 as a direct result of receiving anti-D; to ignore the 1991 Middlesex letter which confirmed the link between anti-D and hepatitis C; to fail to report that fact to the Department of Health until 1994; to fail to tell donors who tested positive in 1991 for two years <Col N="451" /> of their infection and to give misleading information to an expert group established by the Minister to examine the whole matter?  How many negligence acts does one need for a finding of aggravated damages?</P>
    <P>Compensatory damages is what the compensatory tribunal offered.  The reason the late Mrs. McCole was so determined and so strong right up to the end was that a finding of aggravated or exemplary damages in her case would have marked the courts' and the people's particular disapproval of the defendants conduct in all the circumstances of this awful case.</P>
    <P>The difference between compensatory damages and aggravated damages is that it contains an element of culpability beyond that of a mistake. Such culpability can arise from one individual's acts or omissions or from the collective acts or omissions of a State authority or of the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to the DPP, one of the questions was ruled out on the grounds that it anticipated the debate today and tomorrow.  It was submitted to the Minister for Justice and asked whether there is a Garda investigation into matters relating to the hepatitis C scandal whereby persons were infected by a blood product supplied by the BTSB; whether there was ever a Garda investigation into these matters; whether a file has or will be sent to the DPP in this matter.  The Taoiseach showed courtesy in allowing questions to be replied to.  Will he show the same courtesy in the case of this question?  The DPP took the unusual step of making at statement to the effect that no papers were sent to him in this matter.  It is important to know whether anybody has made any effort in any Department in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it was pointed out that the case would not be ready for trial in June as her lawyers requested and that the President of the High Court adjudged that it should proceed on 8 October.  Is the Minister saying her lawyers were not ready to proceed on 8 June having lodged their case one year previously?  They were ready, but the BTSB's lawyers were not ready and the President of the High Court made a decision on that basis. Did the BTSB get an independent medical opinion on which the President of the High Court based his decision rather than basing it on the opinion of a consultant who had seen Mrs. McCole and had stated that she was gravely ill? Surely a decision should have been made on the basis of the consultant's statement?  Will the Minister ensure that patients in Donegal, for example, are facilitated in nearby Altnagelvin Hospital, although this problem occurred in our jurisdiction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will give the list to the Deputy this evening.</P>
      <P>Mr. Liam Dunbar, who was the administrator at St. James's Hospital, and Mr. Shaun McCann, who is now professor of haematology at Trinity College and is presently attached to St. James' Hospital &mdash; Deputies know him from his reputation as the bone marrow transplant man &mdash; came in on the night Members accuse me of allowing people to retire.  I explained why retirement was the option available.  The post subsequently became a permanent post and Mr. Liam Dunbar became the permanent chief executive. Professor Shaun McCann wants to return to Trinity College so a new haematologist, who has wide experience abroad, has been appointed.  I understand he will take up duty shortly.  In the meantime, Professor Shaun McCann has decided to stay on until 1 December.</P>
      <P>The substantial elements of the recommendations of the Miriam Hederman O'Brien report and of the Baines consultancy group have been implemented.  Anyone who knows donors will know that the forms they must now complete are more searching and detailed.  The screening is also more rigorous than heretofore.  There are now fewer donors, not because there are fewer volunteers but because people are being screened out.  However, there is a greater volume of blood from fewer donors.  This arises from the fact that when the blood is subsequently tested, the initial screening screens out what would have got caught in the blood testing afterwards.  We now have blood and blood products which can match anything internationally in terms of safety.  As a result of this experience, we have internationalised the issue.  As President of the Health Council of Ministers, it is one of my priorities to ensure that European Protocols on blood safety and blood products are put in place.  It is the main item on the Council's agenda for November and I have the full support of the Irish Commissioner for Social Affairs in this regard.</P>
      <P>The compliments paid by Deputy McDaid to Dr. Joan Power are apposite.  In the course of research in 1994 she matched the incidence of hepatitis C in women to the fact that they had received anti-D product.  I know many women in this House had anti-D.  Almost 60,000 women in Ireland have been screened.  There is no one who does not know someone in their families or among their acquaintances or friends who did not have to be screened.  Fortunately, the number who screened positive is relatively small as a percentage, but as a number it is significant.  That is why I described this as a national health crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> Dr. Joan Power must now answer questions about the incidents.  It is easy in politics and in high profile professions to be a hero one day and a villain the next.  We owe it to Dr. Joan Power to put her statement of explanation on the record of the House because it answers questions which have been raised by a number of Deputies.  The statement was issued on 15 October 1996 and it states:</P>
    <P>In introducing screening tests to enhance the safety of the Transfusion Service for recipients, there is also a reciprocal responsibility to understand implications of a test for donors. This means the transfusion specialists must interpret laboratory information for donors and their General Practitioners and providing guidance on choices in the donor's further health care.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C was first described in 1989. However, laboratory tests have undergone several developments since then.  Screening of blood donors, introduced in late 1991 in Ireland, most commonly gives rise to a false positive reaction.  The interpretation of laboratory results of Hepatitis C virus is complex.  The BTSB decided it was important to understand why people were screening positively for Hepatitis C and set up a study to understand better the reliability of the screening tests and the nature and implications of this for the donor's health.</P>
    <P>Because of prior interests in this area, the Munster Director undertook a pilot study of donors screening positive for Hepatitis C in her area, in collaboration with Cork University Hospital and University College, Cork.  [I am sure the House is aware that Dr. Joan Power is an employee of the BTSB's unit in Cork.]</P>
    <P>It was this donor study that established the association between the administration of BTSB Anti-D in 1977 and transmission of Hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>It took many months between the time when basic screening was initially introduced and supplementary testing becoming available and a further year before this became more reliable.  It was also necessary to establish a collaboration with a research facility to test for presence of virus and the viral type.  This also took time.  Once these were in place, however, donors were invited from November 1993 to February 1994 to a specialist consultation.</P>
    <P>This approach is accepted by the medical profession in general as reasonable and responsible. As a result of the Munster's HCV Donor Study, the link with Anti-D and Hepatitis C was established and we now know more about testing for Hepatitis C and the virus itself which was invaluable in setting out the subsequent screening programme for Anti-D recipients. Furthermore, as a result of the study, these people were the first blood donors to be fully <Col N="455" /> informed, after complete screening for Hepatitis C, of their condition and to be referred for full investigation at a Hepatology Unit.  None of those involved in the Munster Donor Study had any prior knowledge of the association between Anti-D and Hepatitis C transmission.</P>
    <P>There is also a supplementary note here which states:</P>
    <P>The Munster Donor Study was structured in collaboration with Dr. Michael Whelton, consultant in Cork University Hospital, and Professor J.K. Collins at the department of microbiology U.C.C.  The aims of the study were to afford identification and treatment to those found Viraemic with hepatitis C, to review blood donor behaviour patterns in the Munster region and determine hepatitis C viral types and subtypes.  Under 30 donors who had initially reacted on mass Eliza screening and subsequently on Riba antibody testing were invited to consultation where their screening tests were interpreted and they were offered the opportunity of further testing for the hepatitis C virus, viral type and subtype.  Of the 25, six had first screened positive in 1991, 11 in 1992 and eight in 1993.  The average number of screened positive donations was two per donor.</P>
    <P>I have said that when the case came to court for early hearing before the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Costello, the decision was made on the basis on the defendant's application that this case was not ready to proceed.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, the defendants were not ready to proceed.  Mr. Justice Costello did not refuse an early hearing.  He decided to grant one.  He said the defendants had met the case properly and he fixed 8 October for it.  Subsequent to that court case, the solicitors for the plaintiff took the opportunity to change significantly their statement of claim.  An issue now arises with respect to the Therapeutic Substances Act, which was not in place from 1970 to 1984 but is now considered such a major issue that it is a separate term of inquiry in the tribunal.  It was only added to the case by the plaintiff's solicitors by way of amendment to their statement of claim on 23 July, significantly after the time they sought an early hearing.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The defendants asked that there would not be an early hearing because their case was not ready.  The High Court judge decided there would be an early hearing and he fixed it for 8 October.  Between June and October, the plaintiff's solicitors significantly altered their statement of claim.  One alteration of major significance was the issue of the Therapeutic Substances Act, which first came in as part of the statement of claim on 23 July.  That would indicate to any reasonable person that, if the judge had given an early hearing in June rather than fixing it for early in the next session in October, the plaintiff's solicitors would have had difficulty as well.  They could have proceeded with their unaltered statement of claim, but they altered it subsequently.  That is the only point I make.  I am giving the full facts.  Accountability does not mean one has to like my answers.  My obligation is to give the facts as I have them. Medical advice was given to both sides and on the basis of that, and despite the statement that the case was not ready, the judge still went ahead with an early hearing but decided that 8 October would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a question which has been put to him many times but has not been answered.  When did he first discover that the woman whose plasma was used in 1976 to make the anti-D product was clinically diagnosed at the time as having infectious hepatitis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I first realised she had infectious hepatitis when I read the Miriam Hederman O'Brien report some time in January 1995.  The conclusion there was that the woman had hepatitis C which is infectious hepatitis.  That was the first time I knew the nature of the problem. The new file of one of the 5,000 documents discovered is the basis of the charge laid against me that I misled the House.  I have already outlined in my speech that the document was attached to the grounding affidavit on 22 March 1996 by the plaintiff's solicitor in support of an <i>ex parte</i> motion to amend the plaintiff's statement of claim.  The documentation came to light in the discovery of documents of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The first time my Department became aware of the existence of the documentation was on 22 March 1996 when the <i>ex parte</i> motion was sought in the High Court and it then became part of the plaintiff's amended statement of claim in the proceedings.  A statement of claim in court proceedings is a series of allegations by the plaintiff against the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that this document was not seen by the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board is not disputed.  What is at issue is the <Col N="457" /> significance of this document in terms of the question of legal liability.  My view based on the advice available to me and my understanding of the nature of the documentation remains as I set it out in May.  I know that the treating clinician of donor X in 1976 was not interviewed by the expert group.  I do not know why and am not sure of the circumstances.  If that clinician is available for the tribunal and gives evidence before it then new evidence and information may emerge.</P>
    <P>I am saying that, with the stated knowledge I had from reading the Miriam Hederman O'Brien expert group report, when I was informed that we had this new document attached to the grounding affidavit of 22 March 1996, it seemed to me that did not change the information the expert group had.  I simply made a distinction between a file or document and the information contained therein. Maybe I am wrong.  All this will be adjudicated before the tribunal.  All I am telling parliamentary colleagues is that I did not mislead this House. My interpretation of what was in the Miriam Hederman O'Brien report and how it matched up to the new document is as my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea, said when he came into the House.  I am not claiming I will not be proved wrong subsequently.  I do not know what new testimony will be cross examined.  I know that Miriam Hederman O'Brien was not in a position to call witnesses or to cross examine under oath.  It was an informal inquiry.  I am simply dealing with what I was rightly brought in here today for, which is to account for myself.  As part of that accountability, it is alleged I misled the House on the issue.  I did not.  I supplied the information which, in my mind, was the only information I had.</P>
    <P>I knew donor X had infectious hepatitis when I read the Miriam Hederman O'Brien report, a long time before that grounding affidavit.  It is as clear as crystal in the conclusions that donor X had hepatitis C which is infectious hepatitis.  I also knew that, at some time between November and December 1976, the Blood Transfusion Service Board was so concerned about the fact that she had infectious hepatitis B that they not only sent tests to the viral laboratory in UCD but sent other tests to Middlesex Hospital.  When both the tests came back negative, they decided it was environmental jaundice.  As I said before, I will not say who was culpable but it is crystal clear they were wrong.  They tested for hepatitis B, they concluded it was environmental jaundice and they were wrong on both counts&mdash;it was hepatitis C.  The issues of negligence arise on the circumstances of making the decision.  I cannot adjudicate on that but the High Court could.  I thought it would be adjudicated upon in a case before the High Court but now the facts will be established before the tribunal.  I presume that in due course it will be argued before the High Court also when someone proceeds, as Deputy O'Donnell said, towards a full High Court case.  I did not mislead <Col N="458" /> the House and that is the only charge I have to answer here.  I am not the expert in this case.</P>

On 18 February the BTSB informed the NDAB, withdrew anti-D product and made arrangements for emergency supplies of WinRho SD from Rh Pharmaceuticals of Canada.  From 18 to 20 February there were extensive meetings between the Department of Health, the BTSB and representatives of hospitals to decide the next steps.  These included arrangements for a national screening programme. On 21 February a BTSB press statement announced the establishment of a national blood screening programme.  This is all in the report.

The tribunal will also have to decide if there is a connection between the fact that there was no licence, if a licence was statutorily required, and the infection.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have answered it.  The Deputy should reread the report because she has mixed up two points.  She asked who gave the retrospective licences under the Therapeutic Substances Act.  The Act is one issue but the issue of retrospective licences stems from the fact that the National Drugs Advisory Board should, in the normal course of events, have advised the Department of Health in respect of licensing. There were no licences applying at certain periods and that is all in the report.  The chronological order is there.</P>

There is nothing new here but the Deputy is making a new allegation.  No one at any point said this was a matter of contention or that Dr. Hederman-O'Brien's identification of a problem in respect of the supervisory role of the Department was not correct.  There is no doubt there was a lapse but the proposition that it contributed to the infection has to be tested.  It was part of the case against the State in the first High Court case and in the new cases which may or may not be heard.  It will also be central to one of the issues before the judicial inquiry.</P>

They relied substantially on the new chairman, who was appointed by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>Criticism in reports can be muted at times. However, Miriam Hederman O'Brien says that she got very little co-operation at the start, but after some time it improved.  That was when the new chairman was appointed.  I always acknowledge that Miriam Hederman O'Brien did not see all the documents.  There were 5,000 documents on discovery.  However, she would not even have seen routine matters which did not come up on discovery.  She relied on having experts investigating matters with her and produced a great report. It is now being severely criticised.  It may emerge that it has half, all or 90 per cent of the truth. However, a series of allegations have been made. It is not that I disbelieve the report, but I see why people now believe we should look at this again. There is a widespread belief that the full story is not contained in the report.  It is, therefore, not only in the interests of the victims but in the public interest to have a judicial inquiry.  If there was any other way of doing it I would suggest to the House that we proceed accordingly.</P>
      <P>I had a number of choices.  I could have reconvened the Miriam Hederman O'Brien group, but I do not know how long it would have lasted before it would come up against a brick wall when somebody refused to speak with it.  If I then had to give it judicial powers to compel witnesses it would have become a tribunal and the chair would be Dr. Hederman O'Brien rather than a High Court Judge or a judicial person.</P>
      <P>We should get serious about the situation.  The allegation that somehow the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, knew what was going on while his colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn did not, is ridiculous.</P>

Should they seek an adjournment?  Will there be hundreds of adjournments over the next few months until the inquiry reports?</P>
      <P>How many people have already sought adjournments, but have been denied them and forced to either proceed under the tribunal or go to court?

        <b>:</b> During the last contentious debate in the House on hepatitis C in June I was pressed to extend the date for applications. At that time, I stated &mdash; although it was generally missed, like all good news &mdash; that nobody would be required to have their case heard before the tribunal on any particular day and the dates would be fixed by agreement.  This is the position and nobody will be forced to take <Col N="467" /> a specific date.  On that basis, an application for an adjournment which was granted does not arise. Even when dates are fixed, the tribunal has allowed alterations to dates for personal reasons. There is no problem in this regard; it can be done in an informal tribunal.  I understand dates have been fixed for cases up to mid-January and there are up to 50 cases where solicitors have prepared full papers and are ready to fix dates.</P>
      <P>The essential point about the tribunal is that it does not depend on facts in the same way as a court case.  If a series of new facts is established, it does not affect the tribunal.  The only fact relevant to the tribunal is whether one can establish the medical link between blood and blood product and hepatitis C infection.  Once an applicant establishes this point, and in the cases of most applicants the information is readily available from the screening programmes, it is just an issue of measuring the quantum of damages.  The tribunal does not deal with negligence issues; the State, the BTSB and the NDAB are not represented. Only one fact must be established and then the tribunal measures the damages.  The emergence of new facts will not influence the manner in which it proceeds.</P>
      <P>However, if a matter emerges at the tribunal of inquiry &mdash; I cannot foresee what it might be at this point &mdash; which impacts on the terms of reference of the compensation tribunal, I will come back to the House and discuss necessary changes. I will make these changes if they are in the interests of the plaintiffs.  A restriction placed on me is that I cannot change the terms in an adverse way.  This provision was included to ensure that if public attention ever departed from this issue, a future Administration could not slip back regarding the tribunal's terms of reference.  The terms can be changed to assist plaintiffs but the Minister cannot take away any rights already provided under them.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's lack of commitment towards the economic development of the Border counties; stresses the absolute necessity to draw down the maximum amount of EU funding available to this area; and calls on the Government to utilise all available peace initiative funds towards industrial infrastructural development in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>&mdash;commends the Government's commitment towards the economic development of the Border counties and is confident that the <Col N="472" /> maximum amount of EU funding available to the Border region will be drawn down in timely fashion over the lifetime of the EU Programmes relevant to the area;</P>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledges that a full consultative process was undertaken in Northern Ireland and the Border counties by the European Commission task force;</P>
    <P>&mdash;further notes that local opinion in regard to the implementation of the measures was overwhelmingly to the effect that implementation of the measures be devolved to local implementing mechanisms and away from central Government departments;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and also recognises that the weight to be given to the various strands of the peace programme, including the question of aid towards infrastructural development in the Border region, was based on this local consultative process.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The slashing of the peace and reconciliation budget by £78 million is a terrible blow to the Border counties.  I cannot understand how any Irish politician could justify that, particularly when the peace process is at such a critical stage.  We need a Minister for the Border counties and a commitment to a region that knows it has been forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who live in the Border region and who see the effects of 25 years of trouble and strife on our communities welcome this debate.  When the peace process first began two years ago everyone asked why it had not been initiated 25 years earlier.  Why had so many lives to be sacrificed and businesses closed in the name of the troubles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union and others were prepared to make funds available for Border counties and when Jacques Delors announced the package for the Border region people thought money would be pumped into the area to address the problems that arose over 25 years ago.  We expected a programme to be put in place that would have long-term benefits for the entire region.  The peace and reconciliation programme promised much but needed some fine tuning which the Government was unwilling to carry out. Border counties were allocated only 20 per cent of the funds from this programme; under the previous <Col N="473" /> international fund we would have received 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reason given for the decrease in funding was the decline in population in Border counties. That was a clear indication that there was an urgent need to provide funds in that area to help rejuvenate it and that a higher rate of funding was needed.  The final straw came, however, when the budget committee of the European Parliament initiated a programme which cut the funding by £78 million.  That is an enormous amount of money to such a small community.  The money was needed to rejuvenate the entire region.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to everyone the way the Border region has suffered.  The breakdown of the peace process has affected the tourism figures for the region; they have decreased drastically this year. My colleagues in the House who live closer to the Border than I know that the number of foreign tourists in the area has dropped considerably. The proposal to reduce this funding was ill-advised. The MEP from this jurisdiction who supported it has few ties with Northern Ireland and represents the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>If the idea behind this move was to take money from the Border region and allocate it elsewhere, I hope the commitment given in the House last week by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to rectify the position will be adhered to.  We hold the Presidency of the EU and it is our responsibility to ensure we get fair and equal distribution of moneys due to this country.</P>
    <P>The peace and reconciliation programme needs some fine tuning.  It should have wider scope and capital projects should receive a considerable amount of the funding.  The reason the moneys have not been drawn down is because it takes time to document all the various projects under so many headings.</P>
    <P>There is a need for capital expenditure in Border areas.  Many communities could improve their areas if they were given the necessary funding.  I appeal to the Government, even at this late stage, to ask our colleagues in Europe to implement the necessary changes that will allow capital projects benefit from the funding.  I welcome the fact that some of the Government MEPs decided to abstain from the vote on this proposal but they should have voted against it in the budget committee.</P>
    <P>When we consider the decline in population on both sides of the Border, it is obvious there is need for rejuvenation and that will only be possible when the necessary funds are provided from a number of sources.  The IFI on the Southern side will contribute 25 per cent with the Northern side contributing 75 per cent but such funds, in addition to the funding from the peace and reconciliation programme, are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>In recent times the Government has withdrawn funds earmarked for Border regions.  Why is the Cork tunnel project considered suitable for INTERREG funding when some of the roads or <Col N="474" /> infrastructural projects in the Border region are not?</P>

Sligo Town is only 20 miles from the Border and if a town such as Drogheda qualifies in the same region, then Sligo should be eligible for inclusion.</P>

      <P>Nobody is better at that than Deputy McGahon.  He can write the script and rewrite it as it suits him on occasions.</P>
      <P>It is important that we ensure that the decision of the EU budget committee is overturned.  That funding is needed in the Border region.  Without it, many projects will not go ahead because local communities will be unable to come up with the necessary contribution.  There should be total agreement among Members of this House, particularly those from the Border region, that this decision should be reversed by fair or foul means.</P>
      <P>We must address this problem in a positive way.  There is little point in bemoaning the loss of funds.  The funds are available and it is the responsibility of all Members and the MEPs who represent us, to ensure that these moneys are returned at the earliest possible date.  There is little point in people trying to put schemes in place if they do not know if funding will be available in 12 months' time.</P>
      <P>There is total agreement in the House that the decision of the budget committee needs to be overturned.  It can be overturned if there is sufficient political will on all sides.  We are not here to score political points.  We are demanding money for the region that has been allocated to it.  It is up to us, with our European counterparts, to ensure this decision is reversed sooner rather than later because people must not be allowed to feel they are wasting their time preparing projects which will be eligible for funding under the peace and reconciliation fund.  There is also a need, in view of the decline in population on the Southern side of the Border, to increase the allocation.</P>
      <P>The Border region has suffered due to the troubles and we want the slim hope for peace to be built on by bringing communities back into viable employment.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to points my colleague made about County Louth.  I do not know about Sligo, but I know a bit about County Louth because I am its representative here and on two local authorities.  During the terms of office of the last two Governments, particularly this Government, <Col N="475" /> County Louth has received more funding for roads, sewerage and water than it ever got in the history of the State.  This year alone we were allocated by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Brendan Howlin, £87 million for sewerage and water and some £10 million for roadworks.  A further £60 million is in the pipeline for motorways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues, Deputies McGahon and Ahern, the Acting Chairman and myself are looking after County Louth very well with a good Labour Minister to provide the funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the only Oireachtas Member of the Cross-Border Regional Authority, I was very much involved in discussions over a period of a year and a half with community representatives and local councillors from the Border area in drawing up plans for the spending of that money. I proposed at one of the meetings that it should be channelled through the local authorities in the Border area.  However, this was not to be because we had no say on the matter.  Decisions on the distribution of the money were taken at EU level. We strongly protested about that when funding was first announced.  There was no disagreement on it among the representatives of the communities involved but the local authority representatives were substantially outvoted.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the chance to address the House on this issue.  As a representative of a Border county, it is of great concern to me and to those of us who live and work in the Border area and see the damage that is being done to our county and to the whole Border region by the violence in Northern Ireland.  That was not created by this House nor by any party in this House.  It was created by people who seem to have no interest in the development of the Border area but are instead intent on continuing the violence in Northern Ireland that has caused the problems we have been facing for 25 years.  Those of us who have to live in the area know that better than anybody else.</P>
      <P>There seems to be confusion among the members of the Fianna Fáil Party on a number of issues relating to EU funding for cross-Border activities.  Contrary to the impression created by Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, there will be no real reduction in the amount of money available to the Border counties under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  I have no doubt that moneys up to the amount originally promised will be made available to the fund when it can be properly availed of.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem has been lack of submissions for moneys by local authorities and other organisations in the Border region.  If I had more time I would explain that in greater detail. I have no doubt that this money will be available. It is a poor reflection on the Deputy that he, of all members of the European Parliament, does not understand European budgetary techniques.  This is not the first time this has happened.  We have never suffered financially.  Funds were made available if and when they were required.  That will be the case this time also.  What is amazing is that when all of this was being discussed in the European Parliament there was only one Fianna Fáil member present.</P>

      <P>It must also be taken into account that the existence of this fund has nothing to do with Fianna Fáil representation in the European Parliament.  They are the largest party here, and the largest party representing us in the European Parliament, but they have little say because the group they belong to is a total nonentity and has no say in the distribution of funding.</P>

      <P>This package was put together by the Socialist group led by Jacques Delors.  The main player in the negotiations was John Hume, who is a member of the Socialist group to which the Irish Labour Party is affiliated and in which it plays a major role at every level both within the Parliament and at the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>It would appear also that quite a number of Deputies in the Border area are totally confused on this issue.  There is no doubt that the moneys will be made available for the programme as set down for the regional authority.  Nobody indicated last night where moneys will not be available for projects put forward under the proposed programme.  We also have to take into consideration that we get moneys for areas along the Border in the Republic where the same does not apply to Northern Ireland, and we are not going to begrudge the people of Northern Ireland their share of any available funds.  What we are trying to do is unite the people, not divide them.  If we start to haggle about the distribution of EU funding it will do the people with whom we are trying to unite in Northern Ireland no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of debate does not help.  We should, as Deputy McDaid did last night, collectively condemn the violence created by the paramilitaries in Northern Ireland which is the root cause of this problem and not put the blame on Jacques Delors, John Hume and others who have put this funding together to benefit the whole region, North and South.  Fifteen per cent of the moneys available will be for cross-Border projects.  In <Col N="477" /> some parishes along the Border, schoolchildren living within five miles of each other have never played together or met each other.  We are trying to encourage integration, cross-Border activity and the co-funding of programmes jointly funded by the Republic and Northern Ireland with EU assistance.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;social inclusion and local consultation.  A special task force established for the European Commission engaged in a broad process of consultation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties concluded that, where possible, <Col N="478" /> the programme should be implemented through local delivery mechanisms and that the intermediary funding bodies be funded directly by the Commission to ensure maximum independence. The difficulties which have been experienced are largely due to this devolution requirement, a requirement which presupposed the development of innovative mechanisms in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It was only in February this year that the relevant bodies were fully up and running.  Since then they have been actively implementing measures provided for and they should be congratulated. A sum of £33.7 million has been delivered through these devolved mechanisms.  That amounts to over 70 per cent of the funding allocated to the Border counties.</P>

      <P>As I have only five minutes I do not wish to enter into debate with Deputy McDaid.  That programme is working well and any teething problems experienced with the new devolved mechanisms are more than compensated for by the new impetus which has been given to the concept of local democracy.  I hope the mechanisms which were developed, including the county council led task forces operating in each of the six Border counties, will serve as models for the future administration of EU funds. Deputy McDaid and his Fianna Fáil colleagues who tabled this motion are well aware of the facts as I outlined them.  They and the people in the Border counties know that this Government is fully committed to the economic and infrastructural development of the Border counties.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of EU funding to the economic development of the Border counties, the European Parliament budget committee's decision to reduce next year's funding of the peace and reconciliation fund is inexplicable.  I have every confidence that the Government will exert maximum pressure in the appropriate quarters to have the funding proposed by the Council of Ministers restored.  We will not bamboozle the electorate.  We will not emulate Fianna Fáil's attempt to massage the EU figures when in Government or engage in the type of scaremongering tactics adopted by Fianna Fáil in Opposition.</P>

      <P>Considerable funds are available for the Border region from INTERREG, IFI, the peace initiative, etc.  I said in Opposition and in Government that there is a serious problem because of the plethora of organisations. Every effort should be made to rationalise them and ensure they work properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> I listened to some of the greatest rubbish over the past two days regarding what different Governments have done for the Border region. The national plan was supposed to draw down £8.8 billion which was in the bag in Edinburgh. We were assured the N2 would be included for some of those funds.  Monaghan County Council called a special meeting to discuss how the plans could be drawn up quickly to get the money. Plans have been drawn up for the Carrickmacross by-pass, the Castleblayney by-pass and we are in the process of drawing up plans for a by-pass for Monaghan town which is choked with traffic. There was supposed to be a road from Belfast to Dublin to Rosslare as well as a railway line.  There was a commitment in the national plan to the Dublin-Longford-Sligo road to get to Derry.  I ask the Government to ensure in the interim review that money is found for the N3 which goes through Cavan.  With the peace initiative that is necessary if we are to get industry and proper business into the Border region.  Infrastructure is very important.  I support the idea of bringing all the bodies together with a view to obtaining the maximum benefit.  An all party group representing Monaghan county is meeting the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in an effort to encourage him to bring much needed employment to Monaghan county.  I want to see the maximum draw-down.  I deplore the decision of the European committee to try to cut the peace initiative but I am satisfied the Taoiseach and the Government will do what has to be done to have it rectified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said last night that he was pleased to be given the opportunity to put on the record the Government's commitment to the development of the Border counties.</P>
      <P>I am not sure I agree with the commitment of any Government over the past 26 years to the Border counties.  Every Deputy from a Border county, irrespective of party allegiance, would share my view if they had the honesty to get up and say it.  I am pointing the finger of neglect at the Border counties, particularly at County Louth, at all the successive Governments over the past 27 years, my own included.</P>
      <P>I do not share the euphoria of my good friend, Deputy Bell, at the £87 million which came to our county this year for sewerage schemes and roads. We have been on the hind teat in terms of any allocation from the Department of Finance for the past 30 years.  We have been waiting a long time for that money.  I regret Deputy Bell lost the European election on a photo finish.  If he had not I have no doubt he would have played a vital role in influencing the socialist bloc in the European Parliament to continue with the much needed money to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never been ambivalent in relation to the IRA.  I do not recognise Sinn Féin, it is a nonsense and a joke.  There have been many pious expressions of hope that the peace will resume in <Col N="480" /> the North.  I condemn Mr. Adams, the man I have dubbed the Irish Dr. Josef Mengele, for the position he has adopted in regard to the resumption of violence in the North &mdash; I believe he knows everything about it.  He has endangered the lives of people and is guilty, by association, of causing the deaths of hundreds of people.  He has also placed at risk the lives of people living in Border towns and the metropolis.  Through his actions, he has endangered the continued flow of money from Europe.</P>
    <P>As I have repeatedly done in recent years, I wish to voice my disapproval at the unfair allocation of funds &mdash; 80 per cent &mdash; to the North. This El Dorado or economic promised land has been bolstered by British funding for many years &mdash; last year the figure was £3.5 billion &mdash; while counties on the southern side of the Border have been hung out to dry and neglected by successive Governments in the spurious belief that if the counties along the Border were declared designated areas counties in the south and west would not like it.  Any rational Deputy will accept that the southern Border counties have been allowed to wither almost to the point of extinction in recent years.</P>
    <P>The policies of begrudgery are evident in the House and at Government and Civil Service level.  The tame acceptance by the Government of this very unfair allocation of funding is wrong and should have been opposed.  The EU perception of the North as economically deprived is erroneous.  This perception is understandably shared by people in America and Europe. Nobody would deny that the people of the Six Counties have lived through a nightmare for many years but their economy has been bolstered by compensatory money given to them by the British Government.  The southern Border counties have received no compensatory funding and it is time the Government realised that these counties are close to extinction.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy McDaid referred to the damage caused to the tourism industry in County Donegal, which I regard as my second home. However, that county benefits from the tourism industry, much of which is hidden from the Minister for Finance.  My town of Dundalk, the largest town in Ireland, does not have a tourism industry and is dependent on an industrial base.  Louth, the smallest county, never got a fair deal from any Government.  I ask the Government to accept that the allocation of funding is totally wrong from an economic point of view and to take steps during the intervening period to level the playing pitch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government's commitment to the Border region.  The best way of measuring this commitment is by what is happening in one's county.  One can refer to the Border region in global terms and the effects of violence and ask whether the Government's policies are being realised on the ground, but the only way of measuring people's confidence in the <Col N="481" /> Government is by the results.  In County Cavan there was a 30 per cent increase in 1995 over 1994 in the number of planning applications for private houses, small factories and farm buildings, and a further increase is on the cards this year.  This shows that the people of that county have confidence in the Government and its policies.</P>
      <P>This restoration of confidence has been brought about by the appointment of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for the Border region and the necessary programme of works.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, for taking the time to visit the county councils in the southern Border counties where he met public representatives and answered questions.  This was a worthwhile exercise in that the information was made available to the people.  Unlike other regions, counties Cavan and Donegal recorded an increase in population in the last census.  This is another indication that confidence has been restored by the Government.</P>
      <P>The great possibilities for development in the Border counties have been impeded by the resumption of violence.  I join with Deputy McDaid in calling on the IRA to stop the violence now.  This organisation which has no mandate and serves no useful purpose should depart the scene immediately so that honest decent people, North and South, can get on with their lives in peace.  Until last year some people in County Cavan had not even travelled as far as Enniskillen, which is 15 miles across the Border, because they were afraid they might end up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  However, during the peace last year many people from the North travelled South and <i>vice verse.</i> If the members of the IRA regard themselves as Irish patriots then they should leave the scene immediately so that ordinary people can live their lives in peace.  This will lead to further benefits.</P>

      <P>I could be patronising or party political but instead I will be honest.  I have been a Member of the House for 36 years and it does not matter a damn what party is in Government. An imaginary line has been drawn across the country somewhere around Drogheda and the areas north of it have been neglected.  While the depression in southern Border counties can be blamed on the troubles in the North this House is also to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDaid seems to think that Fianna Fáil has all the answers but I wish to remind him that there was no Border between the North and South during the first ten years of partition.  It was Fianna Fáil which erected the Border between the North and South and continued to build tariff barriers until such time as the entire Border was closed down by the Customs.  Since the removal of these barriers there has been greater interplay between the North and South. This gives us an idea of the kind of country we <Col N="482" /> could have had if Fianna Fáil had not blindly erected a Border between the North and South in an anti-British way.</P>
    <P>If ever a Deputy was disillusioned with the policies on Border areas I am.  I could pay tribute to various Ministers for doing their best but I cannot go that road.  Instead I must be honest and say that this House has contributed in a major way to the difficulties in Border areas.  The public does not realise that we erected a sterling partition between the North and South.  Successive Ministers for Finance on budget day took decisions without any reference to their effects on the North or on businesses in Border areas. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been guilty of that.  We should admit our mistakes and try to effect change.  The Government while it is trying to do its best, is no better or no worse than its predecessors.  I would like to speak further on this matter but unfortunately I do not have the time.  I have paid much attention to the cross-Border principle and believed from the day I entered politics, that the solution to the Irish problem lies in economics rather than talking politics.  At last that message is getting through.  I am sorry so many years of my life and the lives of other Deputies have been lost on the misguided policies of Ministers of all parties.</P>
    <P>Last weekend at my clinic in Donegal I spoke to a Protestant lady who read a speech I made and wanted to know why other people do not see the problems of the North as I see them.  She wondered whether the southern states constitute a different nation, whether people see things differently in the southern counties.  There are many Deputies here from the Border areas.  Can we identify entirely with the southern part of this island or have we an identification with the North with which we have not come to terms and which we have discovered only recently?  Dublin Governments cannot understand our attitude let alone the attitude of the North.  I am speaking very frankly and harshly, but I would fail in my duty if I did not.  Unless we understand the ethos of the northern people, Catholic and Protestant, unless we admit that this House has been as much to blame for the economic problems of Border counties as have the troubles in the North, we will not solve our difficulties.  That message must get through to every party, including those in Government.  The parties in Opposition should admit that when they were in Government they did not do much better.  When talking recently to a Donegal Fianna Fáil politician, who shall remain nameless, he said that while we do not often agree he agreed with me on that matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute on this very important matter, which has been debated at length within the Fianna Fáil <Col N="483" /> Parliamentary Party and at all levels of our organisation. The 25 years of the troubles did untold damage to the Border region, and my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan suffered enormously. Following the cessation of violence in the autumn of 1994, every public representative and statutory and voluntary body called for a concerted Border areas investment programme.  Such a programme is the least that is needed to try to undo some of the damage that was inflicted on our area.</P>
      <P>From the autumn of 1994 it has been readily accepted that the climate of peace would be strengthened enormously if the Government addressed the major infrastructural deficiencies in the southern Border counties.  A focused approach is needed to ensure investment programmes are co-ordinated and that funding from INTERREG II or the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is additional rather than substitutional.  The European Union recognises that the National Development Plan which was finalised before the cessation of violence needs to be refocused following the developments of autumn 1994.  I emphasise that the economy of the southern Border counties has suffered enormously due to the political problems from 1969 to 1994.  A major infrastructural programme and a determined approach is urgently required to build on the natural strength of the area.</P>
      <P>The poor condition of the regional and county roads in the Cavan-Monaghan area has been well documented.  In recent years some progress has been made in easing those problems, but a much greater investment programme is needed to provide decent access to people's homes and to places of work.  Alongside the difficulties with regional county roads, we have a very poor network of national roads.  The major employers, predominantly the agricultural co-operative societies in County Cavan, are sited on regional roads, with the result that colossal, heavy traffic uses those roads.  Those arteries are not up to the standard needed to transport goods at an efficient pace, to markets, ports and airports.  Some of the main north-south and north-west routes traverse Cavan on roads that are of regional status.  A number of routes leading from parts of the North to Sligo and Athlone are inadequate.  They may have been adequate for the volume of traffic 20 to 30 years ago, but today they are a major impediment to industrial development.  An adequate investment programme in our main roads is essential if we are to attract inward investment and give existing businesses the facilities they need to get their products to the marketplace in adequate time, with the lowest transport costs possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negligible level of inward investment to counties such as Cavan has been mentioned on numerous occasions.  Job creation has been confined to the initiative of local industry and business. We are fortunate that many leading enterprises have been established by local people <Col N="484" /> providing very worthwhile employment and based predominately on the natural strengths of the area.  I instance in particular the success of the agri-food sector.  The last foreign industry established in County Cavan was in 1977.  There has been substantial inward investment in Ireland in recent years, but unfortunately our region has not secured any of those projects.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I raised the need to provide an advance factory in County Cavan, with the most up-to-date facilities.  I requested the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Forfás and the IDA to give this request urgent and favourable consideration.  Progress has been made in that a decision in principle has been given to provide such facilities.  I call on the Minister to ensure that construction of this factory will begin in early 1997.  The facilities in such a factory should be geared specifically towards the food industry, with which the region has particular association.  Many of the statutory bodies in County Cavan have put forward proposals on the need to establish an information technology centre, and such industrial infrastructure is needed if we are to attract the necessary inward investment to the county.</P>
    <P>Indigenous industry such as the food industry must be a leading instrument in regenerating the Border economy.  The Government should provide research and development centres throughout the country, aimed specifically at increasing the added value of our farm products and thereby creating much needed employment.  With the great American and European interest in this country since the change in political fortunes in 1994, opportunities exist for the proper matchmaker programmes and links between industry abroad and in our region.  Such links with major international firms would be of enormous benefit to the much smaller enterprises on which our region depends for employment.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on Question Time and in debate on his Department's Estimates on the need to progress the Erne navigation project.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, is here because I questioned him on this matter previously. This project would make the Erne navigable southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen Forest Park, Killeshandra and Loch Gowna.  The preliminary engineering report on the project demonstrated that there are no unforeseen obstacles to carrying out this work.  I had hoped the project would be included under the current Structural Funds programme, INTERREG II or the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. It would be of major benefit to the tourism industry in counties Cavan and Fermanagh and would complement the restored Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, which has been an outstanding success.  It is a credit to the Government that made the decision to restore that waterway.</P>
    <P>Funding is coming on stream under various programmes for small projects.  At the end of these programmes we need to have in place projects <Col N="485" /> that will act as a catalyst for other developments and enterprises.  A few pounds spent here and there will contribute practically nothing to the necessary regeneration of the Border economy. Imaginative proposals need to be implemented.  We can all readily identify projects in each of our constituencies that the Government should support.  It should support projects that will act as a catalyst for other developments and enterprises.  Unless the funding available is spent in that manner we will have lost a golden opportunity to contribute to the much needed regeneration and rebuilding of the Border economy which has suffered so much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak to the motion.  The Labour and Socialist group members of the EU budget committee voted to cut by £78 million the moneys available under the peace and reconciliation programme for the Border counties to help the victims of the violence of the past 25 years.  No area has suffered more than the Border counties, Sligo and Leitrim in particular, because of the lack of industry and tourism facilities.  Although not geographically a Border county, Sligo was included in the programme by the former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, because of its proximity to the North.  The County Fermanagh border is just over 20 miles from Sligo town.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a report on the 1996 census presented by the county manager to Sligo County Council last Monday.  At 55,645, the population of County Sligo as a whole has increased.  The increase in the population of the borough of Sligo, that is, Sligo town, can be attributed to the decision of the former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, to decentralise the pensions section of the Department of Social Welfare to the town to which many multinational and other industries have also been attracted.</P>
      <P>The population of the areas I represent in south Sligo, particularly those adjacent to counties Roscommon and Leitrim, continues to fall. The rate of decline in some townlands is considered serious.  The decrease in population in the townland of Kilshalvey is 9.7 per cent; Kilmactranny, 7.5 per cent and Killaraght, 6.66 per cent. This is an issue which will have to be addressed not alone by Sligo County Council but also by this House and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office the Government has failed to attract industry to any part of County Sligo, including Sligo town.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce we had in County Sligo one of the greatest factories in the west, Gowna Wood Industry, GWI.  I worked for 11 years in that company which manufactured all types of joinery and at one stage employed over 300 workers.  It has since been succeeded by Munster Joinery.  Instead of giving it the £150,000 it needed to keep the factory open the then Minister decided the company was not viable.  This <Col N="486" /> resulted in its closure and over 150 workers being put on the dole.</P>
    <P>One of the last tasks the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, performed before leaving office was to sanction the establishment of the Masonite plant in County Leitrim.  This is now a show case plant which will employ 500 workers when it commences operations.  I estimate that a further 300 jobs will be created in downstream industries.  If Deputy Reynolds had been allowed to continue in office he might have succeeded in attracting a similar industry to south County Sligo and north County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Reynolds for the great work he has done in the pursuit of peace in Northern Ireland.  It is time the Government spoke to everyone, including Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>Why has the Government failed to attract industry to the Border counties?  Wonderful work could be done if the £78 million were made available.</P>
    <P>As an afterthought, the Taoiseach appointed a Minister of State with special responsibility for western development.  Although he has visited the Border counties to which his brief extends he is not doing enough.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Conveney, for making funds available for the drainage of rivers in Border counties.  Our county roads are in a desperate condition while our national primary and national secondary roads need to be improved to attract industry to the region.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Pat Cope Gallagher who is due to speak later for keeping us informed about what is happening in the European Parliament.  Some of the money could be used to fund the development of Sligo airport, an issue I raised in the House in the past week, and to improve the Dublin-Sligo railway line.</P>

      <P>Ever since the foundation of the State the counties immediately south of the Border have suffered severely.  The imposition of an artificial political border had the effect of stunting and stultifying normal economic growth and social development.  Many times over the past 50 years, particularly during the years when there was a sizeable differential between the purchasing value of the punt and sterling, businesses south of the Border were almost wiped out.  Mercifully, that is not the case nowadays.  The punt is much stronger than it was in the years of which I speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To compound the problems, the violence of the past 25 years played havoc with communities south of the Border as well as communities in the Six Counties of Ulster.  When peace was declared there were great grounds for optimism and people believed the damage done could quickly be undone.  Fuelling that optimism was the decision by the European Commission in 1994 to create a special task force to look at ways of giving special practical assistance to Northern Ireland and to the Border counties.  It seemed as if that task force would provide the blood transfusion <Col N="487" /> necessary to regenerate the economic and social life of the Border counties.</P>
    <P>Any attempt by the EU budgetary committee to cut £78 million from the fund for peace and reconciliation must be strongly resisted by all parties in this House. There is an onus on the Government to ensure that moneys promised are forthcoming because communities in these areas pin their hopes on receiving such money.  Without it, their future is bleak.  There is also an onus on the communities in the Border areas to develop the type of projects which will attract such money and will have long-term beneficial effects on the economic and social life of the region.  There is an onus on the Government to provide communities in these areas with all the information necessary so that they will know what programmes are available. They should be given advice on how to develop viable projects and basic information on how to make successful applications for funding.  There are too many quangos and bodies doing the same thing, but nobody is moving the agenda forward. That cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I am told the Welsh are much better at developing projects and programmes for INTERREG funding than we are.  They are more businesslike in developing their projects and cutting through red tape and bureaucracy.  The Border counties must get their act together in this regard and move quickly to ensure that funding is available and is well spent on essential infrastructural and other projects to enable them to attain their full economic and social potential. There is a huge difference between the condition of the roads in Northern Ireland and those in the Border counties, which needs to be addressed. Job creating projects must be set up and the economy must be revitalised so that the effect of the troubles of the past 25 years can be eliminated and normal growth can be restored.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally important for peace to become the norm in Northern Ireland.  It should not be the remit of any paramilitary group to give or to withhold peace.  Peace is the essential precondition for proper growth both north and south of the Border which will enable normal cross-Border trade to recommence.</P>
    <P>As regards the difference between our taxation system and that in Northern Ireland, it costs 50 per cent more for an employer in Dundalk to put an extra £1 in the pocket of an employee than it costs ten miles up the road in Newry.  That is a huge difference which must be remedied.  We live on a small island so anything which benefits one section of the island benefits us all.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised when I heard Deputy McGahon say that Deputies from other parts of the country are not interested in this issue.  That is not the case.  There is sympathy and understanding for the plight of Border counties, particularly in the past 25 years.  The creation of the Border had a stultifying effect on trade and economic <Col N="488" /> growth.  We now have an opportunity to put that right.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to assure the House that the £78 million will be forthcoming. Such assurance will enable the Border communities to develop their projects so that they will be eligible for funding.  I hope that will be the recipe to transform the economy of the Border regions.</P>

      <P>I want to respond to Deputy Mattie Brennan's point about Deputy Reynolds. Deputy Reynolds's contribution to the peace process does not need any praise because it is well acknowledged everywhere.  He spoke to Sinn Féin during a total cessation of violence by the IRA.  The Taoiseach would be only too pleased to do the same were the IRA to restore the ceasefire and make it permanent, as I and every other politician has appealed to it to do.  It is important to respond to the Deputy's point that the Taoiseach should speak to Sinn Féin as Deputy Reynolds did.</P>
      <P>Because it falls to me during the EU Presidency to chair the Budget Council of Ministers, I want to concentrate on the proposed reduction by the EU budget committee of Parliament of moneys earmarked in the draft budget to support the Northern Ireland peace programme in 1997. I want to make the position clear about the EU budget process and where responsibilities lie.</P>
      <P>The EU budget procedure is complex and long drawn out.  It is different from a budget process as we understand it.  The budgetary authority is shared between the Council of Ministers and Parliament under Article 203 of the Treaty.  This Article establishes the respective powers of Council, that is the Ministers, and Parliament and of the Commission in conducting the procedure.</P>
      <P>From a legal standpoint, there are two critical points in the budgetary procedure.  First is the adoption of the draft budget by the Council of Ministers &mdash; generally in July &mdash; which marks the formal opening of the budget procedure.  Second is the final adoption of the budget after Parliament's second reading which closes the procedure, generally in the month of December.  It is a process which goes on for approximately six months.  The Parliament has the final say over the amounts to be included for what is termed nonobligatory expenditure, which includes the special peace programme for Ireland.  I do not want any doubt to be cast over who is responsible for this &mdash; it is the responsibility of Parliament.  That does not mean this Government cannot do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July the Council of Ministers adopted the draft budget for 1997.  This included commitment appropriations of 159.9 million ECU in line with the Commission proposal for the Northern Ireland peace programme in 1997.  The draft budget for 1997 is currently with the European Parliament for what is known as its first reading. During that process, the Parliament's committee on budgets has proposed that the Northern <Col N="489" /> Ireland peace programme commitment be cut by 100 million ECU which people have referred to correctly here as approximately £78 million.  Parliament is due to vote on the draft budget at its plenary session next week.  I hope and have some reason to believe that they will either reject this proposal or it will be withdrawn by the budget committee before any vote is taken.  In the course of the budget deliberations I am scheduled to meet with both the Parliament's budget committee and the Parliament itself next Monday and Tuesday and will do everything in my power to convince them not to proceed with this proposed cut.  I shall also be on the telephone tomorrow to speak with the chairman of the budget committee on the same issue.  I assure the House the Government is pursuing this matter on several fronts at the highest level to ensure that resources for this programme are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The Government sees this programme as a political imperative which must be safeguarded at least for the following three reasons.  First, this EU initiative represents a most important signal in political terms.  This is particularly so at this time when the political process is at a critical and delicate stage.  Second, the commitment of the European Union to the programme has been a constant support and encouragement to those who believe in the Northern Ireland peace process and it would be tragic if this were to be undermined in any way.  Third, the relatively slow rate of expenditure in the early stages of the programme, which has been given as one of the main reasons for the budget committee's proposed cut, reflects the care taken to put in place appropriate local structures in the communities affected to ensure an optimum outturn for the programme. Expenditure is markedly increasing in recent months and I firmly believe that the full amount of the appropriation will be required in 1997.  I appeal for the full support of this House in the Government's efforts to retain in full the funding necessary for this peace programme.  That support should include utilising whatever influence the respective parties have with their political groupings in the EU Parliament.  I am happy to see a member of the European Parliament here who I am sure will tell us something about that process and how he sees it from the grouping he represents and works with.  If we all work together we can have the proposed cuts restored in full.  I accept the Government has a heavy responsibility and I assure the House that the Government at different levels, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and my own level to a lesser extent, will be doing everything in its power, in the days ahead in particular, to ensure that this process is reversed.  There are a number of stages in the process but I am anxious we nip this in the bud and be in a position to report back with better news about this issue as early as next week.</P>

      <P>The much talked of Task Force Document on Funding Arrangements for the Border Regions was eagerly awaited by those of us who consistently sought the setting up of a structure to co-ordinate the various funds.  We have many different funds &mdash; INTERREG, operational programmes, the peace and reconciliation fund and various other funds.  We have about ten administrative agencies and eight Government Departments, including the Taoiseach's.  This document is a compilation of funding figures and sources of grants and there is no thought about strategy or serious recommendations.  I would hazard that it cost much more to produce than a document I supplied to community groups, county councils and schools informing them of the different grants available, the projects that could be grant aided etc. which I suggest is a more informative document than this.  It is a great disappointment.</P>
      <P>The yardstick by which progress is measured in any constituency is the level of employment. Despite the various funds available, unemployment in County Monaghan in the 18 month period from November 1994 to April 1996 increased by 12 per cent.  That was before the collapse in the past few weeks of a large factory employing 100 people in the pig industry.  In meetings with Forbairt in November 1995, it was accepted that industrial infrastructure and factory space were required in the Border region.  I was informed that food industries could be secured if factory space was available.  A few months later, when the IDA compiled a programme for the Border region, it decided to locate factories and industrial parks in four counties but none in County Monaghan.  It was a huge blow to that area that it was not included on that list.  There is no funding available in the Border region for industrial infrastructure in the southern counties.  In Northern Ireland they allocated £2 million of their 80 per cent to factory ventures, but we could not do similarly on our side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the decision of the European Parliament to support an amendment to cut the £125 million for peace and reconciliation by £78 million.  It is a complete reversal of thinking at EU level and of the European Commission and the Council of Ministers who have always favoured the retention of that funding. The Minister said it was important to get it right. However, there have been delaying tactics.  The Government Departments delayed completely. The Minister of State was appointed as a result of a question of mine asking for the setting up of some structure to co-ordinate the various funding and agencies.  He was allocated this task.  This is the document this Minister has sent out.  That is the seriousness with which Border funding and development and cross-Border infrastructural development is handled.  Activities of community groups and local authorities are curtailed in most <Col N="491" /> locations by the lack of matching funding.  It must be 75, 50 or 25 per cent.  It is practically impossible for local authorities or community groups to obtain the 25 per cent, let alone the maximum, from the funding agencies.</P>
    <P>When speaking in Ballyconnell last year, Mr. Carlo Trojan indicated that no project would fail through lack of matching funds and that he would ensure a package of matching funding from other measures would be made available.  Unfortunately that has not happened and many projects have been halted for the lack of additional funding. This is one of the disappointments.</P>
    <P>There has also been a serious lack of effort by State agencies to develop cross-Border schemes. This was shown in recent months in a report from the EU audit committee, which was critical of the lack of truly cross-Border projects.  There were stand alone projects on each side of the Border but the idea behind INTERREG and the peace and reconciliation fund&mdash;which has 15 per cent funding for this purpose&mdash;is that the projects would be cross-Border projects which would be truly beneficial and involve communities from both sides.  The audit committee report stated that the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal scheme was a truly cross-Border project and that it would demand that projects receiving INTERREG II funding would be truly cross-Border.</P>

      <P>This is a particularly timely motion, as unemployment and depopulation of the Border counties continues despite national economic good fortune.  It comes at a time when the budget committee of the European Parliament has voted to slash £78 million from the funding to support the programme for peace and reconciliation and when the threadbare commitment of this Government to the Border counties has become apparent to all.  We did not have to wait two years to see this&mdash;it became apparent on the night the Government was announced and during the subsequent days, when no Deputy from any of the Border counties, from Louth to Donegal, was appointed as Minister.  That is no reflection on the fine Deputies in those counties, in particular Deputies McGinley and Harte from my own county.  We did not first realise it today, we knew it then but we gave the Government a chance.</P>
      <P>Unemployment in the Border counties ranges from 14 per cent in Leitrim to 24 per cent in parts of Donegal.  This is further compounded by the ongoing outflow of our talented young people. The peace process gave new hope and possibilities to the Border counties but so far this potential has not been realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended last year's Washington conference on encouraging investment in Ireland in the wake <Col N="492" /> of the peace process.  I presented Senator George Mitchell with a report outlining good reasons why American companies should invest in the Border region.  I pointed out that, at that time, less than 20 American companies out of a total of 400 operating in Ireland, were based in the region. The position has not improved one iota since then, due to Government inaction.</P>
    <P>One incident more than any other illustrates this Government's indifference to the Border counties.  At the Washington conference there was a great sense of hope that real economic regeneration of the region lay ahead.  However, in his address to the prestigious gathering the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, made but one fleeting reference to the Border counties.  That was the sum total of his interest and nothing has changed since then. There is no commitment from that Minister or this Government.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by all sides to serious matters which have arisen in Brussels.  These have direct implications for Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The powerful budget committee of the European Parliament voted by 18 to five, with nine abstentions, to slash the peace and reconciliation fund by 100 million ECUs or £78 million.  This cut was proposed by the Labour Party's colleagues in Europe, the Socialist Group, and was stoutly defended by Labour's sole MEP. It was made in the full knowledge that the EU currently does not have the resources to compensate for the loss of this money.  Members of this House and MEPs can speak of financial perspectives but I refer them to the Florence and Dublin Summits, where no decision was taken on funding. All these actions illustrate to the people of the Border counties how unwilling the Labour Party is to defend their interest.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael member of this committee, even though he shares the constituency of Connacht-Ulster with me, did not oppose the cut and merely abstained.  The same MEP accused me of being mischievous in the position I took.  Does anyone expect me, as an MEP for the Border counties of Connacht-Ulster, to stand idly by while the Socialist Group and other MEPs are prepared to slash this fund, which was provided after a commitment given by Mr. Jacques Delors that Europe would respond in a positive and practical fashion?  The European Parliament unanimously agreed to this fund but now certain groups are prepared to slash it&mdash;so much for their interest and practical and positive commitment to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Bell, anyone who listened to the factual explanation given by the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, will notice the wide gulf between their two positions.  Deputy Bell accused me of political mischief but it is his colleague in the European Parliament who is being mischievous.  I ask him to elaborate on his charge that local authorities are not drawing down enough funding and are too slow.  We all know the reasons for that&mdash;it is a new fund, there <Col N="493" /> is no precedent for it and new structures must be established to disperse these funds, therefore it took some time after the green light was given in July last year.  The Minister of State and Commissioner Wulf-Mathies have suggested there will be sufficient applications to draw down all the money.</P>
    <P>This has been a remarkable display by all the Government parties at a time when Ireland holds the EU Presidency.  They either actively oppose funding like Labour or sat on the fence as Fine Gael did.  Were it not for the vigilance of Fianna Fáil MEPs and our group, the Union for Europe, this might never have come to public attention.  I have been accused by many of highlighting the matter.  If I am to be elected to this House or the European Parliament, so long as there is breath in my body I will defend the public interest and I am not prepared to ignore matters such as this.  I give a strong commitment that our group in the European Parliament will remain vigilant and will defend the interests of the people of the Border counties at all times.  The Tánaiste has strong ties with the Socialist Group and has lavishly entertained its leaders in recent times.  I urge him to remonstrate with his colleagues and urge them to reverse their decision in next Thursday's vote in the Parliament.</P>
    <P>I note with some irony yesterday's plea by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, that the Parliament reverse its decision.  The Government should have ensured that matters never reached this critical stage in the first place.  With my colleagues in Fianna Fáil and the Union for Europe, I will do everything in my power to ensure the cut is reversed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> The Commissioner for Regional Affairs, Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, has rightly criticised this cut and described those who supported it as lacking solidarity with the victims of violence in Ireland.  I hope to have an opportunity to discuss this and other issues with the Commissioner when she visits the north-west tomorrow.  I give her credit for her commitment to the Border region.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan must be restructured in order to ensure that the Border counties and the west of Ireland receive a fair and equitable share of funding.  I wish the Minister of State well in his deliberations with the chairman of the budget committee, who stated at the European budgetary meeting that Ireland did not fight hardest on this issue.  That is the charge I am placing before the Government.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, will take the opportunity to raise this matter with him and ensure that this is reversed.  Over the next couple of days I will use all my contacts with other Members who are also Members of the European Parliament, including Deputy Hyland, with a view to ensuring that we achieve that.</P>
      <P>I know there have been telephone calls today between the Taoiseach and the Christian Democrats and between the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Socialists, and I hope there will be contacts tomorrow between the Minister of State and Mr. Samlend.  I wish the Minister of State well in his deliberations, but let nobody accuse me of being mischievous because I represent the people who elected me.  I call on Deputies from the Border regions, for all of whom I have so much respect, to vote with us on this motion.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the recent announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that he has agreed to a ban on the sale of beef from Counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan.  What is the scientific basis for the Minister's decision, the greatest blunder since Mr. Douglas Hogg's infamous statement to the House of Commons?</P>
      <P>This country has promoted Irish beef as a single standard quality product, capable of export to every destination and continent worldwide. However, following the Minister's decision, meat from Counties Cork, Tipperary and Monaghan is to be avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This will have dreadful consequences for the economy, beef and specifically the unfortunate farmers in those three counties. What will An Bord Bia and the Irish marketers do now in seeking to sell and promote Irish beef? Can it be said that it is safe to eat?  Can it be said that some of it is safe to consume?  Can it be said that one will be fine if one avoids beef from particular parts of the country?</P>
      <P>What did the Minister have in mind when he took this decision?  As President of the Council of Agricultural Ministers, the Minister could have telephoned the Taoiseach, who is the current President of the Council, about this calamitous matter which will have ruinous consequences in the economy and asked him to contact the authorities in Moscow or to travel there.  Surely there is more to the European Presidency than banquets, photocalls and opportunities to embellish halos?</P>

When Sainsbury and Tesco say they want a similar agreement for their consumers, to which they <Col N="497" /> would in effect be entitled, will the Minister tell them that we have given it to the Russians, but that we cannot give it to them?  Why does the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry leak the figures for BSE throughout the country? A map of Ireland was printed in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> with the number of BSE outbreaks listed for every county.  That is grossly irresponsible and could only have come from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  We have spent years promoting the image of Irish beef and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is trying to ruin it.</P>

      <P>Mr. Willie Dillon in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> put it very well.  He said that no matter how he tries to put a gloss on it, the Minister's decision will have disastrous implications for beef producers in Ireland.  It is a bit late in the day to do so, but I call on the Minister to seek to reverse this particularly bad decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I reiterate what Deputy Walsh said about the selective system where Monaghan, Tipperary and Cork are selected for a ban.  While barley, wheat, sugarbeet and so on are grown in other counties, three quarters of farmers in County Monaghan are solely dependent on cattle production and they are being victimised. On what scientific basis did the Minister agree to a ban on beef which included County Monaghan but excluded his own constituency although there is a higher incidence of BSE in Wexford than in Monaghan?  Wexford is a grain growing county, where farmers have alternatives. This is an utter disgrace and it deserves an explanation on the basis of fair play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very anxious to arrange a comprehensive debate on this matter at the earliest possible date in Government time. <Col N="498" /> Arrangements have been agreed between the Whips to make time for a detailed discussion on this at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow, 17 October, so Deputies will have an adequate opportunity to air their views.</P>
      <P>I was faced with a situation where Dr. Avilov, the chief veterinary officer in Russia, who had been given full powers to make a determination on whether there would be a ban on Irish beef, had personally recommended on two occasions in the last two months the imposition of such a ban. Through political pressure we got that reversed. He was here from 7 to 12 October and visited our ports, our laboratories, our rendering plants, all the different facets of the beef industry.  He presented us with a draft Protocol last Friday evening, 11 October.</P>
      <P>I indicated to him, as I had indicated to the Iranians, that I was not prepared to sign the agreement on the basis of regionalisation.  He made it absolutely clear that he had no difficulty with that but that the consequence would be a direct ban on all Irish beef in Russia effective from 1 November.  I inquired from my officials as to the consequences of that ban and whether they were convinced that this would happen.  They advised me that with 100,000 tonnes of beef or 300,000 animals having no market, safety net intervention would be a likelihood.</P>
      <P>People have complained to me that 82p per lb is not a viable price.  From 1 November I was faced with the prospect that not only farmers in Tipperary, Cork and Monaghan, but every beef farmer in the country, would be faced with a £50 per head drop in prices, a drop of 5p in the prevailing rate down to 78p per lb.  I want to avoid that situation.  In hindsight &mdash; this can only be judged in hindsight &mdash; this is a temporary hiccup, because I have a review clause in this agreement. I am going to Russia in a couple of weeks to negotiate on the basis of 23 counties in and three counties out as opposed to 26 out and none in, which would be much more difficult.  The figures will determine which counties are in or out.</P>
      <P>In the detailed stages of the negotiation the Russians wanted a ban on seven counties.  The additional counties were Limerick, Donegal, Longford and Wexford.  If the Russians had decided to ban Wexford at the end of the negotiations, I would have taken the same decision, because it was in the national interest, and I would say that in my own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Russia accounts for 26 per cent of our exports. Some 74 per cent of our exports are accounted for within Europe, and go to France, Britain, Germany, Holland, Italy and Spain.  We are also selling to Egypt and Algeria.  The ban on Saudi Arabia was lifted on Tuesday of this week.  Like any branding scheme, the beef from those three counties can go to intervention.  It can go to everywhere except Russia and there are no restrictions.  Regionalisation was sought because, <Col N="499" /> four years ago, the French made a regional agreement Protocol with Iran which was renewed recently.  They told us we have the second highest level of BSE in the Union, we have a higher rate of BSE than France, and asked us why they should accept a less stringent deal from Ireland than they accepted from France, which volunteered this agreement.</P>
    <P>What concerns me most is not the Russians or the safety of beef in these counties, but the hysterical overreaction, the momentum of which will be to advertise to the world that there is a serious question mark over this beef where there is no scientific basis for it.  I hope the opportunism of the Opposition will not get in the way of the best interests of beef farmers from those counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>A very serious situation will develop in regard to this issue next week because school children will be going on strike.  That is something which nobody wants to see.  The problem in the Louisburg area, and particularly in the Killeen area, is that this area has been served by five school busses.  An existing operator retired and Bus Éireann amalgamated four of the buses. Some of these children used to be collected at 8.30 a.m.  They are now collected at 6.55 a.m. and brought home between 5 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>I know the people in Dublin do not understand this.  This problem will not make national headlines because it is happening in the west.  People in Dublin do not care about what is happening in the west.  Officials in Ballina in certain cases banged down the telephone on public representatives and on parents.  Those officials are paid by the State, they are public servants and should not treat public representatives or members of the general public in that way.  I have complained to the Minister of State but he has informed me the matter is outside his brief.</P>
      <P>The people in this area are not looking for a new service or for additional money.  They want the five buses they had last year and the original bus timetable reinstated. They do not want their children getting up at 7.15 a.m. and carrying their school bags approximately two and a half miles to a bus stop. That is cruelty to children and it should not be tolerated.  Many Members of this House speak about the rights of children and I know the Minister of State will say tonight that we only have to provide a reasonable service but the service being provided is not reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of inaccuracies in the written reply from the Minister to my question on <Col N="500" /> this matter.  It stated that the numbers had decreased but in fact they have increased.  It stated that Davitt house was almost half a mile away.  That is not correct as the distance is only a quarter of a mile.  The reply also states that the school bus service in question has not been removed but has been changed, and that a school bus contractor in the Louisburg area has resigned and has not been replaced.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will have good news for us tonight.  All we want is the bus service we had last year.  We are not asking for anything new.  These children should be allowed go to and from school at a reasonable time.  Winter is coming and while Louisburg is beautiful in the summer it is isolated and wild during the winter months.  We are merely asking that these children be given an opportunity to be educated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support my colleague, Deputy Ring.  We are seeking restoration of the service we had last year to service the same number of students who currently attend the school. Will the Minister of State indicate in his reply the difference in the position that obtained last year? Five buses were available last year but this year, as a result of changes made and sanctioned by the Department, only four buses are serving the same number of school children.  Some of these children are now spending one and three quarter hours longer travelling to and from school.  They are spending a greater amount of time away from home than the average number of hours worked by an industrial worker.  That is not a satisfactory education system, particularly in this area which faces the Atlantic.  These children arrive at the home stop one and three quarter hours later than they did last year and they are then required to walk along barren windswept boreens to get to their homes.</P>
      <P>In interpreting the Department regulations as narrowly as possible, the Minister of State seems to be keeping within the letter of the law but not within the spirit of the school transport system as originally set up.  Will he examine this particular case and not accept the stance taken by the bus officials in Ballina.  A school strike is due to begin next week.  I point out to the Minister of State that the chairman of this committee has been successful in leading his community on two previous occasions in campaigns which appeared irreversible. He will win this campaign also even if it means children are kept out of school or whatever other action is deemed necessary.  I appeal to the Minister to reverse this decision forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this matter because it gives me an opportunity to outline the position on school transport arrangements to Louisburg Post-Primary Centre in County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> The position in the case to which the Deputies refer is that the school bus service in question has been changed, not removed.  A school transport contractor in the Louisburg area has resigned and, due to a reduction in numbers requiring transport from west of Louisburg, has not been replaced.  The remaining four school buses for this area have been reorganised resulting in a larger capacity vehicle being allocated to one of the routes with a change in its operating time.</P>
    <P>The pupils in question are picked up at 7.55 a.m. and set down at 4.50 p.m.  The bus contractor involved lives in the locality and consequently the pupils are picked up more than a mile nearer to their homes, but at an earlier time, and are set down later than in previous years.</P>
    <P>When establishing school transport services, routes are planned to ensure, as far as possible, that travelling and waiting times do not exceed three hours for post-primary pupils.  The level of service available to these pupils will continue to be reasonable and adequate in the general context of the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>As far as school transport is concerned, my Department has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 162,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools throughout the country.  We also have responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money expended on the provision of this service. It does not come cheaply; in 1995, the net cost to the State was approximately £37.3 million.</P>
    <P>One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.  For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre.</P>
    <P>Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside are eligible for transport under the school transport scheme to that centre.  I am satisfied the school transport arrangements currently in operation for Louisburg Post-Primary Centre are operating well within the general context of the school transport scheme.  Fully eligible pupils enjoy a reasonable and adequate level of service to this centre.  Accordingly, as the level of service is well within the general operation of the school transport scheme, it is not my intention to alter the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been demand for a review of the school transport system, taking into consideration the changes that have occurred in student numbers.  That review is currently taking place and should be completed shortly.  If Deputy Ring puts in writing the allegations he made tonight about the way public representatives are being treated in the Ballina area, my Department <Col N="502" /> will have them investigated as I take those allegations very seriously.  Public representatives should get the responses and the respect they deserve.</P>

      <P>To date, the Minister for Education and her Department have not sanctioned the appointment of any non-permanent staff in Carlow regional technical college.  Contracts have not been signed between the college and any of the non-permanent staff.  That is not acceptable.  We are now almost five weeks into the 1996-7 academic year, yet up to 40 non-permanent teaching staff in Carlow regional technical college do not know when and if they will be paid for the work they do.  Some of the academic staff in the college have contracts going back ten years, and those contracts are renewed on an annual basis. The staff and their families are devastated by the conduct of the Minister and her officials in not ensuring this matter was resolved prior to the beginning of the academic year.  It is a poor practice for any Department, but particularly the Department of Education, to allow this serious situation to continue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried to hide behind the Regional Technical Colleges Act of 1992.  It is just not fair to say it is a function of the regional technical college management and that they alone are the cause of this problem.  All information requested by the Minister and the officials in her Department has been submitted and any delay in the implementation of these agreements is now the sole responsibility of the Department of Education. The ball is firmly in the Minister's court and she should act immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is outrage among the staff in the college at the conduct of the Department in this matter, and a number of questions need to be answered. Are the non-permanent teaching staff in Carlow regional technical college being used as hostages in a conflict between the Department of Education and the Carlow regional technical college management?  Why did the Minister's Department not intervene before now to resolve this problem when the officials in the Department were made aware of it?  Is the Minister prepared <Col N="503" /> to give a commitment to this House to have the matter resolved immediately?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to use all her influence to ensure this matter is resolved and that the hardship, worry and stress which has been caused to a small group of teaching staff in the Carlow area is resolved.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I thank my colleague, Deputy Nolan, for giving me some of his very short time.  Like him I am concerned about the present situation in the regional college in Carlow.  There is a strike on the administrative side, which does not make communication easy. It is indefensible that at the start of the academic year teachers who have served the college well over many years do not know whether they will be paid or if they will have temporary full-time jobs.  It is absurd.  We want to see the regional college in Carlow at the top of the tree, and this kind of carry on does nothing for the college.  It is grossly unfair to the students, teachers and lecturers. I hope the Minister of State has good news for us and, if not, that he will at least bang some heads together and get a result that is good for the Carlow college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter and for the opportunity it affords me to clarify the position.  The Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, states:</P>
      <P>A college may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers (in addition to the Director) and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, the Governing Body from time to time thinks proper.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the function of the Minister for Education in relation to staffing of the colleges is to sanction a quota of posts for each institution. The arrangements for filling vacant posts within the overall quota of sanctioned posts and sanctioned levels are matters for the college management. There is, therefore, no involvement by my Department in the matter of filling posts in the college which have been sanctioned in accordance with the requirements of the regional technical college Act.  In a letter to the Director of Carlow regional technical college on 13 August, his attention was drawn to the fact that sanction for the creation of posts is a matter exclusively for the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  It was also pointed out that the college would need to continue to seek departmental sanction for the creation of new and additional posts, permanent or temporary, or any upgrading to posts already sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in Carlow regional technical college is that my Department sanctioned a quota of posts for the college which has been increased over the years to take account of increased <Col N="504" /> student numbers and various other relevant circumstances. The Deputies will be aware there are constraints on numbers employed in the public service generally.  It is incumbent on college management to be aware of these constraints and to have regard to them when making demands on my Department for increased staffing numbers.</P>
    <P>Demands from all institutions, at all levels of education, invariably exceed the resources available to my Department.  Consequently, the allocation of resources is based on the priorities which are identified in consultation with the colleges. Following this it is the responsibility of local management to manage their institution within the quotas allocated by the Department.</P>
    <P>For the academic year 1995-96, my Department sanctioned a total of ten additional permanent staff for Carlow regional technical college at Lecturer 1 level.  This additional allocation was granted to take account of additional student numbers and to help the college to reduce its dependency on part-time staff.  A case had been made by the college management to the Department about the difficulties it had encountered in finding suitable part-time lecturers and this difficulty was taken account of.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that there were severe restrictions on additional staff numbers being recruited in the public service at this juncture. Consequently, the Department in its dealings with Carlow regional technical college was generous in its allocation of ten extra posts.  Subsequently it transpired that there was a need to sanction an additional three posts at Lecturer 1 level in Carlow regional technical college to regularise appointments made.</P>
    <P>Consequently, a total of 13 additional post at lecturer level has been added to the quota of sanctioned academic posts for Carlow regional technical college since September 1995.  In discussions with the management of Carlow regional technical college regarding its quota of sanctioned posts in the context of ongoing monitoring of staffing in the sector generally, the college has sought sanction for an additional number of temporary academic posts i.e. 29 Lecturer 1 posts and five EPT posts.  To evaluate this claim for such a large number of extra posts, the college was asked to submit a detailed analysis of its needs.  It has been clearly indicated to the college in a number of letters and discussions on the matter that the application for extra staff must be supported by a comprehensive report to justify the demand.</P>
    <P>To date, however, the information provided by the current management has been insufficient to enable the Department to assess the demand for extra staffing requirements and to determine how the demand ranks in terms of competing priorities. In the absence of the detailed information needed, it has not been possible for the Department to evaluate the college's overall staffing requirements or to decide how their requirements <Col N="505" /> can be addressed.  I am very anxious to have this matter fully clarified as I am aware that some staff have complained about problems arising in relation to their salaries and difficulties in renewing contracts.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, have in my Department any background information as to why this situation exists as the quota of posts has been allocated and the budget has been issued to take account of both permanent and part-time staff payments.  If there are problems arising because contracts have not been renewed in respect of posts which were not previously sanctioned by the Department this would be a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the onus is on the college management to provide my Department with full particulars of any difficulties which need to be addressed and to submit the detailed information needed to justify its request for additional staff.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that on receipt of the information requested by my Department the problem will be given full consideration as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and the Minister for attending.  An article appeared in the papers about ten days ago clearly showing that Dublin Bus is the least subsidised transport system among European States.  They cover 96 per cent of operating costs from fares whereas in Brussels 33 per cent of costs come from fares, in Amsterdam, 25 per cent and in Rome 10 per cent.  Even London, the home of right-wing Thatcherism and deregulation, the percentage is only 79 per cent.</P>
      <P>In every aspect of life we are told to look at what is happening elsewhere in Europe. However, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is telling Dublin Bus in particular that from next year they will have to cover 100 per cent of operating costs from fares.</P>
      <P>We recognise that urban transport systems throughout the world have to be subsidised.  The attitude of CIE with its latest viability plan is at the root of the problem.  The plan proposes 800 redundancies and major changes to take home pay and working conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE companies are like all other businesses and must invest in new rolling stock.  It is crazy to expect this type of investment to be funded from current cash flow on the backs of people being forced out on early retirement.  The Minister tells me we have to look at the CIE argument.  The latest CIE figures for last year have been presented in a manner which shows the 1995 outturn in the worst possible light.  There have been changes in the way in which depreciation is calculated and in the allocation for public liability claims.  The figures have been presented to show a certain line of thought.  I do not suggest CIE should ignore expenditure.  Expenditure has to be controlled and reviewed and any restrictive practices <Col N="506" /> approved by management over the years have to be changed.</P>
    <P>In the light of the overall position I am horrified at the way some of CIE management, particularly newer management is operating in trying to push everything through without any discussion or consultation.  There is an agreement between the Government, the unions and the social partners negotiated by the last Government. The Taoiseach has expressed his interest in another similar agreement.  How can the Minister ask CIE management to bulldoze its way through that fundamental agreement?  I do not know what happened today in the court but will the Minister, in the context of what has been threatened within the next few days, call on the management to deal with this matter in an organised way by consultation? I realise the Minister has to curb the subvention to CIE and the opportunities for fare increases are limited but bulldozing something through without negotiation must not occur.  It appears management has soured its relationship with the unions.  Will the Minister take an initiative and call all parties together, give them a deadline and ask them to sort out the matter?</P>
    <P>I understand the company is withdrawing from the rail link side in December.  It has notified all its customers and put them in touch with another company, yet there has not been one meeting with the unions on the matter.  It is a major problem. They might like to put the boot in and get tough but they must sit down and negotiate rather than try to ram something through.  The Department has many demands on its subvention but I ask the Minister to call on those who are acting tough to sit down and sort out CIE's problems.  If change has to come let it be done by agreement as it is in other walks of life and in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1996 Exchequer subvention for CIE is £99.76 million.  There are no proposals to reduce this.  The allocation of the subvention between the three subsidiary companies is a matter for the CIE board and is made in accordance with the relevant European Union regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State financial support for the provision of socially necessary non-commercial public transport services has been very substantial over the years.  In the past ten years more than £1 billion has been paid by way of Exchequer subvention to CIE.  This high level of financial support <Col N="507" /> reflects the continuing commitment of Governments to the best possible provision of public transport services throughout the country consistent with what the taxpayer can afford.</P>
    <P>The ability of CIE to offer a satisfactory service to its customers is not solely determined by the availability of Exchequer subvention.  Management and staff have made very real efforts in recent years to develop the range and quality of services available to the public and to improve the efficiency with which those services are delivered. I welcome these efforts which reflect a realistic awareness of the increasingly competitive environment in which CIE must operate.  These efforts have to continue across the company with a particular emphasis on improving equality, reliability and value for money for its services.</P>
    <P>In determining the level of subvention to be paid to CIE each year the Government has to find the right balance between a range of competing demands across all sectors of the economy. CIE cannot operate on the basis that the taxpayer has a bottomless purse.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the Government should not increase subvention to subsidise inefficient practices or as a way of postponing decisions which the company must take to ensure its commercial viability and to protect its competitive position.</P>
    <P>Since the 1980s successive Governments have pursued a policy of containing CIE's requirement for State financial support.  This has been accompanied by a substantial development of services and by a major improvement in productivity throughout the CIE group.  More and better services for less subvention is surely something of which we should be proud rather than apologetic.</P>
    <P>I have already announced a further and very significant development in subvention policy.  I intend to replace the current lump sum subvention payment to CIE with a series of public transport contracts.  The contracts will cover those bus and rail services currently being supported by the Exchequer as well as rail infrastructure.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the new arrangements will be to provide for a greater degree of transparency in the State's financial relationship with CIE.  The contracts will set out clearly what services CIE will provide and what the State, in turn, will pay to support socially necessary non-commercial services.  They will also specify the quantity and quality of services to be provided and will allow for independent performance measurement, the results of which will be published.</P>
    <P>Users of public transport will be able to see, for the first time, what service standards have been set for CIE and how it performs against those standards.  CIE management and staff will know what is expected of them.  Taxpayers will be able to see exactly how their taxes are being used to support socially necessary transport services.</P>
    <P>Public service contracts combined with the <Col N="508" /> Government's customer service initiative will be used to ensure that the quality of public transport services is improved.  Performance standards will be set for the equality and reliability of CIE services and the company's performance will be independently assessed and published.</P>
    <P>While I am heartened by the sense of purpose and realism evident within the company in recent months and by the efforts to make CIE more effective and efficient, there is no doubt that the group's cost base remains too high.  More work must be done to improve its financial position if the company is to remain viable and competitive. Cost reductions will have to be achieved throughout the company at all levels and in every area of activity.</P>
    <P>The company is now facing increasing competition from the private sector.  Gradual liberalisation of the public transport market driven by European Union legislation is also inevitable. The Exchequer is simply not in a position to deal with the problem of excessive costs and inefficiency by providing increased subvention.  Even if the Exchequer could provide extra funding this would only postpone the necessary remedial action and make the ultimate resolution of the problem even more difficult.  Large fare increases would be counterproductive and drive many of CIE's customers to other modes of transport and to lower cost private sector competitors.  An organisation which contributes to its own decline is not my vision for CIE.</P>
    <P>A concerted effort must be directed towards ensuring that CIE is geared to provide effective and high quality public transport services, giving full value for money to both the taxpayer and the public transport user.</P>

      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has assured me that business in his office is transacted expeditiously.  This has been borne out in the Grant Thornton Consulting report and in a preliminary draft of the Department of Finance report on the structure and management of the office.</P>
      <P>However, the situation is that very often an immediate decision on whether a particular case can be prosecuted or not cannot be given by the Director's office.  The circumstances of a particular case may, and usually do, require detailed consideration by at least one legal assistant, and perhaps then by the Director.  Also the Garda file that has been referred to the office for directions may not contain sufficient material for that purpose with the result that a request may have to issue to the Garda as further Garda investigation or information will be required before a decision can properly be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director and his staff are conscious of the need to issue directions immediately after a thorough analysis of all the relevant information in the case.  There are internal checks carried out each month on the status of files that have been <Col N="320" /> received in the office but have not been the subject of directions.</P>
    <P>Recently a study was conducted in the office of a random sample of 354 files which had been received in 1996.  It showed that &mdash; on average &mdash; a direction issued 15 days after receipt of the file in cases where further investigation or information was not required from the Garda investigators. An additional legal assistant was recruited to the office approximately five months ago and another will commence duty before the end of next month.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Department of Finance study of December 1995 of information technology needs in the office, development work on the computerisation of case management and information systems within the office is continuing with the assistance of computer experts from that Department.  The sum of £60,000 has been set aside this year to finance the extension of computer facilities within the office and their acquisition will commence in a few weeks.  This will lead to phased implementation of IT systems commencing in spring 1997.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 1 and 2 yesterday, the Attorney General is chairing a group representative of his office, including the parliamentary draftsman's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Departments of Finance, Justice and the Taoiseach as well as an independent legal consultant to provide a strategic overview of the law offices of the State.  The terms of reference of the group require it to identify the strategic policy issues which require detailed examination and consideration arising from the various reports on the State legal offices. The group held its first meeting on Thursday last, 10 October 1996, and it is expected to make recommendations to Government as soon as possible on action to ensure that the legal services provided to the State are structured and managed so as to provide a quality service.</P>

The number of contract draftsmen has increased from three to six in the same period. <Col N="321" /> The law librarian and personal secretary are also on contract.</P>

Two further appointments are expected to be made later this year.  These and other initiatives within the office will mean that the demand for contract draftsmen, in the medium to long term, should diminish. In the meantime, the ever-increasing demands placed upon the office and the lengthy training period required to bring new staff to an effective skills level means that in the short to medium term the use of external expertise will continue.  The training and development of recently recruited staff in the office is another area where contract draftsmen have and continue to be involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is of the view that social partnership and national programmes have served this country very well.  Significant benefits have <Col N="322" /> accrued to all members of society under social partnership.  The strategy underpinned by the social consensus has secured record increases in the numbers at work, significant increases in take-home pay at all income levels, a secure basis for low inflation and low mortgage interest rates, and it has served to deepen our competitiveness, not least in securing record levels of overseas investment. For all of these reasons, the Government attaches great importance to the achievement of a further national agreement.</P>
    <P>However, it will not be easy to reach agreement on a programme which will equip us to meet the challenges of the future.  In particular, a new programme will cover the transition to a single currency which will require us to maximise our competitiveness, especially through greater flexibility in all aspects of our economic performance. The best basis for achieving this, while maintaining the stability of a coherent national programme, is to ensure that the nature and scale of the challenges we face, as analysed in the recent NESC report, are widely understood and agreed.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that, as I outlined last week, I envisage that the agenda and indeed the framework for the next programme, will be set by the conclusions of the NESC strategy report and the NESF opinion on a new national programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other inputs that will be made to negotiations some 18 groups have been invited to participate in discussions on 23 October by outlining the priorities that they would wish to see addressed in a new national programme in the light of the NESC analysis.  These groups will then be asked to elaborate on these views, bilaterally and multilaterally, as appropriate, in relation to the particular areas of interest of each group.  Negotiations on pay and related matters, as I made clear last week, will continue to be dealt with by the organisations with an established role in industrial relations matters.</P>
    <P>The Central Review Committee intends to publish in the near future a progress report outlining all that has been achieved under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I anticipate that it will show that the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> have overwhelmingly been implemented.  Where it is considered that there is further progress to be made, these items can be considered in the course of discussions on a new programme.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the establishment of area based employment pacts throughout the EU and in the implementation of the other Jacques Santer proposals for a European employment pact.</Quest>

      <P>In relation to progress in establishing territorial employment pacts in Ireland &mdash; as indicated in my response to earlier questions <Col N="323" /> from Deputy Ahern, Nos. 1 and 2 of 3 July 1996, the area-based partnership companies are based on a local development pact between employers, trade unions, state agencies and local communities. It is intended that these partnership areas will be selected as the pilot regions for Ireland. As there are 11 partnership companies in the Dublin area, I envisage that it would be useful to have an overall employment pact for Dublin which reflects the work of all of the partnership companies.</P>
      <P>A major conference on local development will be held here on 11-12 November.  The broad aim of the conference is to share the Irish model and experience of local development with policy-makers in the other member states and also to consider the Commission's proposals for local and territorial employment pacts.  The conference will be attended by Ministers, officials and representatives of non-governmental organisations in all member states.</P>
      <P>President Santer will be addressing the conference and members of the Commission staff will elaborate on their proposals for employ-initiatives including territorial and local employment pacts.  The discussions and workshops which will be held during the conference will enable information and ideas on local employment initiatives to be shared, so that progress can be made in furthering the Commission's proposals.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other elements of the Santer pact, given the need for the agreement of all 15 member states, and in some cases the desirability of social partner involvement too, progress has not been uniform across all elements of the pact.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Flynn has established a high level group with a view to finding a solution to the blockage of the European company statute. However, it is unlikely that the Commissioner will have proposals on this before the end of the year.  The same is true of Commission proposals for a biotechnology directive.  The Presidency will do its utmost to bring the dossier on small and medium-sized enterprises to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Essen process the Presidency has put in place a small steering group to oversee preparation of drafts of the single report on employment.  The steering group is made up of the chairman of the <i>ad hoc</i> group of personal representatives of Ministers of Social Affairs, the chairman of the Economic Policy Committee, the Commission, DG II and DG V, the General Secretariat of the Council and the next two presidencies &mdash; Netherlands and Luxembourg.  Following consultations, the final draft will be submitted for adoption by the Social Affairs and ECOFIN Councils on 2 December for transmission to the Dublin European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social partners involvement at European level is welcome and vital in reaching agreement on certain issues.  We are optimistic that the social partners will reach agreement before the Dublin European Council on a framework for the integration of young people into employment and <Col N="324" /> training.  The social partners have agreed to negotiate on other issues such as the social protection of a typical workers.  I expect to meet with the Social Dialogue Committee in November to reinforce the contribution of the social partners.</P>
    <P>Arising from their work, I intend to seek the agreement of the European Council in December to a declaration on employment which will chart the future direction of employment strategy, building on the initiative of President Santer in his employment pact proposals.</P>

      <P>The CSO is making the necessary preparations to begin the new quarterly survey in June 1997, following the completion of the April 1997 labour force survey, which will be the last of the traditional annual surveys.</P>
      <P>The new survey will provide more frequent and more timely estimates of employment and unemployment. This is an important development, particularly following the publication of the CSO's study of differences between the labour force survey and the live register, which confirmed that the most consistent measures of unemployment are those based on the labour force survey.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The preliminary results of the 1995 labour force survey, published by the CSO in October 1995, generated considerable public debate on the growing divergence between the LFS estimates of unemployment and the live register.  The Government established an interdepartmental strategy group on employment and unemployment and asked it, <i>inter alia</i>, to examine the reasons for this growing divergence, including such further analysis as might be necessary.  The group invited the CSO to provide input to its discussions on how the divergence could be most effectively analysed.  The group supported a CSO proposal to survey a sample of persons on the live register as part of the April 1996 labour force survey as a statistical quality check of the unemployment indicators.  The Department of Social Welfare co-operated fully with the study by providing a computer file covering the bulk of the live register from which a 1 per cent sample was selected by the CSO.</P>
      <P>The additional costs of the study were met out of the office's existing budget allocation for 1996. The principal costs incurred in the completion of the study amounted to about £30,000 in field costs for data collection and about £20,000 for staff input within the CSO.  The CSO published the results of the study on Wednesday, 18 September.</P>
      <P>The study examined, more directly than before, the reasons for the growing divergence between the two measures.  It was purely a statistical exercise. The names/addresses of those selected and their LFS responses are known only to the CSO; they are protected from disclosure under the 1993 Statistics Act which guarantees anonymity and confidentiality.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,672 persons was selected from the live register for inclusion in the study.  LFS details were collected in respect of all persons usually resident in 2,414 of these selected households.</P>
      <P>When the names recorded in the LFS were compared by the CSO with the sample of registrants, it was found that, in 679 of the 2,414 addresses surveyed, the person on the live register was not listed as a usual resident at that address.  These 679 addresses were excluded from subsequent analyses and no specific conclusions about them can be drawn from the study.</P>
      <P>The main findings of the study concern the labour force status of the remaining sample of claimants for whom LFS information was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Using the principal economic status classification in which people describe their own situation the study found that: almost 44 per cent of <Col N="326" /> the sample of persons on the live register did not describe their status as unemployed in the LFS; just under 4 per cent described themselves as retired and a similar percentage as students.</P>
    <P>Using the ILO economic activity classification, which takes account of job-searching and availability for work, the study found that: just under 50 per cent of the sample were classified as unemployed; 11 per cent had full-time jobs; 10 per cent were working part-time; almost 5 per cent were marginally attached to the labour force.  This category includes discouraged workers and those passively rather than actively seeking work; almost 25 per cent were classified as &ldquo;Others not economically active&rdquo;, with most of these indicating that they were neither looking for nor wanted work.  Persons engaged in part-time work of a casual nature and who are available for and actively seeking work may claim UA/UB.  Such claimants are included in the live register while, in the LFS they are likely to report their status as &ldquo;at work&rdquo; under the principal economic status definition. Under the ILO definition, such claimants would be regarded as in employment.</P>
    <P>Under the ILO approach to labour force analysis, a person is classified as in employment if he/she worked for one hour or more for payment or profit in the week before the survey.  The published 1995 LFS report shows that the application of a higher threshold than the international standard of one hour recommended by the ILO would have had little or no impact on the estimates. In 1995, fewer than 16,000 of the total of 152,000 persons in part-time employment usually worked for less than ten hours per week.</P>
    <P>The CSO's annual labour force survey report already addresses the need to provide detailed analysis of part-time working.  Among the most relevant analyses is Table 37, which classifies full-time and part-time jobs by the number of usual hours worked.  In 1995, this table showed that the average usual hours of work for part-time workers was almost 19 hours per week.</P>
    <P>Returning to the divergence between the labour force survey and live register, the CSO study confirmed that many persons who are not statistically classified as unemployed in the LFS are included in the live register total.  Conversely, taking account of the size of the gap between the LFS and live register sources, the results also indicate that there are unemployed persons, according to the LFS definitions, who are not on the live register.</P>
    <P>Taken overall, the study shows that the most consistent estimates of unemployment are those derived from the LFS.  From the middle of 1997 onwards, this survey will be conducted by the CSO on a quarterly basis.</P>

      <P>URBAN is a European Union initiative to find solutions to the serious social problems in depressed urban areas, through supporting schemes for economic and social revitalisation, the renovation of facilities and infrastructures, and environmental improvement.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for the implementation of URBAN in Ireland 1996-1999, has recently been signed by the European Commission. As previously announced, the initiative will apply in two areas in Dublin &mdash; Finglas/ Ballymun/Darndale and Tallaght/Clondalkin and also in the northside of Cork city.</P>
      <P>Under the first round of URBAN, funding to a total of £16.5 million was approved by the Commission. This money has been allocated equally between the three areas, with priority for north Dublin being given to Ballymun.  The Government has agreed that the second round of &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; funding of £4.5 million, recently approved by the Commission, will go to projects in Finglas and Darndale.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme there are six eligible measures to which funding can be allocated in each area.  These are 1. Employment and Enterprise Development, 2. Training and Education, 3. Community Infrastructure, 4. Children and Youth, 5. Environment, 6. Community Development.</P>
      <P>The three steering groups have submitted area action plans to my Department.  These plans contain proposals for projects to be implemented under the six measures and they are currently being appraised by my Department, with the assistance of independent consultants.  When this process is completed, the plans must then be submitted to the first meeting of the monitoring committee for URBAN, for approval of the strategies, targets and performance indicators envisaged in the plans.  This meeting is planned for 25 October 1996.</P>

      <P>The International Conference on Local Development, being organised by the Department of the Taoiseach, forms part of the Government's ongoing evaluation and exchange of experience about the evolution of local development activities in Ireland.  It is a major element within Ireland's Presidency programme and will be held in Dublin Castle on 11 and 12 November 1996.  It will highlight the significance of the local development approach to promoting <Col N="328" /> economic development and tackling disadvantage and long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>The conference programme is currently being finalised in consultation with the European Commission. It is expected to focus on the Irish experience of implementing local development policies and the significant role of local partnership in social and economic development and the European implications of our experience &mdash; particularly in the light of the review of the European programme to tackle the unemployment issue &mdash; through territorial employment pacts, and new ways of working together.</P>
      <P>Local initiatives such as local development have been given strong support by each European Council meeting since, and including, ESSEN.  European interest in the conference is, therefore, very strong especially given Ireland's extensive experience in comparison with other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The conference will be informed by the findings of the OECD study, launched in May 1996 &mdash;<i>Ireland &mdash; Local Partnerships and Social Innovation,</i> that confirmed the importance of the local development approach and stressed the need to ensure that the successes achieved are generalised and the lessons learned are applied as widely as possible across the board.</P>
      <P>The conference programme will provide for exchanges, within workshops, on appropriate themes in the local development process, including experiences in enterprise creation and small business development; local strategies to counter unemployment; integrated approaches to meeting the needs of the unemployed in the local economy; strategies for mobilising social partners and local authorities; strategic approaches for comprehensive rural renewal and experiences of physical, economic and social renewal in a local development perspective.</P>
      <P>The organisational arrangements for the programme are well in hand.  The expected attendance of 300 people will include European Commissioners, EU Ministers, MEPs, chairpersons of the relevant Dáil committees, representatives of various groups involved in local development, non-governmental organisations and relevant academics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main statutory functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to audit the Government accounts for accuracy and regularity.  An audit of this nature can also highlight any weaknesses in procedures, and the findings can be particularly helpful to Departments when implementing new schemes &mdash; such as the local development grants scheme, which was introduced for the first time in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> There is no question, in the report, of any misappropriation of funds but rather that the administrative arrangements approved for the scheme were not followed as strictly as they might have been.  A number of critical comments were made in the report: documentary evidence was not available, on each individual project file, of the analysis carried out of the projects.  However, the report records the Department's response that meetings were held and other contacts made to establish compliance with the criteria.  Other Departments were consulted in every case to ensure that there was no duplication of funding, in particular under the local development programme.</P>
    <P>The report notes that tax clearance certificates were not obtained prior to payments being made. However, each organisation signed an undertaking agreeing to adhere to the tax requirements and to fulfil all the accounting requirements of the Department.  At this stage, only two certificates are outstanding; one group is awaiting a decision on its application for charitable status and the second group has agreed to produce its certificate without further delay.</P>
    <P>The report notes that grants were paid to a number of projects for work which had not commenced by end 1995.  However, the Department took the view that these voluntary organisations required a seed funding approach.  The grants were paid on the basis that there was a reasonable expectation that this would enable a useful project to go ahead or be completed.  Department of Finance sanction was obtained for the individual grant payments in mid-December 1995.</P>
    <P>Regular contact with the grantees, in an effort to assist in bringing the projects to fruition, is being maintained.  It will be appreciated that all of the groups are voluntary in character and in many cases for the first time, they are facing the challenges of completing significant financial packages and of securing planning approval for large construction projects.  These projects are complementary to the overall local development programmes, one of the cornerstones of the Government's policies in tackling the problems caused by disadvantage and exclusion.  While some of the completion dates are slower than we hoped for the Department will continue to work with the grantees to ensure that the projects are completed.</P>
    <P>The accounting officer will appear, in due course, before the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; as is standard practice.</P>
    <P>The administration of the 1996 local development grant scheme complies fully with all the relevant procedural points raised in the report.</P>

      <P>The 38 area partnership companies operate under sub-programme 2 &mdash; the Integrated Development of Designated Disadvantaged and Other Areas &mdash; of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-1999.  Their boards include representatives of the State sector, social partners and the voluntary and community sector, as agreed by the then Government and the European Commission when the operational programme was drawn up. Any change in their composition &mdash; if that is the Deputy's suggestion &mdash; would require the agreement of the Commission and the monitoring committee of the programme.</P>
      <P>With a view to informing Deputies and Senators of progress to date under the programme and to allow them an opportunity to exchange views of their experiences of it, I chaired a seminar for Oireachtas Members on 28 March last.  Those who attended found it very informative.</P>
      <P>Since then &mdash; and as I informed the House in reply to Questions Nos. 50 and 54 on 28 May 1996 &mdash; elected public representatives are now included in the membership of county strategy groups, whose role is to ensure co-ordination of the local development initiatives.  Therefore, public representatives can now contribute, in a more meaningful way, to the development and implementation of co-ordination strategies, for EU funded initiatives, at a county level.</P>
      <P>While elected public representatives do not form part of the partnership boards, at present, the Government has accepted the principle that partnerships should be encouraged to invite local authority members to participate in their work. The Government has asked the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to prepare a report on how the principle of the primacy of the electoral process should be reflected in the local government and local development systems.  In particular, the Minister has been asked to make recommendations on how the distinct role of elected members can best be expressed and supported.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I have also been asked by Government to draw up frameworks for partnership and co-operation between local authorities, which embody representative democracy, and local development organisations, which embody participative democracy.  We would welcome any suggestions in this regard and would be happy to consider them.</P>
      <P>The outcome of these deliberations will inform any decision on whether a formal process, as suggested by the Deputy's question, should be set up.</P>

Accordingly, the Government has made available an additional £1 million this year specifically for the development of access services and related infrastructural work.  As chairman of the interdepartmental committee, I have visited the islands and discussed with island communities all aspects of island life, including the issue of <Col N="332" /> access.  I have seen at first hand the conditions that many islanders have to face in travelling to and from the mainland and I fully appreciate the difficulties facing these remote communities.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the island report, each of the relevant local authorities, in conjunction with their islands committees and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, prepared a prioritised programme of work in respect of access services to these islands.  The proposed projects within the programmes have been assessed by the interdepartmental committee and recommendations on funding were subsequently made.</P>
    <P>I have recently advised Galway, Mayo and Donegal County Councils of funding for projects included in their programmes of work.  Details of Cork County Council's priority access project have just recently been received.  These are currently being assessed by the interdepartmental committee and I expect to be in a position shortly to confirm funding for this project.</P>
    <P>To date, a total of £242,250 has been made available to the relevant local authorities for access projects.  A number of projects in the programmes of work are still under consideration and I hope to be able to announce further funding from the financial envelope shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Delivering Better Government &mdash; A Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service</i>&mdash; was launched on 2 May 1996.  The central focus of the programme is the provision of excellent quality services to all customers of the Civil Service.  This comprehensive report sets out the vision for the Civil Service of the future and provides a clear framework within which consistent and ongoing progress can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Work has commenced on implementing the recommendations of Delivering Better Government. A new co-ordinating group has been set up to oversee the implementation of the report.  The terms of reference of this co-ordinating group are as follows: (i) to oversee the implementation of the Government's programme for change in the Civil Service; (ii) to validate reviews of particular programmes as requested by Government and, (iii) to report regularly to Government on progress.</P>
      <P>Membership of the co-ordinating group is drawn from both the public and private sectors. The group has already met on two occassions and will be presenting its first interim report to Government early next month.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of working groups, whose membership is also drawn from both the public and private sectors, have also been established to address the following key areas identified in Delivering Better Government: quality customer service; human resource management; financial management; open and transparent service delivery; regulatory reform and Information Technology and Systems.  Three front-line groups, which are cross-departmental and cross-grade, have been established in the following areas: quality customer service, training and development, information technology.</P>
      <P>The working groups and front-line groups will work together to address the issues involved in implementing Delivering Better Government and to develop the detailed programme of action. Meetings commenced in September and the working groups have set the end of October as an interim deadline for the presentation to the co-ordinating group of initial proposals for implementation of Delivering Better Government.</P>
      <P>I am circulating in the Official Report details of the terms of reference and membership of all the working and front-line groups.  Nominations have now been obtained from Government Departments for a cross-departmental team to support the overall strategic management process in both the development and implementation of programmes of action.  It will also assist Departments with extending the process to the wider public service by the end of the year.  This team will be put in place immediately.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, have been incorporated into the Public Service Management (No. 1) Bill, 1996, which has been considered by Government and has now been sent for drafting on a priority basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> A key element of the response to Delivering Better Government is the publication, by all Government Departments and agencies, of statements of strategy before the end of this year.  I am circulating with this reply a list of those Departments and agencies which have already published such statements and the schedule for publication of the remaining documents.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, a wide range of initiatives are being undertaken at local level within Departments and offices throughout the Civil Service.  To date these have focused on the themes of communication, consultation and participation. A newsletter containing details of these initiatives will be circulated to all staff later this month as part of the continuing commitment to keeping staff informed of SMI related developments.</P>
    <P>Finally, I propose to continue to consult with Opposition leaders on the detailed progress of Delivering Better Government as the programme is implemented throughout the public service.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for his decision not to proceed with the publication of the proposed White Paper on the role of the voluntary and community sector and to proceed with a Green Paper instead.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18563/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment to publish a White Paper was first given by the then Minister in 1990. Following a round of consultation with voluntary and community groups, an interdepartmental task force was set up to assist the Department of Social Welfare in drafting material for the White Paper on voluntary activity in 1992.  The task force completed its work in July 1993.  The work of drafting the actual text for a White Paper then commenced in the Department of Social Welfare and a draft had been prepared by December 1994.</P>
      <P>The essential difficulty has been that much has been happening in the community and voluntary sector and related areas which would have an impact on any White Paper.  These include the reform of the Department of Social Welfare's grant schemes for voluntary organisations, the establishment of the National Social and Economic Forum, implementation of the Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development and, perhaps most importantly of all, the national anti-poverty strategy.  I might also mention in this context the Taoiseach's announcement of the establishment of a western development commission to promote coherent action for economic and social development by public bodies, social partners and community-based groups throughout the western region.  The Deputy will also be aware of the interim report of the devolution commission, which makes proposals for the involvement of the voluntary community sector in local community structures at area level and, through the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme area partnerships, in local authority committees.</P>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy (NAPS) is designed to fundamentally change the way in which Government tackles the issues of poverty and social exclusion and has involved a widespread consultation process with the voluntary sector.  The strategy, after an essential lead in period of consultation, is at its most critical stages of policy development.  Not taking the NAPS process into account in the White Paper would have meant that it would have been out of date even prior to its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These developments made it necessary to take a look again at the wisdom of publishing a White Paper at this time.  I came to the view that the best strategy to move forward the debate about the role of the voluntary community sector and its relation with the State is to publish a Green Paper.  The Green Paper is intended to stimulate further debate and to facilitate further engagement between the statutory and voluntary sectors in relation to the issues involved.  The debate to <Col N="342" /> be facilitated by the Green Paper will help shape future Government policy in relation to the voluntary community sector.  The Green Paper will cover issues such as suggested principles which should underpin the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector including the matter of representation in national policy making fora; suggestions regarding the method and source of funding for national representative structures for the voluntary sector; criteria to be attached to funding generally by statutory agencies; issues relating to charitable status and taxation issues; effective consultation mechanisms already in place both nationally and at EU level and the reason(s) for their effectiveness; and areas which could usefully be explored where models of statutory-voluntary sector co-operation should be actively encouraged.</P>

      <P>At present there are a number of schemes available to unemployed people and lone parents who wish to participate in full-time or part-time educational courses while continuing to retain their social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education operates the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) through the network of vocational education committees (VECs).  This scheme provides an opportunity to pursue a second level education course which can lead to qualifications such as junior certificate, leaving certificate and certain city and guild certificates.  To qualify under the scheme an unemployed person or lone parent must be at least 21 years of age and have been unemployed for at least six months.  Participants are paid the equivalent of their unemployment payment directly by the vocational education committee.  Provision has been made for some 5,000 VTOS places in the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
      <P>The second level certificate scheme is available to unemployed persons and lone parents who are unable to pursue a VTOS course.  Participants may attend full-time second level education courses at any community, comprehensive or vocational courses provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions for the VTOS scheme.  Their entitlement to social welfare payments are not affected while attending such courses.  There are no statistics available on the number of persons availing of this scheme but it is estimated that up to 1,000 people availed of it in the 1995-96 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployed people and lone parents wishing to pursue a third level education course may participate in the third level allowance scheme operated by my Department.  To qualify under the <Col N="343" /> scheme a person must be aged 23 years or over and be unemployed for at least six months.  Participants can receive a payment equivalent to their relevant social welfare payment while attending a full-time third level course at any university, third level college or institution provided that both the college and the course involved are approved by the Department of Education for higher education grants purposes.  To date, 2,694 people have been approved under this scheme in respect of the 1996-97 academic year.  Applications are still being received by my Department and it is envisaged that an additional 200 persons will qualify before the end of the year.  An unemployed person or lone parent who fails to qualify for a full-time education course may attend a part-time education course and retain their entitlement to unemployment payments. However, unemployed persons availing of this option must satisfy my Department that they continue to be actively seeking and available for full-time work.  There are no statistics available on the numbers benefiting from these arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received the final report of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems early this summer.  The report sets out comprehensively the poverty traps and work disincentives in the present tax and social welfare systems, reviews a number of possible approaches to reform, and sets out priorities for future development of the system.  I very much welcome the group's report.  In charting options for future reforms, the report provides a significant and unique contribution to public debate in the area of poverty traps and work disincentives. The two key priorities identified by <Col N="344" /> the group are reform of child income support and tax reform.</P>
      <P>It is now widely recognised that some of the income supports for children contribute to poverty traps and disincentives to work.  Reform of this is essential.  As the working group's report points out, as well as the incentives arguments, there are strong social reasons for giving priority to tackling unemployment among families with children, to break the cycle of unemployment and poverty being passed down from one generation to the next.</P>
      <P>The Government programme already commits us to reform in this area, and we have already been taking steps to reduce the disincentives effects associated with the current structure of child income support.  We have been gradually improving child benefit, while reducing the relative importance of child dependant allowances. Child benefit has been increased by 45 per cent since this Government took office.</P>
      <P>The report makes it clear that reform of child income support must continue.  The group did not reach agreement on what form this could take, but puts forward a number of different ways in which the overall system of child income support could be improved, from the point of view of incentives.  These are firstly, an integrated child benefit which would replace all the existing schemes with a greatly increased child benefit. This would be high enough to replace child dependant allowances and would be partially clawed back from the middle and higher earners through taxation.  The second option is child benefit supplement, a payment in respect of children which would be related to the income of the family, regardless of whether that income comes from employment or social welfare.  The third option considered by the expert group is to retain the broad structures of the existing system but to reform family income supplement to remove the poverty trap that arises where that payment interacts with the tax system.  The Government will be looking at these options very carefully to develop the best strategy for continuing reforming this area in line with the commitment in the programme for Government of working towards a basic income for children.</P>
      <P>The second priority identified by the group is the need to pay particular attention to the taxation of people on low incomes.  The expert group's report recommends that policies for taxation of the low paid should be directed towards limiting and eventually abolishing the exemption limits, by increasing personal allowances at a faster rate than the exemption limits.</P>
      <P>This Government has already made considerable progress on reducing the tax burden.  Over the last two budgets, the personal tax allowance for a married couple has increased by £600; the general exemption limit for a married couple has also been so increased by £600 over the last two years.  Progress has also been made on widening the tax bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> I will now turn to the specific question of basic income.  As there seems to be some public confusion as to the exact meaning of this term, let me define what exactly basic income is.  It is not to be confused with adequate income, minimally adequate income or minimum wages.  Basic income would be a payment, made by the State to all citizens, regardless of other income, family circumstances or labour force status.  A full basic income would be paid at a level high enough to replace all social welfare payments.  A partial basic income would be paid at a lower level, and would, therefore, require retention of part of the social welfare system to cater for people with no other source of income.</P>
    <P>The expert group examined a number of options for full or partial basic income.  They looked first at a full basic income, that is, a basic income which would be high enough to replace existing social welfare payments.  It would also replace personal tax allowances.  Research commissioned by the group showed that, if this were to be financed through the income tax system, it would require a tax rate of 68 per cent on all other income.  Not surprisingly, the group concluded that such a high tax rate would be likely to have an adverse effect on employment, and therefore did not recommend full basic income at this point in time.</P>
    <P>The group also examined a number of options for partial basic income, that is a basic income at a lower level of payment; this would require the retention of some elements of the existing social welfare system.  The group rejected this approach. The group's view was, essentially, that if the rate of basic income is high enough to have any substantial impact on simplifying the tax-transfer system, it would require very high levels of taxation. It would be possible to fund a partial basic income at a low level (around £21 per week) without any tax rate increase.  This is just under one-third of the level of the lowest personal rates of social welfare payment.  Thus, a considerable part of the social welfare system would need to be retained to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; the partial basic income, so that partial basic income would not have a significant effect on incentives.</P>
    <P>I accept the group's analysis that the tax rates required to fund a basic income system make it unrealistic in the short-term.  Whether or not basic income becomes feasible in the future will depend on relative movements of a large number of variables, such as the desired level of the basic income, the tax rate that may be imposed, the dependency ratio in the population, the relative level of employment and unemployment, and any changes in social welfare systems and structures in other EU countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 63, 65, 82, 94, 138 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Experience in Ireland and internationally shows that it is very difficult to estimate the level of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. However, the levels of detected abuse, with their resultant overpayments of benefit or underpayments of PRSI, show that there is a continual level of abuse, perpetrated by a minority of claimants and employers.  This abuse can range from minor short-term irregularities to serious deliberate fraud of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only study of the absolute level of fraud and abuse was undertaken in 1987 by my Department <Col N="347" /> with the assistance of consultants.  The study covered both disability benefit and unemployment payments.  In relation to unemployment payments the findings indicated that in Dublin some 2 per cent of the number of unemployment payments were based on claims which contained some clear element of fraud.  In monetary terms this figure represented some 1.6 per cent of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>In addition, the review showed that 7 per cent of the sample of cases gave rise to suspicion. Later investigation of these cases showed that two-thirds were found to be actually bona fide, a minimal number were clearly fraudulent and no definite conclusions could be drawn about the remainder.  Based on this study it would appear a reasonable conclusion that at that time there was a baseline fraud level of around 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Control activity of the Department has been a continuing feature of its work and, by its nature it is targeted at categories of claimants who are considered to be at higher risk of fraudulently claiming payments and at employments where there is greatest scope for working and claiming fraudulently or greater likelihood of non-compliance by employers with statutory obligations. The estimated value of savings arising from these activities in 1995 is estimated at £124 million. Some £50 million or so of this relates to the unemployment payments and this represents some 5 per cent of total unemployment expenditure. Total overpayments established by my Department in 1995 amounted to £16.4 million of which £11.6 million has been attributed to fraud or suspected fraud.</P>
    <P>The recent CSO survey was not undertaken directly to identify the level of fraud in the unemployment payments system.  It was designed to elucidate the reasons for the divergence between the labour force survey and the live register. However the findings of the survey give rise to concern in relation to the possible extent of fraud in the unemployment payments system and for this reason I immediately introduced a programme of control measures designed to tackle the issues.</P>
    <P>Under the programme:</P>
    <P>&mdash; all new claims for social welfare are carefully scrutinised to ensure that claimants understand their obligations, that they provide full and accurate information on their circumstances and that they are aware of the support services available;</P>
    <P>&mdash; a programme of six monthly interviews of unemployed persons will be put in place to review people's continued eligibility;</P>
    <P>&mdash; persons who are considered to be at particular risk of fraudulent claims will be subject to special review and, where appropriate, more rigorous signing arrangements;</P>
    <P>&mdash; new claimants will be expected to register with FÁS; those who refuse offers of appropriate <Col N="348" /> training and development opportunities will have their entitlement reviewed;</P>
    <P>&mdash; new arrangements for the transfer of information between FÁS and my Department are being put in place to facilitate access to appropriate training and employment opportunities by claimants and to ensure that my Department is fully informed of claimants' responses to offers from FÁS;</P>
    <P>&mdash; social welfare local offices are currently launching a major campaign to verify recorded addresses of unemployed claimants which will include a programme of home visits and other spot checks.</P>
    <P>In addition there is a programme of employer inspections which will result in some 9,000 employers being visited by the end of the year to ensure that they are meeting their PRSI obligations.</P>
    <P>The remarks made by the Secretary of my Department to the Committee of Public Accounts related to the level of overpayments of benefit and assistance which were identified as being due to fraud.  This relates to payments which were established as having being made to people engaged in fraudulent claiming.  It cannot be taken as a measure of the overall level of fraud in the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>In the light of the indications emerging from the CSO survey I am arranging for further work to be carried out to get more detailed information on the problem which will enable the Department to deal more effectively with the issues and concerns.</P>
    <P>A number of developments in the computerisation of the Department's services also have a significant impact in the area of control.  A new computerised system known as the integrated short-term schemes system (ISTS), has been implemented in local offices.  This system has enabled a greater focus on control at claim registration, particularly with regard to establishing the identity of claimants and validating increases claimed for dependants.  This system is also enabling the computerisation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the first time.</P>
    <P>As part of the development of this system a major review of data held on both the central records and short-term schemes databases was undertaken.  This review has assisted in improving the integrity of the data base.  In addition cross checks are carried with other databases to highlight any iregularities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the estimates of expenditure these are reviewed on an ongoing basis in the light of trends in the numbers qualifying for payment and in the level of payments under the various schemes.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the measures I have introduced will have an impact over time on the live register figures and consequently on expenditure on unemployment payments.  It is not possible at this stage to assess the precise impact on the 1996 <Col N="349" /> outturn of expenditure but this will be addressed as part of the review of expenditure for 1996 and the Estimates for 1997.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the loss of income from PRSI contributions from those who are concurrently working and claiming unemployment payments.  This estimate would depend on the type of employment i.e. employment or self-employment, the level of earnings from the employment and the appropriate rate of PRSI contribution applicable to those earnings.</P>
    <P>There is also an ongoing programme of employer inspections which will result in 9,000 employers being visited by the end of this year to ensure they are meeting their obligations under the PRSI scheme.</P>
    <P>I am determined to stamp out fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to apply the full rigour of the law to those employers and claimants who deliberately set out to defraud the system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 78, 88 and 95 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to Priority Question No. 43 on today's Order Paper, I outlined the current position with regard to the scheme of support for older people and my plans for an awareness campaign to be launched next week to provide elderly people with specific information and advice on how to improve personal security both inside and outside their homes.  The awareness campaign is a joint one with my colleague the Minister for Justice and is being co-ordinated by my Department in conjunction with the Garda Síochána who have primary responsibility for protecting <Col N="350" /> older people &mdash; or any other section of the community &mdash; from criminal assault or attack.</P>
    <P>The campaign will involve a mailshot to 320,000 pensioners and is being co-ordinated by the Departments of Justice and Social Welfare. The mailshot will include a letter signed by both Ministers and a number of relevant information leaflets etc. on security issues for older people.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the recommendation made by the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly for a £2 million grant scheme, I established a national advisory committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and the Garda Síochána (Neighbourhood Watch) are represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted at the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved.  On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for:</P>
    <P>&mdash; small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
    <P>It was not intended that the scheme would provide funding towards the cost of conventional burglar alarm systems.  The strong advice available to me from the advisory committee and the Garda Síochána is that conventional burglar alarms are of limited use to vulnerable elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>As the scheme came about as a direct result of the Special Task Force on Security for the Elderly, it was intended to provide funding for older people, which for the purpose of the scheme we took to be anyone over the age of 65 years living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people or older people and other vulnerable and dependent people.  Priority in allocating the funds is being given to the most vulnerable older people.  Vulnerability is being defined in terms of advanced age, disability, isolation and those who have previously been victims of crime. I have no plans to extend the scheme other than to the older people for whom it was intended.</P>
    <P>The scheme, entitled a scheme of community support for older people was advertised on Wednesday 29 May 1996 in the national newspapers. The scheme is open to any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people. Information on the scheme was disseminated through my Department i.e. headquarters, regional and local offices and through the networks of the various organisations represented on the national advisory committee.</P>
    <P>The deadline for receipt of applications was 28 June 1996.  This was to allow time for my Department <Col N="351" /> to assess all applications and to ensure that those most at risk benefit from the available funds before the onset of the winter months.  The scheme is being administered in each of my Department's regions with the aid of a regional advisory committee which mirrors the composition of the national advisory committee referred to above.</P>
    <P>A total of 425 applications have been received from voluntary organisations catering for approximately 11,103 individuals.  To date, 297 groups have been approved for funding catering for approximately 6,263 individuals.  Applications received after the formal closing date were and are still been considered, in the light of resources still available under the scheme.  It is expected that all the available funds will be spent very shortly.</P>

      <P>The problem of long-term unemployment is deeply rooted in our society and will only be resolved by the sustained application of a series of targeted measures.  Through its actions to date, this Government has demonstrated its absolute commitment to the development of opportunities for the long-term unemployed to share in the benefits of our economic growth and we will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that a range of pro-employment measures have been introduced this year which are designed to provide incentives to the unemployed, and particularly the long-term unemployed, to re-enter the labour force.</P>
      <P>Among the measures provided for this year are:</P>
      <P>&mdash; An increase in the PRSI-free allowance from £50 p.w. to £80 per week together with reductions in the employer PRSI rates from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent in the case of the lower incentive rate and from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent in the case of the main rate;</P>
      <P>&mdash; An increase of £10 in the income limits applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, which means that most current recipients are getting an increase of £6 per week;</P>
      <P>&mdash; The continued payment of increases for dependent children for up to 13 weeks to people in receipt of such increases at the full rate who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" />&mdash; The reform of unemployment assistance which is designed to simplify the arrangements for claiming unemployment assistance and to make it more attractive for recipients to take-up part-time or casual work opportunities;</P>
    <P>&mdash; An increase of 5,000 in the number of back to work allowances from 10,000 to 15,000 places during 1996.  In view of the success of this scheme, the Government has recently approved a further increase of 2,000 in the number of allowances bringing the total up to 17,000.</P>
    <P>&mdash; A further substantial increase in the monthly rates of child benefit.  By channelling resources to child benefit, which is a universal payment, as opposed to child dependant allowances which are lost on taking up employment, the disincentive effects of the latter payments are greatly lessened.</P>
    <P>&mdash; The introduction of a new one-parent family payment from January 1997.  This new payment will merge the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit and is designed to make employment a more feasible option for lone parents.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Improvements in the third level allowance and second chance education schemes whereby participants are allowed to retain their allowances during the summer holiday period until such time as they finish their course.</P>
    <P>I will continue to reform the social welfare system to ensure that disincentives to employment are stripped out and that the system can operate effectively as a system of income support and, equally importantly, can provide the support necessary for people to re-enter the active labour force.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 140 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided at its meeting yesterday to approve the payment of a Christmas bonus again this year to certain social welfare recipients and others at a cost of £41.7 million, of which £38 million is appropriate to my Department.  The balance is appropriate to the Department of <Col N="353" /> Enterprise and Employment in respect of participants on community employment and other schemes and to the Department of Health in respect of certain health benefits.  As in previous years, the bonus will amount to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments and there will be a minimum payment of £20.  It will be paid during the first week in December and will benefit almost 800,000 recipients and their 500,000 dependants i.e. a total of 1.3 million beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>In line with previous years, the bonus will be paid by the Department of Social Welfare to people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments including those receiving old age, retirement, widows', widowers', invalidity pensions, lone parent's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, carer's allowance, disability allowance, (formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance), as well as FÁS and CERT trainees.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of August this year there were 8,006 allowances in payment.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  For example, last year the weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse was increased to £150 a week and the scheme was further improved with the inclusion of carers who look after the recipients of occupational pensions.  In this year's budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 to £67.50 which is an 8 per cent increase on last year's rate.</P>
      <P>In addition, new regulations have been introduced which change the basis of assessment of means of carers for the purpose of determining entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  As a result of these changes, carers who are receiving rent or mortgage interest supplements from the health boards can now benefit by as much as £29 per week.  The new regulations also mean that some applicants who previously failed to qualify on the basis of their means will now be in a position to qualify for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further development of the carer's allowance is currently being examined in the context of a review of the allowance which is being car <Col N="354" /> ried out by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health having regard to general health care provision in the home for elderly and disabled people requiring care.  In this regard, all aspects of the current operation of the carer's allowance are being considered in the light of our experience to date.  The findings contained in the recent report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights entitled <i>A Long-term Support Framework for Female Carers of Older People and People with Disabilities: 1996-2011</i> are also being taken into account in this review.  Any proposals arising from the review would, of course, have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance payments include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have. Different methods of assessment are applied in the various social assistance schemes.  For <Col N="355" /> example, in the case of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent.  For old age pension purposes, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>During the debate in this House on the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, I made known that I was taking the opportunity of the introduction of the new one-parent family payment and the new disability allowance to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all the various social assistance payments. Under the new provisions, the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>The extension of these provisions to other social assistance payments will be done progressively over a period of time in view of the significant administrative implications involved.  There are about 430,000 people in receipt of a social assistance payment at present and the means of all those with capital would have to be reviewed on the introduction of any changes in this area.</P>
      <P>The substantial £2,000 initial disregard under the new arrangements will significantly reduce the effective interest rate for most recipients and will mean that claimants are not effectively assessed at 7.5 per cent until their level of capital approaches £25,000.  The cost of extending these arrangements to other social assistance payments is in the region of £9.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The publication by the NESC of the conclusions and recommendations arising from its report entitled &ldquo;A Strategy into the 21st Century&rdquo; is timely and welcome in the context of the debate on the need for a new national programme.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that the major economic and social challenges we currently face are to manage growth and lay the foundations for sustained national competitive advantage, and to promote social inclusion and cohesion so that all sectors of Irish society are enabled to participate in supporting that national competitive advantage and to benefit equitably from the success that advantage will bring.  It emphasises in particular the need to reduce unemployment and to start a long-term reversal of inequality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> The NESC report also outlines the priorities which the council believes must underlie an integrated programme to tackle unemployment and social inclusion, including&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; action on key unemployment and poverty traps;</P>
    <P>&mdash; expansion of targeted employment measures for the long-term unemployed; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; development of an effective local employment service.</P>
    <P>These priorities match those which have driven this Government's continuing determined efforts to tackle the root causes of long-term unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>Against that background, the council concludes that negotiated social partnership programmes are a most effective mechanism for developing competitiveness and social cohesion.  In this context, the council has made a specific recommendation concerning the scope for enhancing the partnership approach through development of the arrangements for participation and monitoring of progress.</P>
    <P>The recommendation, which has been accepted by the Government, is that, at the outset, all relevant parties, including the Government, make opening position statements at a formal meeting for that purpose and that discussions thereafter proceed bilaterally and multilaterally, as appropriate, depending on the issues being considered.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Taoiseach is inviting key national organisations to discussions later this month about the priorities for a new national programme.</P>
    <P>The report emphasises the priority which must be attached to combating unemployment and social exclusion and outlines the council's views on the priority policies and actions which it considers will achieve the greatest impact in this area.</P>
    <P>The council notes that a long-term strategy for social inclusion requires that public policy be oriented in such a way as to promote a reallocation of resources to those in greatest need and notes the key role which the National Anti-Poverty Strategy will play in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the area of income support, the council recommends that the next national programme should seek to bridge the remaining gap between social welfare rates and the minimum rates advocated by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986, subject to overall Exchequer constraints and pending consideration of the current review of income requirements which I have commissioned from the ESRI.</P>
    <P>The council's report also examines the issues of work incentives and poverty traps, and includes proposals on reform of the family income supplement scheme and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Finally, the report also includes recommendations on future actions to combat tax, welfare and employment fraud.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> The NESC report brings valuable insight to the many issues which are addressed within it and I will take the closest account of the council's views in developing social welfare policy.</P>

Various options for alleviating the problems associated with the current situation, whereby a beneficiary loses entitlement to the adult dependant allowance and half of any increase payable in respect of dependent children when the earnings of the spouse or partner exceed the present income limit of £60 are being examined by my Department.  One such option is to introduce a more gradual withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance where the income of the spouse or partner is within specified income limits.  Any changes along these lines would have substantial cost implications, however, and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, a proposal for a fourth EU Poverty Programme to combat social exclusion, with requires unanimity, has been blocked by Germany and the UK.  To date, all efforts by the Commission and other member states, including personal interventions by myself, have not succeeded in changing the opposition to this particular proposal.</P>
      <P>Indeed, as one Deputy referred to in his question, the UK Government applied to the European Court for an order annulling the decisions setting up European Commission grant schemes for anti-poverty projects.  The German Government has also joined in this action.  As the House is aware, the court has, in an interim ruling, instructed the Commission to make no expenditure commitments in advance of the final conclusion of the case.  While the Commission can still process applications, it cannot make decisions on them.  This leaves applicant groups in a limbo situation.  As far as I am concerned, this serves to highlight the need for action at the Intergovernmental Conference to give a clear competence to the Union in these matters.</P>
      <P>In the European Union as it stands I see two serious imbalances.  First, a mismatch between on the one hand, the impressive and wholly laudable statement of social objectives set out both at Article 2 of the Treaty and in the chapter on social policy, and on the other hand, the extent of Community action to give effect to these.  We are all only too familiar with the saga of how a range of fairly humble spending initiatives at EU level have failed to be implemented due to the weakness of Article 235 as a Treaty base.  Even within the limited social policy powers available to the Union, one could further criticise the fact that most activities relate to the protection of workers in relation to employment, rather than to their rights as citizens in relation to their social needs.</P>
      <P>The second imbalance that strikes me is between the strong legal and financial instruments available for economic policy and those for dealing with poverty, unemployment and the labour market.  The EU community can accept social cohesion as a necessary goal between regions, but not, apparently, between social classes or between individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My overall aim during the Irish Presidency is to mainstreanm what might be called a `social exclusion mindset' which will help shape the discussions <Col N="360" /> on the next phase of the Essen process, at the Dublin summit; and to materially influence the conclusions of the summit and ensuing policy in the Union.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as Deputies will be aware, the Government will seek a treaty change in relation to the fight against social exclusion as part of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The purpose of this is to ensure that the European Union will be better able to combat poverty in the future.  If we are successful, two things may happen.  First the competence of the EU to engage in anti-poverty programmes will be clearer so that such actions will have a specific legal basis.  Second, this would permit more significant European poverty initiatives in the future.</P>

      <P>Council recommendations of the type which are the subject of the Deputy's question do not have binding force on member states in the same way as directives.  The idea of compliance with their strict terms therefore does not arise. They are, however intended to guide and inform the direction of national policy.  I can confirm that Ireland has been fully supportive of the two recommendations in question and has observed their broad spirit in developing the social welfare system since then.</P>
      <P>Recommendation 92/441/EEC, which was adopted by the Social Affairs Council on 24 June 1992, urged member states to ensure that their social protection systems give recognition to &ldquo;the basic right of a person to sufficient resources and social assistance to live in a manner compatible with human dignity as part of a comprehensive and consistent drive to combat social exclusion&rdquo;. It recommended, in particular, that people with no other means of subsistence should receive &ldquo;sufficient resources and social assistance in keeping with their situation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was already engaged in providing support to people in such a contingency via the social assistance system and, in particular, the supplementary welfare allowance system.  It has been my policy since coming into office to develop both the adequacy of rates of payment within social assistance and to improve the delivery mechanisms.  As the Deputy will already know, in regard to adequacy of payments, I have commissioned a study from the ESRI on updating the work of the 1986 Commission on Social Welfare on the issues of target rates for adequacy in social <Col N="361" /> welfare rates generally; I would hope that on receipt of this report to make further progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation cited in the Deputy's question, 92/442/EEC of 27 July 1992, refers to the concept of convergence among member states on the objectives and policies of social protection.  The recommendation went through the various well-known categories of social protection &mdash; for example maternity, unemployment, incapacity for work, old age and support for families &mdash; and set out certain agreed basic principles in relation to how these should be administered in the member states.  These included equality of treatment, fairness, including the idea that recipients should receive their share of improvements in the standard of living of the population as a whole; flexibility, in order to accommodate to new needs in social protection; and efficiency of organisation and delivery.</P>
    <P>The idea behind this recommendation was to agree among member states on certain basic principles which are held in common in our diverse national systems and to ensure that the future direction of these systems of social protection should take account of these principles.  The Commission has followed up by producing a biennial report on social protection in 1993 and 1995 which traces how developments in the social protection systems of member states relate to these principles.</P>
    <P>Developments in the social welfare system since 1992 &mdash; for example, increases in rates above the inflation rate, improvements to the child benefit system, the introduction of a survivor's pension and the payment of equal treatment arrears &mdash; all contribute to the development of the Irish system as a whole in line with these objectives.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity of the Irish Presidency to propose to my colleagues in the Social Affairs Council of Ministers that we adopt a resolution, at our 2 December meeting, which would have the effect of adding an important new objective to those set out in recommendation 92/442/EEC.  My aim is to secure agreement to the effect that social protection systems, while continuing to support the objectives referred to above, should have the additional aim of contributing positively to the prevention of unemployment and to the re-integration of the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed and marginalised people.  It would be up to individual member states to take whatever steps are appropriate, however, in our own case this resolution would suggest that we act to develop clearer incentives to take and stay in work and a greater array of active supports to people who are having difficulty in getting back into the world of work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The cost of reducing the current higher rate of employer's PRSI by 1 per cent, from 12 per cent to 11 per cent, is estimated at £76 million in a full year, starting in April 1997.  The cost of reducing the current lower rate of employer's PRSI by 1 per cent, from 8.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, is estimated at £39 million in a full year, starting in April 1997.</P>
      <P>The exemption limit for employee's PRSI was abolished in the 1996 budget.  Instead, the employee's PRSI allowance was increased from £50 per week to £80 per week with effect from 6 April 1996.  The cost of increasing the employee's PRSI allowance from £80 per week to £110 per week is estimated at £65 million in a full year. The estimated cost of increasing the weekly allowance from £80 to £140 is £125 million in each case starting from April 1997.</P>
      <P>With regard to the current 1996-97 tax year, the cost of a 1 per cent reduction in the higher rate of employer's PRSI which applied up to 5 April 1996, from 12.2 per cent to 11.2 per cent, would have been about £70 million in a full year.  The cost of reducing the then lower rate of employers' PRSI by 1 per cent from 9 per cent to 8 per cent, would have been about £30 million in a full year, assuming that the earnings limit for the lower rate remained unchanged at £231 per week.  The cost of increasing the employee's PRSI allowance from £50 to £110 per week would have been about £120 million per year, while increasing this allowance from £50 to £140 per week would have been over £200 million per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to priority Question No. 44 on today's Order Paper, I outlined the range of measures I have either already taken or are being planned to improve the relationship between the statutory and voluntary and community sectors and the specific supports provided by my Department for local community development initiatives. <Col N="363" /> My Department funds a number of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work.  In addition substantial funding is provided for a number of programmes which have an anti-poverty focus.</P>
      <P>Under the Community Development Programme, or CDP, funding is provided towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in an area and to other specialist community development projects.  I have committed myself to the proactive targeting of 30 new areas for the establishment of new CDP projects over the next three years and the establishment of an expert technical group to assist and advise me in that regard.  The group is being appointed for a two year term.  The experience of the process over that period will be evaluated. The group will have the following functions: first, advising me on applications received from groups for funding under the programme; and, second, assisting the Department in drawing up a list of 30 priority areas to be targeted for the development of new projects over the next three years.</P>
      <P>In January 1995, an advisory group was established to advise both myself and the Department in relation to the overall policy and development of the community development programme.  I am committed to continuing to work closely with the advisory committee and see it as a model of good practice in involving the community sector in decision making and the development of a strategic partnership for social change.  My Department will continue dialogue with the advisory committee on funding levels within the CDP, with a view to the strategic development of options to build on the successes achieved to date, while preserving the basic community development programme that has served disadvantaged areas so well while maintaining its accessibility to new communities and projects.</P>
      <P>As already announced, I am committed to the expansion of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service to make it available throughout the State. It is expected that this expansion will be complete within the next year.  Priority issues for the future are the need to strengthen the community sector's involvement in local projects and enhancement of the preventative and educational work of local projects, to complement the core one-to-one advisory service offered by MABS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the various levels of funding for women's groups by independent consultants is currently nearing completion.  The review was commissioned to suggest a framework to deal with the funding of women's groups to include the three levels of schemes; identify the linkages between the three levels of schemes, bearing in mind that a number of the core funded groups are in fact networks; advise on the establishment of mechanisms for selection of groups and on methods of progression of groups to the different levels; advise on methods for monitoring and <Col N="364" /> evaluation of the schemes; and examine the need for support mechanisms at the different levels and to make recommendations as necessary.</P>
    <P>A review of the men's grants scheme, introduced in 1994, will be commissioned in the near future.  The outcome of these reviews will shape the Department's policy in relation to these schemes for future years.</P>

      <P>Members of the travelling community do not have to satisfy any special conditions for social welfare payments other than those which apply to claimants generally.  For unemployment payments special signing on arrangements did apply but members of the travelling community, in common with claimants generally, now normally sign-on once every four weeks at the social welfare local office nearest to where they are living. They are paid each week at their local post office.</P>
      <P>In some cases, for administrative reasons, travellers sign on at a fixed time on the appointed signing day.  However, any member of the travelling community who wishes for genuine reasons to sign outside this time may be facilitated by the local office.  Signing arrangements for all claimants may however be varied by a local office where they consider it appropriate to do so for proper management and control purposes.</P>

      <P>One of the provisions of the EU Directive, 86/613/EEC, refers to the question of benefit entitlements of spouses who participate in the family business without being employees or partners. It requires that such spouses who are not protected under self-employed persons social security shall be enabled to join a contributory social security scheme voluntarily.  Under the Social Welfare Acts, such spouses have certain benefit entitlements under the contributions, class S, payable by their spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive also required member states to examine whether and under what conditions <Col N="365" /> female self-employed workers and the wives of self-employed workers should be entitled to benefit during interruption in their occupational activity owing to pregnancy or motherhood.  The matter was examined in my Department as required but a decision was deferred pending a review of the directive at the European Commission.

      <P>The restructuring of my Department into two separate areas was undertaken in 1985.  One area is responsible for advising the Minister on policy issues.  The other, known as Social Welfare Services (SWS) is concerned solely with executive work and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the schemes and services of my Department. The main objective of the restructuring was to enable those concerned with the operation of the various schemes to concentrate more fully on effective management and the provision of an efficient and speedy delivery of services.</P>
      <P>The matter of how my Department is organised is being addressed within the context of the strategic management initiative (SMI).  The SMI process to date has involved looking at the business we are in, setting goals and objectives and agreeing the content of our priority action programmes. We have at this stage agreed a strategic framework within which the future development and improvement of our services can take place in a manner that will be relevant and responsive to the needs of our customers and provide value for money to the taxpayer.  The future direction will involve, among other things, consideration of a more integrated approach to the delivery of social services at the local level.</P>
      <P>The suitability of the present structure of my Department to deliver on our agreed strategy is being reviewed on a number of fronts.  Part of this review, in line with the <i>Delivering Better Government</i> initiative, will involve consideration of the appropriateness and feasibility of a move towards establishing Social Welfare Services on a more autonomous footing.</P>

      <P>I welcome the reduction in the live register figures and I believe that the publicity surrounding the publication of the recent CSO report and the announcement of the Government's package of measures aimed at combating fraud has had an impact on the figures.

      <P>I welcome the recent report <i>Lone Mothers in Ireland</i> as being an important piece of research, which makes a significant contribution to our understanding of lone motherhood in Ireland.  Because of its significance I laid the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas when it was published.  I also sent a copy of the report to the secretary of the Select Committee on Social Affairs for information and consideration.</P>
      <P>The policy in relation to lone parents and their children is two-fold: first, to provide basic income maintenance to help one-parent families, and second, to help lone parents break out of poverty and dependence on social welfare payments by facilitating their taking up employment, where they wish to.  I am pleased that the report welcomes the positive steps that have been taken by the Government in this regard over the last number of years, such as the significant increases in child benefit, most of which goes to lower income households, and the shift towards facilitating labour market participation by lone parents through increased income disregards in the means test for entitlement to lone parent's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This facilitation is set to continue with the introduction from January next of the one-parent family payment which will represent another major step in making employment a more realistic option for lone parents.  Under this payment, a lone parent will be able to earn up to £6,000 a year while still retaining entitlement to <Col N="367" /> the maximum rate of payment.  I am confident that, over time, this will prove very successful in helping lone parents make the transition to employment.</P>
    <P>The findings of this Combat Poverty Agency report, with the future report of the Commission on the Family which is examining the needs and priorities of families, and the national anti-poverty strategy which is addressing key themes such as educational disadvantage, unemployment, and income adequacy, will assist the Government in formulating ongoing policies to tackle poverty and social deprivation among all families, which is one of my major priorities.</P>

      <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> is a comprehensive report which was published in December 1993.  It deals with the three elements that make up the national pension system <i>viz.</i> the social welfare pension system; occupational pension schemes; and personal pension arrangements.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board report said that it considered that the aim of the national pension system should be to provide pension benefits which maintained a reasonable relationship with previous income levels, so that establishment standards of living can be maintained and I would fully support this approach.  The report continued that &ldquo;having regard to existing levels of coverage, international experience and the number of small employers in Ireland, the Board concluded that it is highly unlikely that the present system that is compulsory social insurance and voluntary occupational schemes or personal pension arrangements in the case of the self employed and employees who are not members of an occupational scheme, will ever achieve the completeness and the level of coverage which this aim requires&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As a first step to advancing options to increase coverage the National Pensions Board recommended that a survey of occupational pension schemes should be undertaken.  This survey, which was commissioned jointly by the Department and the Pensions Board, is currently being finalised by the Economic and Social Research Institute and will be presented to me on 30 October.  This study will give essential up to date information on occupational cover.  As a follow on to this research I will be announcing a major pensions initiative to examine pensions coverage issues further.  This will culminate in the publication of a consultation document early next year which will facilitate a national debate on how to work towards a national pensions system which achieves the overall aim set out by the National Pensions Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of specific proposals in the National Pensions Board report have already been implemented.  These include (1) Pensions to be paid to widowers on the same basis as proposed for widows &mdash; this was introduced with effect from October 1994; (2) The conditions for homemakers to acquire pensions in their own right to be considerably eased &mdash; this came into effect in April 1994; (3) Full PRSI is payable by all new entrants to public sector employments &mdash; implemented from April 1995.  In addition a Commission on Public Service Pensions was set up by the Minister for Finance in 1996 to examine and report on the pensions terms of public servants. This Commission is to report in 1998; (4) Increasing the earnings disregard in respect of Lone Parents Allowance &mdash; this came into effect from July 1994 and will be further improved from next January so as to improve the incentive for a lone <Col N="369" /> parent to take up employment; (5) An actuarial review of the projected long-term costs of social welfare pensions to be undertaken &mdash; this will be initiated in consultation with the Pensions Board later this year.  These and other issues relating to funding issues are addressed in the Social Insurance Discussion document.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board also recommended that equalised rates of social insurance contribution should be calculated over a 10 year period to meet the changing costs of social insurance benefits.  Consideration will be given to bringing forward proposals in this area following the completion of the actuarial review.  The remaining proposals, which largely relate to entitlement to a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions, are currently being considered within my Department and I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in this regard in the context of the next budget.</P>

      <P>In providing the service, an important element of the approach is the targeting of families who have been identified as having particular problems with debt and moneylending.  Local projects are established on a partnership basis, with the involvement of all relevant statutory, voluntory and community interests.  The Credit Union movement plays a key part in the successful operation of the service and in opening up alternative sources of credit for people with particular debt problems.  New projects are funded on a provisional basis for an initial period of one year. After the satisfactory completion of one year's operations, projects can be offered a three year funding commitment, which involves signing a formal contract with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> The contract includes a three-year work plan, prepared by the management committee of the project, in which they set out the programme of work they will undertake, and the objectives they hope to achieve in the three-year period.  It is important to emphasise that while my Department provides the funding for the running costs of the projects, the service is independent and confidential.</P>

      <Quest>his views on revelations in the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that he was responsible for overpayments of almost £500,000 in relation to arrears of equal treatment payments and that he was responsible for further overpayments to Telecom Éireann, the ESB and An Post in relation to services provided to his Department.</Quest>

      <P>Equal treatment arrears are payable to married women in a number of instalments.  Payments on account were made to all claimants in July/August 1995.  These were calculated by reference to data held on computer file in relation to payments made in 1992/93 under the restricted equal treatment provisions introduced in June 1992.  Subsequent payments were made following detailed review of individual claims.  The overpayments came to light during the course of this review.</P>
      <P>The overpayments arose as a result of departmental errors and were not as a result of any fraud on the part of the claimants.  While every effort was made to avoid overpayments nonetheless they must be seen in the context of the huge task of paying arrears to 70,000 married women on claims made as far back as 1984.  At that time schemes administered by the Department were not computerised to the extent they now are with the result that comprehensive details of claims were not available in all cases.  In the context of overall expenditure on equal treatment arrears &mdash; currently £244.6 million &mdash; the amount overpaid could not be considered as significant.</P>
      <P>As regards the recovery of equal treatment overpayments the position is that a number of legal issues were considered with the Attorney General's office.  The recovery of the overpayments is currently being reviewed by my Department on the basis of the advice recently obtained from that office.  Any further action will depend on the outcome of that review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his annual report for 1995, the Comptroller and Auditor General also referred to overcharges to the Department of £43,850 by Telecom Éireann, £21,168 by An Post and a possible overcharge of £13,600 per two-month billing period by the ESB.  These overpayments arose on the free telephone rental allowance, free TV licence and free electricity allowance schemes which apply to elderly and incapacitated pensioners.  The overpayments <Col N="371" /> came to light as a result of control procedures operated in my Department and in An Post.</P>
    <P>In the case of Telecom Éireann, pensioners were receiving credit on their telephone accounts in respect of the rental charges for additional telephone equipment not covered under the free telephone rental allowance scheme and the cost was charged to my Department.  Overpayment of some £53,000 from January 1994 has been identified to date and recovered in full.  Further control procedures have been put in place in my Department to ensure early detection and recovery of any further overpayments.</P>
    <P>In the case of An Post, part of the overpayment was identified and subsequently recovered by my Department as far back as July 1993.  The remainder of this aggregate overpayment, which related to free television licences which were issued in error to non-qualified customers, was identified by An Post's own internal audit procedures.  The full amount has been recovered from An Post. The issue of free television licences to qualified pensioners is being automated.  This will result in advance verification of entitlement before licences issue.  Overpayments such as these will be eliminated in the process.  It is planned to have this in operation by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In the case of the ESB, checks by my Department identified possible categories of overpayment. Criteria were drawn up and the ESB supplied lists of cases which met the criteria.  A total of 1,213 cases were identified in this process of which 567 had their allowances terminated. Procedures have been put in place to prevent the overpayments recurring.  The scope for recovery is currently under investigation with the ESB.</P>
    <P>The aggregate overpayments in respect of the free schemes concerned are comparatively small in the context of annual expenditure of over £66 million in 1996 terms on the relevant schemes. They were identified through existing control procedures and these are being improved on a cost-effective basis.  I am satisfied that all reasonable steps are and have been taken to avoid overpayments and, where these arise, to detect and effect recovery.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is a need to introduce a social welfare scheme of cheap natural gas to social welfare recipients who depend on natural gas for cooking and/or heating, particularly in the Dublin area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department operates two schemes which are designed to provide assistance with the cost of fuel.  First, the free schemes administered by my Department include the free electricity allowance and the free natural gas allowance.  The natural gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity <Col N="372" /> allowance for people who are connected to a natural gas supply.  These schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>Last July, the free schemes of telephone rental allowance, electricity allowance and colour television licence were extended to low income pensioners who did not previously qualify because they did not get a social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>Second, my Department also operates the national fuel scheme which assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks of each year.</P>
      <P>Last year I increased the income limit for the national fuel scheme from £5 to £10 per week.  In this year's budget I announced a further £5 increase in the income limit which will take effect from October 1996.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum contributory pension rate or savings/investments of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. Under that scheme a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement.  An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the local community welfare officer.</P>
      <P>In view of the existence of these schemes, I see no particular merit in introducing a further scheme which would duplicate administrative procedures already in place.  Neither am I aware of any justification for a proposal which discriminates in favour of the users of natural gas as against users of other heating and cooking fuels.  I would prefer instead to concentrate any available resources on continuing to improve the existing schemes.</P>

These control activities, include specific investigation units which work at local, regional and national level within the Department.</P>
      <P>These units, one of which works in conjunction with staff of the Revenue Commissioners, carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare payments, review customers' means for assistance payments and monitor their on-going entitlements to social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Persons who defraud social welfare payment schemes and employers who fail to honour their obligations under the PRSI system are liable to prosecution.  All cases involving fraud or abuse of the social welfare system are examined with a view to initiating legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>A total of 50 social welfare prosecutions were finalised by the courts between 1 January 1996 and 30 September 1996.  Of these, 28 were people who were in receipt of payments, while 22 were employers.  The results were, 25 received fines, six the Probation Act, four community service, eight a suspended sentence, one was bound to the peace, two were imprisoned and four were struck out.

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, mortgage interest supplements are only payable where a health board is satisfied that a person was in a position to meet the full mortgage repayments at the time the mortgage agreement was entered into.  This would usually mean that a person was in remunerative employment at the time the house was purchased.  If the person subsequently cannot meet the repayments, for example, through illness or unemployment, the health board can then pay a supplement towards the interest element of the mortgage repayment, provided the person satisfies the other criteria which are set out in legislation.</P>
      <P>If a person decides to purchase their home while in receipt of a social welfare payment, they will not qualify for a mortgage interest supplement under the SWA scheme as they were not in a position to make the repayments at the time the house was purchased.</P>

      <P>Social welfare entitlements are available to all citizens who satisfy the relevant conditions attached to those entitlements.  In the case of social insurance benefits and pensions, certain minimum PRSI contribution conditions must be met in addition to the other conditions for receipt of a payment.  Entitlement to a social assistance payment is subject to a means test which requires the disclosure of all income, including, where necessary, the income of household members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The determination of entitlement to social welfare payments is made by deciding officers of my Department in accordance with the legislative provisions currently in force.  That decision process operates on the basis of an underlying presumption <Col N="375" /> of honesty on the part of the applicant, that is, a presumption that the information given on foot of a social welfare claim is correct at the time it is given.  In the course of determining entitlement, the information furnished will be subject to checking where necessary.</P>
    <P>If the circumstances of the applicant, or of a family member having a bearing on the claim, subsequently change to the extent that the information given in the first instance is no longer correct, there is an onus on the applicant to inform my Department accordingly.  Failure to do so can lead to payment being suspended and the possibility of prosecution proceedings in the courts.</P>
    <P>Consequently, a person who acts honestly and responsibility at all times in their dealings with my Department should not find himself or herself in the position of suffering a reduction or loss of his or her legally determined social welfare entitlements. On the other hand, a person who has not acted honestly or responsibly by, for example, not disclosing their full circumstances in connection with a claim and who wishes to regularise his or her position can expect, at least, to have their entitlement to a payment reviewed.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is concerned about the manner in which a particular case was dealt with, I will arrange to have the matter investigated if he will furnish me with the relevant details.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce refunds for VRT and VAT in respect of motor vehicles used as public service vehicles.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible in the time available to asertain if the VRT refund scheme the Deputy has in mind applies in other member states.</P>
      <P>As regards VAT, the treatment of this sector is governed by the EU Sixth VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Ireland has availed of a member state option to exempt passenger transport from VAT.  This means that taxi and hackney operators do not charge VAT on the services they provide, but as a necessary corollary, they are not entitled to recover the VAT incurred on the goods and services they purchase. All other member states of the EU, with the exception of Denmark, treat these services as taxable and therefore the question of special refund schemes for VAT in those member states does not arise.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the concession and benefits available for the conversion of a car for a qualifying person with a disability are granted under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  The concessions include: the repayment of vehicle registration tax, VRT; the repayment of VAT paid on the purchase of the vehicle; the repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle; the repayment of excise duty on fuel used in the vehicle on which repayment <Col N="378" /> of VRT has been granted and the grant of exemption from road tax.</P>
      <P>These reliefs are granted in specific circumstances to disabled persons who qualify under the regulations.  As the information requested by the Deputy is included in two public notices which deal with the concessions, notice 1851A and notice 1851B, I have made arrangements for these notices to be sent directly to her.  Any additional information which is required by the Deputy or her constituent may be obtained by contacting the central repayment office, Monaghan, telephone 047-82800.</P>

      <P>Initial expenditure has been slower than forecast in the programme document, with only 0.2 million ecu spent in 1995 and the remainder reprofiled into future years.  This is largely because of the time it took to establish the innovative delivery mechanisms which are integral part of the programme.  In addition, given the fact that the intention of this programme is to engage groups which have not previously been involved in European funding, it is important that time be allowed for local and perhaps inexperienced organisations on the ground to prepare and submit their applications.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable improvement in the commitment position since end June 1996. Reports are currently being prepared for the next meeting of the monitoring committee in early November and I will arrange to circulate an updated table as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious delays in having eye testing carried out in the north Cork area for medical card holders; if he will have arrangements made to investigate this matter; when two patients (details supplied) in County Cork will be called for testing; and if he will ensure that alternative accommodation be secured for eye testing and other such services when health clinics are not available for whatever reason.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>
        <b>):</b> The provision of eye testing to eligible persons in the north Cork area is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I understand from the health board that the waiting period for the north Cork area for eye testing is about seven months.  In the case of the two persons named by the Deputy I understand these persons are due to be called for testing in February 1997 at the Mitchelstown ophthalmic clinic.</P>
      <P>When a health board clinic is not available for whatever reason the board makes alternative arrangements whenever possible.  In the case of Mitchelstown ophthalmic clinic the position is that this clinic was suspended from February to August 1996 due to the building of an extension and it was not possible for the board to make alternative arrangements.  However, the board is arranging additional ophthalmic clinics to clear the backlog arising from the temporary closure.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that the grave need for this project had been recognised by successive Governments for many years and I am pleased that it was finally brought to fruition during my term of office.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that some 5,485 group water schemes, about 60 per cent of them sourced from public water supply systems, have been constructed or are under construction since the programme was introduced over 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ongoing rationalisation and amalgamation of schemes, including integration into regional water supply network, has resulted in fewer schemes continuing to operate as independent, privately-run group schemes.  In addition, individual schemes will have taken on new members since their construction.  Information on the number of households now supplied from publicly sourced <Col N="404" /> group water schemes, is not, therefore, available in my Department.</P>

      <P>At present there is one psychologist from my Department's psychological service assigned for second level schools in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>As part of the policy outlined in the White Paper on Education it is stated that the psychological service for schools will be expanded.  It is envisaged that the provision of this service will be a function of the proposed education boards.  In the light of this policy statement it is clear that it is accepted that an increase in the availability of psychological services to schools would be beneficial.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service was expanded substantially in 1995, when ten additional psychologists were recruited.  These psychologists were assigned to primary schools with priority given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  When further development becomes possible the needs of children, and of schools, in various areas, including County Donegal, will be borne in mind.</P>

In this particular case, my Department's inspectorate has endeavoured, by a process of consultation with school management and the child's parents, to have the pupil placed in a school where the normal examination syllabus is followed.  While these efforts have not secured a placement in the school of her choice, nevertheless, a suitable placement is available to her in a school in her locality and this has been communicated to the family in question.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that on the 3 of October, 1996 the Garda carried out a search of the offices of a firm of solicitors, in accordance with law as provided for under Section 64 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The inference by Deputy O'Malley that the Garda were responsible for the presence of the media at the relevant time is not sustainable.  The Commissioner is satisfied that the search was conducted in a professional and competent manner. He did not authorise the release of any information on this matter to the media and he does not accept that officers of the Garda Síochána released such information either.  To have done so would have been totally contrary to the established policy of preserving the anomymity of persons affected by these searches.  It is not proposed to have any inquiry into the matter.</P>

      <P>Control activity is a continuing feature of my Department's day to day work.  An enhanced programme of systematic controls in the unemployment payments area has recently been introduced to ensure that only those who are genuinely eligible to receive social welfare payments do so.  Under the current programme all new claims for social welfare are carefully scrutinised to ensure that claimants understand their obligations, that they provide full and accurate information <Col N="411" /> on their circumstances including their abode and that they are aware of the employment support services available; Social Welfare local officers are currently engaged in a major campaign to verify the recorded addresses of all customers in receipt of an unemployment payment. This initiative entails issuing a mailshot to all live register claimants and the programme includes interviews and home visitations where appropriate. Full use is being made of the register of electors and other records in an effort to identify instances of possible abuse.</P>
      <P>Steps are being taken to ensure that addresses will be kept up to date in the future by placing a greater emphasis on this at signing stage and by reminding customers in various ways, including the use of posters in local offices of the need to keep the Department informed if they move address.</P>
      <P>The integration of the unemployment payments and supplementary welfare allowance systems currently under way will also contribute to an improved address data base.</P>
      <P>These controls apply generally to all persons on the live register.  Special attention is also applied to certain categories because of their particular circumstances and the possibilities for abuse.</P>
      <P>I am determined to tackle fraud and abuse of the social welfare system effectively and I am satisfied that the measures now being put in place will significantly reduce the opportunities for such abuse.</P>

      <P>An Post is currently the principal agency through which payments are delivered to Social Welfare customers.  Each week An Post delivers on average about 790,000 weekly and 424,000 monthly payments with a total value of £61.1 million to Social Welfare customers.</P>
      <P>In recent years my Department has introduced a number of new payment methods and options for Social Welfare customers.  My intention is to continue this process to ensure that the most modern and the widest range of payment methods are available to Social Welfare customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal change was the introduction of an electronic funds transfer facility which enables payments to be made by direct credit to personal accounts at banks and certain other financial institutions including An Post.  This is available across a number of social welfare schemes, including child benefit, pensions, unemployment and sickness schemes.  Currently some 95,200 people are availing of this option and some 25 per cent of all new child benefit and 16 per cent of all <Col N="412" /> new pensions customers opt for this method of payment.</P>
    <P>New technologies and &ldquo;cashless&rdquo; money transmission facilities which are now coming on stream are being examined by my Department with a view to expanding further the range of payment methods and facilities from which customers may choose according to their personal needs and preferences.</P>

These include: urban and village renewal and tourism &mdash; using European Regional Development Fund Funds; village renewal and tourism &mdash; EAGGF funds; community-led development &mdash; using European Regional Development Fund funds; and co-operation between public bodies &mdash; using European Regional Development Fund and ESF funds.  In addition, the productive investment and industrial development measure includes a scheme for providing subsidised loans for which tourism projects are also eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace and reconciliation programme places a particular emphasis on a bottom-up <Col N="414" /> approach to development.  Under the terms of the programme, the work of initiating and approving projects for grant assistance is carried out at local level by the county council-led task forces &mdash; in the case of the urban and rural regeneration measures &mdash; and by the specially appointed intermediary bodies, ADM Limited and the Combat Poverty Agency &mdash; in the case of the community-led development measure.  The role of my Department is limited to simply responding to requests from these bodies to confirm that projects under consideration for assistance conform with overall tourism policy.</P>
    <P>On the interest subsidy scheme, I am advised by the Department of Finance, who are responsible for its implementation, that the scheme is now fully subscribed and that a significant number of the projects approved to date are in the tourism sector.</P>

      <P>Proposals by the Minister of State with special responsibility for commerce, science and technology for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which dates in some cases from 1893, are well advanced.  The scope of the Bill has necessarily required detailed attention on the part of both my Department and the Attorney General's Office.  However, I am pleased to be able to say that a first draft of the Bill, which involves up to 200 sections, has been received from the Parliamentary Draftsman, and it is presently being examined in detail by my Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of credit unions.  The text of the Bill will be finalised in consultation with the Parliamentary Draftsman in the coming weeks, after which Government approval will be sought.</P>
      <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions have been part of the consultative process which led to the preparation of the Credit Union Bill.  They have made representations to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and to my Department on a number of occasions about matters of concern to the credit union movement.</P>
      <P>The Credit Union Bill is this Department's priority for legislative action, and while I am not able to give a precise date for publication at present, I can assure Deputies that every effort is being made to have the Bill published as quickly as possible in order that it can be considered during the current Dáil session.</P>

      <P>Cattle prices in Ireland have stabilised during the last few weeks.  I am hopeful of a gradual improvement over the coming months as prices on the Continent improve in response to a modest recovery in beef consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> The measures adopted by the Government and the European Commission have made a substantial contribution towards relieving the worst elements of the crisis.  Intervention purchasing has played a major role in stabilising the market. The EU Commission has responded to my request to improve the effectiveness of the intervention mechanism.  It has increased the weight limit, added to the list of eligible grades, increased the processors margin and increased the ceiling on purchases allowed into intervention.</P>
    <P>In addition I have negotiated a very substantial compensation package worth over £70 million which has now been paid to producers.  This will go a long way towards alleviating the losses suffered by producers.  The deseasonalisation slaughtér premium which is worth £16 million will also continue in 1997 and will be of major importance in underpinning the incomes of winter fatteners.</P>
    <P>Export refunds were also increased and these have given Irish processors a competitive edge on international markets as is evidenced by the high level of exports from this country.  The Government continues to work assiduously to ensure that all markets are opened to our product.  Last month I launched a national campaign of beef promotion on behalf of An Bord Bia.  The new measures which I announced recently relating to identification of animals at slaughter plants and export points will provide greater assurances to consumers and customers and should be a major help in promoting our beef on all markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The submission to the EU Commission on reclassification resulted from recommendations made by the Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel.  This submission was lodged with the Commission in October 1994 and the appeals panel's recommendations were approved without change in October 1995.</P>
      <P>The following criteria for selection of areas in reclassification were agreed between the appeal panel, the farming organisations and the Department: the income of an area must not exceed 60 per cent of the national average income; the land quality must not exceed four on the land assessment scale of 0 to 9; and the area must form an homogenous block and be contiguous to an existing more severely handicapped area or if not contiguous, form an homogenous block of at least 15,000 hectares.  It was also agreed that data gathered in a farm survey in 1989, which had been used for the fourth review, would again be used for the reclassification exercise.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that while a member state can set the criteria by which areas are identified as suffering a higher degree of handicap than others, EU Commission approval is required before these areas can be reclassified.  The Commission must be satisfied that these criteria accurately identify such areas and that the areas meet the criteria before they will approve requests for reclassification.</P>
      <P>The Castlecomer Plateau is a non-contiguous &ldquo;island&rdquo; area, and the appeals panel examined each townland, building up a block which exceeded the 15,000 hectare minimum while satisfying the criteria.  They stopped when they reached the point at which the addition of any more townlands would have caused one or more of the criteria to be exceeded.</P>
      <P>All the townlands named above, with the exception of Smithstown, were omitted from the submission on reclassification because they exceeded the land quality limit of four.  Smithstown was omitted because, although it satisfied the criteria, it was separated from the proposed reclassification boundary by townlands which did not satisfy the criteria.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement of details of the newly reclassified areas, I stated that any individual or group who wanted an explanation for the omission of their area could contact my Department. I suggested this because I realised that some of those who had appealed would not require such explanations, while others had already sought and received this information.  To contact everyone whose area had not been successful would have been both time consuming and would have resulted in a high level of unnecessary duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> A general inquiry was received relating to the Castlecomer area in January 1996 and in my reply I stated that, on receipt of specifically named townlands, I would provide further information. Another inquiry was received in July 1996 relating to four of the above townlands and a reply was issued.  Finally, officials of my Department had a meeting with local farmers in August 1996 at which the full procedure used by the appeals panel was explained, together with the specific reasons for the omission of all the townlands in question.</P>
    <P>The land quality assessment is a rating given to each townland to indicate the stock-carrying potential of the land.  The townlands were assessed by professional officers of my Department in conjunction with the 1989 farm survey and the assessment involved a visual examination of each townland from various points.  The rating was based on the officer's judgment both as a professional and from long experience of working with land.  Scientific soil analysis did not form part of this assessment exercise.</P>
    <P>The stock-carrying capacity of these areas was not an issue for reclassification, since it can be assumed that because these townlands are already designated as less severly handicapped areas they satisfy the stock density criterion.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the desirability of co-location/sharing on telecommunications masts generally and indeed my colleague the Minister for the Environment has recently published guidelines for planning authorities in which this is encouraged.  I have made my views on the matter known to all State bodies under my aegis and other telecommunications operators that have suitable sites and infrastructure and I have also requested my colleague the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to bring these views to the attention of RTE.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the question of where and under what conditions sharing takes place must be, in the first instance, a matter for the parties concerned.  If difficulties arise in practice about this, the telecommunications and radio regulatory division of my Department is ready to provide assistance.</P>

      <Quest>when the environmental impact study for the new port project at Tom Roe's Point and the dredging operation of the River Boyne by the Drogheda Port Authority was received by his Department; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the 1997 salmon net fishing season commences on 12 February 1997, hence the importance of completing the dredging contract work before this date; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that any further delays in the work commencing will result in the net fishermen's livelihood being interfered with, which could lead to a serious claim for compensation; when he will sanction the contract works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The environmental impact statement relating to the proposed port development at Drogheda was forwarded by Drogheda Harbour Commissioners to the Department of the Marine on 29 July 1996. The commissioners are seeking foreshore licences for dredging and also for dumping of dredged spoil.  The EIS has been considered by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, consisting of technical experts from the Department of the Marine Institute, and the Department's detailed response to the EIS will be issued shortly to Drogheda Harbour Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The effects which the proposed dredging will have on existing fisheries mainly shellfish and salmon is a key issue and the Department has requested the views of Drogheda Harbour Commissioners on this important matter.  As is normal practice, any foreshore licence which might be granted would contain conditions setting times and methods of working to minimise interference with and adverse impact on fisheries and other facets of the marine environment.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the issue of sanctioning the contract works in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 309 of 15 October 1996.</P>
