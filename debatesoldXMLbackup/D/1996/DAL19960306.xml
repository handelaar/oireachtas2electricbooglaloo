I thought the Minister for Justice would have taken the opportunity to correct the record.  As the Taoiseach knows the Dáil was misled and through the Dáil the public was misled on this matter.

What arrangements will the Government enter into to ensure the public will have an adequate opportunity to be properly briefed in regard to these proposals, if the Minister is not prepared to offer a prior discussion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond now to Deputy Molloy.  The position in regard to this matter, which I think is in order on the Order of Business, is one that was set out in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.  He explained then &mdash; and I am now paraphrasing on this occasion &mdash; that the heads of the Finance Bill, prior to detailed drafting, would be made available earlier than Finance Bill details <Col N="1477" /> have previously been made available in order to allow members of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to be briefed in preparation for the Finance Bill debate by the relevant interests who might be concerned about technical aspects of particular proposals. This was to avoid the situation where, in the past, because of pressure of work on the drafting section of the Revenue Commissioners, particular items of legislation and amendments thereto might not come before the relevant committee of the House until rather later in the day, thereby depriving members of the public who are interested and members of the committee who are concerned, of the opportunity of studying adequately the issues underlying individual proposals in the Finance Bill.  The Minister's proposal this year, which is an experimental one but one that I believe will be repeated in future years because it is a good idea, is to bring this forward early.  It is appropriate that any interest group that is concerned &mdash; I have no doubt there are many &mdash; should make their concerns known to the Minister for Finance but also, most importantly, in view of the fact that this is legislation which will be approved by this House, to make their views known to all members of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  All members of that committee should receive from any interest groups concerned about these matters full briefing on their questions and concerns so that the Minister can deal with these as fully as he intends to in the most timely fashion and with the maximum degree of preparation.  The new arrangements being made this year are a big improvement on those that have existed for many years.  I hope when Deputy Molloy sees them in operation he will be appreciative of them.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Convention on Biological Diversity done at Rio de Janeiro in June, 1992, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 9th day of February, 1996.</P>
      <P>Tá fíor-áthas orm an chaoi seo a bheith agam an coinbhinsiún seo a thabhairt faoi bhráid na Dála.  Tá suim faoi leith agam le blianta fada an fhiadhúlra agus tuigim a thábhachtaí is atá sé an ilíocht bitheolaíochta a chaomhnú.  Bhí an t-ádh orm bheith i láthair i 1992 ag an gComhdháil Domhanda i Rio faoi choimirce na Náisiúin Aontaithe, áit ar pléadh cúrsaí timpeallachta agus forbartha. Is mór an onóir dom mar sin an coinbhinsiún seo a mholadh don Dáil.</P>
      <P>The convention was signed on behalf of Ireland on the occasion of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.  The formal purpose of today's debate is to comply with Article 29 of the Constitution which requires Dáil approval to international conventions which involve a charge on public funds.  This approval will allow us to proceed to ratification of this important global convention.</P>
      <P>When the United Nations General Assembly decided in 1989 to convene a major conference in 1992 in Brazil on global environment concerns, the conservation of biological diversity was identified as one of the main issues to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Biological diversity is defined as the variety of all animals, plants and micro-organisms and the ecological complexes of which they are part.  It is the source of all food, much raw materials and genetic resources for agriculture, medicine and <Col N="1482" /> development generally.  The significance of the Rio conference was that it brought together, perhaps for the first time, the two major themes of environment and development.</P>
    <P>The convention provides the medium through which the global environment can be safeguarded from further degradation while allowing for the use of its biological resources in an environmentally sound and sustainable way.</P>
    <P>The main aims of the convention as set out in Article 1 are the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilisation of genetic resources. It provides for access to genetic resources and for the transfer of relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies and provides for appropriate funding to be supplied by the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>It also has as its aim the development of national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and for the integration of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into relevant sectoral and cross-sectoral plans, programmes and policies.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Rio conference there was a number of conventions concerned with either the conservation of nature in particular regions of the world or with the protection of particular types of habitat or wildlife.  For instance, Ireland has ratified the Berne Convention which aims to protect biodiversity in Europe, the Ramsar Convention which is concerned with wetlands and Bonn Convention which seeks to protect migratory species of animals.  The Convention on Biological Diversity represents a landmark in the area of environment and development because, for the first time, a comprehensive rather than a sectoral approach to the conservation of the earth's biodiversity and the sustainable use of biological resources is adopted.  It recognises that both biodiversity and biological resources should be <Col N="1483" /> conserved for reasons of ethics, economic benefit and human survival.  It embodies the concept of &ldquo;sustainable use&rdquo;, the principal concept used in Rio, which means the use of components of biological diversity in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of present and future generations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased incidentally that the convention recognises the role women play in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and affirms the need for full participation of women at all levels of policy-making and implementation of biological diversity conservation.</P>
    <P>Achievement of the conservation of biological diversity will be a progressive process, which must not be overly delayed, the success of which is dependent upon national and international compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the convention's provisions.</P>
    <P>The convention recognises the sovereign rights of all nations to regulate access to genetic resources but requires that countries facilitate access to other convention parties.  Countries are, therefore empowered to adopt legislation to stem the unchecked and uncompensated flow of genetic material out of the country but are not entitled to deny access altogether, except in accordance with needs for protection of the resources themselves.</P>
    <P>Around the world countries are seeking to develop innovative mechanisms to regulate access.  I am aware of a proposal by the Andean Pact countries to introduce a mechanism which would regulate trade in genetic material which would respect the rights of indigenous peoples and so ensure an equitable sharing of benefits.  The experience of the Andean Pact is, however, unique being the first welcome attempt by a regional economic union, rich in biological diversity, to deal with national, regional, individual and shared interests under a common regime.  Considering the fact that <Col N="1484" /> many resources of the region are common to more than one of the pact countries and that the free exchange of associated knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous, Afro-American and local communities across frontiers has been going on for centuries makes this a pragmatic as well as an innovative decision.</P>
    <P>This convention calls upon Governments to maintain and promote the use of the innovations, practices and knowledge of indigenous peoples relevant for the conservation or sustainable use of biological diversity with their approval and involvement.  This is an implicit recognition of a property right of indigenous peoples over such knowledge. It also calls for fair and equitable participation by indigenous and local communities in benefits derived from the use of their knowledge, innovations and practices.</P>
    <P>Within the Andean Pact it is widely accepted that indigenous and local communities knowledge, innovations and practices are directly linked to the genetic resources to which they relate and, consequently, that access to genetic resources also implies access to this knowledge.</P>
    <P>The aims of the convention are to be achieved by three distinct approaches to be adopted by the contracting parties. First, by the development of national strategies, plans and programmes. These will require <i>in-situ</i> conservation measures, both inside and outside protected areas, and <i>ex-situ</i> measures principally to complement in <i>in-situ</i> measures to conserve ecosystems, habitats, species and genetic resoures.  These strategic, plans and programmes must also provide for the integration of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into relevant sectoral and cross-sectoral plans, programmes and policies.  It will be seen, therefore, that the provisions of this convention must be taken into account in planning for all areas of economic life.</P>
    <P>Second, the convention covers issues of access and use of genetic resources, technology transfer and biosafety. <Col N="1485" /> Under the convention a Protocol on biosafety is being considered, and would involve regulating and controlling the risk associated with the use and release of living modified organisms from biotechnology which are likely to have adverse environmental impacts that could affect the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity taking into account the risks to human health.</P>
    <P>Third, by the provision of additional funding to meet the agreed full incremental cost incurred by developing countries.  Access to and transfer of technology is to be facilitated under fair and most favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>The strategies, plans and programmes necessary to implement the convention are being developed by Ireland in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and of various international conventions and EU directives which this country has ratified. However, the need to draw all these strategies and plans into one coherent plan has been recognised and I am pleased to inform the House that this plan is being prepared in my Department at present.  This plan will take account of the requirements of sectoral and cross-sectoral integration and will make specific recommendations for national action to conserve biological diversity and to sustainably use its components. As the convention covers many varying aspects of public policy, I am setting up a steering committee, representative of the relevant Government Departments, to oversee and implement this action plan.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has made regulations providing for various procedural matters in relation to the contained use, deliberate release and placing on the market of genetically modified organisms.</P>
    <P>Article 16 of the convention which provides for access to and transfer of technology has presented a difficulty for some countries, including Ireland. There has been some debate as to the <Col N="1486" /> precise requirements of this article.  The guide to the convention states that the obligation each contracting party undertakes is not the outright transfer of technology which makes use of genetic resources.  Rather, it is to create a framework permitting technology transfer to take place &mdash; in this case the transfer of technology making use of resources to the contracting parties providing the genetic resources used.</P>
    <P>However, it stresses the particular obligation towards developing country parties which provide genetic resources. In view of this, and on the advice of the Attorney General, I have decided to adopt the European Union's position and to make a declaration when lodging the instrument of ratification so as to clarify this country's position in regard to this matter.  Essentially the declaration confirms that it is Ireland's understanding that any transfer of technology that will take place between Irish operators and developing countries will be voluntary in nature and will respect the principles and rules of intellectual property rights.  The declaration, <i>inter alia,</i> encourages the use of the financial mechanism established by the convention to promote the voluntary transfer of intellectual property rights held by Irish operators, in particular as regards the granting of licences, through normal commercial mechanisms and decisions, while ensuring adequate and effective protection of property rights.</P>
    <P>The convention provides for a mechanism to provide financial resources on a grant or concessional basis to developing countries.  The Global Environment Facility has been entrusted on an interim basis with the operation of this financial mechanism.  The Global Environment Facility was established in 1990 to provide grants to developing countries for projects aimed at protecting the global environment in ways that are consistent with their national development goals.  Following a three year pilot phase, the Global Environment Facility has been restructured. At the second meeting of the contracting parties to this convention in <Col N="1487" /> November last, it was decided that the restructured Global Environment Facility should continue to serve as the institutional structure to operate the financial mechanism pending the establishment of a permanent structure by the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>The scale of contributions adopted at the second meeting of the contracting parties is based on the United Nations scale of assessments, which in Ireland's case is .18 per cent of the annual cost. The cost to Ireland in 1996 will be in the region of £12,000 per annum.  The Government authorised in June 1992 that the cost of complying with the convention would be met from the allocation for Official Development Assistance.</P>
    <P>The motion comes before the House because of the requirements of Article 29, sub-article 5.2 of the Constitution under which the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I strongly recommend that Dáil Éireann ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity.  In Government, Fianna Fáil took an active part in the Rio Summit which led to this convention and other important measures.</P>
      <P>Ireland's participation in the policies of the global environment, however, predate the Rio process.  Under the last Irish Presidency of the European Union, the Dublin Declaration on the Environment was negotiated and signed.  That historic agreement committed EU member states to the principle of a shared responsibility among countries for the world environment.  It further committed the EU to solidarity with the developing world and stressed that action, to be meaningful, must be now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ratification of this convention is a valuable step forward in the process of all countries accepting a communal <Col N="1488" /> responsibility for the global environment. Recent years have witnessed a growing awareness of the fragility of our environment.  Global consumption and the manufacture involved to satisfy that consumption are the chief pressures on the environment.  Overwhelmingly, the consumption is in the wealthy industrialised north while the worst of the environmental degradation is confined to the Third World.  This convention seeks to deal with the effects of pollution of various kinds.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the broader picture, however.  World patterns of trade and finance are at the root of environmental problems.  Last November, as my party's spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, I published Fianna Fáil's position paper on my remit entitled, &ldquo;Our Place in the World&rdquo;.  In that document, the party set out its world view.  Prominent among the national policy concerns expressed was the global environment.  Fianna Fáil's starting position is that no foreign policy can credibly ignore the living conditions of most of the world's population.</P>
    <P>We live in a world where 1.7 billion people have no access to proper sanitation and where 170 million people in urban areas lack a clean drinking water source close to home.  In rural areas, that number is 855 million people.  In Latin America, less than 2 per cent of all sewage is treated.  Conversely, and hugely exceeding all aid given to it, Latin America pays £50 billion a year in debt repayments.  Huge populations, often only subsisting and sometimes starving, are exerting a devastating pressure on the environment and the species that depend on it.  It is only right that we are critical.  We have absolutely no room, however, to be censorious.</P>
    <P>The reason the rainforest is disappearing is because Ireland and other developing countries insist on having huge chunks of it parked in our homes and offices.  Our consumption patterns are driving entire species out of existence. This convention seeks to implement part of a wider strategy for sustainable development.  We are all <Col N="1489" /> familiar, through the media, with the problems facing exotic animals in Africa and elsewhere.  The key to a meaningful role for Ireland in saving the rainforest or wildlife is economic.</P>
    <P>As a member state of the European Union, we are in a disproportional powerful position to influence the terms of world trade and finance.  In the last round of GATT, Fianna Fáil in Government signed up for a major loosening up of trade terms with the developing world.  We were considerably criticised for doing this by some special interest groups.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil remains convinced that ultimately, sustainable development on a global scale can best be instituted by free and fair trade.  Until developing countries pull out of the destructive cycle of exploitation of primary resources, the problems that this convention seeks to tackle will remain.  Our contribution to global biodiversity must, in the main, be confined to influencing macroeconomic trends.  Fianna Fáil's position paper on Foreign Affairs has clearly set out its intention to work with the other forward looking countries in developing the global economy on a sustainable basis.</P>
    <P>Biodiversity is not intrinsically a Third World issue.  When we are told that species numbers have declined by over 90 per cent in many cases, we might well associate such figures with the destruction of the rainforest.  That is not so.  Those figures tell the story of an appalling decimation of Irish wildlife species over the past two decades.  Studies carried out by the Irish Wildlife Conservancy show the extent of the problem in Ireland.  The numbers of some species have declined by up to 96 per cent. Ireland has nothing like the range of wildlife in most tropical countries.  Correspondingly, each species must be much more precious to us.  We are at risk of going down as the generation that destroyed an irreplaceable part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The lofty sentiments of the Government in posturing on the world stage about saving the whale are not followed <Col N="1490" /> up by any meaningful action at home in relation to our own wildlife problems. Important regulations which Ireland was bound to have in place over one year ago have not yet to be introduced. Under EU agreements, Ireland is obliged to introduce special areas of conservation.  Although the legislation has been written the Minister responsible, Deputy Higgins, who I am glad is present in the House, has not approved its publication.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this convention for ratification before it has put its own house in order the Government is being grossly hypocritical.  There is a biological diversity crisis in Ireland.  The Government has had the natural habitat regulations drawn up for months and still will not move.  These regulations will, if the Government ever brings them forward, protect a small number of sites of particular national importance.</P>
    <P>Far more damaging for biodiversity is the financial crisis in the rural environmental protection scheme.  Under this scheme, which is 75 per cent EU funded, farmers are paid on an acreage basis to conform with eco-friendly farming. The allocation of £42 million in the budget, 75 per cent of which has come from the EU, is less than half what is required to fund the 14,000 applicants who want to join.</P>
    <P>A series of limitations on payments recently introduced may save the Government the embarrassment of having the scheme fall apart but will, effectively, retard the scheme.  An emasculated scheme will do nothing to ensure that species and flora threatened by extensive agriculture will survive.  Our vanishing wildlife species may not have the fame or cachet of a blue whale or snow leopard, but right now many indigenous species once common all over Ireland are in more immediate danger than their more exotic cousins.</P>
    <P>The danger to our wildlife is nowhere more present than in the Irish Sea.  The disaster of the <i>Sea Empress</i> demonstrates the awful biological carnage which can result on our shipping lanes. <Col N="1491" /> Vast areas of the Welsh coast have been destroyed, perhaps for decades.  No area demonstrates more clearly the cavalier and opportunistic approach taken by the Government to the environment.</P>
    <P>Last November, amid huge media coverage, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, announced that his efforts had secured a special meeting of the International Maritime Organisation to discuss the code governing the transport of irradiated nuclear fuels.  I congratulate him for this.  This was to be Ireland's chance to secure safeguards on the transport of nuclear fuels in the Irish Sea.  This is an important issue, but the problem is that the meeting which started on Monday finishes today and the Minister of State failed to show up. He left the field to his British counterpart, Viscount Goschen.  Given the threat posed to this country and the Irish Sea by Windscale-Sellafield the British interests do not coincide with ours.  It is a disgrace that the Minister of State was not present.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Government prefers to preach on what should be done thousands of miles from home rather than face home truths.  I reject what is, at best, an opportunistic and, at worst, a dishonest policy.  I want the same policy standards applied to this issue of biodiversity at home as the Government is so eager to see applied abroad.</P>
    <P>Let us ratify the convention on biological diversity today and also proceed with the implementation of the special areas of convention.  Most importantly of all, if we are to make an impact on the problems surrounding biodiversity in Ireland, the Government must kick start the REP scheme again.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to have a short debate on this important issue.  I strongly recommend that Dáil Éireann ratify the convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly happy to support the motion that the convention be ratified, but do not think it will make much difference either to us or <Col N="1492" /> anybody else throughout the world when ratified.  Looking through it, there is no enforceability, it is full of precatory statements and admirable desires that we would all like to fulfil in the same way as we all support motherhood, apple pie, democracy and all the other beautiful concepts in the world.</P>
      <P>What struck me about the Minister's speech, which was full of technical jargon, was that he succeeded in delivering it with the same passion as a speech on the arts.  It was a feat to deliver it in the tone of voice he usually reserves for an appropriate stage.  This suggests, perhaps, that he has a public speaking persona&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a compliment coming from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which he is not able to adapt when dealing with the somewhat drier concepts of this convention.</P>
      <P>The convention refers to the need to support Third World countries encountering difficulties in sustaining their environment and natural habitats.  That is a commendable objective, but, as Deputy Burke said, it is hypocritical for us to be concerned about Africa when we succeed in destroying much of our own natural habitat and do not seem to do much to stop it.</P>
      <P>In the past few days I saw a list of ten birds and animals which were common in Ireland 20 to 30 years ago and are now on the verge of extinction, most, if not all, because of the change in agricultural practices.  The only way to offset this is through the REPS which, unfortunately, has run into great difficulties where finance is concerned.  This is the subject of many questions at Agriculture Question Time.  There are huge arrears of payments due to thousands of farmers throughout the country.  Many farmers who joined in good faith have not received the grants to which they are entitled.  As a result there is a danger the scheme will collapse.  If it is not implemented properly, biological diversity will be seriously damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Parts of the country, particularly in the west, have a unique biological diversity. Our efforts to support them have been mixed and limited.  The prime example is the Burren.  The Minister seems to be coming up with what we are told is a solution agreeable to all parties. I have heard this before.  I would like to see the Burren left as nature created and developed it.  I do not know why this cannot be done.  Other parts of the west &mdash; Connemara, Kerry and Donegal &mdash; are also progressively being interfered with unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>This is one of the least densely populated countries in Europe.  That this country is so sparsely populated by comparison with the land area under our jurisdiction should mean that we should carefully plan the protection of these large areas of natural habitat.</P>
    <P>Flying at low level or by helicopter over most western European countries, one of the noticeable features, if one is in any way observant, is the small village clusters in the countryside and the virtual absence of buildings outside those village clusters.  On the other hand, flying at low level over Ireland one would notice how small and straggling the villages are, the ribbon development and the number of individual houses built all over the place.  Our planning laws and policies in this area have failed.  We have interfered unnecessarily with the countryside and the natural habitat of many species.  While officially frowned on, this element or ribbon development is rampant and it is only when viewed from the air that one realises the damage it is causing.  It does not make sense from a conservation, biological, traffic, safety or environmental point of view. The extraordinary anxiety of Irish people to want to live all over the place, rather than in the manner in which most European citizens live, is causing great damage and, consequently, we are rapidly losing the advantage that could be gained from our sparse population.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with the medical aspects of genetic resources. While this is not the primary function of the convention, it is a very sensitive <Col N="1494" /> matter.  Spectacular developments in this field will take place in the next few decades.  In expressing concern that particular species of plants and animals may become extinct, we must also face the prospect of new species being created by man which will raise many ethical as well as biological questions. We are on the threshold of many new developments but we should not stumble into them.  We should think through our approach to developments that are possible for this generation to achieve but which were not possible for the countless generations before us.  It is more incumbent on us than on previous generations to get matters right.  Even with the worst will in the world, there was a limit to the extent to which previous generations could damage the environment and natural habitats, but there is almost no limit to the extent to which this and the next generation could do so.</P>
    <P>In drafting, signing and ratifying international conventions which are important to the future of mankind and this planet, every effort should be made to have a greater degree of enforceability and not simply consider them a litany of wishful thoughts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to support the motion.  It is obvious from the wide-ranging issues addressed by the three previous speakers that this matter, although it may appear esoteric, touches on fundamental questions that relate to the use of our environment at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the impact of this convention on developing countries.  Deputy O'Malley correctly referred to the fact that these conventions tend to opt for the lowest common denominator rather than the highest common factor.  When operating on an international level it is important to grasp every opportunity, irrespective of how weak it may appear, to advance the principles contained in the convention. For that reason, we should support ratification of the convention and seek <Col N="1495" /> to improve it, particularly as regards developing countries and enforcement.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Rio conference and subsequently there was a great deal of debate about large international chemical companies going into developing countries and taking materials, traditional cures and other resources for their massive economic benefit, frequently at the expense of the indigenous population. On the other hand, a strong lobby group argued that such indigenous populations should have property rights over those types of resources.  I am pleased the Minister addressed this issue and I was particularly interested in his reference to the work of the Andean Pact countries, which we should support. I am also pleased that in lodging the Instrument of Ratification it will be confirmed that it is Ireland's understanding that any transfer of technology between Irish operators and developing countries will be voluntary in nature and respect the principles and rules of intellectual property rights.  As an individual State or a member of the European Union we should grasp any opportunity afforded us to strengthen this aspect of the convention.</P>
    <P>There is a paradox in this type of convention. We have forced an exploitative model of development on Third World countries which causes the destruction of habitats, over harvesting, pollution and in some cases the introduction of foreign plants and animals.  We claim to have learned from our mistakes but enforce our solutions on the Third World.  In other words, we will continue to reap the benefits of that development model but not allow the Third World to do likewise.  This is causing great tension between north and south of the globe. From a position of massive comparative advantage built up through a particular development model, we are limiting the ability of developing countries to develop and provide for the social and economic well-being of their people. There is an element of hypocrisy in this. Of course, we should learn from mistakes but we should not force solutions <Col N="1496" /> on the Third World countries which we are not prepared to adopt.  The provision in the convention to financially assist developing countries should be strengthened.  Most of the world's biological diversity is located in developing countries.  They cannot be expected to carry the full cost which conservation, sustainable development and compliance with this convention will entail. This fund, therefore, is being set up through the global environment facility which is supposed to provide developing countries with the additional finance which compliance with this convention will require.</P>
    <P>Our initial contribution has been assessed by the United Nations at £12,000.  That will not do much for anybody. It is calculated as our statutory contribution, as it were, and is to be paid from the overseas development assistance budget.  With the massive increase in the overseas aid budget in recent years we have seen decisions by the Government to make additional voluntary contributions to such funds and I urge the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make the maximum possible contribution from our overseas development budget to this global environment facility.  Otherwise we will condone the paradoxical elements of this convention whereby we are imposing burdens in a pharisaical fashion on many developing countries but we are not prepared to life a finger to support them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to introduce a coherent plan to look at the various instruments, strategies and measures being adopted in Ireland to comply with this convention and to meet our international obligations in the area of environmental and wildlife protection, sustainable development and so forth.  It was a little rich to hear Deputy Ray Burke refer to the cavalier efforts of the Government in this area.  For the first time we have a Minister who is trying to ensure that our efforts in this area are anything but cavalier.  I compliment the Minister on his commitment to introduce a coherent plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> I also welcome the fact that his Department is in the process of drafting a new Wildlife Bill.  Many of the obligations which have been imposed on us in this area cannot be met unless there is proper legislation to do so.  I offer as an example the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The sub-committee on development co-operation held a series of hearings last year on this important convention.  The Minister's Department made a presentation in the course of those hearings. The convention limits trade in and movement of endangered species, particularly between the developing and the developed world.  We are already bound by the European Union ratification of the convention but I would like to see Ireland ratify this convention &mdash; CITES &mdash; in its own right.  The Minister has assured me that the convention will be ratified once the new Wildlife Bill is passed and I urge the Minister and his Department to proceed with all speed in bringing that legislation before the House.  The Irish Woodworkers for Africa led by Mr. Tom Roche has made particular efforts to encourage us as legislators in this direction.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ray Burke and Deputy O'Malley on the need to ensure that we support biodiversity at home as well as abroad.  However, REPS is a contentious issue, and not just from a financial point of view.  That scheme was hurriedly introduced prior to the last European election to give farmers another sweetener, as it were, but the implications of the scheme were not thought out properly.  A number of examples could have been looked at &mdash; one in Northern Ireland and two pilot areas in the Republic, in the Slieve Bloom area and the Slyne Head area of Galway.  Lessons that could have been learned from those pilot projects were not learned.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an element of local negotiation being introduced in the REPS.  It has worked in the Burren and it can work in areas such as the Slieve Bloom.  If elements of policy and the content of REPS are addressed rather <Col N="1498" /> than just finance we will have a far better scheme which will help us meet our obligations in this area in a more efficient fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I support this important convention.  The convention is a result of the Rio conference, the most important conference ever held on the world's environment. The debate on our environment has been ongoing for many years and the convention tries to deal with some of the problems that have arisen.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the convention is the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilisation of genetic resources.  It also covers access to genetic resources and the transfer of relevant technologies.  Access to genetic resources is an extremely important part of the convention.  A number of speakers have mentioned our attitude towards the third world.  Access to genetic resources and the transfer of relevant technologies will play a vital part in the future in protecting and cleaning up our environment.</P>
      <P>The general aim of the convention is good.  Conserving our ecosystems comprises such a variety of issues that it is a subject on which one could speak endlessly. Before the Rio conference many of the environmental problems highlighted and much of the environmental work carried out related to one specific mammal or creature, such as the whale, the turtle and other creatures, in addition to varieties of flora and fauna. That was and is important but what we are discussing now is a much wider issue which involves our ecosystems and the diversity of those ecosystems which is so important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers have mentioned environmental problems in Ireland.  There is a problem in Ireland and we cannot ignore our idigenous birds, flora and fauna.  To a certain extent we are hyprocritical in this regard but there is a general understanding <Col N="1499" /> now that these are important parts of our environment and should be protected. As I have told the House on previous occasions, the REPS is extremely important.  The Minister in answering some of my questions has committed himself to the scheme and recognises its importance.  It is an important factor in preserving many species of birds throughout the country and I ask the Minister to ensure that the scheme is maintained and that its problems are resolved.  I represent an urban constituency but I have received many letters and telephone calls outlining concerns about how the scheme is being administered. People believe it is not being run properly and in the meantime some bird species are under threat because of its ineffectiveness.</P>
    <P>The importance of an ecosystem is measured by its diversity.  For example, the ecosystem along the Amazon basin is very complex and survives through its diversity.  If this ecosystem was simple it would die during long droughts or heavy rain falls, but because it is so complex certain organisms come to life during dry periods while others come to life during wet periods, thereby helping other species and parts of the ecosystem to survive.  We have only touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of the diversity and complexity of ecosystems and as we discover more about them we will be able to benefit from them.  It is very important, therefore, to maintain ecosystems as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gallagher that it is hypocritical of us to try to impose very stringent environmental legislation on Third World countries.  They are trying to attain a standard of living similar to ours, yet we tell them they cannot do certain things for various reasons. Nevertheless, it is correct to highlight the importance of the environment and to ensure that aid is not used for purposes which will give rise to an environmental nightmare in the future, as happened in the past.</P>
    <P>One of the best examples of the environmental problems in the Third <Col N="1500" /> World is the destruction caused by oil companies in Nigeria.  We have done nothing about this problem because we want the oil and Nigeria needs the revenue generated by this industry.  When the reserves run out and the oil companies leave the local people will have to clean up this huge mess and live with the damage caused to their environment. This is an area where action should be taken but we have turned a blind eye to it because we need the resource.</P>
    <P>There are many examples which show that people are learning lessons in this area.  When I visited Hong Kong a year and a half ago I was staggered by the level of economic growth achieved by countries in the Pacific rim.  However, in achieving this economic success immense damage was caused to the environment.  While in Hong Kong I visited the most environmentally friendly land fill site I have ever seen.  There were approximately one and a half feet of lime under this enormous dump and all the liquid was put through a treatment plant before being pumped into the bay where the water was almost the same quality as drinking water. Obviously Hong Kong is a very wealthy country but many other countries have also started to realise that they will have to do something about the environment. There has been much controversy about land fill sites but if they were as well run as the one I saw in Hong Kong I believe communities would be only too happy to have them in their areas.</P>
    <P>There is a strong commercial aspect to this issue and as we learn more about the environment we can apply our knowledge to particular problems.  One problem which can be tackled is pollution. The following is the position according to genetic research:</P>
    <P>The successful use of micro-organisms in bioremediation depends on the development of a basic understanding of the genetics of a broad spectrum of micro-organisms, many of them not yet isolated or studied in any detail.  Micro-organisms adapted <Col N="1501" /> to degrade specific pollutants have been found among populations growing naturally at polluted sites. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying specific adaptations are poorly understood.</P>
    <P>In the past, researchers have been unable to conduct genetic studies on these hard-to-culture organisms, but recent developments in molecular biology now make it possible to isolate and study the genes of almost any organism.  Scientists can now analyse genes that govern a wide variety of metabolic processes, including the degradation of environmental pollutants.</P>
    <P>Some companies, for example, Interbio Laboratories Limited, screen bacteria for their ability to break down pollutants, and the convention will be of help to these companies.  It is very important to allow access to technology and genetic resources.  I very much welcome the convention and would like to know if it could be referred to the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development which would have much interest in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the convention which arises from the Rio conference on the conservation of our biological diversity.  While there has been some destruction, we are fortunate that we became aware of the importance of the environment and conservation before too much damage was done.  The same applies in cities in so far as old buildings are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to alert the Minister to practices of which he may not be fully aware. As much of the land in the west is suitable only for forestry, there has been a huge level of afforestation in recent times.  While this is welcome it gives rise to certain difficulties.  I understand that the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are engaged in consultations on the planning permission required for forests.  I would like the Minister to have an input to this issue. <Col N="1502" /> One problem is that only one species of tree, the sitka spruce, is planted and this leads to an imbalance.  There is very little planting of broad leaf species as the land is not suitable for this purpose. Another problem is that in order to maximise income forests are being planted in unacceptable locations, thereby damaging scenery and wildlife habitats and giving rise to knock-on effects.</P>
    <P>Planning permission should be required for all forests, irrespective of their size.  A person who wants to build a porch onto his house has to obtain planning permission, yet no planning permission is required for the planting of a 500 acre forest which can be located in the most scenic of areas.  An effort was made to plant a forest in the only area around Lough Gill from which one could obtain a good view of the Lake Isle of Inisfree, which is famous throughout the world.  Perhaps he will name other lakes in his area which are equally famous when he gets time from his duties as Minister for Arts.  Culture and the Gaeltacht to concentrate on his poetry writing.  As of the moment, the lake isle of Inisfree on Lough Gill is probably more famous than anything on Lough Corrib or the other great lakes in Galway.</P>
    <P>There are good effects of forestry, but heritage areas are being gobbled up by forests.  It is important, therefore, that there should be control.  Naturally, there are vested interests and, probably, conflicting interests between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of the Environment. As a person particularly sensitive in this area, who wants to see a balanced result, the Minister should have an input, and the way to do this is to require that planning permission should be obtained in respect of all forests regardless of their size.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty, not particularly related to what we are discussing now, is that forests can be planted to within 30 metres of a dwelling.  The planting of forests right up to laneways in isolated <Col N="1503" /> parts of the country creates huge difficulties for people living there in that these forests provide ideal cover for criminals casing a house, seeking to commit a burglary or cause injury to the people there.  While I very much welcome and support the convention under discussion which arose out of the Rio conference, I ask the Minister to watch what is happening at home and make sure there are no further difficulties. We have been fortunate in that we have not done very much damage.  However, the potential for damage is there and that potential is now cloaked by the fact that most people think forestry is a good idea.  It is in its proper place, limited and controlled by planning permission.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed.  I very much appreciate the concern expressed on a number of different themes and I hope to take up as many of them as I can in the few minutes available to me.</P>
      <P>The reason I exhibit more than usual interest in this is that I was in Rio in another incarnation making a documentary, and the person who showed the most vitality at that conference was Deputy Harney, whom I interviewed in Rio about these issues.  It was while I was covering the conference that I became interested in a number of these issues in detail.  My memory of that conference and the background to what we are doing today is that there was tension between ecological groups on the one hand, particularly Greenpeace who had a secretariat there, and a group called Business Council for Sustainable Development on the other hand, who were announcing to the world that they had been converted to responsibility in relation to the environment and the balance between the environment and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable for Deputies to say there is a huge gap between enforceable provisions and what we are doing today. In some senses ratification of these agreements is at the rhetorical end <Col N="1504" /> rather than the implementation end. When one thinks back to UNCED and the forces and interests represented there, I remember distinctly there was a possibility that some of the major countries would not turn up.  The approval by the Dáil of today's motion will allow us to proceed with the ratification of the convention at an early date.  It is important that this should be completed before Ireland takes up the Presidency of the European Union in July as we will have the role of co-ordinating European Union policy in the months leading up to and during the third meeting of the parties at Buenos Aires in November this year.  The convention establishes an obligation on us at a national level in terms of planning sectorally and cross-sectorally.  It does not really deal with other matters &mdash; many of the other matters raised are outside the terms of the signing of the convention.  However, I accept that they are all still relevant.</P>
    <P>The latest information we have is that 133 countries have ratified the convention, including all the other European Union countries with the exception of Belgium.  The United States of America has not yet ratified it, and that weakens its effectiveness to some extent.</P>
    <P>I was asked specific questions by Deputies about our international agreements. Since I was given responsibility for heritage, Ireland has ratified the agreement on the conservation of European bats, and we are about to sign the agreement on the protection of African-Eurasian migratory water birds.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to share this information with the small group of enthusiasts who are with me this morning in the wetlands of our concern. We should realise this is not exciting the whole world at the moment, but it is important that we make progress.  I appreciate that on all sides of the House and in all parties there has been an <Col N="1505" /> increased and welcome commitment to issues on which we were perhaps a bit cavalier before.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Nealon that we have done little damage yet.  We have done quite a good deal of damage. I understand his concerns in relation to the integration of our different policies in relation to afforestation.  REPS was mentioned by Deputies Burke and Ryan.  In the area of my responsibilities we have made some progress in having meetings between, for example, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and REPS and farming organisations, and we have reached models which badmix some of the balances.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the number of signatories, but the conservation and effective management of migratory species of wild animals requires the concerted action of all states within the national jurisdiction of boundaries where such species spend any part of their life cycle. The two I mentioned were obligations that we share simply because of the migratory patterns of the species concerned. It is important not only that we care for the species of wildlife and habitats within our own jurisdiction but that we join with other countries in actions to protect them.  The issues with which this convention is concerned are crucial to the future of humankind and of this planet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another memory I have of the atmosphere at this convention was of countries and people who were not directly represented, including some of the Pacific countries.  An issue which has arisen in contributions here today is that some of the actions are in the provenance of multinationals who are not necessarily accountable to any one jurisdiction. There is the impact of an internationalised globalised form of economic activity, and intergovernmental discussions.  Some people are outside the remit even of governmental concerns, for example, some of the Pacific countries and some of the islands, the most controversial of which include <Col N="1506" /> Muraroa and others which were not represented directly.  That was one of the legacies of colonisation in the world.</P>
    <P>The loss of biodiversity is one of the greatest threats of our time.  Biological diversity at all levels, habitats, species and genetic, is being reduced in virtually all parts of the world.  Irreversible losses have already occurred.  Many species have become extinct, and more will follow. Impending extinction rates are likely to be greater than in the past.  The kind of thinking that led to us not only to believe in a single model unilinear development but that it is the only model available to the south countries as well will require considerable revision.  We cannot implement these conventions without changing our assumptions on the balance between economic development and the environment. The convention stems from a recognition of the serious state of the environment and the urgent need to take action.  The conservation of biological diversity cannot wait and ratification of this convention underlines Ireland's commitment to the urgent task of conserving our national and global heritage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised the issue of the designation of national heritage areas. Some say the proportion of the country that will be designated is too high whereas Deputy Burke thinks a small number of sites will be involved.  His support will be appreciated when the areas are designated.  There will not be any undue delay with the legislation which is at an advanced stage.  One of the difficulties any Minister will have in relation to DHAs and SACs is not so much getting over the technical thresholds but making good legislation fit within the constitutional restraints on private property and the balance between it and the public good.</P>

I am delighted Deputy Owen is the Minister for Justice as I have every confidence in her ability to deal with the issue.  If the necessary powers are given to her they will be used widely and she will have the heartfelt thanks of parents, youth leaders and those involved with young people.  Drug barons who have no conscience or scruples prey on those who may be in financial difficulties or are not strong willed.

      <P>He might have had the Minister in mind when he said that over a century ago.  The drugs menace is the greatest threat to society today. The Minister stated in July they were &ldquo;a threat to the very fabric of our society&rdquo; but they were only words to be uttered while action was deferred.</P>
      <P>When I last spoke on this topic in the House I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> I have felt for some time now that the greatest single threat to our society today is that posed by the drugs menace.  So serious is the problem and its disastrous potential for the society in which we live that sometimes I feel we are watching the very disintergration of western civilisation as we know it.</P>
    <P>That phrase caught the eye of the press and I wish it had been said solely for that purpose.  However, so extensive are the tentacles of this monster, so great are the potential fortunes to be garnered and so evil the deeds carried out in the cause of the drugs trade that I have no hesitation in pointing to the drugs problem as the greatest social evil in our midst.  Look at the age group targeted: teenagers in their most vulnerable years and now primary school playgrounds are the haunt of those dealers in death.  Look at the extent of the crime committed to obtain money for drugs. Thousands of addicts need hundreds of pounds per day and that multiplies to frightening amounts.  Consider the implications of that in insurance premiums and payments and the threat to vulnerable members of society who triple lock their doors and see the dawn each morning before they consider it safe to sleep.  That is what is happening in modern Ireland.  The rights of decent people must be given priority.  The figures speak for themselves.  Drugs seizures are up in number and in quantity. I congratulate the Garda and the Customs services on their considerable successes. They are not content to rest on their laurels and each day they renew the fight and their commitment to the elimination of this scourge.</P>
    <P>Drug-related crime now accounts for 80 per cent of all indictable offences. How many more statistics does the Minister need before she acts quickly, decisively and effectively to eliminate this threat from our midst?  A delay of seven months can hardly be called a speedy response.  How many more <Col N="1510" /> reports and submissions does the Minister need before she is given the latitude, the resources and the money by those members of the Cabinet who for unaccountable reasons have starved her Department of the money required to address this scandal in our midst?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House should only be seen as the first attempt or an initial response to the network of criminality behind the drugs scene.  By its nature, it only addresses the trafficking of drugs, the wider issues of drug treatment, the provision of sufficient drug treatment centres, the drug problem in prisons and keeping safe prisoners in the Minister's care.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister stand up with hand on heart and say she is satisfied with the response to drug abuse in our prisons, that there are sufficient programmes to wean prisoners off drugs while in prison and that there are sufficient back-up services for prisoners when they return to the outside world?  Can the Minister confirm that adequate resources are being allocated to the problem?  If she can, then she is easily satisfied.  If not, why has it taken her seven months to present this Bill and still propose no measure to deal with the wider issue of social breakdown as a result of drugs?</P>
      <P>When my party introduced the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the response I received in my constituency confirmed what I already suspected and what was being said to me in my clinics.  The people want action now.  They want not only a response in the area of drug trafficking but a realistic programme of social action which will attack the drugs menace and misery on all fronts.  The danger is that if the problem of illegal <Col N="1511" /> drugs is allowed to go unchecked or if no realistic measures are taken to combat it, it will become a little like the problem of unemployment, that is, there will be plenty of experts to talk about it but nobody to do anything constructive.</P>
      <P>I am on record as saying that I want to empower the Garda to speedily investigate suspected trafficking in and the misuse of controlled substances, to effect speedy entry to premises that are suspected of being used for the illicit drugs trade and to give it additional powers to detain and question suspects as regards drug-related crime.  Does the Minister's Bill measure up to those criteria?</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) sets out the periods of detention, the measures which must be taken and the certification given to keep an arrested person in custody for up to seven days.  This is necessary to allow for proper investigation of drug-related crime, particularly for the search of financial records which may produce incriminating evidence.  Certification needs to be provided by a chief superintendent and in the latter stages the detention must be approved by a judge.  Such proposals for offences of this gravity are realistic and are in line with my party's thinking.  I am glad that adequate safeguards have been built into this section, such as empowering a judge to have an arrested person brought back before the court at any time during the period of detention which he has certified to avoid an abuse of the power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering the question of drug trafficking in any detail we must distinguish between the types of people who deal in drugs.  There are small time operators who first become abusers and are then forced, either by circumstances or by unscrupulous dealers or godfathers, to become dealers.  We must see these people for what they are &mdash; victims of the all-embracing evil of the drugs empire.  I am not suggesting that they should get off scot-free but a court should take into account the manner of their arrival in their predicament and <Col N="1512" /> the nature of the benefit they get from their crime.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that we have not yet provided sufficient places in drug treatment centres for these victims of drugs. It is particularly heartbreaking to see on television or at our weekly clinics mothers crying out for a chance for their child to return to some sort of normal life.  However, they are denied access to proper treatment because not enough places are available.  A place in a medical institution is the least we can offer these people when we may have failed them in another social sphere such as education or welfare or denied them the opportunity to live in decent housing. This is not meant as a justification for their actions&mdash;that would be unfair to the majority who have risen above such handicaps to be model citizens&mdash;it is merely an explanation as to why they may have turned to drugs for solace or a temporary escape from what they perceive as a different type of prison.</P>
    <P>The advent of ecstasy has given the drugs problem a new urgency.  It has brought drug abuse to sections of society which otherwise would not have come in contact with it.  Ecstasy and its image have made drug abuse acceptable to young people who would never get involved with the hard drugs about which they have been warned throughout their young lives.  Along comes this tablet, unspectacular in form, which gives them the type of buzz at an affordable price that they would never get from alcohol.  Added to that, some in a position to influence these young people have at best an ambivalent attitude to drugs such as ecstasy or cannabis.  These people are a menace to society and they do young people no favours by hinting that those drugs should be freely available or saying out loud that they should be legalised.  Worse still, some are in positions where they are seen as role models for our young.  A visit by members of the drugs squad to straighten them out on the facts would not be amiss.</P>
    <P>Those who aid and abet the commission of drug crimes and who give <Col N="1513" /> implicit approval to the use of drugs in dance halls or clubs by shutting off the water supply to make a fast buck from the sale of drinks, including water, can only be described as the scum of the earth masquerading as business people and leisure centre proprietors.  They should feel the full rigours of the law if a case can be made against them.  There can be no reservations about this. Unless the word goes out from this House and from other institutions which can make a contribution to this matter that those who criminally profit from and actively organise the drugs trade will go to prison for a long time, then we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>Those closest to the problem who can see the misery and suffering at first hand, like members of the drug squad and the medical profession who must treat victims, are not in the least ambivalent on the subject &mdash; no drugs, no double-think and no mercy.  Not without reason is ecstasy known as Russian roulette in the medical profession. At some point the user's luck will run out and the consequences will be fatal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health in consultation with the Minister for Justice must devise an effective programme of education and deterrents which will bring home to young people in particular the terrifying consequences and the futility of dabbling in ecstasy and other drugs. The Department of Health is losing the battle against smoking.  It is apparent from any casual observation that while older people are giving up the smoking habit, young people are taking it up in droves despite a reasonably effective no smoking campaign in past decades.  It is the same in the case of litter.  Nearly 40 years after the advent of the tidy towns competition and a comprehensive advertising and educational campaign, we still have very dirty streets.  The fight against drug use must be more successful than those campaigns if we are to achieve any degree of success.  However, results will not be achieved by penny-pinching and procrastination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> The adult population is largely ignorant of the existence of and the threat posed by ecstasy but young people seem to know all about it, except the consequences of its abuse.  We need programmes today &mdash; each day we defer action is another week that we defer the chance of ultimate success.  Any programme of drug information must be realistic, appealing, effective and ongoing to be of use.  It must also carry the unreserved support of the Minister, not only in words but in action and funding.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals in considerable depth with matters relating to re-arrest and the powers of the Garda subject to scrutiny by the courts.  Section 6 allows for the involvement of the Customs and Excise service in questioning suspects. That is a necessary provision to enable the best expertise and widest possible range of information to be available when suspects are questioned.</P>
    <P>However, I wonder if the Minister has a full grasp of the drugs importation problem and a reasonable understanding of the location of most major drug trafficking. The sea route is used for the importation of huge quantities of illegal drugs, as indicated by the large number of drugs finds on the south coast.  Bales of cannabis are regularly trawled by fishing boats or washed ashore on beaches, with the consequent danger that they may fall into the wrong hands.</P>
    <P>Ports are frequently used as a location to offload drugs.  There are two major ports as well as many smaller fishing ports on the south-east coast.  The road from Rosslare to Cork runs through the biggest population centre in the south-east, Waterford, where one of those major ports is located.  The highest ranking Garda officer for the region is based in Waterford, yet when the Minister recently appointed an assistant commissioner to better co-ordinate the fight against crime in the region, she nominated the inland town of Kilkenny as the headquarters.</P>

      <P>On the introduction of our Bill in January I said that the drugs problem must be tackled at three levels: by reducing the supply of drugs reaching the Irish market, by reducing the demand for legal drugs and by dealing with the health problems associated with drug dependency.  The Minister, in addressing only one of those elements, is adopting a less than effective approach to the problem.  Unless we deal quickly and meaningfully with reducing the demand for drugs and take out of the system as many people as possible who have become trapped in it, we are wasting valuable time.</P>
      <P>Many young people who have criminal records are in that position only because of drug dependency.  Without drugs they would never have found themselves on the wrong side of the law. These are primarily the people in whom I have the greatest interest and for whom I have the greatest sympathy. The drug barons who make millions of pounds from that lucrative industry must be hunted down, brought to court and dealt with severely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We are not sensitive to criticism.  Fianna Fáil was in power for seven years and as soon as that party crossed the floor it saw all the problems that must be solved.  The Deputy must realise that there are difficulties in solving these problems, otherwise he is casting a vote of no confidence in his former colleagues. Some of the statements made by Deputies opposite are unbelievable.</P>
      <P>I share the concern about the drugs problem, which unfortunately has increased year after year and is devastating the country.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  I am not concerned about the seven days' detention provision.  People may put forward the argument about civil liberties and rights, but with the increase in the number of judges, I am sure everybody will get a fair crack of the whip.  It is important that people are protected and that those involved in drugs will not go free under the pretence of civil liberties or rights.  They should be made to answer questions and account for their movements.  In this case the right to silence is a very dubious privilege considering the damage being done, particularly to young people.  The suffering inflicted on those who become involved in drugs is outrageous.</P>
      <P>I was shocked to read in my local newspaper recently that a seven year old was offered drugs in the street.  The attitude is that if people become involved in drug dealing or become addicted at a young age there will be a market for drugs.  I have every sympathy for drug addicts who cannot give up drugs, but the drug barons who make money and sit back like lords should be detained for seven days or longer if necessary.  I have no sympathy for them because they are destroying the lives of decent people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the drugs problem was solved much crime would be eliminated because drug addicts steal, rob, snatch handbags and molest people to get money for drugs. <Col N="1519" /> If the major drug barons were apprehended it would help to solve the crime problem.  At one stage it was thought that the drugs problem was concentrated only in Dublin inner city, but we must accept that has now changed.  A drugs scene has been inflicted on most towns and villages.  It is amazing that so many young people are becoming involved in the drugs scene at a time when education about the dangers of drugs was never more widespread.  It is shattering that ecstasy still appeals to young people considering that many have died from taking those tablets and when education has informed young people of what they are dealing with.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of visiting a prison near Washington a few years ago which provided methadone treatment to wean drug abusing prisoners off drugs.  A glass partition which separated prisoners from their visitors prevented the passing of drugs to the prisoners.  The officials there told us they had a 95 per cent success rate in weaning drug abusing prisoners off drugs.  I do not know if that figure was accurate, but the officials there assured us that the prisoners did not have access to drugs.  One of the problems in Mountjoy Prison is that the prisoners there can gain access to drugs. It is difficult to eliminate drugs from prisons, but we must make every effort to wean drug abusing prisoners off drugs and ensure that prisoners do not begin to take drugs when they are sent to prison.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the concept of giving more powers to the gardaí and Customs officers.  In particular, I welcome the co-operation between them to address the drugs problem.  It would be awful if different groups enforcing the same law and trying to achieve the same objective were at loggerheads.  It is important that powers of re-arrest should be implemented where there is evidence of a crime.  Sections 2 to 6, inclusive, will be reviewed after 12 months in case the provisions may be unfair.  That signifies that the Minister is not imposing draconian laws.  I hope <Col N="1520" /> those sections will stand up to scrutiny. I wish the Bill well as it is time that we dealt with the drug barons.</P>

It is hard to listen to a decent quiet man like Deputy Kenneally trot out the type of political claptrap he uttered today.  We all agree with some of the points he made, but to attempt to nail the Minister after only 17 months in office and saddle her with responsibility for the level of crime here demeans the House.</P>

Was he aware that Martin Cahill was the biggest mobster in Europe and that he was freely walking around the streets <Col N="1521" /> of Dublin engaged in crime until he was assassinated?  The Fianna Fáil Government was unable to do anything about that.  It was aware of his activities but it did nothing.  That is the reality of the crime problem.  The Minister entered office in the eye of a storm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact.  In the 17 months since she took office she has been given a baptism of fire and is as tough a cookie as we have had in the history of this State next to former Deputy Paddy Cooney who was a strong Minister for Justice.  I commend the Minister for the measures she introduced. This is the forerunner of many more strong measures.  I do not claim she will solve the problem because she will not.  This House does not have the courage to introduce the type of necessary draconian measures to rid this country of the scourge of crime and drugs.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is alarming.  It is deeply worrying that Dublin is recognised internationally as a clearing house for European drugs.  One of the reasons that is the case is that Fianna Fáil, which was in Government in the years leading up to 1996, presided over a burgeoning crime problem, and did not do anything about it.  It now has the effrontery to identify the problems to which it failed to respond and rectify.  That is the nonsense of political life, but that party engages in that type of activity for consumption outside these four walls.  I do not condone that, but I understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned about the drugs problem and it should not be a political football.  The politicians in this House should not be engaged in a confrontational struggle over this issue, rather there should be consensus on it.  The quicker this palace of variety is eliminated and we get down to the business of addressing this problem through one of the committees of the House the better. The committees could be very effective <Col N="1522" /> if they were given real power, including spending power.</P>
    <P>The appeal of drugs to vulnerable children and adolescents is rooted in the glorification of drink.  For many young people the taking of drugs is a natural progression from drinking alcohol, a means by which some members of society get their kicks.  The tobacco industry has been curtailed.  That is welcome as smoking kills people, but that industry does not kill as many people as the drinks industry nor does it cause as much hardship to families as the drinks industry.  The drinks industry has been glorified, sanctified and protected by every Government in the history of this State because of the level of tolerance of drinking and the State revenue collected from that industry.</P>
    <P>In advertisements every ten minutes on RTE television young people are exhorted to go out for a pint of Furstenberg, Harp or Guinness.  The drinks product is sold by using a good looking girl and young man.  Young people watching television cannot escape the message in those advertisements. Statistics reveal that young people are starting to drink at 12 years of age and some are alcoholics by the time they are 17 or 18.  It is a natural progression for those children to experiment with drugs.</P>
    <P>Draconian measures are needed to tackle the drugs problem.  We all turn our eyes away from a model that could be used to tackle the drugs problem but I am glad Deputy Kenneally has joined myself and others on the extreme right who believe in the introduction of draconian measures to deal with horrible crimes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">

      <P>I had thought I was alone in this House; it is nice to know I now have an ally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People engaged in drug trafficking. described by the media as drug barons, should be shot if we really want to see <Col N="1523" /> an end to the problem.  That type of attitude is not regarded as quite nice in this House; it is easier to perhaps appoint a committee or commission while the problem worsens.  I predict that ten years' of inactivity will make today's drugs problem appear like a tea party. That is the reality.  No matter which Government may be in power in ten years' time, unless serious and immediate action is taken, crime including drugs-related crime, will be totally out of control.</P>
    <P>The draconian measures adopted in Middle Eastern countries to counter drug trafficking have resulted in very few engaging in it.  There was a recent example of a young English girl sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in Thailand having been caught with a relatively small amount of drugs in her possession.</P>
    <P>We must introduce draconian measures not only to counter drug taking and trafficking but all unlawful activities if we are serious about combating crime.  There would not be all-party support for my proposal, that those deeply involved in drug syndicates, selling drugs to unfortunate, vulnerable adolescents should be shot or, if such is not acceptable &mdash; and I suspect it would not be to most Members &mdash; imprisoned for life.  However, there must be deterrents within society, the absence of which has led to our society breaking up before our eyes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on having introduced this Bill, something the main Opposition party failed to do in their eight years in office when the drugs trade continued to burgeon before reaching its present totally unacceptable level, something Deputy Kenneally half acknowledged.  The Minister deserves commendation on having introduced this Bill which, while not constituting a solution, is a step in the right direction in the battle to reduce the level of drug taking.  If we really want to rid our society of this scourge, draconian measures must be introduced.  Deputy Browne of Wexford suggested that drug <Col N="1524" /> barrons should be charged with murder, a realistic proposal which should be incorporated in future legislation.  I doubt if it will be done whether by my party and others or by Fianna Fáil in Government but until draconian measures are introduced the drugs scourge will continue to decimate our young people.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports appear to confirm that Mountjoy and other prisons are sanctuaries for drug taking which, if true, is most distressing.  If drugs are being taken into Mountjoy Prison, the obvious solution is to deny its prisoners visits by family members and others.  If the lurid stories circulating are true, Mountjoy Prison should be closed.  I would go so far as to say those who are committed to prisons should not be allowed visitors and then they might not be so keen to engage in their erstwhile criminal activities.</P>

      <P>I remind Deputy McGahon that for some time I have stressed my belief that this issue is and should be above politics and that there is the danger that one may refuse to listen to anybody else, in the belief that one has heard it all.  I live in a community not far from the city centre within which drug taking is a daily occurrence where the problem has been a scourge for a long time.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to contend that action was not taken heretofore.  Various actions were taken.  Deputy McGahon mentioned the famous &ldquo;general&rdquo;, Martin Cahill.  During my period in office in the Department of Social Welfare we arranged a good deal of &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; on Martin Cahill, who shot one of our departmental officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Before their involvement in the case I explained the dangers in case they did not understand exactly the type of person with whom <Col N="1525" /> they were about to deal.  Throughout operations we maintained contact with the Garda.  There was a great deal of activity about which Deputy McGahon might not have been aware.  Only the tip of the iceberg was visible from time to time and that is why I contend the drugs problem must be tackled on an all-party basis.  Of course arguments will be advanced here about delays, lack of resources and the like, but it is the duty of my party and its spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, to highlight delays and the need for urgent action and place positive proposals before the House.  That is what democracy is about and in respect of which Deputy O'Donoghue is doing a very effective job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the past because it is a waste of time. Any Member now dealing with the drugs problem would feel likewise.  We can see the young people being affected. Young people have often approached me for help to get out of drugs related crime.  I approach the health boards, the Garda, Dublin Corporation and the Departments of Social Welfare and Education for support in my endeavours to combat this horrific problem since the young people are in need of continuing help.</P>
      <P>In the meantime we should not argue about what somebody did or did not do in the past.  The Minister will confirm that numerous packages have been prepared and put through this House with the support of all Members.  I remember a £30 million package, for example, to enhance the technology available to the Garda.  Now we are endeavouring to push back the frontiers across which drug traffickers move.  In the firm belief that they must be hit, I welcome the provisions of this Bill in countering their criminal activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be differences of opinion among Members of the House on how <Col N="1526" /> this problem should be tackled.  It was clear the Minister was very anxious, with the support of her Cabinet colleagues, to tackle this problem thoroughly at an earlier stage but all of that is now history.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill and want to see it enacted because it is crucial to tackle drug barons and traffickers as if they were subversives.  They are subverting our young but it is hard to get that message across to people who are responsible for providing the policing.  I would even go another step because of the massive intimidation when drug barons or traffickers are brought to court and have their case tried in the Special Criminal Court.  I have said that for a long time but not many will go along with it for all sorts of reasons.  In this Bill, action is being taken against the key people, the drug traffickers.  I fully support that and I believe this measure will be widely supported in the community.</P>
    <P>During Christmas 1994 there was a massive price reduction in ecstasy, which fell from £35 to approximately £3 to £5.  The scene changed dramatically in the centre of Dublin and there was an explosion in the use of ecstasy.  We pointed out at the time that this would cause huge problems which would affect our area because it is close to the city. We were very much aware of this new development and our anxieties were proved correct.  In February 1995 I said it was particularly important that immediate action be taken to tackle drug trafficking and serious crime in Dublin.  Large areas of the city centre and north side are dominated by ruthless criminals who prey on disadvantaged young people and menace, threaten and intimidate local communities. It is time to spend the money that the gardaí needs to put these criminals out of action.  I then suggested a number of steps to be taken: (i)  that the gardaí must be given the finance and equipment &mdash; and this related to the Estimates &mdash; to mount and sustain intensive surveillance and intelligence gathering by experienced detectives in specialised <Col N="1527" /> units.  It is a highly professional sophisticated business and one needs people who are experienced and professional in tackling them.  I stressed that this strategy had worked previously in the early 1980s, in the case of the Dunnes and more recently the Cahills.  I said this was one of the most important steps that should be taken; (ii)  reform of the law. I pointed to the fact that the gardaí do not have the power to enter premises and search for evidence in cases involving murder, attempted murder, rape or malicious wounding, without search warrants their hands are tied behind their backs.  The recovery of weapons in murder or wounding cases is vital to the success of the investigation and similarly the recovery of clothing in rape, sexual assault, murder and wounding cases is vital to the success of these investigations; (iii)  the need for co-operation and greater liaison between different agencies; (iv) the seizing of assets and that section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, should be immediately brought into effect to stop the laundering of stolen moneys; (v)  that the bail laws should be reassessed in relation to habitual criminals.</P>
    <P>This Bill tackles drug traffickers, which is welcome.  It provides for detention up to seven days.  In fairness, Deputy O'Donoghue has similar proposals in his Bill.  It provides for the detention of stuffers and swallowers &mdash; some people may not be familiar with the terms but anyone who has been involved since the early 1980s will be aware that stuffers and swallowers are persons who conceal drugs on their person and thereby bring in very valuable consignments of drugs.  It is particularly important that provision has been made so that a superintendent can issue a warrant as a matter of urgency and that Customs officers can be present at and participate in questioning.  This is forming the links between the activities of the Garda Síochána and the Customs officers.  It does not tackle the question of bail for habitual offenders or the use of the Special Criminal Court to hear <Col N="1528" /> the cases of drug traffickers.  Nevertheless, it is particularly valuable legislation.</P>
    <P>Surveillance is central to tackling the problems but, unfortunately, it is not a buzz word or something the papers will take up.  Let us consider the surveillance at ports and airports.  The European Union provided for the removal of barriers to trade and travel.  I was very worried at that time about the impact of this measure from the long-term point of view.  I knew that Customs officers were very vigilant at the ports; they knew the people coming through and could identify them and they noticed people who were unusual or different.  It was extrordinary what a Customs official would observe, I have never ceased to be amazed at how well they observed people and situations.  This is a characteristic of Customs officials and the Garda Síochána.  The 600 Customs and Excise staff were redeployed to Revenue and the Department of Social Welfare. Whereas freedom of travel and trade are very important and valuable, one of the consequences was that there were no longer Customs officials to keep watch at our ports and airports. We no longer have constant surveillance and now depend on spot checks, which cannot match continuous surveillance. The constant presence of a person in uniform has its own impact because people know they can be stopped at any stage and noticed if they travel frequently. For example, the influx of tobacco on the street shows how freely it can now come into Dublin and the possibilities for bringing in drugs are just as open.</P>
    <P>The drugs squad carry out spot checks but it is too easy to import drugs in small quantities.  As we know, small quantities are very valuable.  We need to reassess the question of surveillance at our ports and airports.  The Bill allows Customs officers to participate with the Garda Síochána and this is welcome, but we need comprehensive co-operation between the two services.  It is the <Col N="1529" /> task of management to create the environment within which that co-operation can take place.</P>
    <P>On the issue of Garda surveillance, a recent newspaper article stated the IRA has identified some 200 suppliers and dealers in drugs and issued warnings saying it has its own ways of dealing with these people.  However, the Garda do not need to be told who are the drug barons.  It identified some 20 drug barons, traffickers and major criminals. The force has done its homework and knows with whom it is dealing.  What it needs is resources and support to crack down on criminals until they can put them out of business.  How can the Garda do this?  It would need to provide round the clock professional surveillance which costs money and that is the reason it does not happen.  We need to lean hard on the drug traffickers and the drug barons and to use the new powers under the Bill and all other powers available to ensure success.  We must also pursue the assets of the drug barons and the drug traffickers who can be identified easily.  They are known: they live beyond their apparent means and have obvious wealth.  Obviously they have overseas accounts and other ways of laundering their money.  We have to work to put them out of action.  This means providing the Garda with specialised and experienced manpower to make a co-ordinated attact, to follow up the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>In that context, co-operation between the Garda and the Customs is important.  At the end of January, Mr. Michael Dillon of the Customs and Excise group in the Public Service Executive Union, outlined the difference of approach between the Garda and Customs and excise in combating drug importation.  The problem is that while the Garda would like to catch the major dealers red-handed, Customs seek to keep the drugs out and seize the carriers on arrival at ports and airports. He also called for greater manpower and equipment to further reduce the supply of drugs.  He cited the success of <Col N="1530" /> Customs and Excise officers in combating the importation of drugs and listed the seizures made to date.  They are to be congratulated and commended on the work they have done in the recent past in that area.  We cannot afford to have differences between the approaches of Customs and Excise and the Garda.  There is need for continuous co-operation between the two groups and also to use the Revenue Commissioners to pursue and nail the drug barons.  If the Revenue Commissioners can do it with business people they should do it now in this area.</P>
    <P>I stress the importance of the area based approach.  Garda resources are needed in areas where there are serious drug problems, one of which is in two blocks of flats in the middle of my constituency. The Garda carried out a successful pilot study there in intensive policing which continued for at least four or five months.  Unfortunately, due to a reduction in the numbers of gardaí now available the small dealers are coming back in.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure the continuation of these pilot studies and anything that is successful in the area. There is need for intensive work on an area basis and this will require the co-operation of the local agencies including the Departments of Social Welfare, Justice, Health and Education and Dublin Corporation which is making special efforts in its housing estates.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to support the efforts being made in the area based approach.  We are happy to support the Minister in these efforts and also to support the Bill.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> I compliment Deputy Woods on his speech and his approach to the problem which is one of co-operation rather than of trying to make a political meal out of it and exploiting it for a few miserable votes.  The Bill is welcome as just one part of a series of measures which are badly needed to tackle this problem which is particularly difficult in Dublin. The measures being proposed must be seen as part of an integrated package which will include extra treatment facilities, health facilities, targeted education programmes and so on.  The problem is undoubtedly much wider than just a criminal problem.  It has been suggested that this problem could be solved if more money was thrown at the Garda. However, it is not as simple as that and it is important to recognise that.  That is not to say more resources are not needed.  Certainly, the idea of throwing money at the Garda, without examining how it should be spent, has a popular appeal but is of little real value in terms of tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly some of the measures proposed impinge on civil liberties.  I do not have any problem with that.  We may as well recognise the reality.  The safeguards built in are perfectly adequate.  So far as civil liberties are concerned, one has to accept that there are certain limits and when society begins to fall asunder, it is time to modify the protections provided by civil liberties for the greater benefit and welfare of society.  There are some welcome and useful protections in the Bill.  Section 9 provides some safeguards.  Sections 2 and 4, which deal with the intervention of the courts in relation to extra detention and so on, provide adequate levels of protection.  Also, the Minister has given a commitment that she will review the effectiveness of the Bill when it is up and running.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to deal with some of the changes in the patterns of supply of drugs over the years.  Recently, there has been a worrying trend in that many drug addicts are also used as drug pushers. That is a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> A number of speakers referred to the need for greater levels of co-operation between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners.  Undoubtedly there have been some welcome and worthwhile developments in this area in the past few months.  The way forward may well be related to the proposal by Deputy Ring last night who referred to Al Capone and the need to tackle the people referred to as drug barons on a number of different fronts.</P>
    <P>I have always had some difficulty with the terms &ldquo;drug baron&rdquo; and &ldquo;drug lord&rdquo;. To some extent the terms &ldquo;baron&rdquo; and &ldquo;lord&rdquo; are admirable.  it may be an indication of some subliminal duplicity in some people in regard to this problem.  I am pleased Deputy Woods adopted the attitude he did this morning.  It was in sharp contrast to the point scoring attitude adopted by Deputy John O'Donoghue.  The reality is that Fianna Fáil held the Justice portfolio from 1987 to 1994.  Attacks on the Minister for the action she has taken in difficult circumstances since taking office 16 months ago are little less than opportunistic and unworthy of people who should be trying to address this problem in the manner in which Deputy Woods addressed it this morning.</P>
    <P>The difference of emphasis in Deputy Woods's contribution and the contributions of Deputies Kenneally and O'Donoghue was interesting.  Deputy Woods spoke like a man who is familiar with the problem.  That is not surprising because drug abuse is an enormous problem in his constituency, as it is in mine.  It is wrong for anyone to seek to exploit the terrifying levels of human misery associated with this problem, both in terms of the people addicted to drugs and the victims of addicts whose lives are made a misery because of their actions.</P>
    <P>Certain areas of Dublin are drug black spots which require special attention. I was encouraged to hear of the success of the pilot scheme initiated in Deputy Woods's constituency and I hope the lessons learned from that will be applied elsewhere and that the <Col N="1533" /> scheme will be broadened to include areas in the city with particularly high levels of drug addiction.  It has been said that approximately 8,000 drug addicts live in the areas between the canals. This problem is enormous by any standards and it is difficult for Deputies representing constituencies outside the capital to understand the extent and the awfulness of it in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Drug addicts are generally young and unemployed.  They have low levels of education and come from dysfunctional families.  Who has the ultimate responsibility for tackling this problem which is widespread both here and throughout the world?  It seems to be the responsibility of the Departments of Justice and Health and, to some extent, the Department of Education.  A more co-ordinated approach should be taken in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for the day today management of this problem?  There does not seem to be any one individual charged with the overall responsibility of dealing with it.  There is a need for a manager or a management committee to be appointed to ensure that all the agencies involved in dealing with this problem function in harmony and to the highest level of effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Why has the drugs culture become such a major problem?  I believe it relates to the change of emphasis in morality.  To some extent, <i>á la</i> Margaret Thatcher, society has become an amalgam of individuals.  There has been a serious disengagement from social cohesion.  I am encouraged, however, by some of the statements emanating from the British Labour Party about a stake-holders' society and the need for everybody to feel they have a role and a place in society.  That is difficult in a society which seems to be fuelled on discord and which is ridden with a culture of blame &mdash; we had enough of that here this morning and last night &mdash; accusation and aggravated, hostile questioning. That culture lays the foundation for the disintegration of society and this question must be addressed.  According to figures quoted in a newspaper this <Col N="1534" /> morning there are huge numbers of single parent families.  That presents us with an enormous social challenge.  All these factors contribute to the types of problems we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>On the question of tackling drug abuse, why have we not made a greater effort to study the problem?  Why do we not have an institute of addiction or a chair of addiction studies?  Why have we been so neglectful in adopting a structured, reasoned approach to this problem? A previous speaker referred to the major problem of drugs in our prisons but those working in the prisons believe that if the policy being advocated by Deputy McGahon were adopted prisons would be virtually unmanageable.  I am not sufficiently expert to say whether that is true but it is a matter of great concern.</P>
    <P>There are two schools of thought in regard to the strategies used to treat drug addiction, one of which emanates from the people working in Coolmine who believe that nobody should ever become involved in drugs.  The other school of thought is that the problem should simply be managed.  Some consensus should be reached between those differing schools of thought because that difference creates major problems in developing an effective strategy to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of estate management in local authority areas, particularly the Dublin Corporation area.  Some significant improvements have been made but the manner in which some local authority estates were managed over the years left much to be desired.  For many years, Dublin Corporation was helpless in terms of dealing with people who wreaked havoc in housing estates and flats complexes.  I accept some improvements have been made and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to changing the bail laws in regard to habitual offenders. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Woods in that regard.  Nobody can examine the data on the levels of offences committed by people on bail without being concerned. <Col N="1535" /> The data highlight the need for change and anybody who says changes should not be made in our bail laws in wrong.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring to another comment made by Deputy Woods regarding the need for more surveillance. Broadly speaking, surveillance is boring and tiresome but I agree with him that it is also effective and it is the type of activity to which additional resources should be allocated.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I welcome the legislation which is an important additional weapon in the fight against the increasing use of drugs in our society.  The Minister and the Government are to be congratulated.  I share Deputy Upton's criticism of speakers opposite who attempted to play politics with a serious issue without making any clear alternative proposals. This legislation follows the announcement in the past week of a cross-departmental response to the drugs problem involving the Departments of Health and Education.  It is clear that such a response is needed to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>I wish to broaden the debate and deal with areas where many people would fear to tread.  I watched a British television programme last night on the drugs problem in Glasgow.  It was said in the programme that Glasgow is the drugs centre of the United Kingdom and it was interesting that the law officers at the front line in dealing with the problem were divided on the question of how to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should there be a totally controlled response or a management response to dealing with this problem?  We must seriously examine that issue in addition to the problems that might arise in a more controlled environment, possibly involving elements of legislation.  That is an approach which has been toyed with in certain European countries, some of which first adopted then suspended it and others which introduced elements of legislation.  We need to examine and <Col N="1536" /> analyse all the possible responses in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear some of the law officers on the programme last night say that regardless of the number of people we put in prison, there will always be people willing to become involved in the drugs market, which is very lucrative and which has an established customer base.  They say routes will be found to serve those customers, regardless of how we deal with the supply aspect.  At the Fine Gael conference on drugs many of us were surprised by the conclusions of experts working in the field, including those in Dublin. When there is a major drugs seizure in Dublin, the price of that drug rises and the crime levels increase.  There are no simple answers in dealing with this problem.  The best answer must incorporate some form of education.</P>
    <P>Sweden has the strongest drug free environment in any country.  It moved from experimenting with drug liberalisation to a totally restrictive regime.  It is an unusual society.  It may be unwise to put a drug free environment label onto a society that attempts to prohibit alcohol, has a state supported childcare system and an educational set up that starts at one year of age.  Sweden has a State involved, structured and ordered society with an entirely different cultural background and ethos from ours.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine the approaches taken by different countries to this problem and come up with a meaningful response.  The liberalisation approach will only work if it comes about in all countries, otherwise unmanageable consequences will result.  We need the debates to which Deputy Upton referred to take place at national level.  At international level, Europe should move many of its justice activities in the fight against drugs away from its current weaker structural position and I hope this will happen in the context of the intergovernmental conference. Many justice issues will become Commission activities.  They will not have to depend on <i>ad hoc</i> ministerial meetings but will get ongoing attention. <Col N="1537" /> Irrespective of the country in which one is dealing with the drug problem, controlling demand is critical.  Residents of one area say their quality of life improves if a drug baron lives on their street and that there is more money around, even if it is by way of payoffs.  In my constituency I have seen teenagers carrying metal containers and swabs of cotton wool behind doors; I can only presume what was happening behind those doors.</P>
    <P>This problem is enormous.  While it is mainly related to bad social conditions and deprivation, it is not confined to those areas.  Drugs can be obtained outside many middle class schools in Dublin and drug abuse is also prevalent in richer areas.  Its most serious aspects are the great destruction it causes in deprived areas and its total destruction of quality of life as a result of associated criminality.</P>
    <P>On a television programme last night, senior law officers were divided as to whether the fight against drugs would be better served if they were legalised. We need the structures suggested by Deputy Upton, constant analysis and an integrated approach at national and European levels.  Through the Intergovernmental Conference, I hope we will see the fight against drugs &mdash; our Minister of State has been actively pursuing this matter &mdash; becoming more centralised in a way that draws on the substantial experience of the approaches made by different European countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation, particularly the package announced last week.  Controlling demand for drugs is the best way of ensuring our society will become less drugs centred in the future.  We should find out why these people turn to drugs and offer them better alternatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a limited practical experience of the drugs problem, which I gained from within my constituency. Deputies repeatedly state that the single biggest issue on our minds is law and order.  The Eastern Health <Col N="1538" /> Board set about establishing a methadone and needle exchange clinic in my constituency which, predictably, brought about a hostile reaction from the settled community, parents and community leaders.  However, there is a great lack of recognition of the seriousness of the problem and of what should be done about attempting to treat people afflicted by this dreadful addiction.</P>
      <P>We tried to make people understand the necessity of having this service.  It was even discussed in a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme in which I participated, which addressed the need for attention and urgent action.  The first half of the programme set the scene for the taking of drugs and the related aspects of its knock-on effects.  They interviewed people who were in the process of seeking or currently getting treatment and identified the serious crime costs related to drug taking.  This goes to the heart of what the Minister and Deputy O'Donoghue, in introducing his Misuse of Drugs Bill, are attempting to do.  There is widespread agreement across the House that this problem must be tackled, although we may differ in emphasis on how to do this.  Previous speakers have shown a great depth of knowledge on the issue.</P>
      <P>Our present generation of constituents, especially in larger housing estates, seem to be expert in telling us what is wrong and what should be done about the problem, yet the problem seems to have come from behind us.  Families with teenagers are now at the coalface regarding the availability of drugs and young people can tell a person what drug is available and where to get it.  As one goes into this problem in further detail, it becomes more complex and difficult to attack.</P>
      <P>I would tackle the source of these drugs, the UN member states from which drugs are readily available.</P>

      <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development is a comprehensive assessment of <Col N="1542" /> all the issues which affect the lives of the communities on our offshore islands. Many of the issues considered by the interdepartmental committee are, by their nature, complex and necessarily involve a number of Government Departments, State agencies, local authorities and local development organisations.</P>
      <P>In its report, the interdepartmental committee concluded that the addition of a further body or organisation would serve only to add to the complexity of administrative and funding arrangements with which island communities have had to deal in the past and about which they have expressed particular concern.  The view of the committee is that island communities would be better served by improved co-ordination, consultation and co-operation between existing organisations at national, regional and local level.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the committee has made a number of recommendations to ensure that, when the relevant organisations at national, regional and local level are formulating and implementing policy, the unique circumstances of the offshore islands will be fully taken into account.  In particular, the recommendations of the report include the development of appropriate mechanisms to ensure that organisations involved in development at regional and local levels work in tandem with island communities to maximise the benefits from available resources.  New mechanisms have also been put in place in order to deal in a strategic and integrated way with the key issue of access to the islands.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental co-ordinating committee has been given a mandate by the Government to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report, including issues of co-ordination, and it will submit a progress report to Government annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of more effectively utilising existing structures, expertise and resources is the correct one.  The strategy for the development of our offshore islands as set out in the report will, I am confident, have a very real <Col N="1543" /> impact on the living conditions of our offshore island communities.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and the Government Chief Whip for agreeing to make time available to debate this important report, which I have read, in the House. While I am aware that these are its conclusions there is a need to establish a single agency or authority to co-ordinate the activities of the bodies and groups concerned, some of which I have met during the past 12 months.  Because of the difficulties created by the geographical location of the island communities, weather conditions and other factors, there is, as the Minister of State said, a need to improve co-ordination. The purpose in commissioning the report, in which I was prominently involved in Government, was to try to find a way around the difficulties of the 4,000 people directly affected.</P>
      <P>While they are doing their best, local authorities and other agencies are unable to co-ordinate the services in a desirable manner.  The report is useless because there is not a single agency or authority focused on island communities, there are at least eight agencies involved.  The Minister of State should disregard his reply and during his term in office co-ordinate the activities of island communities under a single agency.</P>

Many Deputies know more about them than I, but from speaking to people in different parts of the country I am aware of the difficulties faced by island communities for many decades in dealing with various agencies.  This report, which will be debated in the House, is unworkable. Unless there is co-ordination and a proper set of principles, the same point will be made in ten years' time.

Will he accept that the questions asked about the needs of islanders in the past three years were not answered because of the pending interdepartmental report?  Will he also accept the suggestion made by those with many years' experience of offshore island communities that there is a need to set up an authority, be it a section of a Department or an agency as suggested by Deputy Ahern, to deal with the problems faced by those communities?

      <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Island Development sets out new mechanisms to deal with the key issue of access services to the offshore islands in a strategic and integrated way.  Under these proposals, the relevant local authority islands committees, in consultation with islanders and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, will prepare a programme of works for bringing the level of access services to the offshore islands up to a socially desirable minimum standard. The proposals will reflect the priority needs of the islands concerned.  These submissions from the relevant local authorities will form the basis on which funding will be allocated in 1996 by the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development.</P>
      <P>Funds will be allocated on the basis of need and the quality of proposals submitted.  Individual projects will be assessed not only on their merit but, particularly, in the context of the overall strategy for islands as set out in the report.  The provision of a scheduled passenger air service to Inishbofin, Inisturk and Clare Island will be considered, along with all other options, as part of this integrated and strategic approach.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is gobbledygook.  The part of the report I have with me refers to air access.  My question related to the extension of the air service but the Minister gave me a general answer about the different types of access to islands for which local authorities are responsible.  They have no responsibility for air access.  I tabled this question on numerous occasions in recent years and have been consistently told &ldquo;the interdepartmental committee is reviewing the situation in regard to the island and we have to await the publication of its report&rdquo;.  Having awaited the recommendations on the extension of the air passenger service to islands other than Inishmaan, Inisheer and Inishmore all it states is: &ldquo;A satisfactory resolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies of my firm commitment to the sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry and that the Department, together with BIM and the other State agencies, is working intensively on all fronts to support its continued development.</P>
      <P>In line with overall policy objectives and with the Department's own strategic objective to improve service delivery to the sector, considerable technical and administrative resources are being devoted to tackling the critical priority issues facing the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sound legislative framework to underpin aquaculture development is the immediate and most urgent objective. The necessary draft legislation to amend the Fisheries Acts, 1959 and 1980 is well advanced and proposals will be brought to Government shortly.  A thoroughgoing overhaul of the existing legislation is agreed by all interests to be essential, not least to address the highlighted deficiencies of licensing procedures but also to take account of new thinking on planning and environmental issues as well as significant technical advances in aquaculture itself.  There are many complex issues involved and the process has taken longer than first envisaged.  I hope, however, that the <Col N="1555" /> outcome will be seen to strike the necessary balance between the essential development needs of the industry and the acknowledged interests of concerned parties to ensure that development is planned and regulated in a sustainable way.  The Department will continue to deploy the necessary resources to achieve enactment of this major and complex legislation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In addition to delivering on the key legislative priority, the assessment and licensing of existing applications, where these can be progressed under the present legislative regime, is advancing as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Significant advances are also being made to bring about sustained improvements in fish husbandry and fish health and sea lice management strategies.  The Department is actively committed to the implementation of fallowing and single bay management strategies which are already paying demonstrable dividends. Decisive action has also been taken to address biotoxin and other environmental factors affecting shellfish productivity. In this regard the recommendations of the Biotoxin Task Force, which I established in March 1995 and which reported to me last July, are being implemented and new strategies to address recurring problems are being put in place together with a financial aid package which is currently with the EU Commission for approval.</P>
    <P>The Department and relevant State agencies and research institutions will continue to work with the industry to provide the necessary advice and support on technical, environmental and fish husbandry aspects of aquaculture.</P>
    <P>Continued EU and State support for investment in the aquaculture industry is critical to delivering on economic potential and employment targets. Under the Fisheries Operational Programme total investment of £36 million is envisaged up to the year 2000 in new projects and the modernisation of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>The investment strategies now in <Col N="1556" /> place under the Fisheries Operational Programme are designed to protect existing employment and production and to generate new jobs and economic activity through sustainable expansion. Since January 1995 over 100 aquaculture projects have been approved for over £4 million of EU and national assistance.  Since the programme got under way it is very clear that the sector has an appetite and ability to utilise available funding quickly and effectively. The Department will continue to work closely with BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta, which are the State agencies charged with developing the sector to maximise the benefits of available funding.</P>
    <P>The EU market situation for farmed salmon continues to be of major concern. We are working closely with the Irish salmon farming industry to get concrete action by the Commission to address the recurring crisis brought about by the flood of low-priced Norwegian imports.  I have also made it clear that the solution in the final analysis lies with the Norwegian Government and industry which must tackle its structural production problems.  EU strategies must be geared to convincing the Norwegians to act themselves and we are working to bring this about.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry has grown from small beginnings over 15 years to a position where it accounts for 25 per cent of the value of total fish production in this country.  Employment in the sector, which now stands at nearly 3,000, continues to grow together with volume and value of production and exports.  I trust that, in outlining just some of the initiatives currently under way, I have reassured the Deputies there is every commitment to deliver for the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that he has no chance of reaching the targets in the Fisheries Operational Programme which envisages increasing the tonnage from the farm fishing sector from the present static 13,900 tonnes to 24,000 tonnes and that this is not attainable, in the absence of legislative <Col N="1557" /> reform?  Last November the Taoiseach told Deputy Ahern legislation would be introduced in two weeks but the Minister of State indicated to Deputy McDaid that the legislation might not be ready this year.  The lack of legislative reform is leading to frustration in the industry.  Those who wish to engage in that sector experience long delays. Will the Minister of State admit that he failed to convince the EU Commission to do anything about the massive imbalance created by the Norwegians dumping fish farm products?  They are in a position to paralyse the industry.  Will he further admit that 20 jobs were lost in Donegal because it was impossible to obtain licences due to the cumbersome procedures in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The target set out in the fisheries operation programme for the salmon farming industry is 19,000 tonnes and not 24,000 tonnes as stated by the Deputy.  I am confident the target will be met and may be surpassed.  Complex and detailed legislation has been prepared by the Department of the Marine.  I am sure the Deputy will agree it is desirable that sufficient care be taken in the preparation of legislation and that we have regard to the legal challenges mounted to the Fisheries Acts, 1959 and 1980, some of which are still subject to appeal in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Deputy's accusation that I failed to convince the EU that there is oversupply from Norway, we have been pursuing the issue with the EU for some time.  The Minister raised it at the Council meeting in December and minimum import restrictions were introduced. Following that and on foot of a case made to the EU Commission and the Norwegian authorities, measures were taken by the Norwegian Government and industry to control matters.  I am not happy that they are either sufficient or successful and I am pursuing with the EU other measures which require to be taken to prevent dumping by the Norwegian industry and protect our industry.  I will meet Commissioner <Col N="1558" /> Bonino next Tuesday and pursue the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the legislation be introduced?  Is it true there is a delay of two or three months following application for veterinary certificates for the transfer of smolts from fresh water to the sea?  It is proposed to introduce single bay management to deal with sea trout problems.  Is it true that there are delays as regards sites for fallowing? Can the Minister confirm that there is only one technical officer dealing with that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the date on which the legislation will be introduced other than to state that it will be introduced as quickly as possible.  It has been prepared and circulated and is being pursued as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my hope.  There will not be delays.  The Department of the Marine works closely with the industry in agreeing following sites and single bay management strategies.  The Deputy will appreciate that difficulties arise in identifying suitable sites for following purposes.  As regards single bay management, where more than one farm is involved it is necessary that all the interests in the bay co-operate in its introduction.  Several officers of the Department of the Marine, both technical and administrative, are involved in <Col N="1559" /> processing these applications and in day to day discussions with the industry.</P>

      <asker>Mr. M. Smith</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the reason his Department has reduced the 1996 grant-in-aid to the salmon research station at Newport, County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5214/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Salmon Research Agency of Ireland based at Newport, County Mayo and owned by the Department undertakes and assists in national research programmes for salmon and sea trout.  This core research programme's support provides vital research and development to both the wild and farmed salmon sectors.  Other activities of the agency include environmental monitoring and new species research for aquaculture, consultancy and contract research and sales of ova and fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to ongoing Exchequer support, the agency generates annual income of over £300,000 from a variety of sources including EU funding, the ESB, contract research and commercial sales.  Up to 1991 the SRA was effectively able to finance its research programmes from own resources.  In 1991-92 a collapse in the market price for salmon smolts and fish health problems led to a serious decline in income which was met from the agency's reserves and additional Exchequer assistance.  A thorough review of research programmes together with a successful drive to enhance income from other sources, including EU funding, has largely restored the balance between current revenue and expenditure.  In light of the agency's request for additional Exchequer support in future years and given, notably, overall budgetary constraints the Department is assessing the agency's programmes, core funding requirements and capital budget needs with the objective of maximising revenue and other sources of funding to <Col N="1560" /> support a prioritised five year research expenditure programme.  In that context, I note the present consultancy review of the organisation and management structure of the fisheries services will make recommendations on the SRA and in particular will address its future structural relationship with the Marine Institute which has overall statutory responsibility for marine research.</P>
    <P>The 1995 Marine Vote provided £160,000 for the Salmon Research Agency grant-in-aid or 34 per cent of its total revenue of some £470,000 last year. This was increased by £66,000 by way of supplementary estimate in December, 1995.  The purpose of this once-off increase was to enable essential capital expenditure to refurbish fish traps and fish tanks at the Newport facility.</P>
    <P>Exclusive of the 1995 supplementary provision, the Exchequer grant-in-aid for 1996, at £150,000 is some 6 per cent less than the comparable 1995 figure of £160,000.  I consider this to be a reasonable allocation in present budgetary circumstances pending the outcome of an overall review of the agency's funding options and needs.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly the EU supported projects which the SRA is undertaking this year.  The SRA is managing a major sea trout restocking programme which is being funded under the tourism angling measure.  This programme is a key component of the overall ongoing initiatives to address a decline in sea trout stocks in the west of Ireland and involves hatching and rearing sea trout for restocking.  Funding of £164,000 has already been approved to date and a further £100,000 will be made available in 1996.</P>
    <P>The SRA has also been approved for funding for two joint projects under the marine research measure of the Fisheries Operational Programme which is administered by the Marine Institute. One is a study of the impact of the fish disease furunculosis on wild and farmed salmonid stocks.  The second project is assessing the application of geographical information systems to river catchment management.  Total funding of <Col N="1561" /> nearly £200,000 has been approved for these projects.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Research Agency makes an important contribution to research and development of the national fisheries resources.  I am committed to securing the best future for its research programmes within the overall institutional framework of the fisheries service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked why there was a reduction in the provision of State aid for the salmon research agency at Lough Furnace near Newport for 1996 as against 1995.  Will the Minister accept that one of the key problems to the development of the fisheries industry has been the lack of research and knowledge and that when the Government decides to reduce State aid to the research unit, which employs 30 highly trained and experienced individuals, it sends a poor signal to that industry? Will the Minister also accept that in the context of the development of coastal regions, where there are few alternatives to employment in the fishing industry, it is essential to build up research and to provide knowledge so that we can combat problems and develop employment?  Will the Minister guarantee that he will make up the imbalance this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a £10,000 reduction in 1996 as against 1995.  Until 1992 the salmon research agency was self-financing and the question of State assistance arose only at that stage.  The agency generates income and is not entirely dependent on assistance from the Exchequer.  In that context, I draw Deputy Smith's attention to the considerable sums which have been allocated to the salmon research agency through the tourism angling measure and the fisheries operation programme for research projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the questions about research on fish stocks, I remind the Deputy that in the order of £5 million is being made available this year for marine research. I am sure he will agree that it is important to get the best possible value <Col N="1562" /> for that considerable investment in marine research, which includes fisheries research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the research unit must raise considerable resources from contracts, etc., but I doubt if there is a research station under the auspices of any Department which is obliged to raise 72 per cent of its revenue from its own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Until 1992 the salmon research agency raised 100 per cent of its revenue from its own resources.  It is very successful and operates on the basis of generating and raising income for specific research projects.  As I mentioned earlier, Deputy Smith needs to apply his attention not only to the grant-in-aid that is made available to the salmon research agency but also to the considerable sums being made available &mdash; £100,000 under the tourism angling measure and £200,000 under the fisheries operational programme &mdash; by the State for specific research projects.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At yesterday's Cabinet meeting the Government approved the implementation plan which includes a voluntary early retirement scheme and it is important to emphasise that the military authorities are in full agreement with this plan.  While I fully understand the fears implicit in the Deputy's question I assure him that a core feature of the <Col N="1563" /> plan is to make more troops available for operational duties.</P>

I would like an assurance that the military would be available if the situation were to deteriorate. When will the recommendations of this report, which was published yesterday, be implemented?  When will officers and men be made aware of its contents?  Will the increase in wages mentioned for June be included?</P>

      <P>I assure the House I am conscious of the need to ensure that our Defence Forces are capable of defending the State.  I have discussed this matter on an ongoing basis with the Chief of Staff and nothing will be done which will undermine the ability of the Defence Forces to carry out the valuable work they have always done when called on.  I assure the Deputy that nothing will be done to reduce the number of troops available for Border duty or otherwise in this reorganisation plan.</P>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy referred was published as a result of yesterday's Cabinet decision and it will allow for ongoing discussions with the representative associations at officer, NCO and private level.  I am anxious that the military authorities and members of the Defence Forces will have ownership of this plan, that things will not be imposed on professional people who are more qualified than I and, I suggest, anybody in this House and that they may advise us on the most efficient structures to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their important duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions will begin with the representative associations on the mechanism for dealing with applications received from those who wish to avail of the voluntary early retirement scheme.  We hope to agree with the representative associations a structure for <Col N="1564" /> dealing with applications and for prioritising who should go first and so on. Much work needs to be done in terms of discussions and co-operation with the military authorities and the representative associations.  I am happy that by May we should be in a position to begin payments to those who have applied under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Will those payments include the increase in wages from 1 June?  I congratulate the Minister for having the courage to put a package to the Cabinet which will ensure people have an opportunity to opt out if they so wish.  In promoting a recruitment campaign perhaps it would be possible to reduce the average age of Army personnel to that in other European countries.</P>

It would be much easier to stand back and do nothing, but I like to get on with the job.  I am very pleased to have received co-operation from colleagues in the House who recognise that the exercise is a very important part of bringing the Defence Forces structures into the 21st century.  I sincerely hope it will result in more efficient and effective Defence Forces, that the job will be more satisfying and rewarding for those serving in the Defence Forces and that they will have an opportunity to seek promotion and to work within modern structures.</P>
      <P>I was not aware the Deputy was going to raise the issue of salary increases because it is not part of the question.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 37, 49 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I met the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and the Environment, the Scottish Office, the Earl of Lindsay and the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State, Ministry of Defence, the Earl Howe in London last Thursday to discuss the drawing up of a management plan for the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite.  Lords Howe and Lindsay confirmed that while there is no conclusive evidence that the British Gas Pipeline disturbed munitions in the Beaufort Dyke, they accept it is likely that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A firm commitment from the UK Government to put in place a system of monitoring and management of the dumpsite was secured.  A number of key points were agreed.  (1) The Scottish Office will undertake a new study beginning next month on the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite in order to re-map and re-chart the extent of the dumpsite <Col N="1567" /> and the distribution of munitions within the site.  (2) It was agreed that UK and Irish scientists will co-operate on the methodology and methods of analysis for the study and they will jointly review the data emerging.  (3) The gas pipeline between Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be commissioned until its safety has been assured following assessment by the UK Health and Safety Executive. UK and Irish scientists will liaise in relation to this issue.  (4) The re-mapping of the dumpsite will be completed before a decision is made on the route of the proposed electricity intercon-necter between Scotland and Northern Ireland.  The installation of the interconnecter will draw on lessons learned from the laying of the gas pipeline.  (5) Based on the studies which are now to be carried out, the UK Ministries intend to issue guidelines on the management of activity around the dump site.  (6) When the 1996 study of the Beaufort Dyke dump site is completed there will be a further meeting in Dublin between the two UK Ministers and myself to assess the results and to discuss what further steps are required at that stage.  I am very pleased with the outcome of this meeting and I am satisfied that a high degree of co-operation has been achieved.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Lynch's question on the dumping of Second World War munitions off the coast of Cork-Kerry, the position is that between 1945 and 1957 the UK authorities dumped a total of 150,000 tonnes of mustard, phosgene and brombenzyl cyanide charged munitions at locations off the coast of Donegal and 250 miles south west of the coasts of Cork-Kerry.  The material was sealed in scuttled vessels. I have asked the UK authorities for a breakdown of how much material was dumped at each site but I have been informed that regrettably it is not possible to give this information because the relevant records are no longer available.</P>
    <P>The issue of all munitions dumpsites around the Irish coast was considered at the meeting with the UK Ministers.  The <Col N="1568" /> proposal within the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, generally known as OSPAR, to carry out an inventory of all munitions dumpsites was noted.  This will clearly be a matter to be pursued through the Quality Status Report &mdash; QSR &mdash; of OSPAR as well as through bilateral arrangements. The UK authorities indicated that if monitoring of water quality and marine life which they carry out on a regular basis indicates any impact from the various munitions dumpsites in UK waters, consideration will be given to surveys and other investigations.</P>
    <P>On the international front I have also raised this issue with the EU Commissioner and I particularly welcome her intervention.  She has indicated that she intends to raise with the UK Government whether there are issues in relation to the dumpsites which could be solved at Community or international level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I get the impression from the Minister's reply and from his press release last week that the meeting between him and the UK Ministers related more to economic factors than to the health and welfare of people using our seas.  Did the Minister raise the issue of British weapons dumps other than the Beaufort Dyke, including sites off the Donegal coast?  What commitment, if any, did he receive from the UK Ministers?  Did he press for an independent study as opposed to one carried out by the Scottish Office?  In the past the information made available from that office and indeed from the UK Government has been provided on a piecemeal basis.  How can we trust them therefore to carry out this study?  Would it not be more appropriate to employ an independent EU monitoring body to do that work?  Did the Minister raise the issue of alleged British dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea and what commitments, if any, did he receive from the UK Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression that the <Col N="1569" /> discussions with the UK Ministers were confined solely to economic issues is incorrect.  They related primarily to our environmental and safety concerns about the dumpsites.  I can confirm to Deputy Browne that the discussions related not only to the Beaufort Dyke but also to the other dumpsites concerned. We have put forward a proposal through the OSPAR Convention that an inventory of all the dumpsites should be made under the auspices of OSPAR. I am sure Deputy Browne is aware that OSPAR is an international body and, therefore, has an international dimension. We have also requested the assistance of the European Commissioner and she is pursuing the matter with the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>The dumping of nuclear materials has been raised with the UK authorities, who stated there are not any nuclear munitions dumped in the Beaufort Dyke or in the Irish Sea.  We paid particular attention to the Beaufort Dyke dumpsite because it was disturbed during the laying of the gas pipeline.  This resulted in the appearance of canisters from that site on Scottish and Irish coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concern about this issue because it is of major concern to people living near the coast.  What assurances did the Scottish Office give the Minister about securing those dumpsites?  It seems obvious that as time passes the vessels in which materials were dumped will corrode and break up.  More canisters are being washed ashore.  What type of supervisory measures and tests will be put in place to ensure that the washing ashore of such material will not become widespread, particularly along the Cork and Kerry coasts bearing in mind the storms that may be prevalent in winter months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The best scientific evidence available states that if munitions dumpsites are left undisturbed, they will <Col N="1570" /> not pose a danger.  That type of evidence is available in Denmark and Norway where there are similar problems arising from the dumping of munitions in the Skagerrak after the Second World War.  The problem arose in the Beaufort Dyke because the dumpsite was disturbed during the laying of the gas pipeline. There is not any evidence that material has been washed ashore from any of the other dumpsites.  We have proposed through the OSPAR Convention the regular monitoring of those sites, the putting in place of a management regime to deal with them and, as a first step towards that achievement, that an inventory of those sites should be made.  In addition, we have made provision in the Dumping at Sea Bill which is before the Seanad that further dumping of munitions cannot take place in our maritime area.  Under that Bill our maritime area is being extended from 12 miles to 350 miles.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Power</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>when the voluntary early retirement package will commence; the number expected to avail of the offer; and the approximate cost of each redundancy.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5135/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that, following consultations with the PDF representative associations, the voluntary early retirement scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Forces will be introduced in or around May of this year.  The purpose of the VER scheme is to allow the early retirement of up to 2,300 PDF personnel over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to their existing superannuation entitlements of pension and gratuity after 12 years service in the case of officers and after 21 years service in <Col N="1571" /> the case of enlisted personnel, the VER package will provide a once-off, tax free lump sum payment of four weeks pay for each year of potential service up to the age of 60, subject to a cap of 18 months pay.  Personnel who have gratuity entitlements only will receive tax free lump sums of five weeks pay for each year of actual service subject to a cap of 24 months pay.  In this regard £13 million was provided in this year's budget for the projected release of approximately 450 personnel.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that the scheme will be entirely voluntary and to assure the House that all those wishing to avail of VER will be dealt with in a humane and equitable fashion, having regard to both their needs and those of the organisation. It is impossible at this stage to predict precisely how many personnel will wish to avail of the VER scheme, but judging from the reported level of interest in it I am confident that it will make a significant contribution to the restructuring process upon which we have embarked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the voluntary early retirement package is central to the restructuring of our Defence Forces. I am delighted it has been announced. The Minister has gone to great lengths to explain this package is voluntary, but would he not agree that this package will effectively mean redundancy for category C members?  Will he explain the major difference in the capital value of the pension scheme and the voluntary early retirement benefits to which a 35-year-old captain and a 35-year-old sergeant major with 13 years service would be entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This package does not involve redundancy for medical category C personnel.  This is a voluntary scheme and it is a matter for the personnel in that category to decide whether to apply for it.  If they apply for the package they will be dealt with in the same way as other personnel and pressure will not be put on them to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> The difference in the package in regard to different ranks relates to the method by which schemes such as this are applied.  The package will provide a lump sum payment of four weeks pay for each year of potential service up to the age of 60 subject to a cap of 18 months pay.  That applies to personnel who have pension and gratuity entitlements. Those who have gratuity entitlements only &mdash; who do not qualify for a pension &mdash; will receive a tax free lump sum of five weeks pay for each year of actual service subject to a cap of 24 months pay.  Entitlement under the package depends on the member's position and length of service up to age 60. There is no bias under the package.  The lump sum payment of four weeks pay applies to a commissioned officer, an NCO or a private &mdash; the same formula is applied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this package will not be as attractive to a number of members of the Defence Forces as they would have wished?  Will there be any flexibility in the scheme for such members or will it be cut and dried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can honestly say that this package is as good as any other presented in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the ESB package which was struck at a higher level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an entirely different set of circumstances.  I will give the House an example of one of the provisions of this scheme.  A captain aged 39, with 20 years service, whose current annual pay is £24,331, will receive a pension of £10,007, a gratuity of £20,043 and an additional severance gratuity of £36,497.  That is a substantial sum of money paid with a pension immediately to a member aged 39.  I do not think one will find an offer as good as that anywhere else in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be <Col N="1573" /> aware that PDFORRA has indicated that the Department lied to its rank and file members.  Would the Minister agree that great difficulty will be encountered &mdash; as there was some weeks ago interpreting what was or was not a public notice or advertisement &mdash; trying to interpret the term, voluntary redundancy? No doubt the Minister is aware that there are 400 soldiers in category C who will be forced to undergo a medical examination and, perhaps, asked to leave the Army, and 1,400 in category E deemed unfit to operate as soldiers. Given the provisions of this package, how can the Minister maintain it is a voluntary scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat, it is a voluntary early retirement package.  I do not want anybody to think that any member of the Defence Forces will be forced to accept this package no matter what their category.  If they do not apply, they will not be considered; it is entirely voluntary. I cannot understand any allegations of being misled because I have been entirely open with the representative associations each time I met them. I told them that, as soon as I had obtained Cabinet clearance for the package, they would be briefed immediately thereafter.  That occurred immediately following the Cabinet meeting yesterday, when they were met, presented with a report and all details disclosed to them.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned, I pointed out that the problem arising from drug trafficking preoccupies the minds of the people.  Virtually every time I meet people in my constituency they are able to identify to me the problems arising from drug pushing.  I have come to the conclusion that in urban areas gardaí are struggling under the weight of the difficulties created by the drugs problem.  Recently when I was dealing with another matter in Blanchardstown Garda station two unfortunate people who seemed high on drugs were brought into the station by a member of the force.  The gardaí obviously had difficulties coping with these individuals and I see how frustrating it is for them to have to deal repeatedly with similar problems.  It impacts on the wider problems the Minister is attempting to tackle in this Bill such as getting people to court, getting convictions and putting people into prison.  The gardaí find that many convicted people are sent back to the community because of health problems and are soon back on the streets.</P>
      <P>One of the points I wish to explore is how we should deal with the source of the drugs problems.  The United Nations should take the initiative on the worldwide approach to this problem.  At the moment countries have to expend a vast amount of money in combating the drugs problems, on the provision of customs officers, drug squads, courts, prison spaces, and in dealing with burglaries and break-ins and so on.  To deal with the problem at source would cost less.  The United States and some of the South American countries took decisive action in the past and I think we need to focus on them.  I do not know of a function the United Nations could have over and above its peacekeeping role, if not in playing an active role, supported by member states, to tackle the known source of most of the drugs problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her opening address on Second Stage the Minister qualified the need to protect the rights of people held in detention for seven days by the Garda Síochána, but she weakened this Bill substantially by removing the provision <Col N="1671" /> in my colleague Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill for only a request by the Garda for detention.  She has ensured that the gardaí at an early stage of the investigations must provide justifiable reasons for a seven day detention.  That will prove to be a substantial obstacle to what the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon, a Fine Gael Deputy, suggested that we go beyond the directive to attempt to give effect to what we accept are the measures needed to tackle the problem. Perhaps some recognition should be given to the fact that as a member state we cannot address the problem at source, given the powers available which have not proved successful, and in these circumstances perhaps there should be a more severe regime.  Every country is afflicted by the problem of drugs.  We accept that the Minister must comply with EU directives, but there is still a weakness in the legislation and it should be addressed in another forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Dr. Woods, outlined the multilateral groupings of various organisations attempting to deal with the drugs problem in his constituency.  I had occasion to meet the Minister for Health during a discussion on the Eastern Health Board's intention to locate a methadone and needle exchange clinic in my constituency.  I subsequently ended up on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; discussing the drugs problem with medical experts and a lady whose son had committed suicide as a result of his drugs habit.  The medical experts suggested that the current method of treatment is deplorably bad and the Protocol we introduced now to be given effect by the Minister for Health, is taking far too long to implement and the provision of methadone and help for those who need help is inadequate.  Someone mentioned on the programme &mdash; I am not sure if this <Col N="1672" /> is factual &mdash; that the Eastern Health Board is not in a position to spend the £1 million allocated to that problem in the last financial year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has to deal with the crime problem arising from drug use.  The body of opinion on that programme was that there is a relationship between crime and the drugs habit. Young men at various stages in trying to break the drugs habit were filmed brazenly describing the break-ins and burglaries of houses and shops and the havoc they were wreaking on urban communities.</P>
    <P>The drugs seized at Urlingford, and other large drugs seizures are valued at vast sums of money.  I do not understand from where the money comes to buy them.  It is not in poor urban areas that one can find hundreds of millions of pounds from the sale of drugs.  The people in my constituency for instance would not be in a position, unless they are involved in crime, to purchase drugs. Drug pushing seems to be spreading to a much wider pool of potential customers. It is generally recognised that in various entertainment locations drugs are freely available.  It appears we all know where the problems are and where drugs can be obtained by young people who are being enticed to take them, but we do not seem to be able to get to the source, those who bring drugs into the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister would probably agree that there is an inter-relationship problem between customs and excise and the Garda.  The Garda would have the support of all Members in trying to get to the people who are importing drugs.  I would ask the Minister to bring some cohesion into that area.  There is a perception that customs and excise and the Garda are operating on different agendas but I understand various efforts at co-ordination are being made.  The problem is greater than the need for success of either arm of the State.  The problem affects all of society and whatever cohesion is necessary in that area should be achieved.  I presume that is a <Col N="1673" /> matter for the Ministers for Justice and Finance.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will address the drugs problem, which is increasingly affecting my constituency.  Some of the provisions in my colleague's Bill might be incorporated in this Bill on Committee Stage. The Minister has already made some comments about possible changes on Committee Stage.  Whatever strengthening measures are needed should be readily agreed.  The Minister should err on the side of the heavy hand in this matter.  I agree that the portfolio which she carries is complex and demanding and is never out of the headlines these days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the problem is dominating our headlines all too often.  There is no doubt that the drug problem is creating many other headaches for the Minister in her Department, for the Garda, the prison system and the courts.  The cycle is never ending.</P>
      <P>I had a telephone call from a father yesterday whose son &mdash; a young married man with a child &mdash; is on drugs.  I understand he made a brave attempt to get off the drugs and was on some course or other.  Now he is trying to be admitted to Cherry Orchard.  The problem there is one of a lack of space and resources. It is a never ending problem.  The father was painting a picture of a young man of 23 or 24 years of age who has now come back to live in his home.  He also has younger children.  This is hell for that family.  As Deputy Upton said, 8,000 people are afflicted by this problem in the area between the canals.  The provision of resources should be a priority.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the introduction of the Bill.  I hope that Committee Stage amendments will be accepted and that there will be a decisive step in tackling this dreadful problem in our society.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the debate yesterday, particularly to Deputy John O'Donoghue, the Opposition spokesman on justice and law reform, on whose contribution I wish to comment briefly.  It would appear that Democratic Left is occupying his every waking moment and his every nightmare.  If Deputy O'Donoghue continues to say that Democratic Left is responsible for everything that goes wrong, he must equally accept that it must take credit for everything that goes right.  This is all about balance and people do not always see it in the same light as politicians.  Democratic Left is not soft on crime.  We intend to keep the integrity of the judicial system intact. We do not see much wrong with bringing people being interrogated before judges at regular intervals to ensure that the legislation is workable and will stand up to scrutiny both inside and outside the country.  We are duty bound to observe human rights.</P>
      <P>The Government as a whole is committed to maintaining the integrity of the judicial system and to ensuring that persons are not arbitrarity detained at a whim.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, Democratic Left and its partners in Government do not intend to go down that road.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill since it represents a well thought out and balanced approach to the issue of drug trafficking. The link between drugs and crime is incontrovertible.  It is estimated that around 80 per cent of all petty crime in urban areas is committed by drug abusers. We need to emphasise that.  The measures contained in this Bill will make life a great deal more difficult for the drug dealers who are preying on our young people in every city, town and village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reassure Deputy O'Donoghue, in the unlikely event that the noises he made last night were an expression of sincere concern rather than political opportunism, that Democratic Left is not soft on crime nor has it ever been.  When we look at the problem of those who are addicted to drugs and those who supply them with drugs <Col N="1675" /> we should not look at it as a purely judicial, legalistic and Department of Justice problem.  If one considers the areas that have the greatest concentration of drug addicts one will see it is as much an economic and a deprivation issue as it is a drugs problem. If the reality is to wake up every morning to nothing, with no prospects, no luxuries, no work and nothing to occupy one's time, then drugs are a better reality.  We need to address it from that point of view and not just say we have to cure these people of their addiction.  The only way to keep people off drugs is by creating a better reality for them.</P>
    <P>My party believes that every crime must carry an appropriate punishment which should be fully implemented.  I have said this time and again but it does not seem to sink in.  While safeguarding the rights of the innocent, it is vital that persons convicted of a crime serve the sentence handed down by the court. From time to time I believe we sentence the wrong people.  Those who are sentenced must serve the sentence.  It is unacceptable that persons should be released on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis after serving just a few months.  There is now an urgent need to review the operation of the temporary release system, not simply in regard to drug related offences but all other serious offences.  I forgot to mention at the outset that I wish to share my time with Deputy Ring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for the first time I urge the Minister to consider establishing a parole board.  That is referred to in the programme for Government.  It is now urgently required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not continue to view prisons as instruments of containment but as instruments of rehabilitation.  There is little point in continuing to imprison offenders who when released are in the same position as when they were first imprisoned.  When we hear people calling for prisoners to be flogged, one <Col N="1676" /> might be forgiven for thinking the current regime in prisons is better than the life they left.  That attitude must be examined and, if it is widely held we must consider how we order society and what we are offering these people.</P>
    <P>A co-ordinated policy of sentence management should be devised for each prisoner to ensure the pattern of offending and reoffending is broken.  With regard to drug related offences, we need to catch drug addicts at the beginning rather than at the end of the abuse cycle.  We must ensure that the first contact drug addicts have with the State is with the social and medical services, not the judical system.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with many of the issues surrounding the supply of drugs but we also need to address the question of demand.  Previous Governments failed miserably in this regard.  The Minister for Health is to be congratulated on the initiative he launched recently.  Many people continue to wait for what is literally life saving treatment which would not only save the life of the addict but would reduce the suffering of thousands of victims of drug abusers.  If these were ordinary patients suffering from some form of organic disease, there would be a national outcry.  Instead, we turn a blind eye until we are confronted with the effects of drug abuse in the form of crime and anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Drugs, like any other product, are subject to the laws of the market. Ecstasy is currently available in Cork city.  Its price fluctuates but it is decreasing. I was told recently that youngsters as young as 11,12,13 and 14 years are being offered ecstasy tablets as a recreational drug free of charge.  That is typical of what happened in other countries yet we allow it happen here.  I hear similar stories from people I have no reason to disbelieve, decent, honest people trying to bring up their families who have chased the pushers from their areas.  They always return.  Why are they not being arrested?  I do not believe we must wait to get the godfathers or the godmothers &mdash; there is equality in this game.  Why do the gardaí not obviously <Col N="1677" /> patrol the areas where these drug pushers are located?  They do not hide, their presence in communities is very obvious.  I do not believe in the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow theory. We should harass those people and put them in jail.  If the market dries up, there will be no need for the godfathers.</P>
    <P>Many young people do not view ecstasy tablets as real drugs until they suffer their side effects.  There is a clear need for a frank, no holds barred education and information programme similar to the successful Manchester initiative.  This problem is not just about justice nor does it relate to a particular Department; it is about health and education. We must reach vulnerable people before they enter the abuse cycle.</P>
    <P>This Bill will go a long way towards making life difficult for the thugs who ply their deadly trade on the streets.  I particularly welcome the increased participation of customs and excise officers in questioning persons detained under the relevant provisions of the 1984 Act. One of the problems in the past has been lack of co-operation between the Garda and the customs services.  There are, however, other supply related issues which need to be urgently addressed.  Ireland is not a producer of drugs.  We do not manufacture ecstasy, nor do we grow either marijuana or poppies.  The drugs consumed on our streets are imported and we must address the question of trade both in the countries of origin and at the point of entry.  All illegal drugs are imported and in this regard I hope Ireland, together with our EU partners, will address the problem of ecstasy flowing into the EU from eastern European countries such as Czechoslovakia and Romania.  Marijuana and cannabis resin are imported from North Africa and Central Asia while heroin is imported from South America.</P>
    <P>The drugs trade is alive and well in the global village.  Drug abuse is the greatest health issue facing our society and because of its illicit nature, we do not know precisely the number of <Col N="1678" /> people affected.  We know, however, that the number of addicts and potential addicts is increasing.  We owe it to those people, their families, to society and to ourselves to ensure this problem is tackled on an international as well as a national basis.  Pressure must be exerted on those jurisdictions ranging from the Channel Islands to the Bahamas to the Seychelles which allow drug traffickers launder their profits in return for a healthy kickback.</P>
    <P>Drug producing countries enjoy pariah status; the same status should apply to those jurisdictions which do not dirty their hands with the powder or the resin but gleefully accept foreign exchanges from known international drug barons. If we are to tackle the drug traffickers and the drug lords, we must insist that our international counterparts put pressure on the countries which allow them launder their ill-gotten gains.</P>
    <P>We must take this issue seriously but it is not the responsibility of one Department.  We whould first consider the educational aspect, although I realise objections will be made on the basis of the age at which a child should be given certain information.  The drug pushers do not raise any such objections; they do not care what age the child is when they are pushing drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Justice on bringing this important legislation before the House.  The problem of drug abuse was not tackled by previous Governments and perhaps if this legislation had been put in place earlier, many of the people now importing drugs and damaging the lives of our young people would be behind bars. Nobody can say we do not have a drugs problem.  Drugs are freely available in every village, town and city and I am glad this legislation will empower the Garda to apprehend the people importing drugs here because for too long the criminals have held the power. At last the Garda Síochána will have these powers.  I see nothing wrong in introducing whatever legislation is <Col N="1679" /> necessary &mdash; we can amend or withdraw it later on &mdash; to take on these criminals. I am amazed that the criminals selling these drugs, who are known by the Garda and live in big houses, are at the same time drawing social welfare payments. I hope these days are over and that the criminals can be put behind bars.</P>
      <P>We have been critical of the Garda Síochána and the customs &mdash; customs officers have never got the respect or praise they deserved &mdash; in the past. However, they made a number of drug finds, particularly off the west coast and County Wexford.  Every time these seizures are made, more of our young people may have been saved from this scourge.  It is time we used every State resource to stop this trade.  I agree with Deputy Lynch; it is not only one Department's problem.  It affects everybody and we should use the Garda, the customs and the Army to tackle these dangerous and vicious criminals who are making a lot of money from this trade. It will not be easy but it must be done.</P>
      <P>Community groups set up in Dublin took on known drug sellers and protested outside their houses in a lawful way.  The groups knew these people were selling drugs but the Garda did not have the evidence to put them behind bars.  I compliment the groups, they have a part to play with the Garda, which is why it is important to have local gardaí living in an area.  They will get the necessary information from the local people if they understand, work with and know them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to comments about the Minister for Justice in county council, urban district council and Dáil contributions. While the Minister has overall responsibility for the Garda and its commissioner, she is not responsible for its day to day operations.  It was not the Minister or her immediate predecessors but the Garda Commissioner and his senior superintendents who put rurally based gardaí into towns.  When I ask the Minister why gardaí removed from Achill, Belmullet or Bangor have not been <Col N="1680" /> replaced, she will say she has been told by the superintendent of the area that the necessary manpower is already there.  The Minister has taken much flak on a matter for which she has no responsibility and it is time she and her Department spelt that out.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner also has a responsibility to the Minister; I am sure she meets him on a regular basis.  The Minister should tell him that the Dáil wants to see a return to the form of rural policing we had in the past.  Previous commissioners should not be afraid to admit their mistakes &mdash; they made a lot of them.  Their major mistake was in taking gardaí out of rural areas and off the beat.  It is a tourist attraction to see a garda on the beat in some parts of my constituency because they are usually in squad cars.</P>
    <P>I asked about having gardaí patrolling the Shannon last year and many people thought I was joking.  I have been stopped by gardaí on my way to the Dáil in the last few months, I am glad to see checkpoints as they give people the confidence that the Garda are in evidence and know who is travelling in these regions.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister brought this Bill before the Dáil.  I know she is caring and wants to take on those evil people involved in the drug trade.  The working class, the unemployed and the weaker members in our society are being targeted by these people, who do not care from whom they get their money.  I wish the Minister well with this Bill.  Ireland is taking over the EU Presidency in July and I hope the Minister will talk to her European counterparts and ask them to take the same action as this Government. I ask the Minister to devise ways of stopping drug smuggling across our seas.  Many of our lighthouses are empty and we could employ people on FÁS schemes to watch our seas for drug smugglers.</P>

      <P>I only had the opportunity to read this Bill in detail today. My first conclusion was that it is suspiciously like Part I of a Fianna Fáil Bill <Col N="1681" /> promulgated in this House a few weeks ago.  I reread that Bill and compared it with this one and I took the opportunity to read the debate on that Bill.  I noticed the Minister was upset about some criticism she seemed to take personally.  I like the Minister and any criticism and advice I make will be exclusively political; it will be business, not personal.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill debated in the House a few weeks ago, which has been effectively buried by the Government and replaced by this much weaker effort, contained three Parts. The first Part dealt with matters which concern the totality of this legislation, the second Part dealt with preliminary examinations, speeding up the trial process, while the third Part dealt with the scandal of temporary releases, which we all know have now become permanent.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a pale imitation and a grossly watered down version of Part I of the Fianna Fáil Bill which the Government tacitly, or at least verbally, accepted but refused to proceed to Second Stage on the basis that it was introducing legislation on the matter. The Fianna Fáil Bill was infinitely more robust, effective and decisive than this watered down version.</P>
      <P>That might be explicable or rational if Ireland was a relatively crime free paradise and that we mainly needed to concern ourselves with civil liberties. However, we all know the reverse is the case.  The increase in crime has already been well published already; I will not go back over these figures because they have been well articulated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have figures that will further illustrate the extent of the drug problem, especially that of the more dangerous drugs, in this country.  The 1994 Garda report indicates that seizures of heroin increased by 232 per cent over the 1993 figures and the 1994 seizures for ecstasy <Col N="1682" /> increased by a staggering 1,327 per cent over the 1993 figures.  From 1993 to 1995, heroin seizures increased from 123,000 tonnes to 3.4 million tonnes and ecstasy from 34,000 tonnes to 353,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Following the appearance of reports in Sunday newspapers on the introduction of crack cocaine in Dublin I raised the matter on the Adjournment.  There have been further reports since then. This extremely dangerous drug, arguably the most dangerous in circulation, is on sale for £20 a deal.  It induces paranoia in the user who instantly becomes psychotic and experiences an irresistible impulse to indulge in mindless violence of the most extreme type.  When it was introduced in a number of local authority housing estates in Birmingham and Liverpool they became no-go areas within a period of three months.  There are documented cases in the United States where users of this drug shot dead the first person they met on the street, be they children, by-passers or by-standers.  That is an illustration of how dangerous it is.  It is being manufactured at a number of indentifiable locations in the north inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter on the Adjournment I received the usual complacent and bland non-response, that the problem was only at the embryonic stage, that it was not out of control as yet and that I did not need to worry too much.  The Garda Síochána estimates that the quantity of drugs seized accounts for 10 per cent of the total quantity in circulation.  This gives us some idea of the frightening extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>The problems documented by the Garda Síochána and reported by a vigilant media provide a chilling backdrop against which the Government has acted out a drama of constant and relentless inactivity.  For the first seven months of its tenure in office it refused to face reality and admit that there was a drug induced crime crisis because it was locked in an ideological conflict which, unfortunately, did not take place <Col N="1683" /> exclusively behind closed doors.  It was fought on the front pages of some of the national newspapers through anonymous spokesmen.  Day in and day out stories were put out by one of the parties in Government to do down the others.  They were acting like the Borgias on a bad day.</P>
    <P>This slapstick was finally brought to a conclusion by the holding of a summit to tell the people that the penny had finally dropped and that the Government realised there was a crime problem. My most abiding recollection of that summit was the large newspaper photographs of a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Justice, the most prominent of whom was &ldquo;near Minister&rdquo; Rabbitte who had a look of studied concern on his face.  As we are all aware, his behaviour when in Opposition was the essence of irresponsibility; he was not beyond engaging in slapstick and throwing the occasional wounding jibe across the floor of the House and the fact that it had no basis in reality was only a technicality.</P>

      <P>On the day of the summit he had a look of concern on his face. The image created for the media was that this was a man determined to reinforce law and order whatever the cost and with whom the penny had finally dropped, that there was a crime problem.  Alas, it was a false dawn, an optical illusion.  Unfortunately, eight months of silence followed.</P>
      <P>Fifteen months on after much deliberation, infighting and prevarication the Government has finally given its response.  Any objective observer would have to conclude after a careful reading of this legislation that the elephantine struggle produced a gnat.  That is the only effect it will have on the rise in drug related crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill comprised three Parts.  This legislation is a pale imitation of Part I.  I have studied carefully <Col N="1684" /> the report of the debate on Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill to see what the Government's objections were in not accepting his much more realistic and robust proposals.  One of the excuses offered was that the Bill did not include the right of access to a solicitor.  The Minister's advisers should know that this has been held by the Supreme Court to be an unenumerated constitutional right and it is patently absurd to suggest that any legislation which does not specifically contain this right runs the risk of being declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>There is a large number of unenumerated constitutional rights laid down by the Supreme Court since 1937 and all legislation has to be read in the light of these.  If all legislation, as the Minister seems to suggest, has to contain all these rights, the legislative process would be very tedious.  I can only conclude that this was only a spurious or throw-away objection to make the illusion that the Government had a substantive case.</P>
    <P>Another excuse offered for refusing to accept the more effective proposals in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill was that the courts would not be able to define what was meant by a substantial offence.  Apart from the common-sense observation that any judge who could not understand the difference between a substantial and insubstantial offence should not be on the Bench, this was a blatant, obvious and deliberate misrepresentation. Are the Minister and her advisers not aware of the fact that the Constitution includes the concept of a minor offence, a person is entitled to trial by jury where the offence is not considered to be minor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy would not mean to imply that the Minister was guilty of a deliberate misrepresentation.  That is tantamount to saying it was a lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your strictures. The fact remains that there is a huge number of recorded court decisions on what constitutes a minor offence.  The <Col N="1685" /> people who framed the Constitution did not anticipate that the courts would have any difficulty in defining what was meant by a minor offence.  That has proved to be the case.</P>
      <P>The Minister also raised doubts about the question of the grounds on which the legislation would be renewed and the procedures involved.  That was a spurious objection and a matter which could have been debated, and the Bill amended, on Committee Stage if the Minister had a stateable case.</P>
      <P>This Bill can be criticised as much for what it does not contain as much as it can for what it does contain.  Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill contained proposals to deal with the scandal of early or temporaty releases which are now permanent and to which the Minister's response was that no legislation was necessary.  She said that she had a major programme to &ldquo;increase very substantially the amount of prison accommodation&rdquo;. She will not be able to provide many extra prison spaces with the £3.5 million provided in the Estimates.  It is pathetic that a Government which has added £1 billion to the national debt can only find £3.5 million to provide extra prison accommodation to vindicate the rights of victims of crime and protect the people.</P>
      <P>The Minister's second objection to this Part of the Bill gave the game away. She said that the proposals in Part III of our Bill on prison accommodation were &ldquo;outside the scope of the long title to the Bill&rdquo;.  Heaven forbid that a measure to tackle the crime problem or the scandal of early releases would be accepted if it were outside the scope of the long title of the Bill.  We have had a series of spurious, empty and shabby alibis for inaction caused by paralysis which, in turn, was caused by ideologicl conflict.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, also participated in the debate on our Bill.</P>

      <P>She was excessively concerned about protecting the rights of <Col N="1686" /> suspected drug dealers and emphasised the need to strike a balance in that regard.  Of course, drug peddlers have rights and we must be careful to protect them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, who fancies herself as the Las Passionaria of the Labour Party, offered the following immortal lines when she sought to chide those who were too strong on law and order.  She stated that in some jurisdictions where there was excessive reaction the balance swung away from civil liberties and in others the cautious development of legislation collapsed as the verdicts were overthrown and the Judiciary brought into disrepute through miscarriages of justice. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, would like to say, on her behalf, what that means.  It sounds like the title to an essay and should be followed by the words, &ldquo;please explain&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's proposals on the right of customs officers to question suspects are a joke and add nothing to the present unsatisfactory position.  We proposed that customs officers should have exclusive rights to question drug trafficking suspects.  As customs officials are usually the first people to meet those <Col N="1687" /> individuals when they intercept the vessels on which they are travelling, they should have a right to question them. Customs officers have been calling for this power for many years but the Minister avoided the issue and said she may introduce regulations at some indeterminable time in the future to allow them participate in the questioning carried out by gardaí.  What purpose will that serve?  Does the Minister believe a customs official would be able to ask a more perceptive question than an experienced garda?  What customs officials want and is glaringly required is the right for customs officials to question suspects when they intercept them. It is a question of when, not whether, they can question them.  The proposal that they may be present and participate in the questioning of suspects detained by gardaí is meaningless and will not serve any purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill is limited and disappointing and there is no indication that matters will improve.  In the previous debate the Minister referred to herself &mdash; I hope tongue in cheek &mdash; as &ldquo;superwoman&rdquo;. She may sometimes contrive to look like superwoman but she thinks and acts like Jack Frost.  Apparently it is fixed Government policy that prevarication and paralysis will continue to substitute for action, clichés will continue to substitute for hard decisions and vacuous empty promises will continue to substitute for necessary reforms.  The Government Press Office, particularly under the tutelage of a certain prominent non-clean shaven adviser to the Tánaiste &mdash; a gentleman who would qualify as a first-class honours graduate of the Josef Goebbels school of news management &mdash; will continue to regurgitate the same old tired useless propaganda.  I can visualise the headlines: &ldquo;Crime is at the top of the Government's agenda&rdquo;; &ldquo;Minister intends to get tough on drug pushers&rdquo;; &ldquo;Substantial increase in prison places&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Revolutionary programme of criminal law reform&rdquo;.  Such statements and the dross that is churned out of the Government Press Office has <Col N="1688" /> about as much value as the rubbish churned out of the famous loudspeakers in Orwell's <i>1984</i> and is about half as believable.  The Minister remains firmly wedded to the policy of acting like a stopped clock, but the painful reality for the people is that criminals will continue to be cosseted and the innocent will continue to suffer.</P>

      <P>I welcome this long overdue legislation.  Were it not for the change of Government and the Minister's desire to put an end to the scourge of the drug problem, I doubt if this legislation would ever have reached the House.  I will refer to Deputy O'Dea's remarks later.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem did not occur overnight or in the past decade.  For much longer drugs have been imported illegally by sea, air and land.  The Minister must ensure that effective anti-crime legislation is enacted without delay.  I am pleased the Government is determined to do everything possible to annihilate this deadly scourge to humanity.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers the comprehensive anti-drugs package which the Government announced last year. I am pleased that powers of detention are being increased and that there will be a maximum period of detention of up to seven days.  This is a step in the right direction and should have been introduced in legislation much sooner.  The Bill also provides that further periods of detention, after the first 48 hours, may be authorised by a court before whom the person detained must be brought.  It also provides for the detention of persons apprehended and arrested for drug trafficking offences where it is suspected that they have concealed drugs on their person.  This will deal with the so-called stuffers and swallowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the issue of warrants in drug trafficking cases and will allow customs officers to be present at. <Col N="1689" /> and participate in, the questioning of suspects detained by the Garda for drug trafficking offences.  The problem of drug trafficking can only be tackled through legislation which enables the Garda to take effective action in tandem with customs officers.  It is very important to maintain the strength of the customs service at the highest level possible.  The decision taken in the past to amalgamate customs posts should be reviewed with a view to reopening posts which were actively involved in dealing with the scourge of drugs.  A previous Government took the unwise decision to close down the customs posts in Castletownbere and Kinsale in County Cork and to amalgamate the post in Castletownbere with the one in Bantry. There are 32 miles of coastline between Bantry and Castletownbere, a major fishery port on the south west coastline with huge trawler and tourism activity and trade.  It is vitally important that this post is reopened immediately so that it can police the long stretch of coastline from Bantry to the Dursey Sound and as far as the Kenmare river estuary.</P>
    <P>Bantry Bay is one of the biggest in western Europe and at one time Her Majesty's Government boasted that it was capable of holding the entire British fleet.  The policing of the piers, harbours and landing places in that bay is of paramount importance in curbing illegal drug trafficking.  The closure of customs posts, thus allowing drug barons and pushers to operate with ease and without detection, was a penny spared and a pound foolish.  The decision to dispense with the surveillance provided by customs officials at ports left many loopholes which have been taken advantage of by illegal operators.  The Minister should consider expanding the service to include all major bays along the coastline, particularly in south west Cork, south west Kerry and along the western sea board.  She might be wise to consider the establishment of a surveillance force similar to the old coast watch protection force established during the Emergency and which rendered <Col N="1690" /> such valuable service to the nation between 1939-45.</P>
    <P>The silly decision taken approximately five years ago to automate lighthouses played into the hands of drug traffickers and smugglers.  When lighthouses were manned all sailing vessels and craft were immediately logged.  This information was available to the Garda and customs officers to help them in their efforts to tackle the major problem of drug smuggling.  There would be no drug pushers in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Galway, Limerick and other major towns and villages if the source of supply was cut off.  This would save the country millions of pounds and solve the problem of drug abuse.  Society has suffered severely since the automation of lighthouses because regardless of how good it is, automation will never be as observant as lighthouse keepers who helped track down illegal craft and report their presence to the Garda and customs officials who apprehended them.</P>
    <P>What provision has the Minister made in the legislation to ensure that customs officials and gardaí in coastal stations have access to speedboat facilities in their fight against this criminal activity?  How well equipped are they to intercept unidentified yachts or sailing ships which enter these bays?  It should be possible to deploy a naval patrol boat in the areas most prone to drug importation, along the south west and western sea boards.  This would enable illegal craft to be monitored, tracked down and boarded to ensure they did not carry illegal drugs which are sounding the death knell of society in this and other EU countries.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Deputy O'Dea refer to the problems associated with crack cocaine, one of the numerous drugs which has found its way into Europe.  This problem did not occur overnight; it had and incubation period of approximately 20 years and only came to light when it was discovered that a huge volume of drugs were readily available in towns and cities.  Successive Governments sat idly by and did not <Col N="1691" /> tackle the problem, they ignored it in the hope that it would go away.  A problem will not go away unless it is dealt with, and this is where successive Governments have failed.  Deputy O'Dea criticised the Minister's policy over the past 15 months.  What did his Government and previous Fianna Fáilled Government do?  They sat idly by and implied this problem only arose at the change of Government last December twelve months.  It has built up over decades.  Now it is a time bomb. We are all aware of the amount of damage it has done to our society and to western civilisation as a whole.  It has not done much damage to oriental civilisations because drug barons there are executed, and that works in that part of the globe.  Under European law, however, decisions made by judges here are increasingly referred to the European Court of Human Rights.  I would ask the judges who sit in the European Court of Human Rights what rights the unfortunate youth and citizens of this country have to protect themselves from the scourge of the drug barons and drug pushers operating here.</P>
    <P>Legislation must be introduced to ensure that the punishment for drug offenders fits the crime.  The Minister has gone a long way on this road.  The Opposition should applaud and congratulate her on the vision and wisdom she displayed in bringing before this House measures to counteract the menace that has struck our civilisation.  I hope those Deputies will have the guts to thank the Minister for introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil spokesman on crime, Deputy O'Donoghue from Kerry, also played his part in introducing his Bill.  It copperfastens what was incorporated in the Fianna Fáil Bill but goes further in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea criticised the Minister because she spent only £3.5 million on the creation of extra prison spaces in the last budget, but what amount of money did the Fianna Fáil Party provide for extra prison space during its lengthy <Col N="1692" /> period in office?  Before criticising this legislation Deputy O'Dea and his colleagues should peruse the details of it. Deputy O'Dea made the sniping remark that the Minister thinks and acts like Jack Frost.  Such comparisons should be applied more to himself than to any other Deputy in this House.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this legislation and ensuring that, for the first time in the history of the State, we have a concrete policy to combat this major drug menace.  I hope the Minister will take on board the points I made and see to it that the drug barons who have been operating at will for the last four years are arrested.  Once the source of supply is cut off, there will be no need for extra gardaí to deal with drugs in our capital and other major cities.  Cutting off the source of supply will deal the first blow in curbing a serious menace to society.</P>

      <P>It is with a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> that I speak on this topic.  If Deputy Sheehan and I are still here in two or three years' time we will make similar speeches about the same problems because they do not seem to go away. There is a sense of desperation among the people.  Dublin 8, in my constituency has the worst drug problem in Ireland, and the sense of frustration and fear among people is tangible.</P>
      <P>I called to a number of houses last week.  During the course of my visits an elderly lady who had moved into a magnificent new home from the flat complexes of the inner city, tearfully asked me if there was any possibility of getting an alarm installed in her house directly linked to the Garda station.  She had been burgled so many times that she is literally punch drunk.  She is in a state of shock and I do not know things will ever get better for her.  That is how the people of our city and country are living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a young man waiting for his friend outside the Bank of Ireland opposite Trinity College was approached by two young men aged about 25, one of whom threatened him <Col N="1693" /> with a syringe if he did hand over his money.  He had about £20 on him which he handed over.  The criminal looked at his student identification card and asked where he lived.  The lad told him where he lived and the criminal interestingly enough, gave him back enough money to get a bus home because he lived quite a few miles outside the city.  He told the young man he knew where he lived, that he knew his face and would recognise him, and if he reported the incident, he would see to it that the young man would never again be in a position to go to the Garda.  These people operate quite coolly in the centre of Dublin. Who knows how many young people have been terrorised in this manner? This young man did not report the incident to the Garda. I heard about the matter from my son who knows the young man in question.  I do not wish to be dramatic but society is being torn apart by these people.  If they are caught they may be sentenced to two years in prison but they are released after serving two months.  Nobody is prepared to give evidence against them.  I do not blame people for that as if these criminals are put in prison their friends go after those who gave evidence against them.  Drug pushers must be given long sentences.</P>
    <P>Criminals with HIV who threaten people with syringes should be charged with attempted murder and be given a life sentence.  We can imagine the fear and anxiety of a person who receives a jab of a needle from someone who says he or she is HIV positive.</P>
    <P>It is not worth living in this kind of society.  We must stop thinking about the rights of the perpetrators of crime but the rights of the victim.  Some years ago I took part in a debate in Blackhall Place.  The person debating opposite me was then President of the High Court who has since retired.  I was talking about the need for the law to be subservient to justice but he argued that justice must be subservient to the law and it is up to the legislators to make the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> Sometimes legislation is not interpreted in the spirit in which we intend it to be when passed.  One example of that is the law on bail.  I was the first Member of the House to call for consecutive sentences for crimes committed while on bail.  I said sentences should be imposed for every crime committed by a person while on bail.  The maximum that can be imposed is two sentences and now there is a question mark over that.</P>
    <P>The Government is reluctant to put a referendum on bail to the people asking them to allow the courts refuse bail in cases where the gardaí are satisfied people will reoffend.  Under the Constitution such criminals must be given bail on the grounds that one cannot predict if they will commit another crime.  The biggest issue in my constituency is crime.  People are not safe in their homes and are afraid to go out.  They are afraid when their children go out. We live in the shadow of impending disaster from other areas but not a weekend goes by without a taxi driver or busman being attacked.  Even in daylight people's homes are robbed and they are held up in the street.  I compliment the Garda on their bravery particularly in the inner city area where community gardaí have weekly meetings with people.  The must feel intimidated as drug pushers know them.  The least we can do is introduce the necessary legislation to back them up.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that seven days detention sounds draconian but that is rubbish.  What is happening to the people is draconian and we must take a tough line on it.  I would not object if a state of emergency were declared.  The Garda must be given the right to enter and search dance halls and other premises. The Minister said she will shortly amend the 1935 Act to allow them enter dance halls in plain clothes.  What does it take to introduce such an amendment? Young gardaí dressed like other young people could enter such premises and if drugs are available the premises should be closed down.  It is not sufficient for the owner to say the premises <Col N="1695" /> were rented out for the night.  The owner is responsible for the club and makes sufficient money to enable him to hire security personnel or, if necessary, pay the costs involved in having the Garda check those going into the dance.</P>
    <P>I do not like using dramatic expressions but a war is being waged.  I am not looking for headlines but pleading for action from the Minister.  We must stop treating these thugs gently.  I ask the Minister to amend the 1935 Act as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards seizing the property of drug addicts, Deputy O'Donoghue stated on 28 February that the powers to confiscate cash on suspicion that it is the proceeds of drug trafficking are contained in the 1994 Act, yet section 44 which sets out the sum which can be seized has never been brought into operation.  Why?  Deputy O'Donoghue said that the bottleneck of promises and instances of talk but no action all confirm a legislative veto.  In 15 months which saw savage criminality we have been given one diluted Bill.  He said the issue of bail which is at the top of every other agenda is receiving &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;. Other phrases used in connection with the issue include &ldquo;study&rdquo;; &ldquo;it is being assessed&rdquo;; &ldquo;it is under review&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;it is nearing completion&rdquo;; &ldquo;it is contemplated&rdquo;; &ldquo;it is under active management&rdquo;; &ldquo;proposals will emanate from the Government soon&rdquo;; &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;; &ldquo;they are imminent&rdquo;; &ldquo;awaited&rdquo; and &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;.  People are dying emotionally and withdrawing into themselves.  Why must people who have reached their 60s, 70s or 80s live in fear? Why must I, as a member of Dublin Corporation, talk to the committees in the flat complexes, in which drug dealers can operate so easily, about the possibility of knocking down these buildings and replacing them with houses at a huge cost?</P>
    <P>In addition to the cost of setting up clinics &mdash; I praise the Government on the work it is doing and the Department of Health for setting up drug clinics to <Col N="1696" /> treat addicts crying out for help &mdash; we are also spending money building houses and policing the areas.  In the past week or two 300 drug dealers have been picked up in the Dublin 8 area alone, which is wonderful.  However, they will be out in two weeks' time as there is no place for them.  These drug dealers, who have no respect for or fear of the law, are laughing.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled as to how people get drugs into Mountjoy.  Each day we read about how they are freely available.  Is it because people believe that if prisoners do not get drugs and they go cold turkey, there will be riots? Some will say that these people should be given all the drugs they need so they will not steal. That is not an argument which I, or many people, support.  However, it must be examined when one sees the horrors being perpetrated on our people.  If these people cannot get drugs free from somewhere, they will steal from anyone, including their families.  The demand for drugs cannot be satisfied and these people must be taken off the streets.  We need army camp type accommodation for certain prisoners and to provide places for drug addicts.</P>
    <P>We must implement the law whereby the property of those who have been convicted of selling drugs and who cannot prove how they paid for their house or car to the Revenue Commissioners can be confiscated.  Perhaps the Minister might say if any property has been confiscated. Are we still stuck on the section which states that we must set out the sum which can be seized? If a person is not employed, known to the Garda and has been convicted of selling drugs, we should confiscate his property.</P>
    <P>I have been told &mdash; I do not know if it is true &mdash; that the Revenue Commissioners fear intimidation and are afraid to implement this Act.  Because so much money is involved in the drugs trade, the corruption of society is possible. It has happened in other countries and it can happen here, particularly in a recession where businesses are in trouble.  We must take action to protect <Col N="1697" /> citizens.  It is all very well talking about co-operation with our European partners, but we must look after the people. We owe children and old people a better way of life.  There is pressure on children to take drugs and we must deal with this problem firmly.  We should use draconian measures to protect the victims in society because we have failed and we cannot continue to do so.  I hope that I, or somebody else, will not stand up here in two or three years' time and say the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to underestimate the level of concern about this problem which rightly exists in the House, but as a Deputy who represents a Dublin constituency I have a particular interest.  It is well known that the misuse of drugs has been a growing problem for a number of years. However, one drug above all others &mdash; heroin &mdash; has a devastating effect on the community.  It is widely accepted that its abuse is confined to major urban areas, in particular Dublin city.</P>
      <P>Members representing Dublin constituencies have been aware of this problem for some time.  Drug related crime in Dublin accounts for almost 80 per cent of all crime and its impact on the community is huge.  We also know that the trade in this deadly drug is masterminded by a small number of gangs. Largely because of the stranglehold these people have over those addicted to the drug they supply, the Garda have found it difficult to tackle them effectively. Despite this, they secured a number of successes in this area and should be congratulated on their efforts.  I hope the passing of this Bill will render their difficult task easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in an Adjournment debate I raised the issue of the drugs problem in the Kilbarrack area of my constituency. The problems there are instructive for Deputies not familiar with the extent of this problem.  It is symptomatic of the threat under which some Dublin communities live their lives.  Residents in that area are regularly subjected to <Col N="1698" /> threats and intimidation.  Corporation tenants have handed back accommodation to the corporation and those living in private houses have moved. Gardaí living in the area have been subjected to threats, including rocks with warning messages thrown through the windows of their homes.  There have also been a number of shooting incidents in the area in recent months which are clearly related to the area's drug problem.</P>
    <P>Last week a young man in the area I represent took his life in Mountjoy prison. The young man was a drug addict and I understand from Garda reports that he had been threatened by a drug gang in the area to whom he was reported to have owed a considerable amount of money that if he could not pay his life would be taken.  I believe that was a factor in the taking of his own life.  That is one example of the misery caused by the stranglehold drug barons have in this city.</P>
    <P>People living in the area I represent would have no difficulty with this Bill and have been waiting for increased powers for the Garda provided therein for some time.  They also want &mdash; I am pleased the Government has moved in this regard in the past month &mdash; better and improved facilities for the treatment of addicts.  I compliment the recent initiatives by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, in this regard. Government initiatives regarding comunity development programmes in Kilbarrack have also been helpful and will go some way to restoring the community's confidence and capacity to address these issues locally.</P>
    <P>I raise this example of how the drugs problem affects an area in Dublin so that nobody will be confused about the complexity of the issues involved.  This is not, as some believe, solely a law and order issue.  I support a tough legal response &mdash; such as this Bill &mdash; to the problem but it must be complemented by action in other areas.  It is always regrettable that a Government must introduce legislation along these lines &mdash; it is tough and infringes on the level of rights we would like to be in a position <Col N="1699" /> to provide to citizens.  In this case the ruthlessness of the gangs involved and the intimidation and terror they are prepared to engage in to avoid being called to book for their crimes renders this legislation necessary.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Owen, on bringing the Bill before the House.  She has taken into account the constitutional concerns of the European Court on Human Rights, particularly in section 4 which limits application of the Bill in the event that an individual is rearrested.  That measure will ensure the Bill is not used for the purpose of harassment.  There is little point addressing the problem if the measures introduced are capable of being challenged in the courts.  The balances and checks in the Bill will ensure it is not subject to abuse.</P>
    <P>This Bill is only one element in tackling the drugs problem.  Sometimes debates in this House concentrate exclusively on a criminal justice solution to the drugs problem, but the problem is also a social one.  There is little point tackling the problem of the supply of drugs if we do not tackle simultaneously the demand for drugs, particularly heroin. In that context I welcome the package announced last month by the Ministers. Deputies Noonan, Owen and Bhreathnach.  That however is only a beginning in stabilising what is huge problem in our cities.</P>
    <P>In the past I have been concerned about the level of inter-agency co-operation between the various State agencies involved in tackling the drugs problem.  Section 6 seeks to place on a proper footing the respective responsibilities of the Garda and the customs service.  The Minister stated that agreement has been reached between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda.  I hope she will announce details of those arrangements soon.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important Bill and hope it has a speedy passage through the House so that the Garda can get down to the work in hand, which is time consuming.  As Deputies Upton and Briscoe said, this is a burning issue.  A <Col N="1700" /> reduction in the supply of drugs is an essential component in the anti-drugs strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill and I compliment the Minister for Justice on introducing it. The aim of the Bill is to allow for more flexible detention of people suspected of being involved in drug trafficking.  It is a further indication of the Government's commitment to deal with the problem of drugs and its impact on society.  The drugs industry is growing. Garda statistics show that between 1989 and 1994 the number of drug seizures trebled.  That is an indication of the extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that drug misuse is widespread throughout the country, although data on the full extent of the problem is scarce and inadequate.  A recent report produced by the Health Research Board indicates that in 1993 an estimated 2,573 people received treatment for drug misuse in the greater Dublin area, but that does not outline the extent of the problem.  The number of people dealing in and abusing drugs is greatly in excess of that figure.  The problem in Dublin is at crisis point, with 7,000 injecting addicts in the capital.  For Deputies like myself working in Dublin constituencies the effect of this crisis is obvious.  Much crime in Dublin is as a direct result of the heroin epidemic in the city.  Up to 80 per cent of all crime in the Dublin metropolitan area is drug related.  It costs up to £100 per day to feed the habit of heroin users.  Where does that money come from?  In order to feed their habit these people are forced into crimes such as robbery, muggings and attacks on the elderly. The correlation between crime and drugs is well established and accepted by all.  If the problem is to be addressed resources must be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Government to provide additional places in Castlerea prison and the commitment to build a women's prison in Mountjoy, which will make available an <Col N="1701" /> extra 50 places.  The Opposition must realise that extra resources such as additional gardaí cannot be made available without extra expenditure.  The assignment of extra gardaí to the National Drug Unit only brings the level up to that which existed in the mid-1980s. If we are to solve the problem drug pushers must be identified.  Given the magnitude of the problem in Dublin city and county, the Labour Party believes there is scope for increasing the drug squad in Dublin from less than 100 &mdash; some say it is 77 &mdash; to 200.</P>
    <P>In my constituency local residents decided in the interests of their children to undertake an anti-drugs campaign with the objective of getting rid of drug pushers from their estate.  They believe that was necessary as there is not a sufficient number of gardaí to concentrate solely on the activities of known drug pushers.  That is totally unacceptable. Drug barons and drug pushers must be caught and convicted.  Even if they are arrested for having no tax or a bald tyre it would be a way of putting them behind bars.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday I met a deputation of nine young people from Balbriggan town, aged between 16 and 18 years of age, all of whom attend second level schools.  They clearly outlined the problems that exist &mdash; for example, there are no facilities for their age group in the town.  While acknowledging that drugs are available, they want to enjoy a drugs-free environment, whether at discos, youth clubs or whatever.  There is a responsibility not only on Government but on local communities and parents to provide the necessary resources and infrastructure so that there is an alternative to drugs for young people.</P>
    <P>There is considerable room for improvement in the manner in which the drugs issue is dealt with in Mountjoy Prison, the main committal prison in this State.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to provide a drug free unit in that prison, but up to 90 per cent of prisoners there have a drug problem. Having visited there recently, I question the methadone treatment policy in <Col N="1702" /> operation and I ask the Minister to take up that matter with the governor of that prison.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's anti-drug project for primary schools.  An education programme to tackle this problem must begin in the home and in schools.  The campaign will provide a substance abuse awareness programme which I understand is directed at parents, teachers and local communities.  A substance abuse prevention programme will be developed for primary schools in co-operation with the Departments of Health, Justice and Education and an anti-heroin programme will be targeted at schools in areas where there is a noticeable incidence of substance abuse. While I support this project, I would have welcomed its earlier introduction. The project must be up and running as quickly as possible and impediments must not be allowed block its introduction. A community group in my constituency has decided to address the drugs problem in their area in co-operation with the local gardaí and the local authority, Fingal County Council.</P>
    <P>I compliment that council on becoming actively involved in the Department of the Environment's housing management initiative, an important initiative which should not be undermined.  Fingal County Council was the first local authority to establish a pilot scheme on estate management.  A number of other councils have had an opportunity to establish such schemes, but all councils should operate an estate management scheme.  Such a scheme involves increasing local involvement in the running of an estate, providing tenants with a better standard of service and improving the maintenance standard of dwellings and their surroundings.  The objective is that such schemes should act as a catalyst in awakening a community spirit in an estate.  These schemes can work.</P>
    <P>A message must be sent from this Chamber that drug pushers do not have any place in local authority estates.  For too long people have been pressurised by drug pushers.  Progress has been <Col N="1703" /> made in some areas and can be made in others.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice noted, section 2, which deals with the powers of detention, will probably be regarded as the most significant provision in the Bill.  The measures in section 2 increase the powers of detention of persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to a maximum of seven days.  I appreciate the concerns of those who may consider those measures suspect in regard to constitutional rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, but I do not have a problem about that.  As the Minister pointed out, the involvement of a judge in the extension of the period of detention beyond 48 hours, together with the requirement that a detained person will be brought before the courts, will be seen as conforming not only with our obligations under the European convention but also with constitutional imperatives.</P>
    <P>This Bill is among the strongest anti-crime legislation introduced in this House.  The Government has shown its commitment to deal with this problem by introducing this Bill.  I hope local authorities, parents, the gardaí and judges will co-operate to ensure that the scourge of drugs, drug pushers and the godfathers of crime is removed.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. We have addressed the issue of drugs on many occasions recently and each time I and other Members have said that the drugs problem threatens the very fabric of our society.  We have heard that so often, but we do not fully comprehend what the statement means or appreciate the problems associated with the drugs issue, such as family break up, suicide, community decline and drug-related crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers said, it is estimated that up to 80 per cent of all indictable offences are drug-related.  A recent survey stated that on average 40 businesses are robbed weekly.  Because of burglaries in some areas shops, including some in my constituency, have had to close down.  Some proprietors are unable to get insurance.  The safety of staff working in some premises cannot be guaranteed and personal injury claims also pose a problem.  Bag snatchings and muggings occur on a daily basis.  There are also burglaries and house breakings, people are beaten up in their homes, and personal attacks involve in some <Col N="1705" /> cases the use of syringes, a most despicable form of attack.  There are also car thefts by drug-crazed youths.  We do not have to put up with all that.  We need to take measures to tackle those crimes once and for all.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem has spread from the cities.  It is interesting that many Dublin Deputies have spoken about this problem today, but the problem is not confined, as it was once was, to the inner city.  Although many Dublin communities have had to bear this problem for years, now that it has spread nationwide it has been placed on the political agenda, hopefully leading to some positive action.  Communities and parents are demanding action to counter this major threat, in particular to children whose quality of life and future must be protected.  These nationwide community groups deserve our full support.  Their very establishment is a hopeful development, living as we do in an age of community decline when so many refuse to become involved in any community activity.  Governments, local authorities and others must support these groups, which have been established because of the inability of the State to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill were announced in July last in response to what was perceived to be a national crisis.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, it is the first major piece of criminal justice legislation introduced by this Government. There was widespread public support, demonstrated by opinion polls, for the proposals to increase the powers of detention of persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to a maximum of seven days, along with the proposal which received most publicity, that to allow members of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent, to issue search warrants in drug trafficking cases where such is urgently required.</P>
    <P>The three parties in Government appear to be immobilised by indecision. Three different parties, each with different ideologies, simply cannot agree on effective measures to deal with crime, <Col N="1706" /> drugs and many other issues, even Northern Ireland.  They are all pulling in different directions, resulting in the country as a whole losing out.  An example is their divergent views on the matter of bail, a matter on which I predict the Government will not take any action.  It appears that the long promised referendum on bail has been put on the back burner.</P>
    <P>The delay in the introduction of this Bill can also be attributed to those divisions within Government.  I do not think any action will be taken on the right to silence, particularly when one considers the difficulties encountered in the introduction of this Bill.  While these Cabinet battles continue behind closed doors the public has a right to know which Ministers were in favour of this or that legislation and which of them were responsible for the delay in the introduction of this Bill.  There is need for openness, transparency and accountability. There is the widespread perception that victims' rights are set at nought while those of the criminal remain uppermost in the minds of particular members of the Government.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Deputy O'Donoghue's comments on the inadequacies of this Bill, the provisions of which have been diluted to an extent that threatens their very effectiveness.  For example, under section 2 a detained person can be brought before a court and given the chance to give evidence and make submissions before detention can be extended.  This section is so complex and its safeguards so far-reaching that it is doubtful the Garda will be able to employ it efficiently.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose tough measures to deal with drug barons fear that the Garda will abuse their powers.  I do not believe that will be the case.  The Garda are respected and enjoy the support of the public in general &mdash; a phenomenon possibly unique to this country.  They are accountable to the Minister for Justice via the Garda Commissioner and the Minister is accountable to this House.</P>
    <P>Given the extent and seriousness of <Col N="1707" /> the drugs problem confronting us, we must take some risks.  This Bill does not deal with the huge delays encountered within the present system of preliminary examinations.  This issue was tackled in my party's Bill whose provisions, regrettably, have been omitted from this one.</P>
    <P>A recent editorial in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 8 February 1996 bearing the caption &ldquo;State-financed drug addiction&rdquo; sparked off a debate on drugs in general, questioning the effectiveness of prescribing methadone to heroin addicts and even going so far as to suggest that the State should dissociate itself entirely from this activity.  Anybody with any personal experience of heroin addicts, such as public representatives, could not support that view.  We must take tough measures against drug pushers and, through our education system, teach children their responsibilities, the importance of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to drugs. Nonetheless we cannot turn our backs completely on those unfortunate enough to be hooked on heroin who roam the streets of Dublin this very evening.  We need to do everything possible to cure them of their addiction. I believe the benefits of prescribing methadone to addicts can be clearly proven.</P>
    <P>In this exercise general practitioners have a major role to play.  Their increased involvement is necessary for continuous treatment of such addicts. We need to encourage general practitioners to prescribe methadone to addicts if and when necessary.  However, much cultural change must be wrought before reaching that point.</P>
    <P>I have one question to pose to the Minister for Justice on the matter of open drug dealing on our streets.  While appreciating she may not be able to answer my questions fully, bearing in mind confidentiality and security, I must inform her that I could furnish this House daily with information about locations, times, even the names of people engaging in drug dealing.  Constituents have telephoned me with precise details which I have conveyed to <Col N="1708" /> the Garda but I am not sure that any effective action has been taken.  It appears to have been Garda policy not to pursue these smaller scale drug pushers in their determination to catch the bigger players behind the scenes.  I should like the Minister to clarify that matter when replying.  The public does not understand why nothing is being done about open drug dealing on their doorsteps.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eoin Ryan mentioned estate management and local authorities having a role to play in detecting drug barons.  I do not believe Dublin corporation is acting sufficiently speedily in the matter of evictions.  While the corporation is aware of the problem and has a policy on drug barons and drug dealing in local authority houses, its eviction process appears to be too slow and cumbersome, resulting in people not being evicted for several months until the legal process has been concluded.  There is need to examine that matter very seriously in order to speed up eviction procedures in the case of such criminals.</P>
    <P>Another debate only beginning here is on the possibility of supporting a liberalising approach and decriminalising drug taking.  Drugs are dangerous; they threaten lives and the State must intervene to protect them.  I believe the liberalising approach is dangerous and misguided.  Other European countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Holland have failed in their experimental approach.  Since the Green Party supports that policy, it must explain to the parents of Ireland its reason for so doing.  We already have a drugs culture of sorts without the need to encourage it further.  The adoption of such a policy would merely accentuate these drug addiction problems and their attendant costs.</P>
    <P>At the very least the State should endeavour to promote an ideal society, while at the same time dealing pragmatically and humanely with real problems on the ground.  This Bill constitutes the first step in tough laws to counter crime generally but many more are needed for the good of society as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Haughey for sharing his time with me.  I have no difficulty with the measures in this Bill.  I see them as merely technical measures that will assist the Garda Síochána in the fight against drugs. Speeding up the signing of warrants is absolutely essential and should have been done a long time ago.  I have no difficulty either with the provision for seven days detention in so far as it relates to drug couriers or dealers, when one knows heroin couriers carrying heroin internally are brought into the Garda station and have to be released, although the gardaí know they are carrying deadly cargoes.</P>
      <P>The question is whether this measure is an adequate response to the drugs crisis threatening the very fabric of society.  It is certainly no longer a problem confined to the inner city &mdash; my constituency stretches from the north inner city to Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot and the heroin problem is spreading throughout that very large urban area.  Other Deputies have similar experiences in their constituencies in Dublin, in particular, but the problem is spreading.  I do not believe the measure is adequate and that is my problem with it.  It might be if it was accompanied by a significant redeployment of the Garda Síochána.  Deputy Haughey referred to this when he talked about reporting street dealing.  We are told that 80 per cent of violent crime in Dublin is drugs related yet in the region of 1 per cent of the force is directed against drug dealers.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that there are more heroin dealers in one flats complex in my constituency than there are gardaí in the drugs unit in the north central division of the Garda Síochána &mdash; a division which stretches from the docks to the Phoenix Park and covers the vast north centre city divisional area.  Until that changes, this plague will continue to spread out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been making this point for a long time and equally I have been saying that the only way to apprehend the drug barons is by setting up a special <Col N="1710" /> integrated unit drawn from the Revenue investigation branch, the social welfare investigation branch and the Garda Síochána.  I cannot understand why such a unit is not being assembled either on the initiative of the Government, the Garda Commissioner or whoever and somebody is not taking responsibility for setting up a unit to target specific individuals.  The gardaí know who these people are and I cannot accept that all the resources of the State are not adequate to take on a relatively small number of drug barons, otherwise we are saying that the drug barons are more powerful than the State.  I refuse to accept that.</P>
    <P>Equally, there is a need to speed up the court process in drug cases.  A period of up to two years can elapse from the time a person is charged until the time he appears before the court.  That makes it impossible for the Garda Síochána to tackle the drugs problem. Bail is an issue in drug cases specifically and it has to be confronted.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats' Prosecution of Offences and Punishment of Crimes Bill, 1996, is nothing less than a fraud.  There is an enormous gulf between the very carefully managed public presentation of the provisions and the actual provisions in the Bill.  This pretence is perfectly in keeping with the nauseating populism last night on the Criminal Justice (Drugs Trafficking) Bill engaged in by Deputy <Col N="1711" /> O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats Party or as she was described to me recently &ldquo;the bland bombshell&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five counts on which I indict this Bill for fraud.  First, the impression was carefully nurtured among the public in the media presentations that it is intended to make the Director of Public Prosecutions accountable for his decisions.  A reading of the Bill makes it clear this is not what is provided for.  Sections 5 and 6 which deal with this matter retain the confidentiality of the operations of the Director of Public Prosecutions in his decisions on specific cases.  It is proper that this confidentiality and the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be maintained, and it is utterly improper for the Progressive Democrats to come before this House and propose these rubbish provisions on annual reports detailing the number of cases handled and so on, and try to present that in public as an account to this House and therefore to the general public of the way particular cases are handled by the Director of Public Prosecutions. If I took the provisions of this Bill on board I would say there is no need for a preliminary hearing and according to section 13 people should be sent immediately for trial and should be given a fair trial before they are hanged. Second, the Progressive Democrats claim this Bill provides for a major tightening up of the laws on bail when it does nothing of the kind.  Examination of the provisions show that what is proposed is either cosmetic or probably unconstitutional, as the Minister for Justice has pointed out.  She made it very clear there must be very serious constitutional doubts about the detention of a person for an offence for which that person has neither been tried nor convicted and that is what is being proposed in the Bill.  Most laughable of all are the provisions on estreatment of bail.  The Progressive Democrats come charging in here on a white law and order charger, and say they will make sure that people who commit crimes <Col N="1712" /> while on bail will have their bail estreated immediately.  Look at what is provided for in the Bill &mdash; it cannot happen until the person has been convicted of a crime alleged to have been committed while on bail and the provisions cannot have effect until after the person has been convicted of the first offence, an application has been made for a further extension of the period during which bail may be estreated and the person has been tried and convicted of an offence committed while on bail.  There are a couple of things put in to make it appear as if it is much tougher than it is. Section 11 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Where evidence is tendered in accordance with subsection (1) the burden of proof of the facts that a person was not on bail at the time an indictable offence was committed shall lie on the person alleging such fact.</P>
    <P>The reason that provision was inserted in the Bill was to allow the Progressive Democrats to say they will be hard on these people who are committing crimes while on bail, that not only will bail be estreated but the onus of proof will be reversed in a case where it is demanded that the bail be estreated.  That is what subsection (2) of section 11 is about.  I wonder why.  Why are the Progressive Democrats suddenly coming in here with this cosmetic provision for the reversal of the burden of proof when it comes to the estreatment of bail?  That is not what they say in public because the public would not understand a single word of what that means.  They put it in as another bit of macho posturing.  The Bill reminds me of the AIDS quilt, every colour is in it, lots of little bits sewn up together to make it look as if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The third count in the indictment for fraud in this Bill is the claim, again sedulously nurtured, on the public airwaves, when the Bill was published, that it removes the right to silence. This Bill does no such thing.  Even the most cursory inspection of section 15 will show that the Progressive Democrats, though they do not want to admit it, know perfectly well the reason this provision is in our law.  If they read section 15 they will find it is hedged about with restrictions and caveats and conditions.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they do not trust the Garda to interrogate suspects and that they want this done in front of a district justice?  I wonder what has happened to the Progressive Democrats old position on the necessity of establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case, on which Deputy O'Malley in 1986 and 1987 was very eloquent when we talked about extradition.  In section 13 they seek to remove that requirement and to turn district justices into simple interrogators, if that is the mood the Garda happen to be in at the time, or rubber stamps, if the violence provisions of section 13 of this Bill seem appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part V1 refers to the prison service. This is presented to us as being a provision to make the prison service independent. If one reads Part V1 one will find it does nothing of the kind.  It sets up a pseudo administration of the prison service so that it is given the appearance of independence but who makes the decisions?  Who makes the financial provision? Who has to approve all the decisions?  It is none other than the <Col N="1715" /> Minister for Justice.  This Bill is nothing more than a cosmetic one that allows the Progressive Democrats to posture about saying they are tough on law and order issues while they know in their hearts and souls &mdash; Deputy McDowell has enough decency left in him to, as I have said, look uncomfortable when these howlers are being trotted out in front of us &mdash; there is no good reason for doing the daft things proposed in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this debate on crime which is the biggest issue facing all of us, particularly in Dublin.  The crime problem is an extremely complex one.  An approach which is solely based on criminal justice measures shows a lack of understanding of the complexity of what is involved.  If we decide to tackle the problem of crime, purely through criminal justice measures, there will be an insatiable demand for extra prison spaces.  Clearly that is not the way to proceed.  We need a co-ordinated and a comprehensive response to the issue which should be primarily targeted at tackling the drugs problem which is responsible for the vast bulk of crime in the city, if not in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>So far as this Bill seems to be a genuine attempt to address some of the criminal justice aspects of crime, I congratulate Deputies O'Donnell and Michael McDowell for the work they have put into its preparation.  If anything, they have been too ambitious. The Bill touches on a substantial number of issues, perhaps too many.</P>

Clearly there is some support for a number of the proposals. Before commenting on the details of the Bill I wish to record my disgust at the nature and tone of the comments made by Deputy O'Donoghue during the course of this debate and during the debate on the drug trafficking Bill which is running parallel to this Bill.  Deputy O'Donoghue should note that if he continues to act the prima donna that is the way he will be regarded and treated.</P>

      <P>A quick tour of the effect of the drug and crime problem in my constituency or in any of the Dublin constituencies might persuade the Deputy to take the issue and its complexity more seriously than he is doing. The Bill is in eight parts.  I do not have time to deal with each part individually but, as in all Bills, some parts are more worthy of comment than others.  I am in broad agreement with the thrust of the provisions of Part II relating to the prosecution of offences.  The case to be made for the unification of the existing prosecution services is a good one.  The delay in bringing cases to trial has been discussed at length here in debates on bail reform and the drugs problem.  The public is rightly frustrated and would be prepared to support any measures which alleviate the problem.  The unification of the prosecution service seems to be a reasonable step to take in this regard.  Neither do I see any reason the Director of Public Prosecutions should not answer to the Dáil for the running of his or her office.  This does not mean that we should comment on individual cases but the overall management of the office is of legitimate public concern.  I note the Minister is not opposed to this development and is awaiting the outcome of the strategic management initiative.  I urge her to act in this area if, on foot of the current review, substantial change is not proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> I welcome the Minister's announcement in her contribution to the debate that she will soon be making proposals in regard to bail.  However, I think she should consider the proposals contained in this Bill.  They are not complete and do not deal with the full complexities of the issue.  I have no problem with seeking to deter people going bail for an accused where they are aware that the accused is more likely to default on that bail.  I fail to see how this measure could be unconstitutional.  I am not a legal expert but I do not see how there could be a problem with it.</P>
    <P>Surely the conditions attached to a bail bond, as envisaged in the Bill, are consistent with the central tenet of the O'Callaghan case, namely, that the accused show up for trial and that people who know this to be the case do not take lightly the duty of going bond for them.  This issue above all others has been the source of much rancour in the House.</P>
    <P>I recognise that our bail law is one of the most liberal in Europe and I would not be opposed to change, but much can be done in advance of a referendum. Deputy O'Donnell's proposals are before us tonight.  Last week, my party raised the issue of bench warrants and the difficulties sometimes involved in executing them.  Evidence in this area is merely anecdotal but from my experience in speaking to solicitors working in this area, it seems to be a considerable administrative problem that we should take not of.  We should also consider other difficulties in this area before we impose new obligations.</P>
    <P>In the section dealing with criminal procedure, Part IV, I am concerned about the possibility of withdrawing an accused's right to silence.  I am not setting my face against such a proposal; I can see the argument for it.  If we have the power to compel witnesses, and often victims, to appear in court &mdash; in some cases with possible repercussions for their individual safety &mdash; should the accused, and only the accused, have a right to silence?  There is not doubt that this is a fundamental change in our <Col N="1718" /> judicial system.  The right to silence in common law is a fundamental right which has been in place for generations. We should not embark on any reform without first fundamentally examining the implications of it.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill addresses the issue of prisons.  I fully support the establishment of a separate prisons board, which has been an issue for some years.  I recognise the Minister is examining the matter but she should at least be moving towards action on it at an early date. She should not be deterred from doing so by her departmental officials whose own interests in that regard is quite clear.  This Part of the Bill also has implications for Part VII and I am sure if the prisons board is established, these other sections will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 seek to impose obligations on the Minister in regard to prison spaces.  As the Minister pointed out, these obligations already exist and I agree with her that the Minister in charge should retain some flexibility in this area.  I cannot support this particular aspect.  I am surprised that such a suggestion should emanate from the Progressive Democrats.  The Minister has not mentioned it but I am sure there are considerable financial obligations involved in those sections and I am not sure that those financial obligations have been taken into account in the Progressive Democrat's five year plan for the nation's finances.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the framers of the Bill did not address just one of the many issues they have raised in it; the Bill would have been all the more effective if they had done so.  It attempts to deal with too many areas while not dealing with any one of them satisfactorily. There is too much in the Bill; that which is good is not adequately developed while that which is bad had not been sufficiently thought through.  I repeat my earlier remarks, however, and commend those responsible for putting a genuine effort into the preparation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to see this Bill before the Dáil.  It is a matter of regret that apparently it will be voted down by the Government's current majority.  The arguments in regard to the various sections were put extremely well and fairly by Deputy Shortall in her contribution and I wish to contrast that with the polyfilla rubbish we heard from Deputy Dukes.  Deputy Dukes is not a fool and it is regrettable that he came in here tonight exhibiting himself as if he were a fool.  It is unfortunate that he did not wait to listen to more of what Deputy Shortall had to say because whenever she touched on a section that he had referred to, she said virtually the direct opposite in each case to what Deputy Dukes said.  That shows that the Government's opposition to this Bill is political rather than practical and it is regrettable that the Government and the Minister for Justice, who had made such heavy weather of her office for the past 15 months, should turn down a measure that is so obviously needed, that is well prepared and which, if it has any defects, is open to amendment.  The Bill is being turned down simply for political reasons and we will have committees, review groups, etc., examining all aspects of it but nothing will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite some time ago I was Minister for Justice and I recall the atmosphere of the times, both inside and outside this House, was that virtually every measure one brought forward was opposed and howled down.  No support was forthcoming for my efforts as Minister to cope with what was then developing as a very serious subversive crime problem. Happily, at that time, what is called in the trade &ldquo;ordinary decent crime&rdquo; was not as prevalent, as widespread or as vicious as it is today.  It was a difficult task to undertake at that stage when virtually everything one tried to do was <Col N="1720" /> opposed at great length and frequently with great bitterness.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Justice, whatever woes she may feel have befallen her, finds herself in the directly opposite situation.  She is criticised in this House for her unwillingness to do enough and, at times, her unwillingness to do anything.  She has been handed a Bill, extremely well prepared by Deputy O'Donnell with the assistance and advice of Deputy McDowell, which deals admirably with a number of the most pressing issues currently facing this country.  If the effect of the Bill were understood by every citizen, the support for it would be overwhelming &mdash; 95 per cent plus &mdash; because its provisions are reasonable, necessary and, so far as I can judge, constitutional.  It was interesting to hear Deputy Dukes complaining that the Bill is not tough enough and alleging that there are sections in which various items are hedged around by conditions.  That has to be the case in the system within which we operate.</P>
    <P>The first Part of the Bill relates to prosecution of offences and proposes sensible changes in the law and in the practice of prosecution.  Those changes are urgently needed.  It has been a marked feature of the situation in this country for quite some years that the prosecution service is not what it should be, that many prosecutions fail due to error and, most important, that many prosecutions which should be brought are never brought.  Part of the reason for that is the fragmented and disparate nature of the prosecution service. Section 4, in particular, overcomes that and seeks to give this country, for the first time, the sensible measure that exists in almost all countries of a unified prosecution service as opposed to the unsuccessful system we currently have.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which our prosecution system falls down most obviously and readily is in that of white collar crime.  There are few prosecutions for white collar crime unless it is of a simple or straightforward nature.  There <Col N="1721" /> are even fewer convictions for such matters. Our prosecution service seems to operate on the basis that the appropriate people to prosecute for crime are ill-educated and socially disadvantaged people who commit straightforward crimes of violence, larceny or something of that nature.  It seems there is no acceptance that elaborate frauds by wealthy and senior people need any examination as far as prosecution is concerned. We have a curious legal and prosecution system which seems to suggest that only the disadvantaged and smaller person suffers while the big and powerful people can more or less do what they like.  There has been recent examples of that in our beef industry.</P>
    <P>Another example, related to the beef industry but which also relates to many other economic activities, is the lack of prosecution for tax offences.  Tax evasion is regarded in most democracies as a serious crime.  Thousands of people are serving lengthy sentences in the United States for tax offences.  In this country, nobody is, or has ever been, imprisoned for tax evasion.  Much of our society seems to regard these matters, which amount, if carried out on a large scale, to stealing from the public Exchequer, as being all right and that it has some imprimatur from on high.  One of the reasons for this is that nobody has ever been prosecuted for it.  If something is wrong, how can it go unprosecuted? Tax evasion does go unprosecuted and it seems this trend will continue.</P>
    <P>I am aware of elaborate frauds in this State which have been investigated by the Garda but they either had insufficient evidence or if they had some, could not convince the Director of Public Prosecutions to take a prosecution.  If anyone wants to see a fully documented crime of tax evasion set out in a judicial document, they should read the beef tribunal report, which outlines how a group of companies set out to deliberately defraud the Revenue and succeeded in doing so for many millions of pounds.  What is amazing about that, and this further compounds the mess we <Col N="1722" /> are in, is that not alone was there no prosecution but that around the time it came to light, the then Government introduced a statutory tax amnesty where people who committed tax evasion could not alone avoid prosecution but also the payment of the vast bulk of the tax they owed.</P>
    <P>If tax owed by those in that category on a personal basis is taken as being around 50 per cent, which is the normal figure, and add interest and penalties to that figure over a period of years, the tax payable would normally be 100 per cent of the amount of gain that accrued to the evading individual.  However, instead of having to pay 100 per cent, or perhaps even more, as it would be in some cases, the most he, she or it ever had to pay was 15 per cent.  It appears that some of those fully, publicly and judicially documented cases of tax fraud were able to avail of the statutory tax amnesty and this sends the wrong message.</P>
    <P>The 1993 tax amnesty was the second such amnesty in a five year period although the amnesty in 1988 was declared to be the last this country would ever see.  The second tax amnesty was unusual in that the Minister for Finance of the day and the Revenue Commissioners, both of whom have the statutory responsibility for the management of taxes and taxation in this country, were vehemently opposed to it. However, against their advice and wishes, it was still forced through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;although I do not know how many.  Those who benefited, with the imprimatur of this House, if they lived in another jurisdiction would not alone get no statutory amnesty but would be in prison for a long period. <Col N="1723" /> However, we still allow this to continue. There is something remiss in our prosecution system, which is why section 4 in particular will make a major contribution in trying to overcome it.  We are a sick society if we think we can allow that practice to continue or do without section 4 or a measure akin to it.</P>
      <P>While section 4 may be one of the most important parts of the Bill, there are also many other significant areas. The current bail question can only be described as a scandal.  There is almost nobody who is not on bail.  People who are recently arrested for spectacular and much publicised murders &mdash; I am not prejudging their guilt &mdash; were let out on bail within weeks, and in some cases, days, of their arrest and charge.  Is that right?  The vast majority of people do not think so.  I have been aware of the constitutional problem confronting us from as far back as 1971 when I was in the Department of Justice and I could not find a way of changing it without holding a referendum.  I am glad 25 years on to be able to come into the House and read section 7 which would patently be constitutional, not conflict with the principle of the decision in the O'Callaghan case in 1966 and help to change the situation.  I wish I had the ingenuity of those who thought up and drafted this section which I would not have turned down, rather I would have been glad to avail of it and enact it into law.  How much of the crime that has occurred since then would have been avoided?  How many murders, rapes and bank robberies have been committed by people while on bail?  The question could more accurately be put the other way around: how many of them have not been committed by people while on bail?  It appears the majority fall into the first category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition that the person released on bail should be of good behaviour would be a powerful deterrent if a breach led to the estreatment of bail.  The Minister should greatly welcome such a proposal.  Whatever about the other sections to which she may <Col N="1724" /> have objections this is the solution to the bail problem that has afflicted us for 30 years.  While it was not so bad in the first 15 to 20 years it is appalling at present.</P>
    <P>In the past month or two I read in the newspapers about a case in Galway where a person convicted of serious crimes was granted bail, which the courts feel they cannot avoid because of the decision in the O'Callaghan case, within hours, if not minutes, of his conviction and was, by all accounts, involved in a further serious crime within a short time.  What right does such a person have under the Constitution to bail?  As a convicted criminal, he has no such right, but under this silly system with which we are encumbered and which this Bill seeks to change and loosen up even he must be granted bail. This allows him to commit further serious crimes.</P>
    <P>The Part which deals with procedure is necessary.  As someone who practised and dealt with criminal matters in the District Court for a number of years, I realise that much time is wasted and the unnecessary procedures do not do an accused or anybody else any good in the sense that they tie down large numbers of gardaí and others unnecessarily.  This would be done away with under this Bill in a way which would not do any violence to anybody's rights.</P>
    <P>The proposal of a formal interrogation before a judge should be accepted by the House.  I also spoke about this matter when I was in the Department of Justice.  The atmosphere at that time was totally different.  Within hours I was howled down.  The following morning the newspapers were full of shock horror reactions.  I was asked how I could possibly contemplate making the slightest movement towards what is called the inquisitorial system which is the norm throughout most of the civilised world. Apart from ourselves, Britain and some but not all of the common law countries of which there are relatively few, every other country operates the system proposed in section 14.  I do not see democracies throughout the world held up as <Col N="1725" /> being grossly unfair or acting without any regard for the rights of accused persons.</P>
    <P>In France an examining magistrate supervises the questioning of an accused.  If an accused fails to answer, this is admissible in evidence and may be taken into account at his subsequent trial.  I do not see anything unfair in this. It cannot of itself lead to his conviction, it can only be corroborative, but it is powerfully important.  I can see no valid reason for turning this proposal down.</P>
    <P>A further section states that an accused should not be allowed to state in his defence at his trial that he has an alibi if he failed to mention this when questioned or had a reasonable opportunity to do so.  That is perfectly fair. Nowadays there are people who do not open their mouths when questioned about a particular offence which it is alleged&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Solicitors are entitled to advise their clients to avail of the law. They would be foolish and negligent if they failed to do so.  If it is alleged that a person committed a crime at 3 p.m. on a Monday in Grafton Street in Dublin and he says nothing when questioned, he should not be allowed at his trial to produce a string of witnesses to swear that at the time mentioned he was with them in O'Connell Street in Limerick. He should not be allowed to concoct an alibi at that last minute.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 for consecutive sentences where a person is convicted of further offences committed while on bail.  I am told that this happened in the first two or three years after the Oireachtas enacted that Act.  I cannot understand why it stopped.  This was a useful and effective provision.  Section 19 of this Bill would require the prosecution to bring it to the attention of the court.  That is a valid proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had more time I would speak at <Col N="1726" /> length about the prison service.  The proposals in the Bill in that regard are essential and make eminent sense.  It is regrettable that the prison system and service have degenerated to a degree about which none of us can be proud.  I fail to understand how a young drug free person could be sentenced to prison for an offence that has nothing to do with drugs and become a drug addict while in prison because drugs are forced on him or her.  This is happening in Mountjoy Prison in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That person will come out of prison a drug addict and his or her life will have been destroyed.  This type of activity is reprehensible.  I thought one of the functions of imprisonment was to keep inmates away from opportunities that would give rise to crime or anti-social behaviour.  It has been suggested, but not denied or confirmed authoritatively, that it suits the authorities in some prisons to allow prisoners to spend most of their time in a doped haze from drugs because they are less difficult and troublesome.  Whatever the reason, it is an incontrovertible fact that large numbers of prisoners are getting drugs, including many who did not use them before being sent to prison. That must be the greatest of all the scandals attached to our prison service. What Dr. Whitaker recommended some years ago should be implemented now. As the section that deals with prisons incorporate the gist of his recommendations I would like it enforced.</P>
      <P>The final part of the Bill deals with the rather sensitive question of pardons, remissions and temporary releases.  I am pleased the Bill proposes that they should be put on a statutory basis and that a proper public register should be kept of those who avail of pardons, remissions or temporary releases, the abuse of which brought our criminal law into disrepute and led to widespread cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to hear from the Minister for Justice in the past 12 months <Col N="1727" /> that it is not now the practice to consult the judge who imposed the sentence before it is varied or remitted by the Minister, which was the practice in the past.  I recall when the number of remissions was much lower and a not insignificant proportion of them emanated from judges who wrote to the Minister stating that something had come to light since the case was heard which, if had been known at the time, would have resulted in them imposing a much lesser sentence or not convicting the person concerned and, since the time for appeal had expired, justice should be achieved if the person were released.  Such power was given to the Minister for Justice under the 1951 Act and earlier legislation because it was foreseen that mistakes could be made, but that is not the position today.  It is now par for the course for defendants to make petitions and get letters from Deputies to show to the gardaí when executing warrants.</P>
    <P>I urge that the Bill be accepted because many of its provisions are necessary.  If some parts need amendment, Deputy O'Donnell and other members of my party would be glad to facilitate that.  The Bill should go to committee.  If it does not, the majority of Members will be shown up as not being serious about the rise in crime which is the most serious problem facing us.</P>

    <P>It is important to debate the issues raised in the Bill so that the Minister is <Col N="1728" /> aware of the views of all Members.  I am sure the introduction of this Bill and the drug trafficking legislation we discussed earlier accomplished this.  There is a clear division between those genuinely interested in the drugs problem and those using it to play political football. There are also other divisions in the House.  For example, Members from large metropolitan areas tend to be more aware of the extent of the drugs problem than those from rural areas, although the problem does extend to towns and villages.  A division between Members representing different constituencies is understandable.  However, the other divisions are neither understandable nor acceptable.  The division between those seeking to use and distort the crime and drugs issue for political gain transcends all party allegiances, but only one Deputy appears to do it on a continuing basis.  He is now the subject of critical analysis by the electorate.  It is unfortunate that Deputy O'Donoghue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unity is one of the fundamental tasks of any party leader, particularly the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputy O'Donoghue has laid out his wares and he wants a referendum on bail.  Regardless of what we discuss, whether this Bill, drug trafficking legislation or other legislation on the criminal justice system, Deputy O'Donoghue pulls out his computer printout and hops on the bail bandwagon.  Like some members of his party, he is new to this issue and thinks he has all the answers. As numerous speakers said, Deputy O'Donoghue's party held the Justice portfolio for seven years.

      <P>Some provisions of the Bill are worthy of comment.  I agree in principle with the establishment of a prison board, although the Minister has said there are difficulties in this area which will have to be ironed out.  I am very taken with the proposal to unify the prosecution service, as we all remember the inefficiencies and difficulties in the Attorney General's office. By unifying the two offices we should be able to do away with some of the bureaucracy which currently delays trials coming to court.  I see no reason the Director of Public Prosecutions should not publish an annual report and be answerable to the Oireachtas committee system.  I would understand a reluctance to comment on individual cases but we should be satisfied that taxpayers' money is being correctly spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> While it contains many positive proposals, there is too much in the Bill. This is a critical but complimentary analysis.  The Bill is overstretched in terms of the proposal in Part IV to remove the accused's right to silence.  I am not saying the House will not eventually support such a provision but before we commit ourselves to such a fundamental reform of the law it should be discussed at length by us in committee. A similar measure is already in operation in Britain and we as a Legislature have much to learn from that country.</P>
    <P>I accept that they worked hard, but the framers of the Bill would have served us better if they had worked exclusively on one Part instead of stretching their efforts over too many issues in this complicated area which deals with people's rights and the right of the State to ensure people are prosecuted and given sentences appropriate to the crime.  One cannot adopt a blanket approach to this issue and ignore people who are innocent until they are proved guilty.  I have difficulties with the Bill and have no option but to oppose it.</P>

Earlier today during the debate on the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill I said since I am cynical of all political parties.  I would like to see an end to confrontational politics on a delicate subject such as crime which should be above politics and would like committees to be given more teeth so as to evolve a united approach to this issue. <Col N="1733" /> Unlike Deputy Ferris, I do not dismiss Deputy O'Donoghue's efforts although I would label them political opportunism, something all of us in this palace of varieties which passes for entertainment or pantomime must engage in.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and often dismissed by the more intellectual and academic Members, I am as close as any Deputy to the feelings of the ordinary person on the street.  People are not concerned about economic issues but about the level of crime, which we all have helped to create.  As a cynic I express my cynicism about a party which was in Government for seven years and eight months and which now engages in a mock battle and expresses mock outrage in an attempt to make the Minister, Deputy Owen, responsible for the level of crime.  This problem has been growing for many years and was prevalent when the biggest mobster in Europe was gunned down on the streets of Dublin.  Yet the Fianna Fáil Party which was in Government at that time did nothing about the problem.  Everything is relative.  When Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Justice the level of crime was burgeoning and he did not bring in the draconian measures most people accept we need today.  I do not believe in the right to silence in cases of <Col N="1734" /> serious crime.  People should have a duty to account for their movements if there is any possible link with a crime, because it is the right to silence that sticks in the craw of most citizens.  There should be no bail either in connection with serious crime until the person charged is cleared, particularly in the case of murder or rape.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley adverted to the huge amount of drugs available in Mountjoy Prison.  He instanced the case of a young boy who never took a drug in his life but came out of Mountjoy an addict.  That is an indictment of all parties who have been in Government in recent years.  The only way to deal with that problem is to deny prisoners the right to visitors, if what Deputies say about Mountjoy is true.  That would be an additional penance on the prisoners which, it is hoped, would make them afraid to go back into that prison.  It would, perhaps, add to their burden, but there should be no admittance of family or friends of people in Mountjoy Prison while the question of drugs remains over that establishment.</P>
      <P>I am apprehensive about the Minister's statement that she would abolish penal servitude.  If there were to be a referendum, I believe the views of the people of Ireland would make me look like an altar boy instead of an extremist. I include Deputy McDowell who has been compared to me as an extremist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Alabama in America they have had to return to the chain gang system, and 17 years ago in Florida I saw a chain gang working on the street.  We turn to America for advice when it suits us.  We invited the President of America here to try to unite the country, so we should not just dismiss what they have had to do.  We should learn from their system. In 1976 they abolished the death penalty, but every State in America has had to bring it back.  Over 30 to 40 years we in this assembly have removed deterrents because of the bleeding hearts and the do-gooders in society.  If a society has no deterrents it will disintegrate.  We are witnessing the disintegration of Irish society and it is incumbent on us to <Col N="1735" /> erect deterrents that we removed over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me and thank Deputy O'Donnell for introducing this Bill.  I am fully aware of the lack of backup and research facilities available to Opposition spokespersons and the great difficulty they have in operating properly in this House.  It is important that Opposition spokespersons should have the resources and the backup they need to do an adequate job in preparing a Bill like this.  Many other Bills have been introduced by Opposition spokespersons and we should compliment them on putting in so much effort.  In the short time I was an Opposition spokesman I found it extremely difficult to cope with the amount of work that had to be done.  I had to rely on the good will of various experts in their fields for help and give backup that should have been provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is important that some of the issues mentioned in the Bill be discussed.  All Members have a contribution to make on them.  I agree with some of Deputy McGahon's comments.  The question of bail is very topical and needs to be addressed and I am delighted the Minister has given a commitment to address it and bring forward her own proposals.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that so many Members of the Opposition pour their wrath on the Minister, Deputy Owen, as if, in 15 months in office, she should have been able to resolve everything.  It is crazy to think that parties who were in Government for seven or eight years did not introduce any of the laws they are now advocating.  Let us not fool ourselves that the public are deceived, because they are not.  They realise what the position is, and we should give them more credit for their intelligence than we do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her short-term in office the Minister has addressed many issues and she has clocked up worthwhile credits as Minister.  I have no doubt that by the time another 12 months have passed <Col N="1736" /> Deputy Owen will be remembered as a Minister for Justice who made a worthwhile contribution.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we have a responsibility to help people realise the problems of society and take the necessary action to solve them.  Crime is a huge problem at present.  Some Deputies have behaved irresponsibly by publishing articles and issuing statements concerning crime, some of which have been downright deceptive in their use of statistics.  One such article was published recently in a local paper by a colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, criticising the reduction in Garda numbers in her area at a time when crime is increasing. She quoted the figures relating to 1993-95, which were particularly apt in that they show that the Garda numbers in that area were declining.  The article got banner headlines and many people were frightened by the implications of its content. Let us look at the real facts.  I could, perhaps, also be blamed for using figures to suit myself, but it is reasonable to look at the figures over, say, ten years.  Garda strength in the Longford-Westmeath division in 1985 was 251 gardaí, including sergeants and inspectors. In 1987 the number had risen to 257.  It was at that stage that Fianna Fáil came into power.  By 1991 the number had been reduced by 41 from 257 to 216, a substantial reduction.  To be fair some of those can be explained.  A Minister for Justice had been resident in the area at the time and when he was no longer a Minister for Justice part of the security was removed.  That would have accounted for a reduction of ten gardaí at most, not 41.  There were 216 in 1991 and the number was reduced to 191 in 1993.  From the time Fianna Fáil came to power in 1977 until it left office the number was reduced by 65.  The former Minister, a senior Minister for most of the time and subsequently a junior one, criticised this Government for reducing Garda numbers by 60.  That is hypocrisy of the highest order.  She said crime rates are rising and something must be done about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to Garda <Col N="1738" /> numbers in the Athlone area and castigated the Minister for allowing them to drop from 71 to 65.  In 1987 there were 76 gardaí in the same area and 69 in 1991.  It did not suit her to say anything about that.</P>
    <P>The Garda have a difficult job to do. My father and brother were gardaí when gardaí were on duty 24 hours a day.  They lived in their own community. The biggest change in policing in rural Ireland is that gardaí do not live among the community in which they work. They have lost touch and do not get the information they need.  Local communities are unhappy with the Garda presence in their area and want them to live in the areas where they work.  I do not know how that will be achieved as we cannot force people to live in particular areas but we need community policing.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment Deputy O'Donnell on the ingenuity she displayed and the hard work she put into the Bill.  I am not as cynical as Deputy McGahon but I am saddened, although not surprised, by the Government's response.  It is proof positive that the Government has abandoned the idea of bringing in the necessary legislative and administrative changes to combat crime.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath detailed the crime figures for Longford-Westmeath but we are all aware of the crime figures nationally.  The Garda report for 1994 tells a frightening story.  Never before was there an all pervasive feeling that the system has broken down.  There was never a time when the people felt so fearful and helpless or when those who work in the system felt so disillusioned and abandoned.  This Bill will not transform the position magically.  Deputy O'Donnell and I will not fall out if I say the Bill will not shake the foundations of the State or be a magical elixir that will transform matters overnight, but it will bring about significant improvements if the Government decides to accept it and it is amended in committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a glaringly obvious need for <Col N="1739" /> procedural and legal change to make the system coherent and workable and to restore some degree of confidence to the public and those at the coalface. There are some changes in the Bill but the Minister has set her face firmly against them.  I do not have anything personal against the Minister but she seems &mdash; perhaps through no fault of her own in that she may be hidebound by the ambiguous attitude to crime of some of her colleagues &mdash; to have raised prevarication and indecision to an art form and has signalled that the Government is rock solid in its determination to pursue a policy of indecision and incoherence in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals on bail.  How much longer will the people endure the vaudeville which has passed for Government policy on bail?  Before the Law Reform Commission reported last March the Minister announced there would be a referendum on bail.  We supported that, but some of her colleagues did not.  There is no great secret about who did not support the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, made his opposition well known and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, was exceptionally dismissive. He was not dismissive to the Minister to her face but, as usual, he spoke out of the side of his mouth.  The great ventriloquist dispatched his puppet to the media to say that the Minister for Justice was &ldquo;the weak link in this Government&rdquo;.  I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear me quote that.  The Tánaiste dispatched his Svengali, Mr. Finlay, who is a first class honours graduate of the Joseph Goebbels school of news management, to describe a ministerial colleague who is doing her best as the &ldquo;weak link in this Government&rdquo;. That is his attitude to improvements in the bail laws.</P>
    <P>After that blast the Minister was forced to shelter behind the Law Reform Commission, which earlier she had been happy to ignore when she unilaterally announced a referendum last March. However, nothing lasts forever and <Col N="1740" /> eventually, after considering the matter for a long period, the Law Reform Commission reported.  I am disappointed with its report which did not come to any conclusions or make recommendations.  I believe the reason it did not do so was that it took an exceptionally narrow interpretation of the brief it had been given.  Be that as it may, the Law Reform Commission reported and eventually the ball was back in the Minister's court.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach, who were unable to justify further inaction, resorted to insults.  The Taoiseach resorted to insults on the Order of Business on a number of occasions.  He said that Fianna Fáil had referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission as a &ldquo;delaying tactic&rdquo;.  If the Taoiseach regards the Law Reform Commission merely as a device where awkward problems can be referred as a delaying tactic, he should say so clearly and unambiguously.  However, that is the import of what he said on the Order of Business in relation to the decision of the previous Government to refer this fairly intractable problem to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister repeatedly told us they were debarred from taking action until the Law Reform Commission reported.  When it did so, they said the matter had simply been referred to the commission in the first instance as a &ldquo;delaying tactic&rdquo;.  We have heard about having things two ways, but the Government is seeking to have things three ways.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill represent a reasonable compromise which, incidentally, would enable the Government to escape from its self-inflicted paralysis in this area.  It is a wise and welcome suggestion to make an independent bailsman responsible for the conduct of the accused while on bail.  It has been the experience &mdash; although not invariably the case &mdash; that the person who puts up bail, the independent bailsman, is somebody closely connected with the accused.  If that person does not trust the accused, whom he or she <Col N="1741" /> knows better than the authorities or the Judiciary, to behave while on bail, why should we expect society to trust them as happens at present?</P>
    <P>The only response from the Minister to that suggestion was that &ldquo;it is by no means clear that there would not be constitutional problems&rdquo;&mdash; a double negative.  Can the Minister say where she got that advice?  Will she publish it because my advice is to the contrary?  I have been told that this proposal is patently constitutional.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the argument in the House on a number of occasions about preventive detention.  Of course, the weight of the arguments about preventive detention would be substantially lessened if there was a fast track system where people got to trial earlier.  There are sensible and logical proposals in the Bill for such a system and again, the Government seems to have set its face against them.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the proposals relating to preliminary examinations and the absolute right to insist on depositions. The absolute right of an accused person to have depositions taken is inappropriate in the circumstances which prevail in criminal law administration today.  The procedure set out in the 1967 Act for the protection of the accused is now being abused by clever, resourceful and mostly habitual criminals to frustrate the process by delaying their trial for an inordinate period of time.  Who benefits from the Minister's refusal to accept this proposal?  Habitual and resourceful criminals who constantly and skilfully play the system benefit, society, law abiding citizens and victims do not.</P>
    <P>The abuse of the depositions system is a fairly powerful weapon which resourceful criminals have developed to frustrate and delay the system.  What mandate does the Minister have to enable them to continue to abuse the system in this way?  Generally, the innocent do not abuse the system in this way. It is predictable who will resort to these tactics.  Clever, resourceful and skilled criminals have reduced the preliminary <Col N="1742" /> examination system and the taking of depositions to a parody.</P>
    <P>As far as I could ascertain from the Minister's speech, her only answer to the arguments that were well made on this side of the House in favour of these proposals was to say that Deputy O'Donoghue proposed a more radical proposal some weeks ago &mdash; a type of hybrid proposal &mdash; and that she would welcome the views of Deputies as to which proposal is best.  In the meantime nothing will happen.  The merry-go-round continues and a powerful weapon developed, by and large, by the guilty to delay and frustrate justice remains intact while the Minister waits to hear the views of Deputies as to which system is best.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains rational and logical proposals in relation to the right to silence. This right was evolved for the protection of the accused in different times from those in which we, unfortunately, now live.  At the time the right to silence was developed, the balance was titled in a different way.  In those days the accused were generally people of little or no education who could hardly read or write.  Even the most minor offences carried severe penalties.  Offences like pickpocketing attracted the death penalty. It was in that atmosphere and against such a background that the right to silence evolved.  However, the situation has changed.</P>
    <P>The absolute right to silence is arguably the most powerful weapon available to a resourceful criminal to beat the system.  It is invariably a device used by those who have something to hide, although not in all cases.  Why should an innocent person refuse to give an account of his or her movements?  What incentive has an innocent person to stay silent?  An innocent person would be anxious to explain why they could not have committed the crime of which they are accused.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on why an accused person, without prejudice, is able to rely on an explanation at his trial which he is not prepared to give when arrested or charged.  What is the logic behind that <Col N="1743" /> in the circumstances which pertain today?  In practice if a person remains silent, as they are entitled to do, it will not be held against them and will not prejudice them in any way.  The right to silence is used by people who need time to construct an alibi.  If they were compelled to give an account immediately, it could be cross-checked and they would not have time to prepare an alibi.</P>
    <P>Recently in Limerick two people, who were both convicted on many occasions, were arrested for savagely beating an 80-year-old woman in her own home.  One of the individuals whistled throughout a 48-hour interrogation. That shows the contempt these people have for the system, and they have even greater contempt for the victims. The other individual resorted to the tactic of shouting his head off in the cell downstairs because he believed, correctly, that it would frighten the elderly victim, who was upstairs, and discourage her from giving evidence.</P>
    <P>There are some cases where genuinely innocent people may wish to remain silent.  Under the Bill the fact that a person remains silent will not be sufficient to convict them, but it will be taken into account.  Judges are well equipped to give proper weight to a refusal to give an account and are empowered to draw inferences from it. That is not very difficult in the circumstances of a trial.  The absolute right to silence has outlived its &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date and must be changed in the interests of society.  It is a very powerful weapon for resourceful criminals who may decide to stay silent and let the State prove its case.</P>
    <P>Last year, according to Garda figures, the number of indictable crimes amounted to more than 100,000, or 300 per day.  That refers only to reported crime; the true figure is probably closer to 400 per day.  The detection rate of indictable crimes was about one in three but the true figure is probably one in four.  How many of those people walked away because of the right to silence? The chance of a person getting away <Col N="1744" /> with crime is great.  The tiny percentage of people who are convicted avail of the revolving door system and walk out of prison having served only a fraction of their sentence.  Is it any wonder confidence in the criminal justice system is at an all time low and there is a pervasive feeling that the system has irreparably broken down?</P>
    <P>The proposals dealing with the prison system are welcome.  There is no indication in the Book of Estimates that the Government intends to take measures to close the revolving door.  In its 15 months in office £1 billion has been added to the national debt, but only £3.5 million was provided for prison accommodation. That is how serious the Government is about closing the revolving door.  It will be left to the next Government to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that even if the revolving door is closed there will be no guarantee that the prison system will give value for money because there is also what I call the legal exit door. Even if every person sentenced by the courts served the totality of their sentence, the day would come when they would get out.  What is the attitude of those coming out of prison?  Deputy O'Malley gave the example of a person who went into prison drug free and come out a drug addict.  That is a regular occurrence in Mountjoy prison.  The value of the prison system must be assessed on the number of criminals who avoid a life of crime when they come out of prison.  Recidivism is rampant and prisons are universities of crime.  People come out of prison much better qualified in crime than they go in. The reason is that the prison system is a gigantic human warehouse, with no segregation of prisoners.</P>
    <P>Apart from appointing prison visiting committees &mdash; usually supporters of certain political parties &mdash; and paying them expenses, does the Minister ever read their reports?  I refer her to the 1994 report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee which indicated that when prisoners are housed together, rather than the better people influencing the <Col N="1745" /> worst, the opposite is the case.  The answer to that problem is segregation. Senior members of prison staff can identify those who possibly can be reformed or rehabilitated and those who have no interest in being rehabilitated.  Why should both categories be accommodated together?  That matter should be borne in mind by the Government, probably the next one, when taking action to close the revolving door.</P>
    <P>The system could be changed by having two basic types of prison institution, one geared towards rehabilitation and reform and the other geared towards punitive measures and detention.  There could be incentives within the system &mdash; for example, by engaging in a certain conduct people could be eligible for transfer from the punitive type institution to the institution for rehabilitation and reform.</P>
    <P>There are other problems with the system &mdash; for example, at present there is the ludicrous practice where a sentenced person need not serve the full sentence because of the automatic right to remission.  The right to remission should not be automatic but should be earned.</P>
    <P>None of these problems will be solved until the revolving door system is changed.  We must get value for the £44,000 plus per prisoner per year which the taxpayer must pay, and the priority is to close the revolving door. That system is a national scandal and has reduced the penal system to a joke &mdash; from the point of view of victims it is not a very funny joke.  The Government has given no indication that it intends to change the system.  It has not the will to do so because it is locked in ideological conflict, wedded to a policy of paralysis dictated by people whom the opinion polls indicate have the support of about 1 per cent of the electorate.  It will be up to the next Government to close the revolving door, and when measures are being taken to do so the other problems to which I referred must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I heartily agree with the proposals to <Col N="1746" /> unify the prosecution system.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, the person at the apex of the criminal prosecution system, when referring to the lack of a single command structure in the prosecution system said that the division between decision making and implementation means that two offices and several lawyers have to consider complex files, resulting in an absurd duplication of work and delays which otherwise could be avoided.  He pointed out the importance of concentrating in one agency the various tasks involved in the preparation of cases for trial &mdash; the decision to prosecute, the preparation of the book of evidence, attendance at the preliminary examination and preparation in due course of the instructions for prosecuting counsel.  He said he was convinced that a fully efficient and cohesive prosecution service will not be achieved until such a unified prosecution agency is in place.  He also said that the present highly satisfactory co-operation between the Garda Síochána and his office would then be extended throughout the prosecution of offences to the very considerable benefit of the entire criminal justice system and that in these days of public spending control it is not without importance to add that the overall financial saving would be very significant indeed.</P>
    <P>It is most unusual for such a senior civil servant, the most important figure in the criminal prosecution service, to go public and issue a cry for help to the Government.  He pointed out in the public media that there are insurmountable barriers to providing a more efficient prosecution service, but that it could be brought about, not at a net cost, but at a net loss to the Exchequer. What is the Government's response? Silence.  Everybody is aware there are difficulties in the criminal prosecution system.  Many believe the system has broken down completely.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, the person with most experience who heads up the criminal prosecution system, points to the difficulties in the public domain, but the Government's reaction to him could <Col N="1747" /> be compared to that of what our friend in Australia, Paul Keating, would call &ldquo;stunned mullets&rdquo;.  Its members stare at the DPP in silence.  That will have to change.  The system badly needs to be improved.</P>
    <P>A section in the Bill obliges the Minister for Justice to introduce regulations for a unified prosecution system.  That is probably the best that could have been done to deal with this complex matter by way of a Private Members' Bill.  The Minister said she will not take this on board.  She has no interest in what the Director of Public Prosecutions has to say.  She knows better.  There is no need for a unified prosecution system and the present system of duplication in which there is a lack of confidence should continue with all its expenses, inefficiencies and failures.  The necessary proposals are in the Bill but the Minister has chosen to reject them.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed by the Government's response to this Bill.  I read the Minister's speech.  She said that to accept this Bill would &ldquo;needlessly delay and disrupt the comprehensive programme of criminal law reform&rdquo;.  To what comprehensive programme is she referring?  We have one Bill.  There is also the incest Bill dealing with a specific problem, the finished product having been drafted by my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue.  Apart from that, this is the only Bill dealing with criminal law.  What is this nonsense about the comprehensive programme of criminal law reform?</P>
    <P>In regard to the <i>cri de coeur</i> from the Director of Public Prosecutions, we were told that the work of the Chief State Solicitor's office is being examined as part of an examination of the Director of Public Prosecution's office.  The Department of Finance has commenced a review of the structure and organisation of the Director of Public Prosecution's office.  We have been told above reviews and examinations.  We were told that the Minister is considering the issue of preliminary examinations. On the question of the right to <Col N="1748" /> silence, we were told that at some indeterminate time in the future this may be subjected to a full analysis and debate. Regarding early release, we were told that the question of the accommodation of prisoners is being kept under constant review.  We were told the establishment of a prisons board is under consideration, but <i>nil desperandum</i> because we were told later it is under very careful consideration.  The appointment of an inspector of prisons is due for consideration &mdash; at this stage the Minister was running out of adverbs &mdash; in the context of discussions which are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Sentencing generally cannot be touched until the Law Reform Commission reports.  That is the same body to which the Taoiseach referred as a stalling device to enable the last Government avoid hard decisions.  I said earlier that the Government was having it three ways, but it is having it four or maybe five ways.  The preliminary report of the Law Reform Commission on sentencing is two and a half years old and all but a few minor outstanding matters are dealt with therein.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to this Bill is a travesty.  Tonight will be a sad one for law abiding citizens but it will be a good one for criminals, who will continue to be cosseted and will contrive to prey on decent people with ever increasing fearlessness and audacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I join other Members in complimenting Deputy O'Donnell for introducing this Bill.  I have listened to the debate during the past two weeks but the terms of the Bill have not been addressed in the detail the Bill deserves.  The debate descended on a number of occasions to levels of political venom and personal vindictiveness that I have not often seen in my short time here.  There are good proposals in the Bill but the Minister for Justice has explained that the Government is not in a position to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to accusations made by Deputy O'Donnell last night on the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill. <Col N="1749" /> It is my understanding that it has been standard practice for Ministers of Justice not to get involved directly in day to day Garda operational decisions.  Those matters are properly the responsibility of the Garda authorities, not politicians. However, the Minister for Justice took the unusual and correct decision to give a confidential briefing to Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue.  That offer was made in good faith.  Deputy O'Donoghue respected the confidentiality of the briefing while Deputy O'Donnell chose to persist with a line of questioning and innuendo on a matter which not only puts at issue the capacity of the Garda to participate in a major international operation but also seeks to imply that members of the Government were improperly involved in the planning of this operation and are now improperly attempting to cover it up. The Garda should be complimented for their attack on the drugs menace.  My understanding is that no member of the Government knew of the details of that operation prior to its taking place.  The accusations made here last evening are unwarranted and without foundation.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill contains provisions dealing with pardons, remissions and temporary releases.  It begins by seeking to define the effect of a free pardon.  The proposals are the same as those contained in a previous Private Members' Criminal Justice Bill introduced by Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell in 1994.  The issue then and now is whether the effect of a pardon should be statutorily defined.  The question has been considered in the Department of Justice on a number of occasions and the position remains that, on the basis of all the advice available to her, the Minister for Justice is satisfied that there is no need to define by statute the legal effect of a pardon. Apart from constitutional or other considerations, a definition would be unnecessary since, under existing procedures, pardons can be worded in such a way as to achieve for practical purposes the same effect as a definition, <Col N="1750" /> including the definition proposed in section 31.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Part VII deals with the publication of details relating to remissions, commutations and temporary releases and to the maintaining of a register of those granted temporary release which would be open to public inspection.  It can be argued that it is a fundamental principle in the management of offenders that they serve the sentence handed down by the court and so repay their debt to society.  One of our main objectives in managing offenders, no matter how ideal it might seem at times, must be to give them the opportunity to lead a constructive lifestyle in the community on their release. If we have any hope of doing that, we must provide the services and facilities to encourage them rather than stigmatise them for life.  The publication of a register of those granted temporary release, which would be open to public scrutiny, could not fail to have such a stigmatising effect.  Apart from any moral considerations, the practical effect of such a measure could be calamitous.</P>
    <P>A significant number of temporary releases are given under the supervision of the probation and welfare service as part of programmes of rehabilitation and resocialisation for the offenders involved.  This process is a mainstay of the policy in regard to planned releases from custody and the management of sentences in a positive fashion.  The development of this policy, which should be promoted and encouraged, would be undermined if this proposal were implemented.  We could hardly expect offenders to commit themselves to such a rehabilitative supervision &mdash; which, incidentally, should not be regarded as a soft option &mdash; if their co-operation with the process is to be publicly announced and acccompanied by details of their offences and sentences. We must continue to pursue a philosophy of treatment of offenders which does not seek to minimise the gravity of their offences but which emphasises justice and fair play.  We are bound to such <Col N="1751" /> concepts by international commitment. To that end we must strive to give all offenders an opportunity to leave the past behind and begin a new life. Undoubtedly, the effect of the indiscriminate use of such public &ldquo;branding&rdquo; of offenders &mdash; who might have been sentenced for the first time or for minor offences &mdash; would be extremely detrimental.</P>
    <P>Most countries operate extensive systems of some form of parole but I am not aware of any that publishes lists of those who avail of it.  In this jurisdiction temporary releases have been granted &mdash; for a variety of compassionate reasons such as attendance at funerals of family members and for short periods as part of their rehabilitation process &mdash; by successive Ministers for Justice since 1960 after appropriate periods of sentence have been served.  Temporary release may be granted for different periods, as appropriate, ranging from a few hours to a weekly, renewable temporary release, all subject to the condition that, if the terms of release are not complied with the offender can be returned to custody without the need for fresh legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The practical arrangements necessary to compile and maintain such a statutory register would represent an immense bureaucratic task.  Even if there were no other objections, it would not be advisable to commit scarce staff and financial resources to such a exercise. Ultimately we must ask what practical benefit would be served by the maintenance of such a register.  If the aim is to reduce crime, I very much doubt if such a register would have any positive impact.  In fact, the opposite might very well be the case for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <P>None of what I say implies that the systems for managing the temporary release regime could not be improved. For example, it could be argued that information regarding people on temporary release should be held centrally, in such a manner as to allow easy access by the Garda or the courts, particularly <Col N="1752" /> when dealing with suspects who may be on temporary release.  A statutory public register, as suggested in the Bill, is not an appropriate way of achieving that objective.</P>
    <P>Nothing in what I have said on this section diminishes my acceptance that a proper level of custodial accommodation must be provided.  I welcome the Government's recent announcement of its intention to provide a substantial number of additional prison places.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations to those to which I have referred could be seen to arise in relation to section 32 which would require the publication of personal details relating to remissions and commutations.  As Deputies Michael McDowell and O'Donnell will be aware, since this proposal was first mooted in their Private Members' Bill in 1994, the petitions procedure has had to be reexamined in the light of the High Court judgment in the case of Patrick J. Brennan <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice, Ireland and the Attorney General.  I understand the Minister is considering the implications of this judgment for the operation of the petitions procedure and will consult the Attorney General on the matter.</P>
    <P>In any event, the reservations expressed on the publication of details of temporary releases might arise also in the case of commutations and remissions.  It has not been the practice to publish details of individual cases involving the commutation or remission of fines and sentences of imprisonment under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 or the delegated authority of Government dated 30 March 1951.  Individuals who lodge petitions are entitled to a certain degree of privacy concerning their personal affairs.  It is difficult to be certain that any good would accrue from the publication of the names and addresses of those who, for personal reasons &mdash; very often inability to pay &mdash; resort to the petitions process. Of course, such objection would not preclude the publication of statistics on the exercise of powers of remission, <Col N="1753" /> commutation and temporary release, as is suggested in section 34.</P>
    <P>I hope I have highighted some of the complex issues to which Part VII gives rise.  I commend Deputy O'Donnell on her work in its preparation but I do not believe acceptance of its Second Reading would be an appropriate or effective way to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who contributed to this debate.  There was a remarkable degree of consensus on the range of measures needed. Unfortunately there appears to be a degree of incoherence on the Government side of the House on the matter of law and order, an ideological divide among the governing parties on fundamental questions of law and order.  That is a great shame, because it is not a matter which lends itself to the degree of indecision we have witnessed on the part of this Government since it assumed office.</P>
      <P>We have witnessed such indecision on how bail and its reform should be tackled.  It is widely acknowledged that there is continuous abuse of bail.  Yet there is paralysis on this issue.  Any Member of this House could deliver a thirty-minute speech without notes on the matter of bail.  There has been a revolving, frustrating debate on bail and the need for reform since I became a Member of this House and, no doubt, before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Justice ministry does not prosper on indecision, or on the back-sliding we have witnessed since the Minister assumed office.  This back-sliding, indecision, incoherence and paralysis of analysis, along with further slagging matches between the Coalition parties on this issue will mean that we shall certainly not see our bail laws reformed. The only transparent feature of this Government is its divergence of opinion on the matter of bail, which is a great pity given that this is one area capable of reform.  If a consensus cannot be reached by members of this Government to put the bail issue to the electorate let the Government bring forward <Col N="1754" /> alternative proposals.  The Opposition is worn out advancing proposals.  This Bill contains proposals which fall short of a constitutional change.  Likewise, the Fianna Fáil Party have put forward proposals to reform the bail laws short of constitutional change.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, has also put forward legislative proposals short of constitutional reform. Let us have something, because the electorate is becoming tired of this revolving debate on the issue of bail.</P>
    <P>One of the most important tests of any criminal justice system is whether it inspires public confidence and is seen to be fair.  Most people want a fair system of justice that punishes the guilty and protects the innocent, a system open to review, capable of responding to change.  Our system fails across a whole range of tests.  The objective of my Bill is to remedy a range of different issues of law acknowledged to be in need of reform.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been criticised by some Members for endeavouring to achieve too much.  That may be a valid criticism but, on the other hand, so much needs to be done and there is so little forthcoming from this Government to reform our criminal justice system, I and my party were forced to avail of the only opportunity within a Dáil session to propose realistic, practical measures. Therefore, I cannot understand why it should be criticised for aiming to close all the well known loopholes.  Of course, it could also be amended.  That is unworthy of a Fine Gael Minister for Justice.  The Fine Gael Party has a mandate on law and order and, as far as I am aware, many of the issues such as the right to silence, reform of the bail laws and the accountability of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are Fine Gael policy.</P>
    <P>Is the practice of initiating Private Members' Bills a complete charade? After all this intellectual energy, two weeks of debate following months of preparation all the Government can say is that it is considering sending it to another review committee &mdash; endless <Col N="1755" /> procrastination, <i>mañana</i> with nothing taken on board.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Minister dismissed the Bill as not containing anything novel.  It would be more accurate to say that the problems it seeks to address are not novel.  I will list the measures we have tried to change and the proposals we have put forward in the Bill: practical measures to speed up and streamline State prosecutions; new provisions, short of a constitutional referendum, to prevent the abuse of bail; the forfeiture of bails money where the accused commits an offence whilst on bail &mdash; a most reasonable suggestion and new provisions to ensure that bail offenders serve consecutive sentences.  At present that does not happen and the Law Reform Commission in its report states that judges are not giving consecutive sentences.  Our Bill proposes that the DPP will have an obligation to point out to the court when a consecutive sentence would be applicable.  Another measure in the Bill is accountability of the DPP to Dáil Éireann in respect of prosecution policy generally.  There is no accountability for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I have spent three years tabling dozens of questions to the Taoiseach to extract the most simple statistical information on what goes on in that office.  Only when a Government fell and there was a huge disaster in the Office of the Attorney General when a paedophile priest was not extradited because of deficiencies in the office did we get reform of the Office of the Attorney General.  I welcome that but do we have to wait for another disaster before we have a reviewable system in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    <P>In our Bill we outline measures to curtail the absolute right to silence which is being abused by sophisticated criminals and is a well known obstacle to bringing criminals to justice.  We do not seek to abolish the absolute right to silence but to curtail it and put some checks on it.  These are very careful measures and we have been anxious to <Col N="1756" /> maintain a fair balance to protect the presumption of innocence.</P>
    <P>We propose to transfer responsibility for the prison system from the Department of Justice to a new statutory prison service, a recommendation of the Whitaker report in 1985.  The Dáil is inundated with reports that are not being implemented &mdash; recommendations are made but then nothing happens. That is the most frustrating aspect of an analysis of the criminal justice system &mdash; endless paralysis of analysis and nothing at the end of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a significant opportunity for change in the law upon which we rely in the fight against crime. This is not an academic exercise.  The justice system is falling down on a daily basis because of loopholes in it.  This is a serious well intentioned thought out proposal to alter some of those deficiencies and yet it is dismissed as unworkable.  That is quite depressing. Members expressed goodwill and asked why the Minister could not extract the good provisions and amend what she does not like.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has gone on record as saying he needs help, there are absurd duplications and delays in the present prosecution service. When the DPP made this statement I immediately raised it with the Taoiseach who has responsibility in this House for the operation of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the most important arm of the criminal justice system.  The question was transferred to the Minister for Justice even though the Taoiseach has responsibility for the Office of the DPP.  When the Minister for Justice answered the question eventually she said that she had not discussed this matter with the Director of Public Prosecutions, that she had met him socially but that it would be inappropriate because of the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for her to discuss this matter with him.  That is the sort of nonsense that has us in the situation in which we find ourselves in terms of the <Col N="1757" /> failure of the criminal justice system to get results.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the resources which are available for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions are top class and that he has at his disposal every possible facility and expertise and yet we have no way of knowing what he needs and the deficiencies of his office.  He has requested that there should be a unified prosecution service.  If one wishes to contact the Crown Prosecution Service in Britain, one can use the freefone and avail of the information pack and speak to the victim liaison officer.  In this State the victim is sidelined, reduced to the status of a witness and is not consulted at any point in the trial. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Many people have contacted me in regard to child abuse cases in particular. There has been an explosion in the number of such cases with 4,000 child abuse cases being reported to the health boards every year.  Files are going to the Director of Public Prosecutions that have been investigated by the gardaí and validated by the health board but I have reason to believe that not enough cases are being prosecuted.  Inexplicable <Col N="1758" /> decisions are being made not to prosecute in child abuse cases.  The reasons are never given but in all cases the consequences for the victim are disastrous. When a prosecution is not brought for reasons that are not given to the victim or anybody else, it means that he or she is not believed.  That is why, particularly in child abuse cases, it is very important that we have a prosecution policy which is up to date, sympathetic to the victim and which everyone understands.  We do not have that and, therefore, we need a total review of prosecution policy, from the reporting of the crime to the validation and the prosecution of it, to the sentencing and the treatment of the offender thereafter.  This area has not been given the benefit of intellectual debate in this House or in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If we do not put it in order it will lead to terrible heartbreak and misery for many people.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who supported the Bill.  I regret that the Government which states that it puts the victims of crime, the rights of the citizen, and crime and law and order at the top of its agenda is voting down the most reasonable proposals for change.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a glacadh leat as ucht na ceiste a tógadh anocht.  Chuir sé an-díoma orm nár éirigh liom an cheist a thógáil inné.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Tánaiste for coming into the House.  I am sure he is familiar with the details I am about to outline.  Harry Duggan has already served 21 years in various prisons in the United Kingdom; he is currently in Whitemoor Prison. Mr. Duggan's mother died this week and he applied for compassionate parole to attend her funeral.  Since I began working with the prisoners in Britain I <Col N="1761" /> always believed it would be impossible to overstate the part they played in bringing about the ceasefire of 1994.  I believe also that the lack of a humanitarian gesture and the refusal by the British authorities to make any movement on the prisoner issue, allied to the earlier release of Lee Clegg, had a seriously undermining effect on the prisoners' morale and on their efforts in favour of peace.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, when confidence building measures are so badly needed and when there is a lack of faith in the political process, particularly among prisoners, it is important that the British authorities make a humanitarian gesture. I ask the Tánaiste, therefore, to make firm representations that Harry Duggan be granted compassionate parole, even at this late stage, to return to Ireland for three days to be with his family at this time of bereavement. Twenty years is a long time to serve in prison, irrespective of the crime.  It is fair to point out also that Harry Duggan's co-defendant, Joe Connell, was the person who wrote to An Phoblacht recently urging the republican movement to pursue its aims by political means and to reinstate the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste also to press the British Government on the case of Patrick Kelly.  This case has been well documented in the public domain and I do not have to go over the details of it. Suffice to say that last October a medical expert from Canada diagnosed that Mr. Kelly's cancer had spread and since then his medical condition has continued to deteriorate.  The Tánaiste is aware of the updated medical position that has been confirmed by the specialist now treating Patrick Kelly.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to hope at this stage that the Home Secretary might be persuaded to expedite the transfer of Paddy Kelly to the Republic.  The legislation and the convention to do this are in place and I understand the necessary documents have been sent by the Department of Justice to the British authorities.  The American authorities were persuaded to adopt a particular <Col N="1762" /> approach one month ago and I now hope the British authorities can be persuaded by the Tánaiste to agree to Patrick Kelly's immediate transfer.  I know the Tánaiste has made previous representations in this case and I hope he will convey to his British counterparts the great disappointment experienced by myself and others who visited these prisoners and argued that politics does work.  What we, as politicians and parliamentarians, have been urging appears to have been totally ignored.  I hope that for the first time we will see confidence building measures and humanitarian gestures being taken with these prisoners.  I have no doubt that if they were taken, they would be a major step in rebuilding an IRA ceasefire and letting politics solve this problem.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the strong interest which the Deputy has taken in republican prisoners serving their sentences in English prisons.  The Deputy's commitment to their welfare was again demonstrated by his visit last week to the relevant, prisoners.  I know his concern is shared by members of all parties in this House, a number of whom from the Labour and Fine Gael parties have also visited the prisoners on several occasions in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The Government has continued to emphasise the importance of prison issues in the context of the peace process and these are fully discussed with the British authorities within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  In addition, humanitarian concerns relating to individual prisoners are raised on my instructions through our Embassy in London and the Anglo-Irish Secretariat. We have made clear that we stand ready to receive those republican prisoners who wish to be transferred to this jurisdiction and the papers in five of these cases have already been processed on our side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the republican prisoners played a significant role in framing the decisions which led <Col N="1763" /> to the cessation of IRA violence in August 1994.  As we work to have that cessation restored there are encouraging indications that republican prisoners remain convinced of the importance of building a peaceful and democratic way forward.  I hope they will continue to bring their influence to bear within the republican movement to ensure that the all-party negotiations which will begin on Monday, 10 June can be fully inclusive.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the specific cases raised by the Deputy.  Regarding the prisoner who requested compassionate parole to attend the funeral of his mother, on my instructions this matter was raised by the Embassy in London with the Home Office yesterday with a request that the parole be granted.  Regrettably, a decision was taken not to grant the prisoner parole and I understand that this was on security grounds.  As the Deputy will be aware, the funeral of the prisoner's mother was to take place this morning in County Clare.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to emphasise to the relevant British authorities the benefits which in our view are realisable from a compassionate approach to this kind of request.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for a considerable period with the other case raised by the Deputy, particularly on the grounds of the medical condition of the prisoner involved.  I have raised his case myself within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The prisoner was visited by an official of our Embassy in London when he was imprisoned in England on two occasions last year and his circumstances have been the subject of numerous representations to the British authorities through the Embassy and the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  In addition, officials of my Department have at their request maintained contact with a number of his close relatives.</P>
    <P>The re-classification of the prisoner in question last November by the British authorities and his temporary transfer <Col N="1764" /> to Maghaberry prison in Northern Ireland were positive developments. Unfortunately, it would appear that in recent days there are renewed grounds for concern in regard to the medical condition of the person in question.  On my instructions, his case was again raised last week with the relevant British authorities and our serious concern about his apparently deteriorating condition was made clear.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Embassy in London and our officials in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat have had a number of further contacts with the British side about this case in the past few days.  I understand that the British authorities have arranged for a further medical examination of the person in question either today or very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the person whose case he has raised has, in fact, applied for a transfer to prison in this jurisdiction.  I would like to repeat again that we stand ready to receive him if the British authorities agree to his transfer under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  I believe that if the worst fears about his health are confirmed he should be enabled to spent the period ahead near to his family in County Laois.  This could be done by means of a transfer to this jurisdiction or indeed by a decision by the British authorities to release the prisoner on compassionate grounds in view of his grave medical condition.</P>
    <P>When I meet the British co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, Sir Patrick Mayhew, later this week.  I will again raise the case in question with him.  The compassionate handling of such cases is, I believe, of crucial importance in terms of building the confidence which both Governments are agreed is necessary if we are to achieve our shared objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I also thank him for the concern and interest he <Col N="1765" /> expressed when this matter was raised in the Dáil.  We succeeded in carrying out an inquiry into the operation of this nursing home.  Its conclusions showed there was overcrowding, unqualified nursing staff on duty, an insurance deficiency and no fire certificate in the nursing home.  It is now clear from the report that the Southern Health Board, in executing and operating under the terms of the Act, was also inadequate in this instance.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that a nursing home which was registered in September 1994 should have an inspection carried out in May and September 1995 and that few of the complaints outlined in May 1995 were resolved.  Indeed, further complaints were added to the list in September 1995 without any indication that action would be taken by that health board in implementing the Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that an extremely vulnerable group is involved in this case.  What is the consequence of the lack of incontinence pads and drugs being dispensed by unqualified staff for the patients and how do they suffer? That aspect has not been covered in this report.  However, given these problems one can only conclude that there was a lack of patient care.  Under the Act both the Southern Health Board and the nursing home are charged to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister's reply to concentrate on the investigation carried out by the inquiry team <i>vis-à-vis</i> that which was done by the internal inspection in May and September 1995.  One bears no relationship to the other.  The inquiry investigation was foolproof, in-depth and produced results.  This begs the question of whether there are more Woburn nursing homes in this country and the lessons we can learn from this inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers that £120,000 of public money was paid to this nursing home from its time of registration to the time of the inquiry, serious questions must be asked about whether that money was well spent.  When the inquiry <Col N="1766" /> team examined the accounts, it could not get a complete set of payroll figures. While a C2 certificate is required in every other public contract, it does not seem to operate as far as nursing homes are concerned.</P>
    <P>Is it not also extraordinary that 12 GPs certified in writing that they saw nothing wrong with the patient care operating in that nursing home?  Surely a question must be asked about those GPs relative to the letters of commendation they gave to the inquiry.  There is a dilemma in the sense that under the Act officials of the board register nursing homes and carry out inquiries with the result that the line has become blurred.  There is no complaints procedure. When Councillor Con O'Leary raised this issue initially he could not avail of Dáil privilege.  He faced a major difficulty in deciding whether to go public on the issue.  The time has come for the Minister to consider providing for a complaints procedure in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act.  There is a charter of rights for patients in general hospitals and the Minister should provide for such a charter in legislation for the residents of nursing homes.  It is important that this should happen.</P>
    <P>In relation to the conclusions of the report the Minister should consider establishing an independent inspectorate to ensure there is not a repeat in any nursing home throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into operation on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives: first, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act, and, second, to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  The Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons will be well cared for.  The Act provides the health boards with another option in meeting <Col N="1767" /> the needs of the dependent elderly locally and flexibly and has served to strengthen the links between the health boards and the private and voluntary nursing home sector.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the Act to 31 December 1995 a total of 13,911 applications for subvention have been received by the health boards, of which 7,568 have been granted.  In the same period, approximately £31.2 million was made available to the health boards for the implementation of the Act.  This year almost £16 million has been allocated to the health boards to continue the implementation of the Act.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Act also assigns responsibility for the insepction of nursing homes to health boards. Articles 23.1 to 25.3 of the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993, give health boards power to inspect nursing homes and premises believed to be nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Under the Act all nursing homes are obliged to register with a health board. Before placing a nursing home on the register, the health board must inspect the home to ensure that it conforms to the required standard of staffing, accommodation and design.  The regulations require the health boards to inspect all homes at least once every six months.  The boards may visit at more frequent intervals where this is felt necessary.  If a nursing home does not comply with the regulations, the health board may attach a condition to the registration that the problem be resolved, it may refuse or revoke registration or it may prosecute the proprietor. In certain conditions, the health board may assume the management of the home.  The regulations also introduce for the first time a formal complaints procedure whereby a health board must investigate complaints received about a nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I launched the code of practice for nursing homes last year.  The Years Ahead <Col N="1768" />&mdash; A Policy for the Elderly recommended that the Department, in consultation with the health boards and representatives of nursing home proprietors, should draw up a code of practice for nursing homes.  Work on the code took place in parallel with the preparation of the regulations to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The code was prepared by a working party set up for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the code is to assist nursing home proprietors and staff, officers of the health boards and the general public to a better understanding of what is involved in providing high quality care to residents of nursing homes.  The code attempts to define what is currently considered to be good quality nursing home care.  It builds on the best practice in nursing homes at present.  I am satisfied most nursing home proprietors are attempting to implement the recommendations of the code to the best of their abilities.</P>
    <P>At 31 December 1995 a total of 348 private and voluntary nursing homes had been registered by the health boards.  Of these, a small percentage were found to be in breach of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993.  The health boards view any breach of the Act and regulations in a serious light and all complaints are investigated without delay. The health boards inform me that where breaches have been identified the nursing home owners concerned have, in general, co-operated fully in meeting the standards laid down by the Act and regulations.  This is borne out by the Southern Health Board's detailed investigation into Woburn House nursing home.</P>
    <P>As mentioned previously, the inspection and registration of nursing homes are essentially functions of the health boards.  I have only received the Southern Health Board's report on Woburn House nursing home in the last few days and I am still considering it.  However, if I feel that lessons can be learned from the Woburn experience I will bring <Col N="1769" /> these matters to the attention of the other seven health boards with a view to preventing similar situations arising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disppointed that the Minister for Education &mdash; this is no reflection on the Minister of State who was not involved in the decision to exclude Clonmel High School &mdash; has not come to the House to answer the points I wish to raise.  As you, a Cheann Comhairle, and many other Members are aware, this school was meant to cater for an enrolment of 320 pupils.  Currently, there are 684 enrolled.  It is the only second level academically oriented school in the town and there are 18 feeder schools.</P>
      <P>Last year 100 pupils had to be turned away because of lack of space.  The closing date this year for the receipt of applications is 19 March and already over 200 application forms have been sent out.  There is a real danger that first year pupils will not be taken in.  An enrolment of 135 pupils this year would bring the total enrolment to over 700 and such a number would not be manageable. The demand for places in increasing because of the tremendous achievements and excellence of the school.</P>
      <P>It is accepted by the Department of Education that the population of Clonmel will continue to increase.  It was announced recently that Seagate was to establish in the town and create 1,200 jobs.  Employment is also to increase at Medite and Merck Sharp and Dohme. Over £75 million has been invested under the urban renewal scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We constantly make the point to those contemplating establishing industry in the area that it has an excellent centre of education.  Unfortunately, their employees will not be able to send their children to it.  The alternative is to ask them to send their children to Rockwell College, a fee paying school. This would be out of the question for <Col N="1770" /> most people as the costs involved amount to £1,500 to £2,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to refuse to sanction the provision of extra accommodation. This may mean that no first year pupils will be taken in in two consecutive years.  To say the local community is shocked and outraged is to put it mildly.  This will not be tolerated by the pupils, parents and staff who have shown their goodwill on the understanding that the necessary funds will be made available and the work carried out.  When the Minister met a deputation last November there was a clear insinuation that the school was at the top of the list and would be given priority if funds became available.  One Government Deputy even announced that there would be good news for the school.  Many people from that area have done exceptionally well.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that for the want of a total of 1,304 square metres of accommodation at a mere cost of £1 million the education of young boys in Clonmel will be stymied.</P>
    <P>Out of a budget of more than £2 billion surely the Minister could allocate £200,000 or £300,000 to start this project next October.  That amount of money would be sufficient until January.  Many builders would extend credit to the Department or facilities could be arranged with banks and other institutions prepared to assist.  Unfortunately, however, there does not appear to be any hope.  I am fearful the good will of the pupils, parents and staff may be eroded.  A total of 39 staff in the school use a staff room intended for 14 people.  It is difficult to work in those conditions.  The decision not to sanction funding for this project will not encourage investment in the town.  I appeal to the Minister of State to persuade the Minister that facilities could be put in place this year.  I received a deliberately misleading reply in the House last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Irrespective of how one describes such a reply, people are angry about the matter.  A physically handicapped neighbour of mine attends the school but cannot attend certain classes due to the lack of facilities to bring him upstairs and elsewhere.  The good will of the teachers, parents and pupils and the strong discipline in the school may not last much longer.  If there is not an intake of 135 pupils this year, what alternative do those young people have?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me an opportunity to air my strong views on this issue.  While acknowledging the funding allocated by the Minister to Cahir community college, Cashel community school and St. Anne's in Tipperary, the people in Clonmel are shocked at the exclusion of Clonmel High School from funding in this financial year.  It is difficult to accept the injustice meted out to young boys who, as a result of this decision, may not be able to continue their secondary education in the town.  As a former teacher I realise how difficult it is to provide good education in overcrowded circumstances.  As my son is a student at the school I am aware of the discomfort teachers and pupils are experiencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the numerous requests and arguments I made on behalf of the high school in the past 12 months did not result in the Minister listing the school for priority.  I ask the Government to immediately allocate the necessary £250,000 for repair works so that the extension can start in October.  If that does not happen many boys in Clonmel will not be able to <Col N="1772" /> receive a second level education in September.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for allowing us join as a team from the constituency to make a case for funding for Clonmel High School.  My colleagues have not over emphasised the problem.  The figures stand on their own in respect of the numbers required. It is reassuring to know the Department has at least accepted the need for 600 places.  If the high school cannot take in first year students this year &mdash; normally it takes in approximately 120 each year &mdash; the vocational system will not be able to take up the slack.  Consequently, prefab buildings will have to be provided in Clonmel but that is not the answer.  The high school project must be given priority.  The cost involved would be approximately £880,000.  If some of the building work starts this year teachers and parents would be satisfied.  Fund raising is taking place in the community and if the Minister gives the project the go-ahead this worthwhile project could start in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  It provides me with an opportunity to explain the Department's general policy in relation to the provision of school accommodation and the particular response being made in the case of the High School, Clonmel.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to make is that, in the case of towns such as Clonmel where there is a number of post-primary schools, the Department's responsibility is to ensure that these schools can, between them, cater for all the pupils seeking second level places.  In the case of Clonmel, I am satisfied that the two post-primary schools there which cater for boys can indeed accommodate all the pupils seeking second level places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be more specific, the two schools in Clonmel which cater for boys could, combined, provide between 240 and 250 intake places.  As against that, the number of boys due to leave primary school <Col N="1773" /> in the catchment area this year is around 220.  It is obvious from these figures that the two post-primary schools, taken together, can readily absorb the total number seeking places.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that all pupils will get a place in the school of first choice. The Department must ensure that existing accommodation is fully utilised before the provision of additional pupil places can be considered.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Christian Brothers High School, the school authorities submitted proposals to my Department which included a proposal for the provision of some additional accommodation. The Department's planning section examined this application and decided that additional temporary accommodation should be provided at the CBS to cater for projected enrolments of 600 in the short-term and 450 in the long-term.  These projections were based on the 1992-93 enrolment figure of 604 pupils.</P>
    <P>In reaching its conclusions, the planning section was conscious of the fact that while some temporary accommodation might be necessary to cater for the existing short-term enrolment, there would be sufficient places in the centre as a whole to cater for all the pupils seeking school places.</P>
    <P>The current position concerning the planning of the new extension is that the school authorities have been requested to submit the detail design for the project. When this has been received and examined by the Department, the next stage will be the preparation of the bills of quantities, which is the stage prior to the invitation of tenders.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by the Deputies, and indeed by the school authorities, that there is overcrowding in the CBS at the moment.  However, I emphasise again that this problem has arisen because a high proportion of the boys seek places in the high school rather than in the vocational school and this has been the case for the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the urgent need for the additional accommodation <Col N="1774" /> already approved by the Department for the school.  The building project at the CBS was one of a large number of projects considered for inclusion in the 1996 post-primary capital programme. Unfortunately, due to the extremely high level of demand on the available finance, it was not possible to include it on this occasion.  However, architectural planning will continue up to the stage where the project is ready to go to tender. At that point, the project will be considered as a matter of priority for inclusion in the 1997 capital programme.</P>

      <P>This is a sad day for the pig industry in Cavan-Monaghan.  As I speak the 9 o'clock news is probably showing a report on the closure of the Cavan slaughter plant.  That factory may never be reopened and the 90 employees &mdash; one man has not been out of work for 44 years &mdash; will end up on the dole.  Counties Cavan and Monaghan have a history in pig production and many producers modernised their farmyard enterprises by installing large computerised feeding units.  Employment is now centred in the slaughtering plants and on value added products.  My colleague will deal in more detail with the Cavan plant as he is more familiar with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the problem in Monaghan is similar, it is of a different dimension. When the Graham factory was reopened the workers were employed as subcontractors &mdash; they were not members of SIPTU.  The price of pigs increased from 95p a kilo 12 months ago to £1.40 a kilo a few weeks ago &mdash; I think there has been a slight reduction since then.  There has been a reduction in supply and an increase in the demand <Col N="1775" /> for the products.  A British firm which recently took over a Northern Ireland plant has increased the weekly slaughter throughput from 3,000 to 8,000.  This increase was picked up by southern farmers because there was no taxation control or any other type of control.  Not so long ago we asked the electorate to vote in favour of a Single Market of 300 million people.  As we now see, jobs can be snatched from under people's noses. I would like to know how fair this competition is.  If the company in Belfast continues in operation it will soon have a monopoly and cause serious problems in the industry.</P>
    <P>If this problem arose in any other part of the country there would be an outcry, Ministers would make promises and the IDA and Forbairt would seek alternative employment.  However, there has been no word about the problem in Cavan-Monaghan.  The Minister refused to meet SIPTU, did not meet his counterpart in England, did nothing at EU level and has not met the producers.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for sharing his time with me.  I was very disappointed at the reply given by the Minister yesterday to parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Leonard and me on the crisis in pig processing plants and, in particular, the plight of the workers at McCarren and Company Limited, Bacon Curers, in Cavan who have been let go.  The final sentence of the Minister's reply stated: &ldquo;The outlook for the industry is good and, as indicated, supplies are expected to become more plentiful in the latter part of the year&rdquo;.  Nothing in his reply conveyed any urgency in tackling the <Col N="1776" /> problems experienced by the pigmeat industry in recent weeks, problems which have resulted in the closure of McCarren and Company Limited in Cavan with a loss of approximately 100 jobs.</P>
      <P>McCarren and Company Limited, which was established in 1860, was a very good employer, providing gainful employment for generations of Cavan families.  Its products were first class and it had markets at home, in Britain, Europe and North America.  I am very disappointed that the workers have been laid off as they were committed to earning an income and most of them have mortgages and family commitments. They are very disappointed that no action has been taken by the Minister to deal with this crisis.  McCarren's not only provided gainful employment in Cavan but it was also an important processing outlet for primary producers in the county and neighbouring areas. Pig farming constitutes a major segment of the farming industry in County Cavan, with a 36 per cent increase in pig numbers between 1980-91.  The main manufacturing sector is the food sector which employs approximately 1,300 people, representing 35 per cent of total manufacturing.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister, Deputy Yates, did not accede to a request by SIPTU at national level for a meeting to discuss this crisis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, met with SIPTU because of the crisis in Tralee in his constituency.  If the Minister finds it difficult to provide specific assistance for the pig processing industry then he should take the initiative and meet with the representatives of the primary producers, the unions and the pig processing plants.  The long-term future of the pigmeat industry is in question. The primary producers, the workers in the plants and the processing industry need a Minister who will take responsibility and give the lead at this difficult time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The making of announcements when there is good news is not sufficient for any industry.  The Minister has shirked <Col N="1777" /> his responsibility to make every possible effort to save jobs in this long-standing industry and to formulate a co-ordinated plan which will deal with the cyclical problems which affect it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has created a precedent by giving an Opposition Deputy some of his time. However, he is aware of my involvement in the industry.  This problem has been created by the purchase of a large plant in the North by a multinational company which is buying pigs from southern suppliers, thereby creating a substantial shortfall here.  As Deputy Gallagher said, the problems in this industry are of a cyclical nature and there is a shortfall in supply at present.</P>
      <P>Under various Ministers for Agriculture, for example, Deputies Deasy and Walsh and Senator Kennedy, the industry was developed to the stage where there were 3.5 million pigs.  The modern trend is to have large processing plants and grant aid has been given for this purpose.  One of the finest processing plants is located in Tralee in the Minister of State's constituency. However, this plant also has a shortfall. I do not know how the problems can be overcome given that this cash rich British firm is buying pigs at exorbitant prices.  I am concerned that there could be a contraction in the industry and a reduction in pig numbers from 3.5 million to 3 million.  Given the high costs of processing, a large-scale operation is the way ahead in the industry.  In the UK, Holland and Denmark an average of 15,000 pigs are slaughtered every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look to developing a modern, efficient industry.  I hope the Minister will recognise the problems the industry is facing caused by the scale of the operation in the north with the involvement of a UK company, and <Col N="1778" /> create greater incentives to southern producers to overcome the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Deputy Leonard that I met SIPTU, as acknowledged by Deputy Brendan Smith.  I assure this House I am concerned about the difficulties being experienced in the pig industry.  If proof is needed to demonstrate our concern for the pig industry, I ask Deputies to recall the early months of 1995, just after the Minister and I came into office, when pig prices were very low and producers were suffering substantial losses.  We set about introducing a number of measures aimed at restoring profitability to pig producers.  We achieved that aim mainly by reducing the veterinary inspection charges and other levies due on pigs at slaughter.  Pig prices rose to a satisfactory level and balance was restored to the market.</P>
      <P>However, the price of pigs has risen substantially since the beginning of this year, and this has created difficulties for the processing side of the industry. Slaughtering plants particularly in the Border regions are finding it difficult to obtain supplies of pigs because of the high prices which they have to pay. Unfortunately, one such plant, McCarrens of Cavan, temporarily closed its premises last week, for a period of three months, and some 100 employees have been laid off.  The firm indicated that it cannot afford to pay the high prices being sought for pigs at the moment.  My Department contacted Forbairt about this firm and has been informed by Forbairt that detailed discussions are ongoing with the company to see how the problems can be overcome.  In that regard Forbairt has offered its full services to the firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors are influencing the price of pigs at the moment.  As is well known, the pig industry is by its nature cyclical, which means that pig numbers fluctuate from time to time thus creating shortages or oversupplies. I am pleased to say that the December <Col N="1779" /> 1995 CSO livestock survey shows that pig numbers in Ireland have risen by 2.9 per cent on the figure for December 1994, standing at 1,542,000 compared to 1,498,000.  We can therefore look forward to supplies becoming more plentiful in the latter part of this year, as it will take some months before the increased number of pigs will be ready for slaughter.</P>
    <P>The arrival of a major pigmeat processing firm in Northern Ireland towards the end of last year is another large factor which has led to the shortage of pig supplies in the south.  This new Northern Ireland firm is sourcing some of its supplies south of the Border and is offering higher prices for the raw material than processors in the south. Naturally, pig producers in the south will sell for the highest price, and the result is that there is a movement of pigs northwards.  Slaughterings in Northern Ireland for the first seven weeks of 1996 are some 4 per cent up on slaughtering for the same period in 1995, while the corresponding figure for slaughtering in the south is down by 4.4 per cent.  I vividly remember meeting a number of Cavan and Monaghan pig farmers in 1994 when they were about to go out of <Col N="1780" /> business and were here protesting about the price of pigs.  Perhaps the two Deputies opposite would ask those people to supply the plants in the south rather than exporting their pigs across the Border.</P>
    <P>Under the single market rules of the EU it is not possible to stop the movement of pigs northwards across the Border. In normal circumstances there has been a two way movement of pigs. Neither can national aids be given to the pig industry as the Common Organisation of the marketing of pigmeat precludes this.  Therefore, neither I nor the Minister can intervene directly in what is essentially a commercial matter between producers and processors in the pig industry.  The outlook for the industry is good, and as I indicated earlier, supplies are expected to become more plentiful in the latter part of the year.  I would point out also that in the past couple of weeks pig prices have begun to ease and I hope this trend will continue so that balance can be restored to the pigmeat market.</P>
    <P>I will, however, continue to monitor the situation and to keep in contact with Forbairt about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 March 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>In 1995, Naval Service vessels carried out a total of 83 patrols which involved a total of 1,129 patrol days.  The two CASA maritime patrol aircraft carried out 267 patrols involving a total of 1,552 flying hours.</P>
      <P>The combination of Naval Service and Air Corps patrols resulted in 7,277 sightings of fishing vessels of which 936 were boarded for inspection by the Naval Service and 51 of these were subsequently detained for alleged breaches of fishery regulations while a further 79 were issued with warning notices in relation to minor offences.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service and Air Corps are tasked with ensuring that all fishing vessels operating within Ireland's area of jurisdiction, including the south coast, comply with both EU and national fishery regulations.</P>
      <P>The new control measures, including the requirement for fishing vessels to report entry into and exit from Irish waters and the Irish box, introduced from the beginning of this year, will result in more effective enforcement of fisheries regulations by both the Naval Service and the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall cost of all Naval Service and Air Corps operations, including fisheries surveillance operations, is met from within various subheads of the Defence Vote.  The total cost of the Naval Service in 1995 was approximately £35 million.  As the vast bulk of Naval Service activity in 1995 was related to fishery protection it can be taken that the majority of the expenditure was consequently related to fishery protection.  The total cost of the Air Corps in 1995 was approximately £37 million.  The cost attributable to fisheries patrols is estimated at £5 million based on the fact that such patrols <Col N="1576" /> account for some 13.5 per cent of all Air Corps flying operations.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of Military History was established in 1947 with the object of collecting and collating material on which might be based an authentic history of the events following on from the formation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913 up to the date of the Truce in 1921.</P>
      <P>The bureau ceased to function with effect from 31 March 1959.  The material collected by the bureau together with the bureau records and documents have been stored in the Department of the Taoiseach.  This arrangement is in accord with a Government decision taken on 20 December 1957.</P>
      <P>It was a fundamental rule of the bureau from the outset that no material entrusted to it would be disclosed to anyone outside the bureau save with the express consent of the donor.  This was to ensure that persons who made statements could do so with complete confidentiality. When the bureau was set up the then Minister for Defence, with the consent of the then Taoiseach, decided that the material collected should not be released to historians or others during the lifetimes of persons who took part in the events with which the bureau was concerned.  This decision was confirmed in 1955 in a radio broadcast by the then Minister for Defence who, in 1956, quantified the release period at 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 25 year period expired on 27 July 1981 but as some of the persons concerned were still alive it was decided that the bar on the release of material <Col N="1578" /> should be extended for a further five years.  The matter has been reviewed regularly since, in consultation with the Director of National Archives, and the bar on general release has been extended for successive periods, the latest of which is due to expire on 27 July this year.</P>
    <P>Each person who made a statement to the bureau was given a copy of their statement at the time but subsequent requests for copies of statements whether from the persons themselves or their relatives were always refused.  In 1987 the Government decided that the Minister for Defence should be allowed discretion to release material presented to the bureau on application by immediate relatives of donors.</P>
    <P>The question of making this material generally available to historians and researchers will be examined again by the Government prior to the expiration of the bar on their release.</P>

      <P>In general, military aircraft from different countries overflying Irish airspace are in receipt of annual blanket diplomatic clearance from Ireland for such overflights.  The blanket diplomatic clearance is a reciprocal measure for the granting by these countries of the same type of clearance to Ireland for Irish military aircraft to overfly their airspace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of the blanket clearance that the operators of the aircraft pass details of each proposed flight, i.e. date, timing etc. to the Department of Foreign Affairs, who copy the information to the Departments of Justice and Defence for information.  In addition, I should stress that a further <Col N="1579" /> condition of each flight is that no armaments, munitions, photographic or intelligence gathering equipment are carried on the aircraft.  The system of blanket clearance and prior notification of proposed flights works satisfactorily and I am not aware of any problems arising in relation to violation of Irish airspace.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to furnish information involving matters of a security nature in regard to equipment available to the Defence Forces.</P>

I also wish to state that it is my intention to ensure that a comprehensive support service is put in place to facilitate an easy transition to civilian life, whether in future employment or in retirement, for those who wish to avail of the scheme.

      <P>The continued availability of a ministerial air transport service is an essential facility for the Government in conducting its business.  This is particularly the case during this year when Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union from 1 July.  The availability of a dedicated aircraft is clearly necessary when account is taken of many factors such as the priority of Ministers engagements, the demands of Minister's schedules and the availability and suitability of other travel arrangements.</P>

      <P>In 1993 the Government decided that, given the changed international environment, an up-to-date statement of roles for the Defence Forces should be drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 21 September 1993 the Government decided that the new roles of the Defence Forces should be: (1) to defend the State against armed aggression; this being a contingency, preparations for its implementation will depend on ongoing Government assessment of threats; (2) to aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist when requested, the Garda Síochána, who have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the <Col N="1583" /> State; (3) to participate in international missions in the cause of peace; (4) to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union; and, (5) to carry out such other duties as may be assigned to them from time to time, for example, search and rescue, air ambulance service, ministerial air transport service, assistance on the occasion of natural disasters, assistance in connection with the maintenance of essential services.</P>
    <P>Last July the Government established an implementation group to draw up detailed plans in relation to the review of the Defence Forces and a major reform is now in train.  Yesterday the Government announced certain decisions arising out of the report of the implementation group and a phased programme of reorganisation will now begin.</P>
    <P>The revised statement of roles approved by the Government in 1993 places greater emphasis on the current operational tasks of the Defence Forces, including aid to the civil power, UN service, search and rescue and fishery protection, as distinct from &ldquo;defence of the State against external aggression&rdquo;, formerly stated to be the primary role.</P>
    <P>No one role is now given primacy over another and the thrust of the reorganisation process is to more closely align the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces with the tasks which they carry out on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    <P>The strategic plan for a restructured Defence Forces allows for a flexibility to permit the organisation to meet all roles.  All situations, including the international environment, are kept under constant review to ensure that the Defence Forces are in a position to carry out their assigned functions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the pier at Carrickarory Moville, which is now owned by Donegal County Council <Col N="1585" /> is in a very poor state of repair.  I understand that the county council advise against its use as a landing place in view of its condition and it has not been extensively used in recent years.</P>
      <P>From a fisheries perspective it would be difficult to make a case for investment at the pier even if the resources were available to do so.  Future possible investment proposals should more realistically focus on the development needs of Moville pier itself and the port of Greencastle, both of which are used for landings of fish and shellfish by fishermen of the area.</P>
      <P>In any event, and to clarify the situation for the Deputy, there is no EU designation system for Irish fishing ports and harbours in relation to landings by the domestic fishing fleet.  Irish fishing boats are free to land their catch into any suitable harbour.  There is one exception to this.  Boats fishing for herring and mackerel are required under the terms of their licences, to land into specified ports.  Killybegs and Rossaveal are the specified ports for the north west herring and mackerel boats.  It is also the case that under EU regulations fishing vessels from outside the EU are required to land in certain designated ports.  This is primarily to facilitate necessary inspection of such vessels by the national authorities.  I am not clear if it is these designation scenarios which the Deputy actually has in mind but he will understand that Carrickarory would not qualify under either category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 38, 50 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> As the House is aware, I dealt in some detail with the tragic loss on the <i>Jenalisa</i> in the context of an Adjournment Debate in this House on 28 February last.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the specifics of the questions, I would like to take this opportunity to bring the House up to date on developments.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the salvage operation has been completed.  The vessel has been delivered to Waterford port where a full inspection has commenced. Preliminary indications are that damage to the vessel is consistent with an impact.  I must stress that this does not necessarily mean that the boat was involved in a collision.  I cannot and will not speculate on the nature, cause or circumstances of the impact.  That will be a matter for the investigating marine surveyor.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the bodies of Peter Nolan and Niall Power were not found on board.  I am assessing whether further surface or coastal searches are warranted or would be likely to be productive.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the salvage team, Celtic Diving and Salvage, for effecting the raising and delivery to Waterford of the <i>Jenalisa</i> in a successful and efficient manner.  I also want to thank the Naval and Garda divers for their unstinting help in the search for bodies and the inspection of the vessel.  I want to express my appreciation of the RNLI for their help and of the tremendous co-operation received at all times from the fishermen of Dunmore East and the south east generally.</P>
    <P>I also wish to again express my sincere sympathies to the relatives of the three fishermen who were lost.  Peter Nolan, Niall Power and Conor O'Grady.  The House will be aware of the particular pain of the Nolan and Power families arising from the fact that no trace of these fishermen has been found to date.</P>
    <P>Turning to the matter of the arrangements for the salvage of the vessel, the decision to raise the vessel was made on <Col N="1588" /> 16 February on foot of the strong recommendation of the investigating marine surveyor.  Tenders were sought the same day, these were received on 20 February and a contract was placed on 21 February.</P>
    <P>Three companies tendered for the raising of the <i>Jenalisa</i>.  They were Celtic Diving and Salvage, North East Diving Services Ltd. and Haulbowline Industries. All three tenderers were required to undertake the salvage in accordance with the &ldquo;Notice to Persons Tendering&rdquo;. This provided in particular that the successful tenderer would be expected to take advantage of the &ldquo;next suitable weather window&rdquo;.  Following the award of the tender to North East Diving Services, it was agreed between my Department and the salvor that the latter would be on site by Saturday 24 February. The key factor in the decision to award the contract related to the means and techniques to be used to raise the vessel so as to ensure as far as possible that the vessel was not damaged in the process.  If any of the proposals offered by the other tenderers had been accepted, the requirement would have been that the operation would have commenced within three to five days weather permitting.</P>
    <P>Weather and technical difficulties delayed the arrival of the chosen salvage vessel.  It was originally expected to arrive in Dunmore East on Saturday 24 February, then on Monday.  It emerged later that further difficulties meant that the salvage vessel would not be on site until well into the week beginning 4 March 1996.  Officials of my Department reviewed the position with the contractor on 28 February.  It was made clear to him that, in view of the these delays, the terms of the agreement had been breached and that there was no option but to regard it as terminated.  Alternative options were reviewed including an alternative option offered by the original salvor.  An alternative arrangement was subsequently made with Celtic Diving and Salvage based on full assessment of all relevant factors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> The contract was awarded to Celtic Diving and Salvage on 28 February and they arrived on site on 4 March.  It must be emphasised that the arrangements entered into with Celtic Diving and Salvage were substantially different from those offered by that company in the original tenders.</P>
    <P>It is regretted that there was a delay in the raising of the vessel.  It is clear that over a week was lost but that this was due to factors entirely outside the Department's control.</P>

      <P>My Department is directly involved with certain measures, funded under the Joint INTERREG Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland 1994-1999 and the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, which apply specifically in the southern Border counties.</P>
      <P>The INTERREG Programme provides for assistance for projects in the marine and inland fisheries areas; £1.5 million in public funding has been provided for these purposes in the period to 1999.</P>
      <P>The EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, which was introduced as a direct consequence of the Peace Process, contains a measure which can assist actions of a cross-Border nature between public bodies in the areas of fishing and aquaculture.  The public funding provision for the southern Border counties is £0.666 million. In addition, other measures in the Programme may assist fisheries related employment and training, tourism and small business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU assisted programmes, measures and initiatives for which my Department is primarily responsible and which are of relevance to Border counties are the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999, the <Col N="1591" /> Ports Measures of the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999, the Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, the Coastal Protection Measure of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999, and the PESCA Community Initiative 1994-1999. Proposals for assistance under these programmes, measures and initiatives for projects in Border counties are evaluated by reference to the established priorities and criteria, with due regard for the special circumstances of that region.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the Taoiseach in replying to Question No. 2 on 7 February 1996, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, will review existing arrangements with a view to recommending whatever steps may be appropriate so that the maximum effectiveness of funding for Border counties is achieved.  My Department will co-operate fully with this review in so far as programmes, measures and initiatives for which it is responsible are concerned.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should say that we have followed very carefully all aspects of the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident.  We have been kept fully informed on a daily basis of developments.  In addition, a senior officer of the Marine Emergency Services Division of the Department of the Marine was part of the special European Union task force which was assembled to assist and observe the response of the UK authoritiers.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there are lessons to be learned by everyone from this incident and the Marine emergency services will be conducting a full review of the implications for emergency management in this country.  In this regard, the report of the official inquiry will be of particular interest.</P>
      <P>We have, however, already in place, highly developed contingency plans to respond to a major oil tanker incident. These plans define precise roles for local authorities, harbour authorities, central Government Departments, as well as procedures for obtaining support from other EU member states and specialised international commercial pollution equipment stockpiles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental aspect of the management of a major marine emergency is to have unambiguous lines of responsibility, command and control.  In this country, the Marine Emergency Services Division of the Department of the Marine would have full management control.  It would have the authority to <Col N="1593" /> task all available resources within the State and call for whatever support which might be required from international sources.</P>
    <P>The management of a major marine emergency such as the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident could involve a wide range of specific interventions including, air/sea rescue, salvage, including securing and towing of a vessel, cargo transfer and pollution response.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we will be conducting a full review of the implications of the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident.  In particular, this review will focus on our intervention capability in a casualty situation, with specific reference to the availability of suitable towage vessels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that the Department of the Marine controls dumping of sewage sludge at sea and the Department of the Environment controls pumping of sewage into the sea.</P>
      <P>Under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, the Minister for the Marine may grant or refuse to grant a permit authorising dumping at sea operations.  Dublin Corporation currently holds an annual permit granted by my Department permitting the disposal of up to a maximum of 340,000 tonnes of sewage sludge at sea during 1996 with a maximum of 2,000 tonnes to be dumped per day.  Three trips are normally made to the site per week with approximately 2,000 tonnes being disposed of on each trip.  The dump site is located some 14 miles south-east of the Kish Lighthouse in Dublin Bay.</P>
      <P>The dump site is dispersive in nature and monitoring carried out in 1993 revealed that there was no significant impact on sediment fauna in the area. According to international practice, monitoring of such sites is recommended at approximately five year intervals and the site will be resurveyed in 1998.  Under present disposal conditions environmental problems are not anticipated at this site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the only authorised dumping of sewage sludge at sea in Ireland.  The dumping of sewage sludge at sea will be prohibited internationally under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment (OSPAR) from 31 December 1998.  The new Dumping at Sea Bill, 1995, will prohibit such dumping after that date.  Dublin Corporation's plan for alternative disposal methods has been approved by the Department of the Environment and work on the implementation of the plan <Col N="1596" /> to switch to land based disposal after 31 December 1998 is on target.</P>
    <P>Discharges of sewage into the sea from land are controlled by the Department of the Environment which has advised me that Dublin Corporation estimate that approximately 333,000 cubic metres per day of sewage is pumped into Dublin Bay.  Of this figure, approximately 67,000 cubic metres per day is untreated, the balance (266,000 cubic metres per day) receives primary treatment.</P>
    <P>The bulk of Dublin's waste water is discharged at two locations, Ringsend and Howth.  No treatment is provided at Howth other than the screening of the discharge, while primary treatment is provided at Ringsend which also serves Dún Laoghaire.  The sludge arising from the primary treatment process is thickened prior to dumping in other parts of Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>EU Directive 91/271/EEC, the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, was adopted in 1991 and came into force on 30 June 1993.  The directive sets down minimum requirements and standards for the collection and treatment of sewage.  Under the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency, 1992, (Urban Waste Water Treatment) Regulations, 1994, which transposed the mandatory requirements of EU Directive 91/271/EEC into Irish law, Dublin's sewage discharges must receive secondary treatment by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is at present planning the construction of expanded facilities at Ringsend treatment works to provide secondary treatment and sludge treatment and management to comply with the year 2000 deadline.  It is currently estimated that the cost of these works will be in excess of £200 million.  The works are being funded with the assistance of the EU Cohesion Fund.</P>

Aid was provided towards a £100,000 gabion protection scheme on Inishboffin Island and a £75,000 sea wall protection scheme at Roundstone.  The works were undertaken by Galway County Council.</P>
      <P>Consideration was given to the council's proposal in relation to erosion at Tawin Island.  The information provided in the council's submission appeared to indicate that private property alone was at risk.  The Department does not provide aid for the direct protection of private property and as a result the proposals for Tawin Island were not accepted.  However, following direct discussion with both island residents and the council it appeared that one of the main erosion difficulties being faced on Tawin Island was the threat to the public causeway providing access to the island.  As this aspect would qualify for consideration under the operational programme, the council were requested to re-examine its submission in relation to Tawin Island.  Late last week the council submitted new proposals for protection works at Tawin and these are being examined by the Department.  If they are found to be acceptable they will be included among the projects to be considered for aid over the remaining years of the operational programme. It is unlikely that funds will be available in 1996.</P>

      <P>The special whitefish scheme was introduced with the primary objective of increasing the take-up of unexploited whitefish and prawn quotas off the south and west i.e. ICES area VII.  In view of the existing level of take-up of Irish quotas by at least 200 Irish whitefish boats traditionally active in area VI, the 20 boats licensed under the scheme are precluded from fishing for quota species in that area.  They are however free to fish for non quota species in area VI.  Policy decisions in relation to the special whitefish scheme are governed purely by domestic fisheries management considerations.</P>
      <P>As regards Spanish vessels fishing for Spanish quotas in area VI, 23 such vessels have been entitled to fish in area VI for the last decade.  Of these, only eight are now entitled to fish in the Irish Box. There is, of course, no increase in the Spanish quota entitlements in this area.</P>

      <P>I visited India in January at the invitation of the Indian Government, and in my capacity as Minister for the Marine and Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my visit related to defence matters, particularly UN peacekeeping, marine matters, and the development of general trade relations between Ireland and India as a follow up on the recent trade mission by my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, Minister for Trade and Tourism.</P>
      <P>Relations between Ireland and India have always been very cordial and have been further strengthened by the close liaison between Irish and Indian forces during UN peacekeeping missions, particularly in Somalia.</P>
      <P>There are also growing business contacts between Ireland and India, and especially between IBEC and the Confederation of Indian Industry.  In this regard, I was particularly pleased to address as a keynote speaker the Confederation of Indian Industries Partnership Summit in Bombay.</P>
      <P>One of the main purposes of my visit, and in this regard I considered it essential that I be accompanied by the Secretary of the Department of the Marine, was to look at the organisation and management in India of the search and rescue services, fishery protection and the co-ordination of coastguard type functions as between the mainline departments with marine related functions and the various arms of the defence forces.  This aspect of the visit was particularly relevant given my twin portfolios at Defence and Marine, and the involvement of both Departments in providing key public services in areas such as search and rescue, marine environnment emergency management and fishery protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also explored the possibilities for improved trade and technical links in the marine sector.  While these possibly seem quite limited in the short to medium term, it is important that Ireland, with the major changes taking place in the Indian economy, positions itself in a strategic sense to avail of the <Col N="1602" /> major potential for growth of the Indian economy.  In this regard, it is worth noting that India is set to become one of the four largest of the world's economies over the next 25 years.</P>
    <P>As regards the new arrangements which apply in respect of the Irish Box from January, I am glad to inform the Deputy that plans for the management of these arrangements were in place well before the end of 1995 and that the protection services of the Department of the Marine and the Department of Defence are fully in control of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the House comprehensively on 6 February of the progress of negotiations on landmines in the Vienna Review Conference of the State Parties to the Inhumane Weapons Convention.  My reply identified the specific additional restraints <Col N="1604" /> on the use of landmines which, it is hoped, all State's parties will accept in an amended Protocol II to the Convention. These are: a ban on the use of non-detectable anti-personnel landmines; a ban on the use of long-lived, remotely delivered anti-personnel landmines; and a ban on the transfer of landmines which do not comply with the new rules. I explained that even these limited gains are not yet assured and noted that Ireland, as a member of the EU Troika, is directly involved in efforts to persuade key Third World countries to go to the limit of what is possible for them at this time.  We are currently involved in a further round of diplomatic approaches to this end.</P>
      <P>As a strong supporter of a total ban on landmines, Ireland would of course greatly prefer a different convention which banned landmines to an amended Protocol which would regulate their use more strictly than heretofore.  This preference would be shared by some 22 other countries which espouse a total ban, including four EU partners. However, as it is only too clear that an attempt to initiate multilateral negotiations for a new convention banning landmines would not at present command enough broad support, these countries have not sought to initiate such negotiations.  At this advanced stage of the review conference, radical new proposals would not only undermine efforts already made but would also stand no chance of success.  The possibility does exist, however, for securing in May a modestly strengthened Protocol II, which would be capable of retaining the consent of the 50 or so existing states' parties and of attracting new adherents.  The EU and other developed countries increasingly operate moratoria on exports of landmines. In these circumstances, a convention imposing a total ban on landmines to which other countries which are, or have the potential to become, large exporters of landmines did not subscribe, would not advance efforts to end the indiscriminate use and transfer of landmines world wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> The Government's priority is to work in a determined, realistic and focused way for effective international action against landmines.  The review conference process is only one strand in international action for the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines. Ireland maintains contact with like-minded countries which share our objective of a total ban on landmines. We will continue to seek to ensure a credible outcome to the review conference in May and sustained international action against the scourge of landmines thereafter.</P>

      <P>In line with our established policy of supporting comprehensive multilateral disarmament measures, Ireland was an original signatory of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which was opened for signature in January 1993.  The Government fully intends to ratify the convention and is actively taking the steps necessary to enable Ireland do so at the earliest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention will enter into force 180 days after the deposit of the 65th instrument of ratification.  To date, 48 States have ratified the convention and the progress of others is expected to permit entry into force before the end of 1996.  As ratification of the convention by all EU member states is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the Single Market in the chemicals sector, all partners are strongly committed to being among the 65 States whose ratification triggers the entry into force of the convention.  The European Council in Madrid on 15-16 December 1995 reiterated the Union's wish that all its <Col N="1606" /> member states should ratify the convention at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Chemical Weapons convention contains the most comprehensive and rigorous verification measures ever developed in a multilateral arms control agreement.  Although Ireland has never possessed chemical weapons or facilities for their production, we have a significant chemical and pharmaceutical industry which may be using chemicals controlled by the convention.  My Department, therefore, conducted interdepartmental consultations over a 12 months' period from mid-1994 to inform other Departments of the implications of the convention and to identify their involvement in the steps required for Ireland to implement the convention, including the need for legislation.</P>
    <P>At my initiative, the Government has authorised the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has primary responsibility for the chemical industry in Ireland, in consultation with other Ministers as appropriate, to examine and prepare such legislation as might be necessary to enable Ireland to implement its obligations under the convention. This work is in hand.  The Government has also authorised the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, in consultation with other Ministers as appropriate, to arrange for the necessary steps to be taken with respect to inspections and declarations and it has designated the Department of Enterprise and Employment as the National Authority or national focal point for liaison with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) which will undertake the verification activities of the convention. For my part, I will continue to facilitate the rapid advance of the ratification process in any way that is open to me or to my Department.</P>

      <P>All full-time officers are eligible to apply for job sharing.  The job sharing scheme is based on the principle of two people sharing one job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> In general, most applicants are facilitated within a short time.  In some instances, depending on the size of the parent Department, the grade of the applicant, the particular form of job sharing requested or the particular needs of the Department, finding a suitable partner can take time.  In such cases, Departments usually contact each other, either directly or through my Department, in the hope of finding a partner in another Department.  Every effort is made to find a partner and in general the outcome is successful. Where there are particular difficulties, Departments consult officials in my Department to find a solution.  In a few rare instances, it has not yet been possible to make a suitable job sharing arrangement.  A record of any such &ldquo;live&rdquo; request is kept by my Department, who continue to search for a possible partner.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention that the current restrictions on the growth of Civil Service numbers should alter the position in relation to dealing with job sharing applications.  A letter to that effect has been issued to all Departments.</P>

The embassies of the particular countries may be in a position to provide this information.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together. Adopted persons do not at present have a statutory right of access to their original birth records.  The only certificate available to an adoptee is a copy of the entry relating to his or her adoption in the Adopted Children Register which is maintained by the General Register Office under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>I am aware that an increasing number of parties to legal adoption proceedings are seeking to re-establish contact with one another, and I accept that the law in this area is in need of updating to take account of recent developments in adoption practice and the changing nature of adoption.  The health strategy contains a commitment to introduce changes in adoption law and procedure to provide arrangements to facilitate contact between adopted persons and their birth parents.  The question of an adopted person's right of access to his or her original birth records will be considered in that context as the two matters are inter-related.  I do not consider that it would be feasible or appropriate to incorporate amendment of current adoption legislation in the proposed Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My immediate legislative priority in the adoption area is the introduction of amending legislation to give fathers of non-marital children a greater say in the adoption process.  This arises from the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v</i> Ireland, which was delivered subsequent <Col N="1613" /> to the launch of the health strategy.  I expect to be in a position in the near future to seek Government approval to a proposed legislative response to the judgment.</P>
    <P>It would be my intention that work on the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the commitment in the health strategy relating to the establshment of an adoption contact register will commence when the issues raised in the European Court judgment have been addressed.</P>

    <P>Both broadcasters in their capacity as programme makers and independent producers may apply for funding under the action plan for the production and conversion of programmes to widescreen. Funding granted by the Commission under the action plan covers part of the additional cost incurred by programme makers for the production of programmes in the widescreen format or their conversion into that format.</P>

    <P>In general, the responsibility for the psychological assessment of children in national schools where such is deemed necessary, is a matter for the regional health boards through the appropriate director of community care.

      <P>My Department has for many years made special arrangements in the certificate examinations for candidates who would have difficulty in communicating what they know to an examiner because of a physical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or a specific learning difficulty.</P>
      <P>In the case of the student referred to by the Deputy, an application for special arrangements on the grounds of a specific learning difficulty was made to my Department in connection with the 1996 junior certificate examination.

      <P>I have dealt with this issue in my speech on the Adjournment last night, 5 March 1996.</P>
      <P>Following the issue of the results of the appeals for the leaving certificate examinations on 4 October 1995 a number of parents of candidates from St. Mary's College, Dundalk began a correspondence with myself and the Department seeking a further review of the leaving certificate English higher level results for the 18 candidates who had already appealed.</P>
      <P>The chief examiner for English was instructed to conduct a further review of the grades awarded for these 18 candidates. He in turn instructed the chief advising examiner to review these 18 scripts and to verify whether they had been marked in accordance with the marking scheme agreed for the examination. In due course the chief advising examiner, a teacher with over 20 years experience of examination work, reported that the results had been in accordance with the marking scheme and did not recommend any further upgrades.  He passed the papers to the inspector who was chief examiner for English, who in turn passed them to a superior officer on 7 November 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no further communication with the parents for three months.  A preliminary and informal report has been received from the officer who received these papers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The chief inspector and the inspector who was chief examiner for English visited the school on 22 February 1996. Following a meeting between the chief examiner for English and the principal and the teachers of English in the school, the chief inspector joined them for a discussion with three representatives of the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents at that meeting made clear their disappointment at the result and referred to the fact that the majority of pupils had received grades C or D in English whereas some of them <Col N="1624" /> had received much higher grades in the other subjects.</P>
    <P>The parents suggested that a teacher in the school who had acted as an assistant examiner at this level in 1995 should remark some scripts from which the marks originally assigned had been deleted.  This could not be accepted by the inspectors as it would contravene the regulations whereby teachers are precluded from acting as examiners of their own pupils.</P>
    <P>The inspectors did undertake to have a recheck of a number of the 1995 scripts from the school.  These were to include some scripts, to be nominated for comparison purposes by the school authorities.  They also undertook that the chief examiner for English would return within one week to inform the school of the results of the recheck.  He would also bring with him copies of the marked scripts to show to the school authorities.</P>
    <P>On 23 February 1996 the principal teacher telephoned the Department and asked that the scripts of six nominated candidates within the school be looked at especially.  On 24 February the chief inspector instructed the chief examiner for English and the chief advising examiner (for English) to recheck jointly first the six nominated scripts and then the further 12 scripts that had been appealed originally.  On Wednesday 28 February the review of the scripts was completed and no upgrade was recommended. All the nominated scripts were found to have been graded correctly.</P>
    <P>On Thursday 29 February the chief examiner for English, accompanied by the chief advising examiner visited the school again and discussed the findings of the review with the chairman of the board of management, the principal and one of the teachers of English in the school.  The chief examiner for English had with him copies of the six nominated scripts.  When he had almost finished discussing the first of these scripts with the representatives of the school, the principal said there was no point in proceeding any further because of the divergence of opinions between the <Col N="1625" /> chief examiner for English and the teacher.  The principal teacher undertook to inform the parents.  Following this a second teacher of English met the group briefly but the third teacher was not available.  The principal teacher has agreed with the chief examiner that this is a factual account of the events of 22, 23 and 29 February 1996.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools are privately owned and when the principal teacher appeared to draw the meeting to a close, the Department representative considered that he should not proceed further.</P>
    <P>The core issue here is whether or not the scripts were graded in line with the criteria applied nationally.  The Department maintains, following four successive rounds of scrutiny, that they were. The parents and the teachers of English in the school maintain otherwise.  Unfortunately subsidiary issues have now become a matter of contention.</P>
    <P>In order to bring the focus back on to the core issue and as an assurance of good faith on the part of the Department I am prepared to ask the chief examiner for English and the chief advising examiner together with the deputy chief inspector to visit the school again by appointment to meet with all three teachers and the principal.  I would be disposed to have a situation where the meeting or meetings would have an independent chairperson who would report to me afterwards.  My officials will be in touch with the school shortly.</P>

      <P>The school transport arrangements in this case involve the operation of four buses covering five <Col N="1627" /> routes in the Mitchelstown area.  Consequently a double trip arrangement is in operation, whereby one route has a less advantageous timetable than the others. Double-tripping is a feature of the school transport scheme throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In the past, the double trip arrangement in the Mitchelstown area affected pupils only from one particular area. However, in order to achieve an equity of service for all pupils in the area, it was decided that the double-trip would be shared by the pupils on all five routes.  This arrangement was put into opearation in September 1995 and will rotate on an annual basis.</P>

      <P>The total amount paid in examination entry fees for the 1995 leaving and junior certificate examinations was £5,783,544.  My Department operates a number of measures in order to alleviate hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees.</P>
      <P>In the case of necessitous pupils who are attending school, the ordinary fee payable in respect of the junior or leaving certificate may be reduced at the discretion of the school principal and subject to a maximum notified to each school or vocational education committee by my Department.  My Department made £400,000 available to schools and vocational education committees for this purpose in connection with the 1995 examinations.</P>
      <P>In the case of the leaving certificate, a number of other measures are also in operation.  A candidate who remains at school to repeat the leaving certificate would normally be charged a course fee of £100 and an exam entry fee, in 1995, of £120.  Where, however, the parent or guardian of the candidate is the holder of a current medical card the course fee is waived and the examination entry fee is reduced to a maximum, in 1995, of £44, the ordinary leaving certificate fee payable by first-time candidates.</P>
      <P>There is also provision for reduced fees in the case of external candidates for the leaving certificate examination. Reduced fees are payable where the candidate is attempting the examination for the first time or where the candidate is the holder of a current medical card or is dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the scheme for the alleviation of fees in the case of school candidates is administered by schools it is not <Col N="1629" /> possible for me to state how many candidates were exempted or assisted in the payment of examination fees in the 1995 certificate examinations.</P>

      <P>It is now accepted that the fundamental causes of crime must be tackled if we are to obtain a meaningful long-term reduction in the level of crime.  A number of studies have been made by various agencies and groups setting out the links between juvenile crime and factors such as social disadvantage and unemployment.</P>
      <P>This was particularly recognised by the report of the Interdepartmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder. The proposition underlying the work of that group was that the causes of urban crime and disorder are quite complex and varied and that a police-law and order response, on its own, is not enough.  The report concluded that an integrated multi-agency approach involving all sectors of the community provides the best possible response to this difficult problem.  Many of the recommendations of that report have been and are continuing to be implemented.</P>
      <P>I am developing proposals to pursue an idea from the report that a body should be set up to co-ordinate the provision of services and facilitate liaison on an ongoing basis so that the statutory and voluntary players can perform their role more effectively.  I favour the establishment of a forum though I believe that, as well as involving the statutory and voluntary agencies, we should also seek to involve representatives of the community, business, trade unions and the professions.</P>

      <P>All advisory staff recruited to the office of the Minister for Social Welfare are civil servants either established or unestablished.  The unestablished civil servants are those who are on contract for the duration of my current tenure as Minister.  The costs for each year are made up of salary, allowances, employer's PRSI contributions, superannuation contributions, in the case of unestablished staff and overtime payments.</P>
      <P>For clarity I have set out in the following tabular statement the cost of both the established and the unestablished civil servants attached to the office of the Minister over the period in question.</P>
      <P>The costs relating to the separate Research Unit appointed to assist me in my position as party leader in Government have been provided in an earlier series of questions and are on the record of the House.</P>

      <P>In December 1995 total pig numbers were 2.9 per cent up on the figure for December 1994.  It will take some months however before the increased number of pigs comes through to slaughter stage, but supplies should improve in the latter part of the year.</P>
      <P>The cost of composite pig meal, as compiled by Teagasc, has only slightly risen in 1995 and in the first few months of 1996 it has risen more steeply.  This reflects an increase worldwide in the price of certain cereals, which is also affecting other EU member states.</P>
      <P>On several occasions last year I raised the matter of feed prices in the whitemeat sector at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels and directly with the EU Commission. However, the Commission has indicated that it is not prepared to take action on the basis that it would lead to competition distortions between the different regions of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Poultry Industry <Col N="1644" /> Forum a detailed study on the difference between feed costs in Ireland and in other EU member states is currently being undertaken.  It is intended that this study will identify areas where feed costs can be reduced.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for the release of quantities of intervention barley which were held in Irish stores in order to make grain available at reasonable prices to assist pigmeat and poultry producers. The release of this grain is continuing. There is 36,000 tonnes of intervention barley on offer, of which about 6,000 tonnes have already been sold. This action is helping to keep feed prices lower than otherwise would be the case.</P>

      <P>My Department is fully committed to implementing this directive.  The delay in commencing training for Agricultural Officer grades under Directive 91/497/EEC is due mainly to problems in finding an institution capable of providing the necessary training programme and facilities. At present, consultants Ernst and Young are doing an in-depth study on the meat inspection service.  It is proposed to await the consultants report before finalising the training programme under the directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the figures in the ESRI Medium Term Review and those in the CSO Labour Force Survey is due to the fact that the ESRI figures are projections, while the CSO figures reflect the actual outturn.  The CSO figures for 1994 and 1995 are more up to date and, in its latest Quarterly Economic Commentary (February 1996), the ESRI has adjusted its figures to reflect the Labour Force Survey results.</P>
      <P>The ESRI Medium Term Review (in April 1994) forecast a reduction of 3,000 in the numbers employed in agriculture, forestry and fisheries (classified by Principal Economic Status) between 1993 and 1994, and this reduction actually occurred.  The ESRI also forecast a reduction of 4,000 between 1994 and 1995.  However, the CSO preliminary estimate is that the reduction was only 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI Medium Term Review also <Col N="1646" /> forecast declines of 4,000 per annum between 1996 and 2000.  However, in its Quarterly Economic Commentary published in February 1996, the ESRI projects a decrease of 3,000 in 1996 and 2,000 in 1997.  The downward adjustment of these latest projections shows that Government policy aimed at maintaining the maximum number of viable farm households is having an effect in slowing the rate of decline in agricultural employment.</P>

      <P>I have received a number of complaints by and on behalf of people who are unhappy with the outcome to their dealings with the companies in question.  The individuals concerned had entered into contracts with the companies in question, covering the planting and ultimate purchase of Christmas trees on their lands.  The financial benefits which they had anticipated when they signed these contracts were not realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation presents a number of difficulties in so far as the options available to me are concerned.  First, the matters in dispute are governed by private contracts, to which I am not a party, between the landowners and the companies in question.  Second, the planting of Christmas trees is not grant-assisted by my Department.  In so far as Christmas trees are concerned, I do not therefore have the means afforded me by grant-assisted forestry to impose and ensure compliance with requirements as <Col N="1647" /> regards the establishment and maintenance of plantations.  Third, the Forestry Acts do not provide me with a basis for intervening in cases such as this.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, I obviously wish to take any steps available to me to ensure that farmers and other landowners who might in future contemplate entering into such contracts are more fully informed as to the establishment, growth, maintenance, eventual yields, etc. of Christmas tree plantations.  The objective should be to equip such persons with the means of arriving at reasonable expectations and of evaluating, before they enter into any commitments, whether contracts which they might be offered are likely to meet those expectations.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Forest Service of my Department to draw up an information sheet on the planting, growing, maintenance, etc. of Christmas trees which I intend to publish and to distribute through a variety of channels in due course.  In the meantime, I would advise any landowners who are offered contracts for the growing and eventual purchase of Christmas trees on their land to take the greatest possible care with regard to the terms of such contracts and preferably to seek professional advice before signing any such contract.</P>

      <P>The core light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely and Ballymun (via Drumcondra/ Whitehall) at an estimated cost of £300 million (in 1993 prices).  The Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 provides for a total expenditure of £200 million on light rail during the period, £175 million of which is proposed to be EU-cofinanced.  The DTI final report endorsed this expenditure as about the limit of what could be physically implemented in the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> In late 1993 a high level project team comprising CIE personnel and consultants analysed a range of possible options derived from the core light rail network which could be implemented within the £200 million allocation for light rail.  These options were examined against a number of criteria including their contribution to DTI objectives, financial performance, congestion alleviation, environmental impact and ease of construction.  The objective technical recommendation of the project team was that priority should be given to the construction of links to Tallaght and Dundrum.</P>
    <P>I launched a public consultation programme on the planned light rail links to Dundrum and Tallaght on 12 December, 1995 following the conclusion of detailed work undertaken by the project team to identify the preferred technical route alignments for both links.  No final decisions will be taken on the precise routes until the public consultation in completed, a public inquiry has been held later this year and EU approval procedures have been completed.</P>
    <P>The target is to get phase 1 of the core light rail network in operation by the year 2000. Phase 2 is planned to follow on immediately afterwards.</P>
    <P>A fourth light rail line to Finglas and an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin Airport and Swords have been recommended by DTI for implementation once the core light rail network has been established.</P>

One application is for an area which includes part of counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo and the second application is for a separate area in counties Sligo and Leitrim. Both applications are being examined within my Department at present.</P>
      <P>The licensing option is a precursor to an exploration licence.  It is appropriate in circumstances where an exploration company is not prepared to commit to an exploration well but wishes to either assess existing data or acquire new data in order to determine the presence or absence of a drillable prospect or drillable prospects.</P>
      <P>Under the licensing option an exploration company is required to carry out a work programme agreed with my Department and the duration of the licensing option is governed by the time required to complete that work programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department promotes research in the areas of energy conservation and renewables with the assistance of the EU Joule energy research programme. Joule is part of the larger RTD programme, Joule-Thermie, which has a budget of 967MECU for the period of 1994 to 1998 and which operates under the EU Fourth Framework Programme. The Commission issue a competitive call for tender under this programme <Col N="1652" /> every two years.  In 1995, and as a result of the 1994 call, 13 projects with an Irish involvement were offered support, resulting in a total financial benefit to Ireland of almost £1 million.</P>
      <P>An amount of 840MECU has been allocated by the EU under the Fourth Framework Programme for fusion research for the period 1994 to 1998. Spending is currently running at approximately 200MECU per year. Fusion research has a long time frame and expenditure on it is not likely to impact on energy supplies for some decades and possibly for a period of fifty years.  Arising from this, the EU Research Council in October, 1995, considered the question of having an external assessment of the fusion research programme carried out in order to evaluate progress to date before deciding on future strategy at the request of Ireland and the Netherlands.  This assessment will include a comparison with other types of energy generation, including renewables.</P>
      <P>Energy conservation measures and the promotion of renewable energies are essential to the development of secure and non-polluting energy supplies in Ireland.  There is already a real and measurable impact from the promotion of such measures, with considerable technological advances made in recent years.</P>
      <P>I will seek to ensure that the immediate and real benefits to be gained from research into renewables will be fully recognised in the assessment of the fusion programme and would hope that this would lead to an increased emphasis on renewables research in the future.</P>

      <P>Within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy there is a considerable body of EU fishing regulations relating notably to fleet capacity, quotas and the control and monitoring of fishing activity.  These impose ongoing obligations on the Irish fishing industry as well as the fleets of other member states.  I am committed to working with the industry to address as far as possible the constraints while enhancing the opportunities within the Common Fisheries Policy and, in particular, to ensure that EU regulations serve to optimise the management and conservation of the fisheries resource through tight controls and strict enforcement by all member states.</P>
