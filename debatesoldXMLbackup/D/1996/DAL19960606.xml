      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1, Report of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs on Estimates for Public Services, Foreign Affairs Group; No. 6, Estimates for Public Services, 1996, Supplementary Estimate &mdash; Vote 38 only; No. 14, Criminal Law Bill, 1996, Second Stage <i>(Resumed)</i> and No. 3, Garda Síochána Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.

      <P>By the time the House meets again I hope the all-party talks will have commenced.  Like everyone else, I hope they will be successful.  I urge the Taoiseach and both Governments to make every possible effort in the final few days to try to create the conditions, as they are trying to do, to bring people of all political persuasions to the table.  I readily acknowledge that this is not totally within the Taoiseach's hands and urge the IRA to renew its <Col N="1222" /> ceasefire and allow Sinn Féin to operate the mandate given to it in a democratic election.  It will be a significant setback for democratic policies and Members of the House who have worked together if the all-party talks do not commence and are not successful.  In agreeing the Supplementary Estimate, Vote 38, which provides a sum of £500,000 for the all-party talks, I hope the decommission issue which has become an obsession is kept in perspective and left for negotiation, as recommended by the former Senator Mitchell, and not used in other ways.  It will be unhelpful and hard line attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to rule having regard to the circumstances prevailing, unless the Taoiseach wishes to reply.  On that basis I call Deputy Harney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity &mdash; the last before Monday &mdash; to wish the Government and all the parties which will participate in the talks well. Everyone who attends the talks has a responsibility to show real leadership. We are at the dawn of a new era of reconciliation on this island although last night's statement by the IRA shows scant regard for the aspirations and hopes of many people on both sides of the island and throughout Britain, the United States and elsewhere.  Every friend of Ireland wants to see a ceasefire, a total cessation of violence, not a tactical ceasefire.  We must be clear that politics is incompatible with violence, and I support both Governments in taking a firm stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In wishing the Government well, if it is the case that Sinn Féin is absent from next Monday's talks as Séamus Mallon, the Deputy Leader of the SDLP said, <Col N="1223" /> his party is more than capable of representing and putting the Nationalist case.  We must never forget that.  They are the real people of courage who never supported violence and we should stand by them and support them.  From next Monday we can put centuries of conflict behind us if people are big enough to compromise and really want to do a deal.  The momentum which started a number of years ago is unstoppable and sooner rather than later it will lead to a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland and on this island. The Taoiseach and the Government have my full support &mdash; and that of my party &mdash; in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for its support for the work being done to make sure that the talks which will commence next Monday are a success.  It is important to put what will happen next Monday in an historic context.  There has been a conflict of allegiance, which has, unfortunately, taken the form of the use of arms at times, and a conflict of political views in and around Northern Ireland for many years.  What has finally come to be realised by all political leaders is that this conflict cannot be resolved other than by dialogue.  It is important that people have the courage to translate that intellectural conviction, which they have all reached and upon which all are agreed, into practical immediate compromises around the talks table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the part of the IRA what is required is a restoration of the cessation of violence so that Sinn Féin can take part in what they have sought for years, an opportunity for direct dialogue with all other parties.  It is important to recollect that the campaigning demand for the republican movement, for many years, has been peace talks now &mdash; now is next Monday.  The responsibility for ensuring that Sinn Féin can take part in those talks rests on the shoulders of those who have the capacity to decide to restore the cessation of violence that was put in place in August 1994, without <Col N="1224" /> any specific date for all-party talks being agreed.  A specific date for all-party talks has now been agreed, which is next Monday.  If there was a case for a cessation of violence in August 1994 without a date for talks, without a detailed arrangement for talks, surely there is a double if not quadruple case for a cessation of violence now?</P>
    <P>Let me say further that I believe the responsibility does not stop there.  There is a responsibility on all participants, whether they be of the Unionist or Nationalist tradition or of neither, to compromise and endeavour to understand the fears and allegiances of their traditional antagonists.  Compromise will be required from all.  This generation of political leaders, of whatever persuasion, will not be forgiven if the opportunity available next Monday is not taken up and used to the full.</P>
    <P>I pay a particular tribute to the work the Tánaiste has done on behalf of the Irish Government in recent days in his negotiations with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  These have been negotiations of extraordinary complexity and of great difficulty.  The Tánaiste has shown tremendous skill, patience and vision in the way he has managed the substance of those negotiaitons on behalf of the Government.  I wish to make my tribute to him on that matter known in the House.</P>
    <P>I am very glad we have substantially reached agreement on all major points on which we had hoped to be able to reach agreement before 10 June.  Everything is in place and the details will be announced this afternoon for a successful commencement of the talks as far as the Governments can make it so on Monday next.</P>
    <P>I should also like to express my thanks to Deputies Bertie Ahern and Harney not just for what they have said this morning but also for the constructive and probing approach they have adopted in recent days in regard to this matter, an approach which clearly recognises that what is at stake next Monday transcends party or faction in <Col N="1225" /> any part of this island.  This is an opportunity for all of us and it is important that everything has been done by the Government to ensure that opportunity can be taken by all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, in view of the fact that on 20 February last the Taoiseach promised the Government's Adoption Bill would be ready in the first half of this year, since we have practically reached the end of the first half of this year, will he say whether that Bill is ready, when it will be published and whether Members will have any opportunity to debate it this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is proceeding as planned on that Bill.  I am hopeful that we will see results quite soon.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If possible, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Taoiseach promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is being processed with a view to being able to have the Bill before the House this session.  I cannot give a cast iron guarantee on that point but that is the working assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Since every time one inquires about the Equal Status Bill it appears to have been sliding backwards, will the Taoiseach say what is the latest projected date for its introduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the work programme would suggest that that Bill will be available for consideration by the House in the second half of the year. It is important to say that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, in addition to his continuous involvement in the drafting of this legislation is seeking to consult and discuss its content with all interested parties so that fears that may have existed can be allayed and we can proceed with this Bill, which <Col N="1226" /> relies so much on voluntary compliance as well as on the possibility of sanction, with the maximum degree of political and social agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising that matter this morning.  I suggest that she contact Deputy Dermot Ahern, her party Whip, who I have no doubt will discuss the matter on her party's behalf with the Government Whip with a view to reaching agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say when the Bill amending the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, will be ready?  Unless taken in this session, the deadline of October next will have passed which will be a tremendous loss to the acqualculture industry.  It is a most important Bill requiring to be introduced very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered questions on this matter in the past two weeks when I explained that this Bill is being drafted on a priority basis.  It is a 71 section Bill but we hope to have it available to the House some time in the second half of this year.</P>

      <P>On 16 May the Taoiseach told me he hoped to have the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, to establish an independent regulator for telecommunications, ready before the summer recess.  What is the present position with regard to that Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of mounting concerns that cuts in the price of beef being paid to farmers are not being passed on to consumers, does Government inaction to protect consumers from this profiteering mean that existing legislation is inadequate and are there any plans to amend it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the interests of those who are engaged in making their living through the sale of beef, at retail or farm level, to ensure its consumption is increased and maintained.  Therefore, it is in the interests of those in the retail trade in particular, to ensure that any reductions in the price of the product bought by them is reflected in a fall in the price of the product to their customers, otherwise they will not achieve their objective of increasing and maintaining the sales of the product from which they derive their livelihoods.  That is a matter of common sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>When we last discussed this legislation, I made the point that this legislation effectively abolishes the offence of misprision of felony, that is, the legal obligation to report a crime. As I interpret this legislation it abolishes the legal sanction for not reporting a crime.  Henceforth, regardless of the extent of somebody's knowledge of a crime, even if they are an eyewitness, they will no longer have an obligation to report that crime under pain of prosecution. To compound that, the &ldquo;reasonable compensation&rdquo; provision under section 9 of the Bill gives a positive incentive not to report a crime in return for a pay-off.  The section states that receipt of reasonable compensation from the alleged perpetrator of a crime will be a defence to a charge of not reporting a crime for accepting a bribe. On the one hand the criminal offence of not reporting a crime is abolished, while on the other an incentive is built in to <Col N="1234" /> the legislation to encourage people not to report crime in return for what is called reasonable compensation.  What is reasonable will depend on the view the victim takes as to how much he or she is offered.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the escalation of vigilante activity in this city and its threatened escalation elsewhere in recent times.  I ask the Minister in her reply to outline exactly what she proposes to do about this, what is in her programme to deal with it and the conditions which have given rise to it.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me when I say that nobody can tolerate the activities of these self-appointed Judge Dredds who are imposing their own form of lynch law in our cities and towns.  It is time the Minister told us what precisely she proposes to do to bring the activities of these vigilante groups to an end and to deal with the conditions which gave rise to their activities in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that vigilantism and threatened vigilantism has taken a very nasty turn because of the alleged paramilitary connections of the people carrying out these atrocities.  If this trend is not nipped in the bud we face the prospect of punishment beatings, shootings and other sanctions being carried out by these self-appointed people.  This is totally unacceptable in a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can be surprised that confidence in the Irish criminal justice system has evaporated.  The law abiding have become cynical about constant bland and empty assurances from this Government that crime is at the top of its agenda.  People know that crime in Ireland has taken a sinister turn.  It is no longer a phenomenon of opportunity meeting needs, of spontaneous violence or of momentary departures from a generally pacific temperament.  People know that these factors very often take second place to planned professional criminality and the willingness to use violence and kill or injure ruthlessly and without remorse.  People are talking <Col N="1235" /> about taking the law into their own hands and in some cases they are doing so.  the spectre of vigilantism looms larger every day and the only response I detect from this Government is a combination of paralysis, self justification and hand wringing.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to explain how this Bill will realistically contribute to the fight against the escalation of crime, particularly violent crime, and what else she proposes to do about the problem. The evidence is that the Government has absolutely no policy in this area.  It is hamstrung by ideological division and paralysis and all this legislation is being produced to create the illusion that something is happening.  However, most of what this legislation is dealing with, welcome though it may be, is as far removed from the reality of crime and the problems of tackling crime on the ground as it is from the moon.  I would like to know what the Minister is doing to meet the genuine fears in the community about the perceived breakdown in law and order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owens) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owens)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed. There was a wide range of contributions to this debate, including the final contribution made by Deputy O'Dea.  I hear him asking what this Government is doing about crime and he asks with such charm that it is as if he has never had an opportunity to do anything about crime and is therefore pleading with the Government to do something.  He had his opportunity and should recognise that in criticising the situation in which our society finds itself, in criticising some of the gaps that exist with regard to legislation or methods of investigating crime, he is criticising himself, as his party had control of the Department of Justice for almost ten years.  I see he has had to leave the House.  I suppose he has a party meeting or something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy O'Donoghue back. I wished him well in my contribution in an earlier debate when he was missing from the House because of illness.  He is <Col N="1236" /> looking extremely well and I hope he has fully recovered.  I have no doubt that he will show his mettle when we debate the next Bill.  He has probably had an opportunity to hone his literary quotations, his similes and his many colourful expressions.  While lying in his bed he was probably thinking of arguments to knock this Minister for Justice even more than he has done before.  I look forward to his deliberations in the fullness of time.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this Bill is a technical measure, but its significance goes much further than just tidying up technical distinctions in the law.  The Bill contains reforms that are long overdue and I make no apologies for bringing it before the House.  The Bill represents a significant updating of the law in several important respects, including the area of powers of arrest.  It has generated a considerable amount of interest outside this House as well as inside it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue seems to have regarded this Bill as no more than a distraction from the real issues that he feels need to be tackled in the criminal justice system; Deputy O'Dea was of much the same view.  That is a poor assessment by these Deputies of the significance of the measures.  Perhaps Deputy O'Donoghue has had a chance in the intervening time to consult a little wider with some of the eminent lawyers whom I know advise him.  If so, he will find that many of those eminent lawyers have called for these changes over a number of years.  Having attempted to nonsense the Bill in some ways Deputy O'Donoghue declared that, like Delaney's donkey, he was willing to go half way down one road and half way down another road.  He was afraid to vote against the Bill and would be supporting the Government on Second Stage.  I am pursuing a programme of reform of the criminal justice system on a number of fronts and I am not dictated to by whatever story makes the papers on a given day.  That is more in keeping with what Oppositions do and it is certainly in keeping with what Deputy O'Donoghue does.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> In my opening speech I outlined a number of measures that I had already taken and that I was in the process of taking.  I see this Bill as part and parcel of my reform programme, and the suggestion from the other side of the House that this Bill should be put to one side in favour of something which is in their view more important indicates that there are at least one or two Deputies who have failed to grasp the significance of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We cannot as legislators hope to cope effectively with the realities of today's crime without systematically updating, modernising and clarifying the law in certain key respects.  That is what is called for because some of our laws leave areas of doubt that have allowed certain things to be done in the courts that people have criticised.  This is not just a technical distraction from the main criminal law reform programme. Deputies recognised the importance of this.  Deputies Dukes, Crawford, Hogan and Byrne have properly put this Bill into perspective in the context of the criminal justice system.  It would be wrong and mischievous to send out a message from this House that the Bill is anything more or less than a highly relevant piece of reform and a central part of the programme.</P>
    <P>During the debate, a number of Deputies raised the issue of the constitutionality of the Bill.  I want to deal with that issue in as clear a way as possible. I was shocked by the certitude of Deputy O'Donoghue's opinion that this Bill was unnecessary, unconstitutional and essentially a waste of time.  This Bill went through the normal procedures for the preparation of legislation.  It went through the Attorney General's office, the Department of Justice and the parliamentary draftman's office.  To imply, as Deputy O'Donoghue did, that I plucked these provisions out of the air and just put them together in a Bill is a gross disservice to the officials in the Attorney General's office, the parliamentary draftsman's office and the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also raised the <Col N="1238" /> issue of constitutionality but in a more considered and careful manner.  Deputy O'Donoghue, in the course of his comments, quoted Article 40.5 of the Constitution which states: &ldquo;The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.&rdquo;  It is precisely in accordance with law that I am providing the powers of entry for the purpose of effecting arrest.  The Constitution permits and, indeed, envisages that; that is why it includes the phrase &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The criminal justice system, to be effective, requires it in the limited circumstances that the Bill permits, having regard at all times to the fundamental rights in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As I said on the first day of this debate, I would not knowingly introduce measures that were unconstitutional. A Minister for Justice would not do that.  Nor would any Minister for Justice who takes on reform of the law preclude any challenges to its provisions. That option is a right that is there no matter what the questions about the law.  This Bill has been cleared by the Attorney General in the usual way and I am satisfied that it is constitutional.</P>
    <P>With regard to the powers of the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant, nothing in section 4 alters the circumstances in which a garda can arrest a person without warrant.  It provides that a garda may arrest any person who is, or whom he or she reasonably suspects to be, in the act of committing an arrestable offence.  That is a restatement of the common law in respect of powers of arrest and arrest in felonies.  The section also provides that a garda may arrest without warrant any person who has committed an arrestable offence and whom the garda reasonably suspect to be guilty of the offence.  Again, this is a restatement of the common law.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate one would think that is not the position as it exists in common law.  The section does not propose to alter the powers of arrest of the Garda Síochána.  What is new is that the scope of offences in respect of which <Col N="1239" /> the Garda may have power to arrest without warrant will be extended.  This arises because of the basic part of this legislation creating arrestable offences in section 2.  This new category of classification will include offences which are misdemeanours at present but which have a penalty of five or more years.  At common law Garda powers of arrest without warrant apply in the case of felonies. It is clear that in moving some of the misdemeanours into that category of arrestable offences they must have that accompanying statutory power as well.</P>
    <P>The present complex situation with regard to powers of arrest without warrant for the Garda is unnecessary and undesirable and all Members wish to see our gardaí provided with clear and unequivocal statements of their powers. If they are to carry out their duties in an effective way, it is our duty to ensure that legal obstacles are not put in their way.  I note that Deputy Woods acknowledged this in his contribution.  Section 4 sets out the powers of arrest without warrant in such a clear and unambiguous way in putting it into the area of law.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with powers of private persons to arrest without warrant was interesting.  It led to the creation of a colourful picture by a number of Deputies, mainly Deputy O'Donoghue and, to a lesser extent, Deputy O'Donnell, and by the hurler on the ditch, Deputy Michael McDowell, who did not contribute during my time here but, from a sitting position, contributed much to this section.  Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue were concerned that private citizens would have oppressive powers of arrest without warrant under section 4.  The section makes it clear that any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is, or whom the person suspects is, in the act of committing an offence.  This is the current position in respect of arrest for felonies.  It also provides that where an arrestable offence is being committed, a private person may arrest without warrant anyone whom he or she, with <Col N="1240" /> reasonable cause, suspects is guilty of an offence.  This is the same as is reflected in the current law with respect to felonies. What is different is that the number of offences is being increased.  This arises again out of section 2.  Therefore, while it is accurate to say that the number of offences for which a private person may arrest without warrant is being increased, the circumstances in which a private person may arrest will not be changed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue made some weak attempts to ridicule the Bill and to paint a picture of large-scale arrests of people pouring out of public houses and other areas of social gathering.  That was colourful, and I am sure it got the Deputy a quote in the media.  However, I am sure he knows that is not what will happen as a result of this increased extension of the offences.  The Bill sets down in law the circumstances in which these new arrestable offences can be handled by a private citizen.  A private citizen who decides to effect an arrest has to do so with great care.  That is the situation at the moment.  They would have to do so in the knowledge that if they make a false accusation they will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The critical difference between the powers of arrest of a garda and those of a private citizen is that a private citizen must be able to prove that an offence was actually being committed.  It is a serious responsibility and anybody who gets it wrong will find him or herself facing proceedings for defamation, for wrongful imprisonment, accusation or trespass.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea tried again this morning to create the impression that this would give extra powers and credibility to people who decide to take the law into their own hands, namely vigilantes. That is not what will be allowed in this Bill.  The handing over of powers of arrest to such groups, or the allegation that this Bill will do that, is without foundation.  It is unnecessary scaremongering and I hope it will not be repeated that this is what this Bill will do.  I do not want that message to go <Col N="1241" /> out from this House.  I do not know that Deputy O'Dea made it absolutely clear where he stood with regard to vigilante groups.  He spoke about them but I am not sure I heard in what he said a clear and unequivocal statement that vigilante groups, groups of citizens, residents and so on should not take the law into their own hands, and nothing that we do or say here should give them the impression that they can so do.</P>
    <P>Deputies also know that a civilian making an arrest must have reasonable cause and that anybody who acts unreasonably and arrests others will quickly find him or herself in court. Deputies also know that this is not something that happens very often.  It happens from time to time in the case of store detectives.  That is the one area where citizens' arrests take place.  For ordinary citizens who are not store detectives, it is a very rare occurrence.  I cannot think of anybody I know who has effected a citizen's arrest.  The Bill will not add greatly to the number of citizen's arrests that occur but is it essential the power is fully clarified.</P>
    <P>The Opposition spokespersons queried the power to enter and search a premises to effect arrests.  The purpose of section 6 is to enable a garda to enter and search a premises to arrest a person. It is not, as Deputy O'Donoghue has suggested, a catch-all power to enter and search a premises.  The garda's power is restricted to the circumstances where a person whom he wishes to arrest is suspected of being in the place or where he forms a reasonable suspicion the person is there and he may then enter the place solely for the purposes of finding the suspect and arresting him.  The section does not entitle the garda to continue searching the premises after an arrest has been made nor does it empower a garda to search the premises other than for the purposes of locating the suspect and arresting him or her.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell rightly expressed concern about the interaction of section 6 of the Bill and section 9 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976.  The Criminal Law <Col N="1242" /> Act, 1976, provides that where a garda carrying out a search under its powers finds evidence of an offence he may seize it.  It could happen that a garda will enter a premises under section 6 for the purpose of effecting an arrest and will come across evidence of an entirely separate offence.  Section 9 of the 1976 Act would then come into play and the garda would be entitled to seize evidence of the other offence.</P>
    <P>Section 9, a very useful and necessary provision, has been in operation for 20 years.  If a garda searching a premises for the purpose of arresting a person, for example, comes across a dead body or a cache of drugs, it is reasonable that he be able to gather evidence relating to it, bringing section 9 of the 1976 Act into play.  What Deputy O'Donnell appears to suggest is that if a garda is on a premises to arrest a person and comes across a dead body he must leave and return with another warrant.  Section 6 will allow gardaí to enter premises to arrest a person but if in the course of arresting the person he comes across evidence section 9 of the 1976 Act will come into play but that is the only occasion which triggers section 9.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which the provisions are being put into law and it is not correct to suggest that section 6 combined with the provisions of the 1976 Act will allow the gardaí <i>carte blanche</i> to do what they want.  They will be bound by the two sections when this section is enacted.  I am endeavouring to bring certainty to the law by providing the gardaí with what I consider proportionate powers to enter premises to effect an arrest.  The law is anything but clear, as Deputies will know, and it is important that we clarify it.  I am not proposing a concept unknown to the law.  It may be that these concerns have been raised as a result of the wording of section 6 but I have been assured by those advising me on this legislation that the powers in the section are capable only of being construed as powers of entry to effect an arrest.  However, having listened to the debate I will consider <Col N="1243" /> it carefully between now and Committee Stage and if I am convinced that further clarification is necessary, I will give it on Committee Stage.  At this point I am convinced it does not need further clarification but as the Deputies raised this issue out of concern, I will not deny them the opportunity to outline what they think is wrong with it and I will look again at it.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue to section 12 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991 which shows that many of their concerns are without foundation.  The Deputies will see a remarkable similarity between section 12 of that Act and sections 4 and 6 of this Bill and there is no difference in principle between what I am proposing and what is in section 12 of the 1991 Act which was enacted during the lifetime of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government.  Perhaps the Deputies did not get a chance to examine that legislation and have simply forgotten it or perhaps they are simply choosing to ignore it.  Section 12 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, empowers any person to arrest without warrant anyone whom the person reasonably suspects to be in the act of committing an offence.  In the course of the debate an impression was created either that the Bill was of no use or that what I was doing was somehow going too far.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the 1991 Act provides that a garda may for the purposes of arresting a person enter, if necessary by force &mdash; and note there is no reference to reasonable force, unlike section 6 of this Bill &mdash; and search a premises.  In this Bill we are empowering the Garda to enter and search a premises for a person who is suspected of kicking or damaging the door of a house or who has broken a pane of glass.  That also was covered in section 12 of the 1991 Act and under that Act any person has the power to arrest without warrant a person whom he or she suspects of committing an offence.  I did not hear the same squeals of worry and anguish in 1991 from <Col N="1244" /> members of the two parties that are so critical of this Bill, when this was being debated in this House.  I am dealing with potentially far more serious offences than those envisaged by section 12 of the 1991 Act, yet the Deputies are concerned about the extent of the powers. If it was all right to enact such provisions in 1991 when their parties were in Government why is it such a matter of concern?  Is it because there is a change of seating in this House?  When one becomes a Minister one does not lose one's cynicism and it is possible the Deputies forget what was in their Act or decided it was not worth remembering because there would not be as much fun at having a go at the Minister if they remembered it.  I do not foresee a sudden change of practice in policy of the Garda Síochána with regard to the use of the powers of search.</P>
    <P>I am not introducing a totally new concept, I am merely clarifying the law. The way we go about our business or the way powers of arrest are used has not completely changed since 1991. Democracy has not been undermined and with this Bill our democracy will not be undermined.  Having listened to the Deputies, and particularly Deputy Michael McDowell, who is known for his quotable quotes who spoke about people being arrested in the middle of playing a card game, I am sure that was said with the lightness of his touch that he is famous for and that he was not really serious when saying it.  The gardaí have powers of arrest without warrant in common law for felonies and we are extending those powers to cover arrestable offences.  One of the principal reasons I am doing so is that they must have a clear and unequivocal way in which they can fight crime.</P>
    <P>It is a feature of my proposals under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, that in the context of an application to a court for the continuation of a person's detention, the detained person should be brought before the court.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue wanted to dispense with that necessary safeguard, <Col N="1245" /> which I am building in because of rulings of the European Court and our rulings here.  In that instance Deputy O'Donoghue wanted me to ignore the European Convention of Human Rights and yet in this Bill he seems to have forgotten that and wants me to be more concerned about the powers in this Bill. I find it difficult at times to reconcile Deputy O'Donoghue's concern about individual rights with Deputy Kenneally's views.  He wants every citizen to be DNA tested at birth.  It would be a blow to civil rights to test every baby in the land so that their file is on record forever. There would be many objections to such a policy.  There is inconsistency in the Fianna Fáil argument.  Perhaps they might clarify it at some stage.</P>
    <P>The balance between people's rights and the need to protect society from crime is struck in this Bill.  Deputy O'Donoghue will not gain any additional brownie points for opposing this Bill for the sake of it so that he might get a line in a newspaper which states that he attacked the Minister.  I am sure he got good coverage in <i>The Kerryman.</i></P>

      <P>People who are concerned about crime and the powers needed by the gardaí are not taken in by that.  We should be careful not to become overly concerned because the public understands the situation better than the debate in this House implies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Penrose referred to section 2 and the term &ldquo;of full capacity&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Donoghue seemed to think the term was a new concept.  He asked if the term referred to a person's age or to whether they were legally sane.  He also said that simultaneously with instant psychoanalysis, required as a prerequisite to arrest, a garda would have to address whether the person had been previously convicted of an offence.  The term &ldquo;of full capacity&rdquo; is already used in statute &mdash; for example, in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It is a standard part of a <Col N="1246" /> definition and a hypothetical test which raises none of the bizarre implications alleged by Deputy O'Donoghue.  I assume he was suggesting that he would do a better job than I if he were on this side of the House.  I understand his position because I was on the Opposition benches for a number of years, although I was not the Opposition spokesperson for justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan mentioned Article 15.13 of the Constitution.  I was interested in his contribution because he has wide experience of criminal law.  I am sure he will share that experience with us duing his time in this House.  He commented on the change in the effect of Article 15.13 of the Constitution which provides that Members of the Oireachtas are privilged from arrest while going to, within or coming from either House except in cases of treason, felony or breach of the peace.  By abolishing the classification of offences as felonies, this will now extend privilege to offences which are currently felonies. The fact there is a reference to a felony in the Constitution does not mean it is required at law to exist.  From the commencement of the Bill, therefore, Members will be liable to arrest for treason or breach of the peace in going to, returning from and while within the precincts of either House.  This change needs no explicit reference in the Bill because the Constitution indicates the felonies.  This change is being made because the privilege of Oireachtas Members is conferred by the Constitution, not by statute, and specifically mentions felony.  The Deputy was right to point it out and I thank him for his contribution which I found interesting and more considered than that of his spokesman.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods mentioned the need to provide for the issue of search warrants in the investigation of serious offences.  He suggested that section 6 was a limited provision as it is a power of entry solely to effect arrest.  He said this Bill should contain a power of search of premises for evidence relating to a serious offence.  That is contrary to <Col N="1247" /> what Deputy O'Donoghue said.  He was worried that the power of search to effect an arrest was too strong.  The power to search premises for evidence relating to a serious offence is covered under section 9 of the 1976 Act.  This is a power to enter and effect an arrest of a person.  The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill extends the power of arrest to collect evidence for certain serious crimes, such as murder and rape, which for some reason was left out of the powers of arrest.  I do not know why the former Minister for Justice did not increase the power of search for such evidence in the case of serious offences such as murder and rape.  I am doing it now in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, but it should have been done many years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea mentioned misprision of felony.  The abolition of felony will mean that the offences of misprison of felony and the offence of compounding a felony will disappear.  Misprision of felony consists of concealing or procuring the concealment of a felony known to have been committed.  There appears to be some doubt about the extent of the offence, in particular as regards concealing offences committed by near relatives.  There is no offence of misprision of misdemeanour.  Compounding a felony consists of agreeing in consideration of any reward not to prosecute for the felony.  Whether compounding a misdemeanour is an offence is also doubtful.  I have tried to clear up this matter in the Bill.  Most people are not aware of this area of law which gives rise to doubt.  I do not know how often it is used in practice.</P>
    <P>This Bill creates a new offence of concealing an offence.  A new offence will apply where an arrestable offence has been committed and a person knowing or believing that the offence or some other arrestable offence has been committed and that he or she has information which might be of material assistance in securing the prosecution or conviction of an offender accepts or <Col N="1248" /> agrees to accept any consideration for not disclosing the information. Although under the present law a person may be guilty of compounding a felony even if the consideration consists of the return of stolen property, the Bill makes an exception in relation to the new offence where the consideration consists of making good a loss or injury caused by the offence or the making of reasonable compensation for that loss or injury.  The new offence will be one of accepting a bribe or some consideration not to disclose information.</P>
    <P>There is a case for examining specific areas of law to see if there is a need for reporting requirements in particular cases.  An example can be seen in section 57 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which I brought into effect in May 1995.  It obliges designated bodies, such as financial institutions, to report suspicions of money laundering offences to the Garda Síochána.  Over 250 such reports have been made to date.</P>
    <P>Another example is whether there should be mandatory reporting of child abuse.  Cases should be dealt with separately if we create an offence when someone does not report something.  The discussion paper, Putting Children First, published by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, has analysed in detail the implications of such a requirement and has invited submissions which should be sent to the Minister for Health.  This has led to a mixed view on the effectiveness of mandatory reporting.  There is a case for selecting identifiable areas of law where there may be a case for reporting, such as I have done with money laundering. Tailoring the obligations to particular circumstances represents the best way forward.  The scope, extent and diversity of modern criminal legislation is such that a single inflexible requirement to report all offences would have far reaching effects.  A man or woman could be in a shop buying groceries when a robbery takes place.  If the person escaped and the shopkeeper decided, for his own reason, not to report it could the customer be guilty of an offence for failing <Col N="1249" /> to report it to the Garda station immediately?  Common sense tells us that it would be grossly unfair to create such an offence.  There is, therefore, a case to be made for looking at the matter in a more tailored and targeted way. That is what the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is doing with regard to mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>Some of the views expressed were very interesting and constructive.  A clear effort was made, however, by one Opposition party to imply that we were wasting our time with this Bill.  I do not believe we are.  The Bill effects an improvement in the law, provides clarity, adds to the Garda's powers to effect arrests and increases the penalties attached to serious offences which, up until now, have been called misdemeanours. As I said in January 1995, when the Incest Act was passed in 1908 incest was considered a misdemeanour. That gives us an idea of how much things have changed.  It is important that crimes which, heretofore, were called misdemeanours are seen as serious.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies indicated that they intend to table amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope that, having clarified some matters, they will not have to table the number they felt were needed.  I am satisfied that the Bill finishes work commenced as far back as 1967.  If Deputies reflect on this, they will realise it is important legislation and I hope it will be seen by them as such. The courts and the Garda Síochána are aware of its importance to their operations. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to provide a mechanism to end the long-standing dispute surrounding the Garda Representative Association.  All Deputies will be aware of this dispute which has persisted for some years now and resulted in a situation where a significant number of gardaí are, in effect, without representation in regard to important matters such as pay, pensions and conditions of service.  I am sure all Deputies share my view that that situation must be deplored and cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated more than once that it is with extreme reluctance I find myself in the position of having to introduce legislation which might be seen by some as interfering in the internal affairs of a staff association and which could, in the last resort, result in the disestablishment of that association as a recognised representative body.  It has always been my view since taking office in December 1994 and that of my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, that the problem should have been solved by those in dispute by agreement and co-operation, in a spirit of goodwill and mutual interest.  Given the failure of the <Col N="1251" /> many other initiatives to settle the dispute, I am left with no alternative but to proceed as I am now proposing.  We all have a common interest in ensuring that the smooth and efficient working of our national police force is not placed at risk by continued dissension in the garda rank.  It is a matter of great regret that the garda leaders in this dispute could not come together to solve the matter.  I had even hoped that by announcing the draft heads it would have happened, but alas it did not.</P>
    <P>The Garda Representative Association is recognised under Statute as the sole organisation lawfully to represent members of the force at garda rank in matters concerning pay, pensions and conditions of service.  Up to recent years it would seem to have filled that role successfully since 1978, but the recent difficulties have meant it cannot, in present circumstances, duly represent all potential members.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to resolve the dispute by prescribing, in the interest of fairness and equity, certain rules of procedure and organisation which must be observed by any organisation which represents gardaí.  These new rules are intended to make good a so-called &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; in the constitution of the association which had been identified by disaffected members.  Failure by the association to comply with these rules would bring into play the proposed power of the Minister, in effect, to withdraw recognition from the organisation.</P>
    <P>The basic structures and operation of all the Garda associations have always been governed by legislation.  Section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, allows for the establishment of Garda associations. Section 14 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, allows the Minister to make regulations in relation to the formation of such representative associations.</P>
    <P>The present structures and organisation of the Garda Representative Association are provided for under four sets of regulations &mdash; made in 1978, 1983, 1987 and 1990 &mdash; by the Minister <Col N="1252" /> for Justice, with the approval of Government, on foot of the statutory provisions I mentioned.  Those regulations were made in agreement with the GRA at the relevant times.  The changes proposed in this Bill, however, do not have similar agreement.  On the contrary, they come about because all efforts to secure agreement over a two year period have failed.  In the absence of agreement, legislation is the only option open to me to put an end to this sorry affair.</P>
    <P>Before I outline the provisions of this Bill I should like to outline the background to the dissension within the association and the efforts made to achieve a resolution.  Disagreements within the association did not become the subject of widespread public knowledge until the association's annual delegate conference in 1994 was disrupted by disaffected members.  In March that year four members of the central executive committee, CEC, had taken an action against the GRA in the High Court over the conduct of a ballot concerning a pension agreement reached at the Garda conciliation council.  They lost the action and were, subsequently, expelled from the GRA.  As a result, a significant number of members of the GRA felt that they could no longer repose their confidence in, or give their allegiance to, the association.</P>
    <P>There are now almost 2,500 gardaí, mainly based in the Dublin metropolitan area, DMA, who are not contributing membership subscriptions to the GRA.  A sizeable number of the 2,500 have joined a separate organisation &mdash; the Garda Federation.  A further 1,000 gardaí in four Garda divisions &mdash; Louth-Meath, Cavan-Monaghan, Cork West and Tipperary &mdash; are, while still members of the association, not fully participating in its activities.</P>
    <P>Prior to my appointment as Minister in December 1994, two initiatives to resolve the dispute had failed.  The first was an offer by the Garda Commissioner to provide an assistant commissioner to act as a mediator; the offer was not taken up by the GRA.  The <Col N="1253" /> second involved a very substantial mediation effort, in a personal capacity, by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission. His report on the dispute contained a range of recommendations aimed at ending the dispute.  As some important recommendations in this report proved unacceptable to the GRA this initiative also failed.</P>
    <P>On my appointment in December 1994 as Minister, I held consultations with all three parties to the dispute. Based on those consultations, I prepared a discussion document with suggestions aimed at reconciling differences. The document was circulated to the three groups in March 1995.  Among the matters addressed in that document were democratisation of procedures within the GRA, the system of election of officers, the appointment of trustees, the management of standing orders and the need for review of the GRA's disciplinary procedures.  The responses from the three groups to the discussion document, however, did not have sufficient common ground to suggest that these ideas could be taken any further with any real hope of success.  I was, therefore, forced to abandon that initiative.</P>
    <P>At the GRA annual delegate conference on 9 May 1995 I first raised the question of an agreed form of arbitration. In the event, all three parties to the dispute subsequently agreed to arbitration. Mr. John Horgan, a former chairman of the Labour Court, agreed to act as arbitrator.  Having had separate discussions with each group, he arranged for a first joint meeting on 5 October 1995.  The meeting was not a success and having regard to what was said at it Mr. Horgan reported that he was not satisfied he could expect sufficient co-operation from the GRA to address the issues involved.</P>
    <P>A further and final attempt at resolving the dispute was made in January this year when the former General Secretary of the GRA, Mr. Jack Marrinan, tried to bring all three groups together.  This attempt also failed, essentially because <Col N="1254" /> the GRA was not prepared to accept him as chairman of the process.  All through these processes, there was no attempt by all dissenting groups to sit down together to solve their differences.</P>
    <P>It is clear from my discussions with the different groups and the reports of the mediator and arbitrator that the fundamental issues, which the Bill seeks to address, revolve around the following: The process governing the appointment of the president, vice-president and the officials of the association; the voting structure at the central executive committee; disciplinary actions taken against members or former members; appointments of the trustees and treasurer; and adoption of Standing Orders. In addition, the Bill also proposes to remove some legal uncertainties which, I am advised, exist under present legislation. I also note that there are those who maintain the row also has its basis in the acceptance of the pensionability agreement by the GRA.</P>
    <P>Section 1 amends section 13 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, to provide explicitly that only one association can represent any one rank in the force.  It had always been assumed that the existing provision in the Garda Síochána Act, 1924 so provided.  I have been advised, however, that that view may not be correct and that the matter should be put beyond doubt by an unambiguous statement as in section 1. The new provision may be thought to be an unusual one but the reason for it is quite simply that &mdash; I think Deputies will agree with me on this &mdash; it clearly would not be in the public interest to have a number of representative bodies competing with each other in seeking to influence the pay, pensions and conditions of service of any rank of a national police force.  A Supreme Court judge has said as much.  In the 1988 Aughey case Mr. Justice Walsh stated that if the areas of pay, pensions and conditions of service &ldquo;became the subject of multi-union or multi-association agitation or industrial action by members of the Garda Síochána, it <Col N="1255" /> would be a matter of grave public concern and public interest particularly because of the fact that the Garda Síochána is a unitary national police force&rdquo;.  I am not prepared to have two representative bodies for the rank of garda.  That option is not available even though I know that is what the federation or some of its leaderships are pressing for.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a representative association established pursuant to section 13 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924 for the garda rank must have the support of such a majority of the garda rank as satisfies me that the association can speak and make agreements on behalf of the rank as a whole. Plainly, the Bill should not quantify the majority required under this section &mdash; that depends on circumstances at any particular time.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the main purpose of the Bill which is to set out certain structures and procedures aimed at ensuring fairness and equity within the representative organisation.  The details are set out in the Schedule which is applied by section 3.  The Schedule will replace all statutory regulations applying heretofore to the association with such changes and additions as will meet the purpose of the Bill.  It may seem unusual that I am now proposing to do by legislation what has heretofore been done by statutory instrument but the reason is simple.  I have been advised that detailed provisions enshrined in legislation which, of course, carries with it the full authority of the Oireachtas, are less open to court challenge.  I will deal with the contents of the Schedule later in my remarks.</P>
    <P>Section 4 allows the Minister for Justice to make an order specifying that an association established under section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924 which fails to conform to the requirements of the Garda Síochána Acts, including this Bill, shall cease to be such an established association.  Such an order can only be made after I have given the <Col N="1256" /> association 30 days' notice that I propose to make such an order.  The association to which such a notice has been given will have 30 days to respond to the notice and-or take any action needed to bring it into conformity with the requirements of the Acts.  Any order made must be approved by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can take effect, as provided later in section 8.  In order to enable me to satisify myself as to whether or not an association is conforming to the requirements of the Acts, I must be able to requisition the up to date rules and constitution of the association.  That is the purpose of section 5.</P>
    <P>The legal power of disestablishment is a power which no Minister for Justice would lightly contemplate using. However, as I have explained, it would be unavoidable if every alternative means to resolve a dispute outside the legislative sphere has failed.</P>
    <P>Disciplinary actions of the GRA over the past two years, whatever about their legal propriety which is the subject of ongoing civil litigation, have caused much of the resentment and personal rancour surrounding this dispute.  This factor has been a huge obstacle to a resolution of the dispute.  It is necessary that the Bill provide for an independent body which can review disciplinary decisions as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 given the Minister power to establish a committee for the purpose of determining appeals made by members or former members of the association against disciplinary decisions made by the GRA since 1 January 1994.  The committee would be composed of a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than seven years standing, who would be chairman, and two other members who would be outsiders.  The decision of the committee in each case would be final and binding on the applicant and on the association.  I want to clarify that the committee would be made up of an outside chairman and two outside members.  In using the word &ldquo;members&rdquo;, I do not mean members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> The timing of this review has not been stated in the Bill.  It has been put to me by the federation and others that this matter is crucial and I will examine the matter again before Committee Stage.  One of the considerations I cannot ignore is the current legal proceedings in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out the detailed rules of procedure and organisation to which the organisation charged with representing gardaí must conform. Most of the provisions in the Schedule simply reproduce the existing regulations which the Schedule will replace, and do not call for comment.  I will refer, therefore, only to the changes proposed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of the Schedule deals with the election to and membership of the Central Executive Committee &mdash; the CEC.  At present, the CEC is made up of 26 members each having been elected by their respective divisional committees. A central problem with this structure is that, although it is sensibly modelled on the operational structure of the force, it does not taken into account the large difference in the number of gardaí in one division compared to another. This is particularly acute in the context of the Dublin Metropolitan Area which, together with Garda Headquarters and the Central and Special Detective Units, has more than 40 per cent of the Garda rank strength but only seven seats on the 26 member CEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to the area of cultural tourism because as Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I have a particular interest in that matter.  The <Col N="1259" /> Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 sets out as one of its priorities the further development of natural and cultural tourism.  <i>The National Development Plan 1994-99</i> identified the traditional strengths of Irish tourism as its people, scenery, cultural heritage, environmental quality and world-wide ethnic links.  In its review of the 1988-93 period, it identified the development of inland waterways, the investment in 16 new theme town projects, two new literary museums, 65 houses and castles newly opened and improved, and other heritage attractions as being among the core achievements of the programme to date.  I am sure all of us would agree that it is important to review these programmes to ensure the best possible long-lasting value for money is achieved for not only tourism but culture, which will attract further tourists.</P>
      <P>About £22 million is available for the cultural incentives development scheme, designed to put in place the arts, heritage and cultural infrastructure to serve the needs for the future.  The total spend for national cultural tourism is estimated at around £125 million over the extent of the programme.  What has it meant for heritage and culture generally? Many arts and heritage people would say in terms of cultural infrastructure what we got was a series of glitzy projects which provided poor value and may well give rise to headaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to talk about a co-ordinated approach to cultural infrastructure. There is no strategy at present.  In the past, funding allocations depended on the applications received and on the ingenuity, planning and clout of individuals and communities.  Some of these projects are very good but all applications for funding should be assessed in the context of a regional and county arts and heritage policy which identifies strengths and weaknesses.  Projects should include long-term goals that will serve arts, heritage and tourism well for a long time to come.  We need living centres at the heart of communities <Col N="1260" /> which keep the arts and heritage vibrant and alive.  That is what will energise those communities and enthral the visitor.</P>
    <P>We must have good leisure and sports facilities for visitors, they come for something different.  Our communities need centres which will encourage the arts, and local culture and which will protect and celebrate local heritage.  The local people must be invited to participate and their energy harnessed.  Ireland is not rich enough and its population is too small to have stand alone single-function tourist attractions which cannot have other uses.  Such places have no heart; either they are cold and peripheral to living culture and heritage because they have become peripheral to local life or they have a poor employment record and often offer little chance of good jobs in the long-term.  Many people involved in such jobs have to depend on FÁS schemes to survive rather than on long-term full-time jobs.</P>
    <P>We are lucky to have landscape, archaeology, music, genealogy, an astonishing prehistory and general history, architecture, gardens and inland waterways.  We have warmth and welcome, craic, and the session.  We have extraordinary literary and artistic talent. Visitors should be able to interact in all of these areas in as natural a way as possible, and will resist us packaging it and presenting it in a plastic way.  They want to see our heritage in context rather than trying to make it look like some kind of Disneyland.  Since Ireland has all the natural ingredients where heritage and culture is concerned they must be developed in a sensitive way as that is what the tourist seeks.</P>
    <P>It is only in the context of a proper national and regional arts and heritage strategy that we can value, celebrate and energise what we have.  We do not want this to be presented in a plastic or stage Irish way.  Art centres, museums and specialised heritage centres offer a chance for a living community to celebrate a living culture and heritage.  Culture and heritage can be relieved and rediscovered because they are rooted in <Col N="1261" /> tradition, solid research and development and in people who draw on their talents to explore a story and to tell it.</P>
    <P>I have been told that many centres have been developed from a computer programme of a foreign design team. This is not the way to proceed.  I am told such a programme can be used anywhere. This is short-term thinking in terms of cultural policy and tourism generally because what the tourists come to see is something indigenous, not something bland which can be translated for any other culture.</P>
    <P>Immense sums have been spent on design and display in some centres but little has been done in the area of primary research or on a collection of archival material and artefacts which would regenerate and invigorate any display and allow unlimited potential for development.  Ireland has all the natural ingredients; it has the tremendous architecture, the archaeology, the artefacts and history.  It is a question of being able to present that in the most acceptable form in its proper context.  In talking about the heritage of a town, for example, one cannot by any stretch of the imagination ignore the town or its history.  That is why I referred earlier to computer programmes, which do not have any real long-term part to play in what Ireland can offer culturally.  It is not what the tourist seeks.</P>
    <P>Many of the Irish heritage professionals have despaired at the small number of centres which have not come up to scratch.  It is disappointing because there are some excellent examples, such as the Foxford Woollen Mills, County Mayo, which connects with its environment. It has a unique history and is well researched and linked to a living mill project.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte should market the product &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; but we should be careful that we know the product and how we want to present, preserve and celebrate it.  Ireland's tourism policy must be conservation driven.  If we do not preserve what we have and allow it to flower as it is, we will turn it into something plastic and shallow which will not be worth <Col N="1262" /> experiencing.  We need to plan for the future.  Having a strategy for arts and heritage will create its own dynamic and will ultimately serve the nation and the tourism industry.</P>

      <P>In many ways sitting down to write a speech about tourism and seasonality is extremely difficult.  I do not know from where Fianna Fáil gets its motions for Private Members' Business but it would appear it simply trawls over old files and complaints it had while in Government and decides on a particular one.  The problem of seasonality in Ireland and in the European context is long standing.  If we were to look sensibly at the weather in Ireland the problem of seasonality would be glaringly obvious, yet it is difficult to write about it.  How does one attract people to a country which for eight months of the year is damp, cold, unpredictable and blustery?  It is a huge problem and must be tackled if we are to benefit in full from tourism.  Nevertheless it is a problem which for most of the time is outside our control.  We do not have the type of historical infrastructure that would attract people to, say, Italy. We do not have the type of history that has stayed intact to a great extent.  What we have is unique in many ways because our history has been a bloody one.  We were either fighting off invaders who came to destroy what we had put in place or we were fighting ourselves and in the process destroyed what had been put in place.  In that respect we are unique and seem to have an unique place on the map of most tourist promoters.</P>
      <P>I welcome the five-year plan and investment in the development of weather independent facilities.  We have at last come to recognise what we have. We are unique.  We have a past which is worth examining and a market which has not yet been fully developed but we are working on it and in time it will prove fruitful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if our cities are not to become like all other European cities &mdash; we can never compete with Paris and Rome &mdash;<Col N="1263" /> we can compete with others.  If we continue to put money into conference centres, which are no more than an imitation of conference centres in other areas, sports complexes or weather independent facilities, why should people come to Ireland?  We must continue to build on what is unique about Ireland but that is difficult to define. One can go through the list as Deputy de Valera did.  In respect of the green environment, the Green Party from Germany would come only for the purpose of looking at what is wrong with our green environment rather than to appreciate what is right about it.  It depends on where one is coming from and who is brought here.  If we go along with our cultural development, revisionism has its place and there are people who will find that it is not all as we present it.</P>
    <P>It would appear that what is unique to us is our way of life which does not lend itself well to organisation.  I have in mind our leisure life.  What is attractive to tourists about how we spend our leisure time is the fact that it is spontaneous and unorganised.  We continue by way of law and legislation to demand that it changes and becomes more organised.  I am not certain how that can be packaged.</P>
    <P>We are unique in that for generations we were the surrogate mother to Europe and the rest of the world.  It is estimated that there are 40 million people connected by way of birth to Ireland.  We have tapped that market to some extent but we have not tapped into it completely.  How can you compete with going to look for your grandmother's grave or your great-grandmother's grave?  That uniqueness should be played on for all it is worth.  Most Americans do not have a history but those Americans who are of Irish descent do have a history and we should encourage them to come and find it.</P>
    <P>Dublin is becoming the weekend capital of Europe.  We must ensure that anyone who comes to Dublin for a weekend comes back for a second.  Cork is a city which people visit not only for <Col N="1264" /> weekends.  While they plan for a weekend they find it extremely difficult to leave because of its friendliness, its atmosphere and the uniqueness of its people.  I am confident that with a Minister of State of the calibre of Deputy O'Sullivan in the Department we will continue to build on it.  We have a heritage project in place which will be awesome, as described by one architect, in the centre of the city.  Cork is known as a city of manageable size and that is the reason it is good at putting on festivals.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of what we provide for tourists that we have never adequately examined, that is, the whole pub culture.  The pub culture in Ireland attracts young backpackers.  They may not spend much when they come as 17, 18 and 19 years olds but they will return. When they return they will have money and will spend it.  We should work on being friendly, open and welcoming to ensure they return.  Most Europeans go out to dinner at 8 p.m. &mdash; unlike the Irish who may go to dinner at 6 p.m. &mdash; and do not finish until 10 p.m.  They then find themselves in the peculiar position of being in a pub at 10.30 p.m. which closes at 11 p.m. and they are astonished at this.  We should examine our licensing hours and consider having them staggered.  There are pubs that are required to open and bring in staff at a certain time in the knowledge that there is no business and that they will have no customers.  We should examine a system of staggered opening hours.  Opening hours would not be extended.  Pubs would still only be required to open for the same number of hours but districts would decide the hours they would open.  As with marketing licences which still exist in certain cities, there could be a pub whose business would be from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. and it would simply open for those hours.  Another pub, because it is situated within a shopping area, would open from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. Another pub would open from 10 p.m. to cater for the after dinner brigade, to 3 a.m.  In this way people could not, as many fear, skip from one pub to the next for 24 hours of the day.  It is beyond <Col N="1265" /> me how one could afford it or how one's liver could stand up to it.  If this was done district by district we could ensure that no matter when tourists or our own people wanted to go for a drink there would be a district where they could get it.  In this way pubs would cater for tourists and the whole culture in that area. At harbours or airports where people are coming and going late at night, this would be the perfect solution.</P>
    <P>We must look at what is unique to us and the 40 million people out there who desperately wish to make a connection with someone and to have a tangible link with Ireland.  We must put more money into that area.  We must look into the whole pub culture and our disorganised lifestyle in relation to leisure which attracts young and middle aged people to this country.  We must ensure that remains as it is with some improvements in order that they are not totally excluded from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Dublin Tourism Board, I wish to speak on the growth of tourism in Dublin, which has been phenomenal since 1988. This success can be attributed to a number of factors.  In 1988 Dublin celebrated its millennium and the positive coverage of events during that year increased people's awareness, particularly in Europe, of Dublin as a tourist destination.  In 1991, during my time as Lord Mayor of Dublin, the city was designated European City of Culture and the main event that year was the opening of the Temple Bar refurbishment scheme which received substantial European Union funding.</P>
      <P>The cultural acclaim Dublin received for films such as &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; instilled a pride in our people.  Groups such as U2, Boyzone and performers such as Chris de Burgh generated an awareness of Dublin's music culture.  Among other things the significant growth in interest from high profile overseas visitors in recent years, cuch as the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, Prince Charles, Tom Cruise, Julie Roberts and others helped to raise Dublin's profile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> One of the reasons for increased tourism business is the direct access to Dublin Airport from North America which has resulted in an increase in airline passengers to Dublin.  The introduction of new vessels on the Irish Sea, such as the <i>Isle of Inisfree</i> by Irish Ferries and the HSS <i>Explorer</i> by Sealink, has doubled capacity on the sea route into Dublin.  A total of 15 new hotels are currently under construction in Dublin and a further 25 are at planning or post-planning stages.  These developments are creating a boom in employment in the city's construction industry.  It is estimated that within three years the number of hotels in Dublin will have doubled and there will be a much needed increase in employment as a result of tourism.  In Howth, hotel extensions have been built and several new restaurants have been opened to cater for the additional tourists visiting Howth peninsula.</P>
    <P>In the past two years the number of tourists to Dublin has increased by in excess of 40 per cent.  Dublin has the highest level of bed occupancy in Europe, it has more bed nights than Amsterdam, Copenhagen or Vienna. The accommodation overflow from Dublin spreads up and down the east coast.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today the manager of Dublin Tourism said that visitors to Dublin on a recent weekend had to be offered accommodation in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>If this growth is to be maintained we must be conscious of the obstacles that may hinder tourism in Dublin.  Today's <i>Irish Independent</i> carries an article interviewing visitors to Dublin from Europe who commented on the amount of litter on our streets and traffic congestion. I welcome the new anti-litter campaign initiated by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to improve awareness and gain public support for an anti-litter war.  The introduction of the Luas light rail system will benefit tourists as well as commuters.</P>
    <P>Many tourists have commented on the impact of children begging in city centre streets.  As child benefit has increased by 60 per cent since 1993 <Col N="1267" /> there is no longer any justification for children begging on the streets.  It is estimated that there are between 12 and 15 families involved in begging in the centre of the city and they are well known to the Eastern Health Board.  This problem must be addressed for the sake of the children who are being exploited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>With peace on this island and much effort all round we have the potential to become a great country for tourists.  However, although we often talk as if we have worked wonders, we have not come anywhere near realising that potential.  We have only kept pace with the increase in international tourism. If we eliminate ethnic and roots tourism, we have made only very modest progress, despite what the Minister of State correctly described as the exceptional performance last year.</P>
      <P>My main concern is with tourism progress in the north west, a region which, despite its natural attractions has failed to realise its true potential, perhaps even more than any other part of the country.  While its geographic location may be the main reason for this, comparative peace in the North and significant improvements in road access should eliminate some of the major geographical disadvantages for that area. With modest encouragement from the Minister, the tourism industry in the north west could be transformed in a short period.  We are not asking for anything exceptional.  We merely want some measures that would embellish the natural attractions of the area.  We welcomed the £50,000 the Minister provided last week for the Sligo walkway through some of the most scenic parts of the county.  The route stretches from Lough Talt in my native parish to Lough Easkey and on to Collooney and Ballygawley, linking the walkways of Mayo and Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should concentrate on our natural advantages, such as walking, golfing, horse riding and other activity sports and our archaeological heritage.  A recent survey reveals that Sligo is the <Col N="1268" /> richest county in monuments and sites, with a staggering 4,500 listed in the survey. There is the potential tourist attraction of Knocknashee Hill Fort, located in the south of the county.  Although that is the third largest hill fort in the country it is not signposted and does not have a path to the top, neither has it been declared a national monument. These matters must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the essential attraction in the west is its people and their houses &mdash; the smoke from the chimneys, the vernacular architecture.  I have always maintained that agriculture could keep a certain basic level of population in rural areas, but I am no longer confident of that.  While I accept that demographic patterns are not the main concern of the Minister for Tourism and Trade or his Minister of State, the population of the west impinges significantly on their efforts to promote tourism.  The Government could take many initiatives to ensure that good housing stock, once vacated through emigration or death, is made available to other families.  The Minister showed great imagination in designating traditional seaside resorts, such as Enniscrone.  Something should also be done about the houses that are being deserted in rural areas and I have put forward ideas in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have also failed to make proper use of some of our regional airports and in this regard I refer in particular to Sligo and Carrickfinn airports which could be targeted for incoming chartered flights.  I do not know where the blame lies for this failure, but someone should be packaging tours in, say, the British midlands, for people to visit the west and north west for golfing, fishing, horse riding and so on, using Sligo and Carrickfinn airports.</P>
    <P>The Minister must address the problem of the high cost of car hire, which adversely affects tourism in the north west.  At this morning's meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs I asked the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in advance of the millennium, to take up <Col N="1269" /> the artefacts on the wreck of the <i>Spanish Armands</i> in Streedagh Strand.  The largest collection of artefacts &mdash; including 59 cannons &mdash; ever found around our coast have been lying on that wreck for the past ten years.  The Minister should set up a museum in Sligo to house those artefacts, which could be a great attraction for visitors to Sligo.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister of State's excellent speech about the balanced distribution of investment and the added value of tourism, particularly in rural parishes.  We must concentrate on that type of tourism.  I ask him to pay special attention to the north west, where there is great tourism potential, which has not yet been realised.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Ring. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  Aont aíonn gach duine ón Aire Stáit go dtí gach duine a labhair anseo aréir agus inniu ar thábhacht na turasóireachta do eacnamaíocht na tíre.  Ní amháin go gcuireann sé teacht isteach ar fáil ach cuireann sé fostaíocht ar fáil fosta.  Is í an turasóireacht ceann de na tionscail is mó atá ag forbairt faoi láthair agus tá súil againn go leanfaidh sí ar aghaidh mar sin.  Caithfimid gach iarracht a dhéanamh i ngach áit sa tír an oiread agus is féidir a bhaint amach aisti, daoine a chur ag obair agus fostaíocht a chothú.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputies Nealon and Kenny and I agree that tourism is booming.  Statistics indicate, however, that there is a national imbalance in tourism.  Deputy Kenny mentioned the attractions of Dublin, which is becoming the tourism capital of Europe.  People from the United Kingdom and other European countries come here for short breaks and weekends and have a very enjoyable few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read this morning in one of the papers about two families who visited Ireland around Easter.  One, a German family, on arriving in Dublin hired a car and travelled to the south Cork-Kerry <Col N="1270" /> area and back through Kilkenny and Glendalough.  The second family arrived in Shannon and did the same circuit. That is an indication that regions such as the west, particularly the north-west, are not benefiting from tourism like the rest of Ireland.  It is coincidental that those two cases were referred to in this morning's <i>Irish Independent.</i> Both families concentrated on the same part of the country, as if the north-west or Donegal did not exist.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available, backed by the Central Statistics Office, show that in 1994 total tourist receipts for the north-west region &mdash; Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim and Cavan-Monaghan &mdash; amounted to £191 million.  In 1995 there was an increase in tourism nationally, but in the north-west tourist receipts were down to £165 million, a significant reduction.  The reason for that reduction relates to the troubles in the past 25 years in Northern Ireland, as a result of which potential tourists from the rest of the country avoided the north-west. They associate it with Northern Ireland, as do many international tourists. Therefore, we were over-dependent on northern tourists.  As a result of the peace process, which we all welcome and hope will continue, the entire country will benefit.  A short-term difficulty has been created, however, in that fewer Northern Ireland tourists, on whom we have been dependent for so long, are visiting the area.  Instead they are exploring their own region, resulting in a downturn in the number of tourists in the north-west.  That is not noticeable but the figures do not lie.</P>
    <P>To counteract the problem we must undertake a more aggressive marketing campaign for the north-west.  It must be marketed as an attractive place.  We have as much, if not more, to offer than any other part of Ireland and people who visit the area always return.  We must also improve access to the north-west. People visiting other parts of Ireland think that Donegal is at the North Pole.  It is possible, however, to reach any part of Donegal from Dublin in three or four hours &mdash; it is as easy to <Col N="1271" /> travel from Dublin to Donegal as to travel from Dublin to Kerry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon referred to airports.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister recently in granting £300,000 to Carrickfin airport, Donegal.  That money will help to market and promote not only that airport but the entire region.  Last year £100,000 was allocated to the area, and Deputy Coughlan had the good grace to welcome it.  When there is good news, support from every side of the House is appreciated.  It is important that the regional imbalance in tourism be addressed.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before the Structural Funds were unevenly allocated, with much funding being provided for the east coast while the west was forgotten.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on the wonderful job they are doing in this area.  Last year was a record year for tourism.  Earlier in the year I referred to the low number of tourists visiting the west, and I was proven right at the end of the year.  I hope Deputy Hughes, who castigated me at the time, will have the decency to apologise to me this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much talk about Dublin. Two weeks ago my wife and I visited a restaurant in Temple Bar &mdash; an area for which tax breaks are given &mdash; but when I received the bill there was an extra charge of £3.50, for food.  Since the meal was not very good I was annoyed at the extra charge.  When I inquired what the £3.50 was for I was told it was a service <Col N="1272" /> or house charge.  I objected to the fact that the bill indicated that the £3.50 was for food and said I would report it to the Minister &mdash; I will give him the name of the restaurant because I want him to take up the matter.  If that is the way people are treated it is no wonder we have great difficulty attracting tourists. The Minister should deal with the issue of service charges.  People visiting restaurants and hotels should be charged only for accommodation, food or whatever, and if they wish to give a tip it should be at their discretion.</P>
    <P>People involved in the tourist trade should be pleasant to tourists because we want them to return.  They should not think only about the current year and the quick buck.</P>
    <P>The Westport, Mulranny and Achill areas are great tourist destinations. Announcements were made about that area in the past 12 months and I hope the Minister will announce the opening of the Westport leisure centre in the near future.  It is time the west got its share of tourists and I intend to ensure we succeed in that regard.  For too long money was allocated to other areas while the west was neglected.  At a recent conference in Dublin many of the people attending did not know where the west coast is.  Bord Fáilte should concentrate on promoting the west.  I regret I do not have more time because I have much more to say on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two brief points.  Voluntary organisations play a very significant role in promoting tourism in their local areas.  It has come to my attention recently that tourist information offices under the aegis of Bord Fáilte insist that literature promoting tourist attractions without the Board Fáilte stamp of approval will not be displayed in those offices.  I hope the Minister will take up this point as a plethora of attractions developed with the assistance of State funds will be excluded from promotion by these offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme funding was available for small hotels in <Col N="1273" /> rural areas.  This funding is now exhausted and the Minister should go back to the Commission and seek additional funding under this heading.  Funding for accommodation and leisure facilities for smaller hotels under Measure 5 of the Operational Programme can deliver great benefits and stimulate investment in areas which will otherwise have to struggle to gain their rightful share.  I thank Deputy Ring and the other Deputies for being so tolerant of my incursion into their time.</P>

      <P>Some members of his party, including Deputy Bell, visit the west.  I hope it does not go unnoticed that most of the contributors to the debate represent constituencies along the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry which have become increasingly dependent on tourism because of migration, emigration and the failure of the Government to provide industrial and service type jobs.  When the agricultural and mineral extraction industries closed down in the Caribbean countries the tourism industry became very important.  Similarly, tourism is becoming increasingly important in the west. We must ensure that the tourism product is evenly spread throughout the regions and that there is an unapologetic bias in favour of the west and those areas which have not experienced a sustainable level of tourism growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must also be a bias in favour of the west in terms of grant aid.  Some <Col N="1274" /> years ago there was an increase in the level of hotel accommodation built in Dublin and the leaders in the industry wondered if all of it would be filled.  We now see that there is increased demand &mdash; there are still many projects in the pipeline &mdash; and that bed and breakfast owners in Dublin can charge the same rate as top class hotels in the west. Under the operational programme introduced by the then Fianna Fáil Government there was an even spread of tourism benefits and no regionalisation in terms of the allocation of grant aid.  The time has come for a bias in favour of those areas which have the potential to build up the tourism product and sustain an increasing number of visitors. In recent months there has been much reference to areas which have too many visitors and the Minister now has an opportunity to do something about this issue.  There are many other points I would like to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As my time is limited I will concentrate on the main proposal in the motion, that is to ensure that available finances and resources are no longer employed to further exacerbate regional imbalances.</P>
      <P>Tourism is unquestionably our strongest growing industry and it is predicted to continue growing until the year 2000 and beyond.  It is a very important element in the economy of all developing and developed countries, particularly Ireland.  Nowhere in Ireland is tourism more crucially important than in the west and, in particular, County Mayo.  All the official reports and plans, including the National Development Plan and the recently published Western Development Partnership Board plan, tell us that tourism is the main hope for the development of employment in the west in the future.  Yet there is a clear regional imbalance in the spread of tourism benefits throughout the regions.  A recent report published by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent research carried out on behalf <Col N="1275" /> of the ITIC indicated that tourism is growing faster in the eastern regions than in the west so the benefits of tourism growth are not being spread equitably.</P>
    <P>Other reports bear out these findings. The report goes on to state that the Government must decide if sufficient infrastructure is in place to cope with further expansion.  This, in turn, poses questions about how the tourism industry can move more of its business into areas such as the west, particularly County Mayo, which are still underdeveloped in the tourism sense but which have great potential.  This cannot be done without greater EU and Government assistance and, if one is to judge from the performance to date, there is little sign of this assistance.</P>
    <P>The industry is being allowed to proceed at two speeds, a fast speed in the east and a slow speed in the west.  Far from achieving convergence, the stated intention of Cohesion and Structural Funding, this process, if allowed to continue, will put tourism in the west at a further disadvantage rather than help it to catch up.  It seems that Cohesion and Structural Funding has been directed towards those areas which are already well established in the tourism field by assisting the provision of ever more sophisticated tourism products, while the more underdeveloped areas in the west cannot get assistance to provide basic facilities.</P>
    <P>Reports state that there is a need to increase accommodation by 50 per cent in County Mayo if it is to cater for the number of visitors expected to visit the county by the year 2000.  Yet no grants are available for the provision of accommodation in County Mayo.  I am informed that 40 of the 90 hotels due to be erected in the next few years and past the planning stage will be in Dublin and the surrounding environs.  Recently a relatively modest development in Knock which would have catered for 100 people was turned down in court <Col N="1276" /> because of the inadequacy of the sewerage system.  Mayo County Council submitted an application for the upgrading of this system to the Department of the Environment some time ago but it is still awaiting approval.  If the Government is interested in the development of the west it should give the go-ahead to this and other small schemes.  It should also give financial support to small and family owned hotels in the region to encourage them to develop and expand. The development of such infrastructure is necessary if tourism in the west is to reach its potential and be the economic salvation of those areas which experts predict it will be.</P>
    <P>The tourists who visit Knock may be regarded as a joke by some of the mandarins who monitor and direct the development of the tourism industry, but more than one million people visit this location every year.  These visitors are important not only to the local economy but to the wider area.  There cannot be a regional balance in the industry without Government and ministerial action.  I acknowledge the recent assistance given by the Government to improve the lighting system at Knock Airport.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Kenny, for including western tourism locations in the recently designated tax areas and invite the Minister of State to visit Knock Airport which has great potential to assist the development of tourism in the west.  I urge the Minister and Bord Fáilte to take cognisance of that fact.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear my party spokesman, Deputy Andrews, suggest yesterday that greater efforts should be undertaken to promote tourist traffic into airports outside Dublin.  I am sure that the management of Knock International Airport would be only too pleased to facilitate the Minister and Bord Fáilte in that respect.  There was much criticism on the part of those in the west of a recent Bord Fáilte publication entitled &ldquo;Ireland &mdash; A Romantic Blend&rdquo; in which there was no mention of the Céide Fields or the Foxford Woollen Mills, to say nothing of the fact <Col N="1277" /> that flight schedules from Britain to Knock international Airport were incomplete.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Members should engage in the marketing of tourism for their respective regions.  We could all speak about the attractions of our constituencies, about the huge regional imbalances, even between Dublin city centre and greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>A number of issues need to be examined. We speak about the diversity of the product, yet I have noticed that many who diversified into new types of product and accommodation have discovered they do not fit into the ordinary categories of accommodation and experience enormous registration difficulties. The very fact that we have such a diversity of product is something that needs to be examined urgently.</P>
      <P>We have invested much money in marketing our tourist attractions and have reaped some of the benefits but we must concentrate on those specific products we have to market.  There has been an increase in the numbers of backpackers and other young visitors and although some facilities are provided for them others are needed.  Many people in the mainstream trade are very annoyed that there is no knock-on benefit from these young visitors.  Nonetheless, we should encourage them because in ten or 15 years time when they get a job and have some money to spend they may return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not really targeted young professionals, those with a few extra pounds to spend who can afford to pay for hotel accommodation.  At the same time, I am afraid that we may price ourselves out of the market.  It is expensive to go out for a meal and purchase a bottle of wine compared with prices in other European countries.  While we have the quality product, we need to reexamine our price structures.  There is an insufficient variety of restaurants here.  There is need for a middle niche market in which there is much potential. People should be encouraged to invest <Col N="1278" /> in that type of restaurant and ancillary facilities.</P>
    <P>We have a problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> accommodation. Each year we debate the fact that there is no grant aid for accommodation and that there is an imbalance in some regions while others need to be targeted.  Somebody will have to take very difficult political decisions and target areas where accommodation needs to be upgraded, in addition to ascertaining how many bednights are available within the industry in the west and northwest.  The reality is that we have insufficient, particularly to facilitate tour operators.</P>
    <P>Training is another vital issue.  We cannot have an industry without adequate training.  Having worked in the Hotel College in Killybegs, I know that much money has been invested in training.  Hoteliers, restaurateurs and those promoting tourism must encourage people to be re-trained consequent on the enormously changed system.  The Minister should engage in some public relations exercise to encourage people to be re-trained in the off-season, or by way of in-house training similar to that provided by FÁS.</P>
    <P>There should be an integrated approach to such grants as are available to assist the development of the industry. There has been much criticism of the plethora of agencies charged with the allocation of these grants in Border areas.  We tend to give people false hope and encourage them to engage in tourism only to discover they are unable to develop a tourism product.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism and Trade and Bord Fáilte will have to work hand in hand with the Department of the Environment in the provision of proper infrastructure and litter control. We must implement a cohesive package in our attempts to redress regional imbalance.  Any investment in tourism must encompass infrastructure to allow access to the regions, one of our most serious problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> regional imbalances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of <Col N="1279" /> the House, I should like to share my time with Deputy McDaid.</P>
      <P>This debate is timely and useful and will direct the attention of the Minister, his Department and those engaged in the industry to the need to ensure the balanced development of our tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House in the names of members of the Fianna Fáil Party, among other things, refers to the need to:</P>
      <P>&mdash;take action to promote more even growth in tourist numbers and income in the regions and in the off-peak season;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to ensure that available finances and resources are no longer employed to further exacerbate regional imbalances;</P>
      <P>We are grateful that the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation report has highlighted the sudden change in the growth in tourism, showing exceptional levels of growth in the eastern region compared with those in western regions generally. It is appropriate that this anomaly be brought to the immediate attention of policy-makers so that they can ensure an even growth distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years the tourism industry worldwide has been experiencing phenomenal growth.  One might well question whether ours should not be faring better bearing in mind the vast numbers of international tourists who travel to London and the very small proportion of them who continue their journey here.  That vast potential has remained untapped to date.  This industry is of great importance to our economy, its benefits filtering down to the most remote rural areas.  No other industry or investment the Government could sponsor would yield so much revenue for so many of our remote regions. We do not want to see that benefit siphoned off into an Irish tourism industry based in Dublin.  That criticism could be levelled at the English tourism market since most if its visitors are attracted <Col N="1280" /> mainly to London, resulting in a huge imbalance there.  We have been successful in maintaining growth in all our tourist regions.  It is important that our tourism policy is directed at its continuance.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that overall visitor numbers in 1995 reached a record high of 4,256,000.  There is a danger of concentrating on such figures, for a number of reasons, the first being that we need to attract quality, high-spending tourists to sustain high quality, sustainable jobs for those employed in the industry.  The industry's reputation as an employer has not been the best because of its vagaries.  In order to improve the conditions of those employed in the industry, to create well remunerated, full-time, worth-while career opportunities, we need to attract a higher level of tourist spender rather than concentrate on augmenting tourist numbers, which appears to be the trend from the Minister's remarks.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a two-way business and, while there are those engaged in attracting foreign visitors, here, there are other promoters selling foreign holidays to Irish people.  This means that Irish people are participating in this phenomenal worldwide growth in tourism. It is important to point out that, as net revenue earners from tourism and travel, we are faring worse now than in 1991.</P>
    <P>When expenditure by Irish visitors abroad is put against the earnings from visitors to this country, the net revenue from tourism and travel amounted to a balance of £518 million in our favour in 1991.  Unfortunately, in 1995 the net balance in favour of the Exchequer has dropped to £410 million.  We must focus on the reality that our domestic market is losing out to foreign markets.  The large numbers of Irish travelling abroad is countering the growth in revenue from visitors coming to this country to the extent that our position is declining. The relevant figures are produced in the Government Information Services tourism and travel quarterly publication for January-March 1996.  This is worrying <Col N="1281" /> trend and it is disappointing that the Minister in his long speech did not refer to that development in the industry.  It is one of the most significant developments and something to which the Government should direct its attention.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a domestic market initiative has been taken.  A total of £500,000 has been made available by the Government to increase the number of holidays Irish people take in Ireland. When one considers that the Irish who travel abroad on holidays spend £1.2 billion, one can see that the Government's contribution of £500,000 to promote domestic tourism is a paltry sum. Nobody seeks to stop people travelling abroad on holidays, but we must be more vigorous in promoting domestic holidays.  The industry deserves that, particularly in view of the large investment made during the past number of years in new facilities, including the upgrading of hotels, guest-houses and the provision of new tourist amenities of a high standard right across the board, many of which are lying empty and grossly under-utilised for nine months of the year.  There is a major opportunity to attract the Irish to holiday at home and to sample and enjoy those new facilities, which they have not experienced, rather than to take the plane to Spain or Portugal.  Young people are more strongly attracted to sun holidays, but the middle-aged group have sampled them and there is great potential among that group to promote higher levels of growth in domestic tourism. It is necessary that we do so because, as net revenue earners from tourism and travel, we did much better in 1991 than in 1995.</P>
    <P>I am confused about the new role for Údarás na Gaeltachta in promoting tourism in the Gaeltacht areas.  I have had communication from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht which was intended to clarify the matter, but it has left me more in the dark than I had been before I sought clarification. I ask the Minister of State to inform the House either today or at a later stage as to the distinction between <Col N="1282" /> the role of Board Fáilte and that of Údarás na Gaeltachta in promoting tourism in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>There is a need to provide financial assistance to those who are prepared to upgrade their guest-houses, bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels, provided they are registered through the State registering system for official accommodation.  I appeal to the Government to recognise that need and to meet it to increase the availability of facilities and the provision of a higher standard product through the continuous efforts to improve tourist facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for sharing time with me.  I am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  I am sure the House will forgive me if I concentrate my remarks on the position as it affects the northern half of the country, especially my county of Donegal where people depend heavily on tourism for their livelihoods.  For as long as I can remember the marketing of tourism abroad has been concentrated almost entirely, as other Deputies said, on the lovely southern half of the country. It appears that somebody had drawn a line from Dublin to Galway and ordained that there would be minimal marketing north of that line.  We are used to plane loads of travel agents being flown in from the United States and Europe and entertained in Dublin, Galway and Killarney.  This year's Bord Fáilte European workship has been organised again in Killarney &mdash; previously it was held in Galway and Cork. Bord Fáilte produced a brochure on walking tours in Ireland and Donegal tourism interests had paid for an advertisement in that brochure but no mention of Donegal was included in its editoral content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard that foreign tourists went into a Bord Fáilte office in Dublin for information on Donegal and were told that it was handled by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, I thought that Dr. Paisley had annexed another part of Ulster.  That did not surprise me in the <Col N="1283" /> least because I have met many Americans who thought that Donegal was one of the Six Counties.  In recent months the tourism industry in Donegal has been organising its marketing having lost all patience with the lack of real effort by Bord Fáilte in Dublin to promote it.</P>
    <P>In terms of the lack of promotion of tourism in Donegal from Dublin, there is one honourable and outstanding exception.  I refer to the magnificent efforts down through the years by Gay Byrne on his radio and television programmes. If anyone deserves the title of honorary citizen of Donegal, it is he. Mr. Byrne has spent his holidays in the county for well over 30 years and has never tired of its beauty and the qualities of its people.  Perhaps he is aware of the shortcomings of Bord Fáilte in promoting that area.  I would like Gay Byrne to know that the people of Donegal have noted everything he has done and greatly appreciate his efforts.  I have no doubt he has done more for Donegal than any State body.  It is time that Bord Fáilte gave him a little help and we will be watching it carefully from now on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am pleased to speak on this debate and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, for allowing me time to make a brief contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members may be surprised that I have a contribution to make to this debate, but I live in one of the most picturesque areas of the country in County Westmeath.  It is the lake district of the country and a beautiful county with many excellent facilities, including lakes, fishing, cultural activities, equestrian facilities, bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels and golfing and pitch and putt facilities.  Like Deputy McDaid, I would like somebody to promote the excellence of that county on the national radio.  I welcome the contributions of other Deputies to this debate. We had a useful and wide-ranging debate on our national tourism performance and the prospects for the <Col N="1284" /> future.  I was surprised that the motion was put down by the Opposition in these terms, but that is its prerogative.</P>
    <P>Westmeath County Council, in partnership with the Midland-East Regional Tourism, is a promoter of the national freshwater centre of Belvedere in Mullingar. This large project, is intended as a flagship one for the midlands region and I am sure it will get the support of everybody.  It will be located in the grounds of Belvedere House and gardens on the shores of Lough Ennell, some three miles south of Mullingar, which is bounded by the world renowned golf course.  It will have a visitor centre incorporating an educational reception area, indoor water garden, audio visual theatre, art and mythology.  Extensive development of the garden, parkland and shore is also intended.  It is an excellent project and my colleague, Deputy McGrath, and I hope the development management board will give it the support and approval it deserves.  This proposal would bring upwards of 100,000 visitors to that area and that is very important in terms of tourism.</P>
    <P>Irish tourism is going through a period of unprecedented and sustained growth.  The optimum support structures have been put in place in order to promote further development and the prospects for the future have never looked better.  It might be useful to recapitulate on some of the key points that illustrate this success.</P>
    <P>While the targets the Government has set for tourism are clearly ambitious, we are well on course towards achieving them.  Ireland was the top performing tourism destination in Europe in 1995 with revenue growth of 12 per cent over 1994 compared with a European average of 2.3 per cent.  All our main markets performed exceptionally well.  Visitor numbers from Britain were up 13 per cent, from North America were up 30 per cent and from mainland Europe were up about 12 per cent. Job creation targets are also being met &mdash; this is very significant &mdash; and the sector is now estimated by Bord Fáilte to <Col N="1285" /> sustain 102,000 jobs, an increase of 50 per cent over the 1988 figure.  Tourism will soon outstrip agriculture as the main provider of jobs in our economy.</P>
    <P>Some opinions have been expressed on the subject of the regional imbalance. Contrary to this view, all regions have benefited from this growth, a point which was illustrated at length by the Minister of State.  Deputy O'Sullivan, in his statement last night.  Not only that, but the past and future strategy for tourism development takes full account of the need for regional development and provides a platform for each region to realise its potential.  Indeed some of the programmes and measures that assist tourism projects, such as the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas &mdash; we would love to benefit from this scheme in County Westmeath &mdash; IFI, INTERREG, and Leader programme and the agri-tourism scheme could, by their nature be said to be weighted in favour of regional development.  This is important and is to be applauded.</P>
    <P>The value of domestic tourism to the economy generally and to the regions in particular has not always been fully appreciated in the past and I am sure the House will agree that the initiative recently announced by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, in this regard will prove extremely useful.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of Bord Fáilte is well on course and its home marketing activities are being extensively supplemented by a total projected marketing spend of £125 million in the operational programme for tourism which will support a marketing campaign focused on improving seasonality and access, developing new markets, attracting high yield business and co-operative marketing on a product or geographical basis.  The overseas tourism marketing initiative, which represents a unique partnership of Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, and the tourism industry North and South, is proving particularly successful in this regard.</P>
    <P>New and improved arrangements have been put in place to ensure the <Col N="1286" /> optimum co-ordination between Government Departments and agencies involved in tourism development. Greater emphasis is also being put on manpower policy.  Together with the other policies outlined by the various speakers in the debate, the framework is being put into place to ensure the planned development of a sustainable tourism industry into the next millenium. Obviously there is no room for complacency and perceived problems of regional imbalances as outlined must be addressed.  It is nevertheless clear that not only can we realise our national tourism targets but that the conditions are there for each of the regions to realise its own potential.  That is my hope for the midlands east region and for County Westmeath in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this most important issue.  I can say without fear of contradiction that I come from one of the most beautiful counties in Ireland.  The scenery is spectacular and breathtaking in its variety and the inhabitants are second to none, as Members know.</P>
      <P>Having been to Killarney and suffering from the adventure of finding a place to stay &mdash; I almost failed despite the fact that every second building seemed to be a guest house or a hotel &mdash; and having listened to a report on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning to the effect that there is no room left for visitors in Dublin, I am amazed at the failure to market Ireland as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is unique in what each county has to offer the tourist.  Natural resources abound in every part of the country.  We should not rely completely on a handful of locations to absorb the entire tourism market but, unfortunately, that seems to be how it is at present.  If we get rid of regional imbalances we will have more accommodation available which in turn could lead to a growth in visitor numbers in areas at present devoid of real tourism. This would lead to a bigger income for all areas and more people would be <Col N="1287" /> involved.  Everyone will be happy; the tourist, who has had an enjoyable holiday, the hotelier or person with whom the visitor stayed, the musicians or dancers who entertained the visitors, the shopkeepers, the companies which transported the visitors to and from the holiday destinations and so on.</P>
    <P>What is going wrong for places such as north Donegal?  Are such places too far removed from the main centres of population?  Ireland is a relatively small island.</P>
    <P>We could be reached throughout the year by cruise liners or yachts, but although cruise liners pass up the Foyle, for example &mdash; the passengers wave at us and we wave back at them as they go to Derry and back &mdash; and while hundreds of people are involved in yachting throughout the country and want a series of landing spots around the north coast, there is no commitment in real terms to repairing our many piers, although the Minister for the Marine has an interest in the development of small harbours.</P>
    <P>We could have been reached by air, but what was done to keep the Jersey and European routes from Eglington, Derry, to Dublin in operation?  We were not looking for a big investment; indeed it seems we did not look for any investment. We appreciate any help given to Carrickfin, but marketing has to be improved and include the whole of Donegal.</P>
    <P>We could be reached by road but there are many deficiencies in road signs which could easily be improved by the tourism group if they were properly funded.  However, the tourism section of Inishowen Leader II receives £40,000 per year and Action Inishowen is practically penniless.  Even more serious is the fact that most of the beautiful coastal routes are in danger of disappearing due to coastal erosion, although we have been told there is funding available for this work.  What will happen to tourism if our natural resources disappear?  With a little investment it should be possible to improve our road network to places <Col N="1288" /> of interest such as Knock.  The interest must be coherent and structured, however, as the many State bodies and agencies currently administering funding and marketing the country are completely confused, like those funding the business.  One agency does not know what the other's function is.  We need a one stop shop and a definite source of funding for accommodation in areas where there is a shortage of it.  It is hard to believe that there are areas without hotels, registered guest houses or self catering accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater co-operation between Departments not only between the Department of Defence and the Marine, as mentioned earlier. There should be encouragement for the arts, music and dance.  Donegal County Council is working on a cross-Border basis to provide a Macgilligan to Greencastle car ferry.  Such initiatives will open up the whole north coast to tourist potential.  We need that to be followed up and I hope the Minister will do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was placed on the Order Paper last February, long before the report from ITIC was published.  That report confirmed that our concerns outlined in this motion are well founded.  I look forward to a future policy statement from the industry or from the Government which will address issues raised today but not assessed in the ITIC report.  It is clear that there is a worrying lack of planning in tourism and that the industry suffers from poor research and weak objective setting.  As <Col N="1289" /> a result, despite increasing tourist numbers, there is much confusion and disaffection in the industry.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the Minister of State acknowledged this in his speech and outlined again the tourism 2000 strategy as the basis of the Government's response.  The policy document of the previous Government was reponsive to the needs of its time and quite far reaching in many respects.  It laid the ground work for the present encouraging growth in numbers and revenue. However, the situation is constantly changing.  The policy needs updating, perhaps a fundamental rethink and a change of direction.  The onus is on the Minister and the Government to undertake this review and change in policy direction.  Deputy Andrews and I have highlighted this at every opportunity in the House and in committees, and we take the opportunity here again under six headings.  There are other areas of concern, but these are the principal issues which have been raised with us, mainly by people in the trade.</P>
    <P>The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation report.  <i>Responding to Changing Market Trends,</i> prepared by Tourism and Leisure Partners, identifies some of the successes and deficiencies in Irish tourism.  Nobody denies there are encouraging increases in visitor numbers nationally.  However, there are huge regional disparities and a minimal increase of 3 per cent in the shoulder season is quite disappointing while outside of Dublin off-season growth is negligible. I have already referred to the ITIC report, a section of which highlights the disparities between the regions.  Among British holiday visitors, east coast bednights grew by 30 per cent in 1995 while west coast bednights declined by 19 per cent.  Among European holiday visitors, east coast bednights grew by 6 per cent and west coast bednights declined by 6 per cent. As to US holiday visitors, which is the most encouraging area nationally, east coast bednights grew by 88 per cent while west coast bednights grew by 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Lest there be any misunderstanding, the growth in visitor numbers and revenue in Dublin is welcomed by all. Some speakers may have misunderstood our intention in that regard.  We welcome that and would like to see it continuing to develop.  We accept there are slightly different markets.  However, even within Dublin and within the eastern region there are enormous differences. Large numbers of tourists who visit Dublin are concentrated in quite a small area of the city.  There are other areas, south County Dublin, north County Dublin and adjoining counties, which could benefit from visitors coming to Dublin, and if that growth is to continue they will have to be included. I note South Dublin County Council is thinking of appointing a person in charge of tourism for its area.  That is to be welcomed but, certainly, the Dublin numbers can be accommodated in a greater area, and the lessons and successes of Dublin can be repeated in the rest of the country by adopting appropriate strategies.  We are talking about doing that by increasing the number of people coming in and not by decreasing the number of people visiting Dublin.</P>
    <P>We also need to address the shoulder season and the off-season.  Perhaps the shoulder season is more important because it allows the opportunity to lengthen the season in each direction and has enormous advantages in terms of costs for hoteliers and others involved in the industry, particularly staff.  A new policy initiative is required in that area.</P>
    <P>The role of access in the disparities between east and west is highlighted in the ITIC report, and we will have to come up with ways to address it and face up to the fact that more and more people who want to come here want to fly in.  The west of Ireland can benefit as much as Dublin by increasing the number of flights to the many airports in the west and also by addressing the cost of rented car facilities at those airports. Ultimately cost is a major factor in the development of tourism, and the Government can come up with a policy <Col N="1291" /> that will ensure competitive costs and give an advantage to the areas which have not enjoyed much growth.</P>
    <P>The second point addressed in the motion relates to spending Government finances and the effect that has.  That was examined in the report which did not come up with conclusive findings.  If governments are in the business of spending money they need also to be able to say that it has had some effect.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers from the Border area expressed their disappointment that the Border fund was not spent. Many people in the industry are a little surprised at the level of facilities provided, for example in Tralee.  I am sure that was not for political reasons, but some people might believe it was.  The Government is making a mistake in placing too much emphasis on spending European Regional Development Fund money &mdash; this has now become the major objective rather than, as it should be, the means to an end.  We also have to face up to the fact that there has been on occasion development of inadequate or inappropriate tourism projects.  The Celtworld project may fall into that category. The conference centre scenario which was dealt with in detail by Deputy Andrews is most worrying.  We also have a tendency to copy successful projects and provide too many of them and, as a consequence, damage the success of the project that initially set the running.  We need to fundamentally rethink the role of the management boards in relation to the European Regional Development Fund funds. That is extremely important in terms of deciding where Irish tourism is going.</P>
    <P>On the quality of tourism and income generation we must learn a lesson from other countries.  Parts of Spain and Italy successfully encouraged mass tourism but, unfortunately, almost killed the goose that laid the golden egg.  They have developed strategies which have successfully spread their tourism, and we can learn from them.  There are also important segments emerging in tourism which need to be pinpointed and <Col N="1292" /> chased directly because they are the areas that can deliver.  I have in mind areas like youth tourism which tends to be ignored to some extent, the amazing market in Europe and in North America for the additional holiday, the second or third holiday, even more in some cases, the green holiday, business tourism, cultural tourism.  There is even a role in adult education for parts of the country. To achieve success in this area we need to address the role of the RTOs and encourage them to increase visitor satisfaction and create visitor spend.  There is a need in that area for innovation and for involving the local community and crafts people in areas and getting a marketplace for a shop front for products of the area.</P>
    <P>We also referred to integrated development at local level.  The local authorities need to be brought into the picture.  Support and direction is required for local communities who are showing initiative.  We have to remember that the local communities are the receiving ambassador and play a key role in enhancing Ireland's reputation for hospitality and friendliness.  Almost every speaker has referred to the lack of co-ordination of State and grant aiding agencies.  The Minister and Minister of State are aware of this.  Deputy Penrose, in his address, listed some of these agencies. There is an urgent need for clarity in the role of this plethora of bodies. Some rationalisation is also required. On the Manpower Development Plan we would all agree that CERT are doing a magnificent job but there are many other agencies involved in training, and training is crucial to the development of tourism.  It is most important that the quality of service provided to the tourist be of the highest quality to enhance the reputation of Ireland as a tourist destination and to ensure that the kind of growth we have enjoyed is spread more evenly, brings better tourism revenue with it, and continues to grow.  There are signs of poor planning.  It is hardly any wonder that Irish tourism has drifted to some extent and that in the very era when we are enjoying such <Col N="1293" /> huge increases in numbers there is much disaffection and confusion and in some areas the industry is virtually in chaos. There is a weak organisational structure with no clearly defined roles for the public and private sectors.  We need a modern tourism industry which can cope and prosper in a highly competitive world.  To this end innovation is the key.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent report made by Shannon Development and the University of Limerick in this area.  It has highlighted the advantages of innovation, <Col N="1294" /> that we in Irish tourism are simply not into innovation and have not realised we are in a very competitive arena where there is a huge market but where we can only continue to succeed if we can match those with whom we are competing.  We have to match them in terms of cost and service.  We can certainly match them in terms of the project. However, we need to be able to match them in all areas.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Garda Síochána Bill, 1996: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned this debate I referred to paragraph 6 of the Schedule which deals with the election to and membership of the Central Executive Committee.</P>
      <P>To redress this imbalance section 6 provides for a number of changes to the structure of the Central Executive Committee. As a result of paragraph 4 (i) (b) the Garda College in Templemore will no longer be deemed a division and, therefore, will lose the right to nominate a member to the CEC.  Because there are only 60 gardaí permanently based in the college, their right of separate CEC membership is considered disproportionate. To further redress the imbalance in representation of the high-personnel Dublin divisions, section 6 (2) of the Schedule provides that of the divisions in the DMA &mdash; which for this purpose will include Garda Headquarters &mdash; the four divisions with the greater number of members will each be allowed to nominate one additional member of the divisional committee to the CEC.  The overall effect of the proposed changes, taking into account the recent reorganisation which included two divisions instead of one in Cork, will be that the membership of the CEC will increase from 26 to 30, and that 11 of those will represent DMA divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions were made to me that a better way of ensuring properly representative voting on the CEC was a system of weighted voting at CEC meetings. Indeed, in a statement I issued in February last, I said that the legislation would provide to each committee member one vote for every ten members in the division which elected that committee member.  However, on further consideration of the matter I decided that this arrangement would be too complex to operate in practice and could lead to <Col N="1297" /> unnecessary dissension at CEC meetings. It would have the anomalous result that the absence of one member would have greater significance than the absence of another if the first had a substantially greater number of votes.  In fact, there is no similar weighted voting at CEC level in any other recognised staff association of which I know.  The real issue is to ensure greater representation for gardaí serving in urban areas and the proposals I have now included in the Bill will provide for that.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 also provides that the CEC shall take office at the conclusion of the annual conference next following the selection of the committee.  The reason for this is that the outgoing CEC will have conducted all the preparations for the conference and it seems only sensible to charge it with the actual conduct of the conference.  To meet the requirements of the Bill the conference must take place before 31 May.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8 of the Schedule provides arrangements to ensure that standing orders are fixed before an annual conference begins.  Difficulties with the fixing of standing orders have been an aggravating factor in the past.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 of the Schedule provides that the president and vice-president shall be appointed by the annual conference from among the members of the CEC.  A candidate for either office shall be nominated by at least two divisions and in either case, if only one person is nominated, he or she shall be deemed to have been elected to the office by conference.  This differs from the present system where the central executive committee elects two of its members as president and vice-president of the association without reference to conference.  The principle underlying this change is to give a greater say to the delegates at the annual conference in the appointment of the principal officers of the association.</P>
    <P>The same principle underlies paragraph 10 of the Schedule.  It deals with the appointment and functions of the main officials of the association, the <Col N="1298" /> general secretary, the deputy general secretary and the assistant general secretary.</P>
    <P>The paragraph provides that the general secretary may be a person who is a member of the association or a member of the Garda Síochána other than a member of the association, or a person who is not a member of the Garda Síochána.  In the latter two cases the appointment shall be subject to the approval of the Minister, who may attach conditions to such approval as he-she thinks fit.  The provision for a non-garda general secretary is a new one.  This is, of course, only an option for the Association and whether it is exercised or not is a matter entirely for the association itself.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 provides that the appointment of the general secretary, deputy general secretary and assistant general secretary shall be by the central executive committee as at present. However, it also provides that the appointment procedure will be laid down by the annual conference and that the appointments shall be subject to ratification by the next annual conference or special conference held following the appointment of the officials.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 (8) of the Schedule provides that the general secretary, deputy general secretary and the assistant general secretary shall not be members of the CEC.  They may attend meetings of the CEC at the leave of the committee, but shall not vote or propose or second motions at meetings of the CEC.</P>
    <P>The House should note that under the existing regulations, specifically section 3 (3) of the regulations of 1990 and section 9 (3) of the 1978 regulations, the membership of the central executive committee is composed exclusively of those members elected by the divisional committees.  However, the GRA's amended rule book of September 1990 states that the officials shall automatically be members of the CEC and have the same rights at all CEC meetings as other CEC members, but not the right to vote on issues being voted on by the CEC.  Paragraph 10 (8) of the Schedule <Col N="1299" /> restates the position as provided in the 1990 regulations.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 11 of the Schedule provides for the appointment of five trustees to the association who shall not belong to the CEC.  The trustees shall receive the report of the auditors. Under the present arrangements there are three trustees all of whom belong to the CEC i.e. the president, vice-president and the treasurer.  The intention here is to have responsibility for the considerable finances of the association vested in a body separate from the executive of the association.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12 of the Schedule provides for the appointment of a treasurer of the association by the CEC from among its members.  This remains unchanged from the present position.</P>
    <P>The triennial elections of the district committees take place in September.  As a result of paragraph 4 (6) these elections will in future take place every three years in March beginning with March 1997.  The purpose is to bring the election of the central executive committee closer to the date of the annual conference which will elect the officers of the association.</P>
    <P>The reason for bringing the elections of the district committees which take place in September closer to the date of the annual conference which is held the following May is that the officers are in place for approximately six months before their appointments are ratified. As Members can see, it is more difficult where somebody has held a position for six months not to ratify their appointment at the annual conference.  It is important, therefore, to bring the elections and the annual conference closer together.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one which I had hoped would not be necessary.  However, there is now no alternative.  All of the changes proposed in the Schedule are reasonable and motivated solely by the desire to bring greater democracy and fairness into the structures and procedures of the association.  Most fair-minded persons will find the changes proposed <Col N="1300" /> characteristic of the structure and procedures generally found in staff associations. Any association whose structures take into account the need to allow the annual conference to have more say would, I hope, be seen as an association to which one could give allegiance.</P>
    <P>One issue which has arisen is how to reengage the former members, who withdrew from the GRA as a result of the dispute, in new elections which will be held under the new structures brought about by the Bill.  I have been giving careful consideration to this aspect.  What I have in mind is a provision which would automatically entitle those who withdrew from the association since 1 January 1994 to be deemed members and participate in the elections.  Any amendment I may have in this regard can be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that there are those in the GRA who are not wholly concerned that 2,500 gardaí approximately do not wish to be in the GRA.  Equally, there are members of the federation whose only object is one of recognition. I am also aware that the federation has grave concerns about what would happen in the interim i.e. until next March when new elections would be held.  One of the suggestions made to me during recent meetings was that some sort of arrangement be made to speed up the process of change and involve federation members, but I find it hard to envisage how people who are not members of an association can be facilitated in voting for officers of such an association.  That difficulty has yet to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a fair and equitable resolution to a long-standing problem. I will, consider with an open mind any points of detail raised by Deputies. I had a meeting recently with the GRA, the Garda Federation and what is commonly known as the Group of Four and various points were put to me.  Unfortunately, some of them were based on the premise that there were certain actions that it would be desirable for me to take, such as recognising a second association.  The point was made that in <Col N="1301" /> recognising a second association there would be no further problems, but I do not subscribe to that view.  If there were two associations to represent one rank it might have the effect of prolonging the dispute and one association would look for members on the basis of one set of propositions while the other would top that offer and claim, if people joined it, it would get them a bigger and better deal.</P>
    <P>I am sure the proposals put to me have also been put to Opposition spokesperson by the groups involved, as is their right.  I cannot accept some of them because of legal opinion or because it would not be desirable for me to do so.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that comments have been made by some gardaí rejecting the Bill.  I am also aware that the GRA indicated that it was having a special delegate conference to change its rules. That is its business, but it will not deflect me from legislating to meet the requirements and exigencies of the day.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly thank the Minister for her kind expression of good wishes on my return to the House following a recent illness.  I will allow myself a little hint of self-congratulations and say that I was disappointed but not surprised not to receive a message from the Minister hoping that I would be back soon.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. The Bill presents us with the opportunity of reflecting upon, considering and appreciating the role of the gardaí in Irish society.  It will be clear to everybody that the force has played a significant and important role in the development and maintenance of democracy here.  As a body it has been devoid of even a hint of corruption and that is a testament to its enduring role in Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána are <Col N="1302" /> admired and respected in all democracies and it is fair to say also that many emerging democracies aspire to their extremely high standards.  Whether at the height of the troubles along the Border, in the pursuit of peace internationally or in their major role in the fight against criminality throughout the land, the members of the Garda Síochána have been at the forefront and have acquitted themselves with great distinction and courage.</P>
    <P>For these and other reasons it is particularly sad that the members of the Garda Síochána have become embroiled in an argument with themselves about representation.  At times this unfortunate and untimely internal disagreement has surfaced in public and it would be less than honest not to say that it has not helped public confidence in the Garda Síochána's ability to effectively tackle crime.  That may be seen by some as an unfair assessment but it is the public perception which must be confronted.  It would be less than honest to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>That is not to say, however, that grown men and women should be treated like adolescents by the Minister for Justice or that they should be lectured in dictatorial tones reminiscent of a matriarchal handbagging society.  No amount of dictatorship or high moral tone from the Minister for Justice or anybody else will help to resolve a conflict which is as complex as it is deep-seated.</P>
    <P>Inasmuch as there cannot be an imposed solution, it is fair to say there is no simple solution either.  On a previous occasion in this House I referred to what the then United States President, Thomas Jefferson, said on hearing of a judgment by the great American jurist, Chief Justice John Marshall: &ldquo;John Marshall has given his judgment &mdash; let him now enforce it if he can&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One has to be realistic and recognise that this is a serious dilemma and that the Bill as presented &mdash; to be fair to the Minister &mdash; could be figuratively <Col N="1303" /> described as a vehicle which may ultimately lead to an amicable resolution of the dispute.  It would be remiss of me if I did not take the opportunity to say that the gardaí on both sides of this argument deserve tremendous credit for keeping their eyes firmly focused on the fight against crime and not allowing the dispute to distract them from this to any great extent.</P>
    <P>It must be said, however, that there has been and continues to be a palpable lowering of morale within the Garda Síochána in recent times.  This has more to do with the lack of ammunition available to the gardaí in the fight against crime than with the dispute which is the subject matter of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no police force in any democracy which would not be adversely affected by the pirouetting and somersaulting of the Minister for Justice and the rainbow Coalition Government when it comes to the fight against crime.  The image has been conjured up in the public imagination of a Minister for Justice tiptoeing through the tulips and avoiding at any cost catching her Achilles heel on the thorny sensitivities of Messrs.  Spring and De Rossa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy is not going to disappoint me. The bed rest did him the world of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly disappoint the Minister, particularly when the criticism is so well merited. Messrs.  Spring and De Rossa are the silent comrades who never say where they stand on matters such as bail and who prefer to take the Fifth Amendment in relation to such crucial issues.  At least we know where the Minister for Justice stands, even if she cannot implement her proposal.  We do not know where the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare stand on this and related issues regarding the fight against crime.  The haunted face of a Minister for Justice who asks the public to &ldquo;read my lips&rdquo; will be forever etched on the minds of <Col N="1304" /> the public as the counterfeit which the rainbow Coalition Government tried to pass on to the Irish people as a criminal justice policy.</P>
      <P>Inasmuch as the litany of failures, broken promises, considering committees, contemplating commissions, reviewing interdepartmental committees and studying subcommittees have exhausted a cynical public, they must surely have helped to sap at least some of the morale of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>A Minister for Justice cannot hope to retain the confidence of the general public, let alone the Garda Síochána, if she publicly announces a referendum on an issue as important as bail in the spring of 1995 only to see the summer of 1996 come with more, and presumably different, proposals on the table, irrespective of the fact that the different proposals may have been forced upon the Minister &mdash; and no doubt were &mdash; by her colleagues in Government, the Leaders of Democratic Left and the Labour Party.  The new proposals the Minister has formulated have not been seen by us; presumably they have been seen only by the Cabinet and have yet to obtain the seal of approval of the Leaders of Democratic Left and the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>In the same way, a Minister for Justice cannot hope to retain the confidence of the Garda Síochána or the general public if she defends a decision by the kitchen cabinet to cancel the building of prisons in her absence when she earlier championed them as the cornerstone of her criminal justice policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Minister for Justice who sees the glaring mistakes made by a security firm in the Brinks-Allied raid in January 1995, who does not take any remedial action to introduce regulations for security firms and who then watches in awe one year later when a replica raid occurs in Waterford, cannot inspire confidence in the general public or in the Garda Síochána.  It took 100 days following the Brinks-Allied raid for the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 to be introduced by the Minister for Justice even <Col N="1305" /> though she had only to lay the regulation before the House.  It took approximately 15 months for the Minister for Justice to introduce the regulation whereby assets, the subject of suspected criminal activity, could be frozen even though again the Minister had only to lay the regulation before the House.</P>
    <P>For all that, there is an even more unedifying monument to the priority the rainbow Coalition Government attaches to crime.  The increase in the Justice Estimates for 1996 in so far as it relates to the prisons, the courts and the Garda Síochána is about the equivalent of the anticipated increase in inflation despite a savage increase in the viciousness of offences committed.  It was as if there is not a drugs problem, vicious murders were not being committed and burglaries and robberies belonged to another age.  The reality is quite different, and no knight in shining armour, such as Deputy Dukes, sent into this House by the Minister for Justice to pour vitriol on the truth can cover it.</P>
    <P>In so far as there has been a criminal justice policy in this State in the past 18 months, it has emanated from Fianna Fáil.  In dealing with the fiasco which surrounded the Duncan extradition case in this House, the Taoiseach said he could not be expected to stand by the photocopier while the garda photocopied extradition warrants.  I remind him this afternoon that his Minister for Justice is quite good at sitting by the photocopier where Fianna Fáil legislation is concerned.  Her Misuse of Drugs Act, 1996 is a poorly watered down version of Part I of Fianna Fáil's Drug Trafficking Bill, 1996, the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995 is a replica of the essential provisions of Fianna Fáil's Incest Proceedings Bill, 1995 and her proposed insanity Bill, as reported, is clearly sculpted out of the very rock of Fianna Fáil's Criminal Law (Mental Disorder) Bill, 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to tell the House where he got it?  Does he want to tell the House it was taken from the Department of Justice in 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1306" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister did not choose to plagiarize all of Fianna Fáil's Bills and proposals because we would then have a coherent, cogent and effective criminal justice policy.</P>
      <P>It is of fundamental importance that we reflect on whether the structures of the Garda Síochána as presently constituted reflect the needs of modern society.  Could it be more responsive to a society which is becoming increasingly afflicted by drugs and drug related crime?  We must ask ourselves honestly whether the patriarchal role the Department of Justice currently plays in Garda affairs is the most effective way of managing the force.  There simply must be a professional examination of the Garda Síochána with a view to ascertaining whether change is required to make the force more reflective of, and responsive to the needs of society as we approach the third millennium.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that the nature of crime has changed and it is imperative that we honestly address the question of whether there is a need for the Garda Síochána to change in tandem.  In this context, there is clearly a need for a new and imaginative recruitment drive for the Garda.  We must recognise that effective policing today truly requires technological and professional expertise in a whole range of areas.  Technology, professional expertise and mobility are essential for a modern police force.</P>
      <P>It will of course not come as a surprise to anyone to learn that numbers in the force have progressively decreased under this Minister for Justice and the rainbow Coalition Government.  There are fewer gardaí than there were at any time since 1993.  As of 10 May 1996, the strength of the force was 10,798, which is approximately 100 down on the comparable figure for 31 December 1993. Natural wastage at a time of escalating crime levels and increased viciousness in crime is now outstripping recruitment to the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors recently highlighted what it describes as the running down of <Col N="1307" /> the force.  It has called for recruitment to be stepped up and for the extension of the retirement age to alleviate the crisis in Garda numbers to deal with ordinary crime.  I put this marker down here for fear of any misinterpretation inside or outside this House: the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors stated there is a crisis with regard to Garda numbers.  They also make the point that more than 300 members are now diverted from the city and county to duty on the Border because of the BSE emergency.  In a statement issued on 8 May last, the association said the situation, from being extremely bad, has now become intolerable for sergeants and inspectors who bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that gardaí are allocated duties within their units. Supervisors simply do not have enough gardaí now to ensure all the duties are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>This rundown is extraordinary at a time when we are experiencing more indictable crime than in any period in the history of the State.  How can any rational person justify this when, for example, there were 43 murders in 1995 and 22 so far in 1996?  How can any Minister for Justice stand over the decrease in the strength in the Garda Síochána when there were 12 murders committed between 1 January and 30 April 1995, and when this increased to 17 between 1 January and 30 April 1996?  Indeed, how could any Government stand idly by while the figure for indictable crime climbs over 102,000 in a given year.  I quote only statistics, but it must be remembered that behind them are thousands of innocent victims and their families.  Small wonder then that the President of the Garda Representative Association bluntly declared at the GRA annual conference that this Government appears to have no interest in crime.  Not for the first time, I must say it is the duty of the Minister for Justice to fight her corner at the Cabinet table to secure a realistic level of resources to enable her Department and <Col N="1308" /> its agencies to tackle the ever escalating level of crime.</P>
    <P>Last December, a senior Garda officer said certain politicians in the Dáil exaggerated the level of murders committed in the State, when I said in this House that there were 40 in 1995. In fact, the sad and tragic statistic shows there were 43.  Instead of wheeling out a senior Garda officer or officers to play down the problem, the Minister for Justice and the Government would be far better engaged in addressing it.  To date, the Minister has singularly failed to impress on her Cabinet colleagues the need to prioritise the crime problem in terms of resources.  If she fails again in the 1997 Estimates for her Department, the time will certainly have come for her to reflect on the viability of her position and whether it remains tenable.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil holds the view, having given the matter deep consideration, that it is desirable there should be only one Garda representative body, not only in the public interest but in the interests of the Garda.  A strong unified body, representative of all the gardaí, would have the capacity to obtain the best deals and conditions for its members, but the achievement of this objective will require compromise on all sides.  Above all, and this should not be forgotten, it demands ordinary, plain common sense.  I have every confidence in the rank and file membership of the Garda Síochána, many of whom I would describe as personal friends, having and exhibiting that common sense.</P>
    <P>The Garda Representative Association has indicated it will incorporate most of what the Minister has suggested in the Bill.  In that context, it appears to have a problem with the idea of a Minister for Justice reserving unto herself or himself the power to dissolve the association. It makes the point that this would not happen with any other trade union and feels strongly that it should not be made an exception in this respect.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with the two bodies can best be illustrated by the fact that while the Garda Representative Association has no difficulty with one body it has a <Col N="1309" /> difficulty with the Minister reserving unto herself a power of dissolution.  The Garda Federation considers there should be two bodies, if necessary.  It makes the point that if the Government has a preference for dealing with one homogeneous organisation, the Minister should have the Mulvey report adopted in its entirety.  For its part the Garda Federation made it clear that it is not satisfied with the Bill and wants amendments to it.  It is clear to me &mdash; and I am sure to everyone else at this stage &mdash; that the Minister must mediate between the representatives of the Garda Representative Association and the Garda Federation following the passage of Second Stage of this Bill so that common ground can be reached.  There is no point in adopting an ostrich-like stance.</P>
    <P>Is it true that the Minister for Justice has failed or refused, despite repeated written requests, to meet the Garda Representative Association since taking up office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister adopts the same attitude in relation to the Garda Federation, how does she expect to reconcile the difference of opinion between the two bodies?  A direct attempt at mediation must be made by the Minister prior to Committee Stage, otherwise there will be a feeling among the public that the Minister has simply lost control of the force.

      <P>In an attempt to be helpful, Fianna Fáil will support this legislation on Second Stage but I serve due notice on the Minister that she must ensure, following Second Stage, she is not leading us or the Garda Síochána bodies up a blind alley.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I ask the members of the Garda Representative Association and the Garda Federation to reflect on <Col N="1310" /> this legislation, not in a simplistic way but in a deeply considered and constructive way and in a spirit of compromise and magnanimity.  The truth is that the objective of the Garda Representative Assocation and the Garda Federation is the same.  A continuation of the disagreement can only serve to exacerbate it and, ultimately, members of both bodies and the public will be the only losers. For our part, Fianna Fáil will be willing to put forward any reasonable amendments suggested which would help to resolve the impasse, irrespective of which side of the equation they come from.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on behalf of my party.  At a time when Ireland most needs a disciplined, focused and cohesive Garda force to tackle unprecedented levels of viciousness of criminality &mdash; some petty, some organised and some subversive &mdash; it is a sad irony that we have to legislate in the most public way possible to seek to resolve what is basically a trade union or industrial relations dispute between the Garda.  I would prefer to have a real debate on policing but unfortunately, it seems to be out of the range of this House to do so since all operational matters and issues on the deployment of the force are the preserve of the Garda authorities. In that respect, there is a democratic deficit as to how the House can debate policing issues.  Many Members are uneasy resorting to legislation to resolve this protracted, personalised and litigious dispute between the organisations involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 19, 27, 32 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus, as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product within the State, to decide whether to pursue his or her claim to the courts or to the Compensation Tribunal.  The making of a claim to the tribunal under the scheme does not involve a waiver of any right of action.  During the course of negotiations between my Department and interested groups in November 1995, it was agreed that the time within which a claimant must apply would be extended, from three to six months, as is now the case in the tribunal scheme.  In accordance with the tribunal scheme, claimants must apply within six months of the date on which they first become aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus or within six months of the date of the establishment of the tribunal, whichever date is the later.  In exceptional cases the tribunal may in its absolute discretion extend the time limit and shall do so in the case of any claimant whom it is satisfied was under a legal disability by reason of minority or unsoundness of mind at the time at which such claim should otherwise have been made and who applies to it within six months of the cesser of that legal disability. It is not my intention to extend the time limit for applications any further; the closing date for receipt of applications by the tribunal is the 17 June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its inception the tribunal has accepted application forms unsupported by medical data or records.  The tribunal records the applications when received and the claimants or solicitors are <Col N="1313" /> requested to supply outstanding documentation as soon as it becomes available. The tribunal had been receiving a significant number of specific inquiries from the general public and from the legal profession querying whether the lodgment of the application form without the supporting medical data or records before the 17 June 1996 was sufficient to comply with the closing date. The addition to newspaper advertisements to the effect that the application form is accepted by the tribunal without the supporting medical data or records was made to ease the concerns expressed by claimants and solicitors who may be experiencing some difficulties in obtaining medical records or reports before the closing date.</P>
    <P>Cases before the tribunal are heard in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  The tribunal relies primarily on written medical reports in its consideration of individual claims.  The claimant must, no later than six weeks before the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing, submit in writing reports prepared by doctors or other health care professionals who have treated or examined the claimant and relevant reports prepared by other experts on which the claimant intends to rely.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has been hearing a maximum of 12 cases each sitting week and I am informed that the hearing of the cases in respect of the applications received to date will carry its workload at least to the end of 1997.  Claims can be listed for hearing before the tribunal on lodgment of all the relevant documentation. I have been informed by the tribunal that any application for a priority hearing has been and will be dealt with sympathetically by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons with hepatitis C who had received a blood transfusion or blood product who have been identified to date is 1,356.  The compensation tribunal has to date received 639 applications &mdash; at lunch time today the figure was 652.  I have been informed by the tribunal that a <Col N="1314" /> substantial additional number of applications is expected before the closing date.  Since its commencement the tribunal has heard 63 cases.  The awards made to date by the tribunal range from £15,500 to £324,321.  A total sum of approximately £6.67 million has been awarded to date by the compensation tribunal and no tribunal award has been rejected.  The tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently as had been envisaged and at this stage has hearing dates arranged until 31 July 1996.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1995 is to provide a statutory basis for the provision, to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C, of general practitioner services, drugs and medical appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, aural and optical appliances; counselling; home nursing and home help services, free of charge and without a means test.  The Bill, which passed Fourth and Fifth Stages last week, states:</P>
    <P>A health board shall make available without charge to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the board, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immuno-globulin Anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion and to persons of such other classes (if any) as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>An amendment giving the chief executive officer of the relevant health board the power to determine eligibility for the proposed services at his discretion was introduced by me on Committee Stage.  Its introduction followed discussions with representatives of Transfusion Positive which was concerned that a small number of its members would experience difficulties in acquiring medical records.</P>
    <P>In determining eligibility it is envisaged that the chief executive officer's decision would involve, <i>inter alia,</i> consideration of medical opinion submitted <Col N="1315" /> by the applicant's treating physician and that of the relevant health board's director of public health, Eligibility for the services proposed does not therefore require a determination by a court or by the compensation tribunal.  There may be individuals who, for reasons best known to themselves, might not make a claim to the courts or to the compensation tribunal but who will still be eligible for services to be provided under the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, when enacted.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that a range of services will be provided under the Act and preliminary discussions have already taken place with some of the relevant bodies. Detailed negotiations cannot commence until the necessary legislation is in place. As soon as the Bill has passed all stages in both Houses, I hope to finalise discussions with the health boards and negotiations with the appropriate professional groups to ensure that the services to be provided under the Act for persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C will be available to them at an early date.</P>
    <P>In December 1995, when I announced the health care package for persons who have contracted hepatitis C, I also indicated that I would establish a statutory consultative council to advise me on matters relating to hepatitis C.  A draft establishment order was circulated to interested groups and I am currently considering a number of amendments to take into account the views expressed by them.  I will again consult with the interested groups at an early date and following such consultation will formally establish the council.  I hope to complete this process as soon as possible.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No. <Col N="1316" /> There is a certain amount of contention about the tribunal which has been stoked up by unnecessary controversy, much of which was stimulated by the Deputy in this House based on inaccurate information.  Some issues are still outstanding between my negotiators in the Department of Health and representatives of one of the interest groups, Positive Action.  It is not true to say there is a lack of confidence in the tribunal.  To date 63 awards have been made fairly and efficiently and, more importantly, no award has been rejected.  That means applicants, with their legal advisers, had enough confidence in the tribunal not only to process their cases through it but to accept the awards in all cases.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Obviously I would have to go back on records, but the figure is composed of definite numbers for members of Positive Action, that is the cohort of women infected by anti-D product, definite numbers for members of the Haemophiliac Association of Ireland and definite numbers for the Irish Kidney Association.  The variable includes people infected by blood rather than blood product.  We are involved in a look-back programme and a national screening programme, which is continuing. That is the source of the 1,600 cases mentioned in the Deputy's question.  To date the actual number is that which I have given, and that will increase as <Col N="1317" /> tracking and national screening continues. It is our view that the final number is nearer to 1,400 than 1,600.  For three cohorts of people we have definite figures and there is a variable in respect of persons infected by blood rather than blood product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for confirming that he and the Department know who the 1,356 persons are.  Why has it cost almost £1,000 of taxpayers' money per application by way of advertising by the State in national newspapers to target persons, who are already known to the Minister, to apply to a tribunal in which the Minister maintains they have confidence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I regard this as a very serious matter.  It is one of the most serious issues of compensation in which the State has been involved for a considerable time and it involves enormous amounts of money.  While we have very good relationships with the interest groups, it is not sufficient to deal with interest groups alone.  Every individual person with hepatitis C or hepatitis C antibodies has individual rights, and not only is there a legal obligation on me but there is a moral responsibility on me to do everything in my power to ensure those people are aware that there is a tribunal in existence through which they may process their claims.  I am reinforcing that opinion because only 652 applications have been made to date out of a cohort of about 1,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 400 people communicated by way of initial solicitors' letters which they issued to protect their own position, but there is huge duplication between those and the 652 applications made to the tribunal &mdash; those figures have not been cross-matched.  There are 1,000 people from whom we have not heard.  We have received communication from 652 people plus the number not duplicated, perhaps another 200, and the number of statements of claim before the court is less than 20.  There are about 600 people who for one <Col N="1318" /> reason or other have not communicated with the Department of Health or the Blood Transfusion Service Board by way of initial solicitor's letter indicating that they demand compensation, and who have not applied to the tribunal.  In those circumstances I make no apology for spending money in bringing their rights to people's attention.  There is a missing cohort at present and I hope we will receive applications from them in the next fortnight.</P>
    <P>Unless there are deadlines, some solicitors will not complete the paperwork, and the fact that there is a deadline will ensure the paperwork is completed.  We have made it very clear both in the <i>Solicitors Gazette</i> and in the modified advertisements that a completed application form will be sufficient to meet the deadline and that the supporting documentary evidence can be sent in subsequently. There is no change in procedure; that has been the procedure since the tribunal was set up.  We felt it was necessary to advertise that fact because we received many inquiries about whether a completed application form without supporting documentation would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>When application forms come in the people in charge of the tribunal, the registrar or secretary to the tribunal, give dates for hearings.  A person would need to have sent in their case in writing six weeks before the date of hearing. This is a contentious issue and I do not mind Deputies taking a political run at me on it, but it is not in the interests of women with hepatitis C or hepatitis C antibodies to be discouraged from applying to the tribunal.  It is not in their interests for me to change the date.  At the rate applications are being processed, there are already sufficient applications before the tribunal to last until the end of 1997.</P>
    <P>No injustice will be done to anybody who wants to wait to see what happens in the court case on 8 October.  If that case lasts until Christmas it will still be 12 months from a hearing before the tribunal. If an application has been made to the tribunal it may be withdrawn and <Col N="1319" /> the person may proceed through the courts.  If they proceed through the tribunal and an award is made, having considered the award for four weeks they may say that because they are not satisfied with the award they wish to proceed through the court.</P>
    <P>The campaign being conducted to get me to extend the date of 17 June is not in the interests of individual applicants who believe the charges being made. The Deputy is ensuring that the people she purports to represent will go to the end of a very long queue.  I have no doubt that she will then be back next year asking me to appoint extra personnel to the tribunal so that people will get an early hearing.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware of the joint Government-ICTU statement of 15 May in which they outlined their commitment to meet, in partnership, the substantial changes in the public service and to achieve the necessary restructuring in a positive and constructive way. This statement arose from a series of discussions which were held in the light of public service pay negotiations and the continued failure of a number of groups to reach agreement on restructuring under clause 2 (iii) (a) of the public service agreement on pay, incorporated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The statement also outlined the development of a framework aimed at achieving the continuation and successful completion of a number of outstanding sets of discussions.

    <P>Over the past two days discussions have taken place with the nursing unions aimed at resolving, within the framework, the problems arising from the recently rejected offer.  Progress has been made in these discussions and arrangements for a resolution have been identified.  I hope the matter will be progressed further in the coming days.</P>
    <P>Given the delicate balance to be struck in these negotiations, the Deputy will appreciate that any more detailed comments or statement by me would not be appropriate or helpful in bringing the talks to a successful conclusion at this stage.</P>

Is the Minister aware that previously during threats of industrial action, emergency cover was guaranteed in each hospital on the basis that those who provided it were paid or got time in lieu but that on this occasion the managements of hospitals have already indicated to nurses that neither pay, nor time in lieu, will be given for emergency cover?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I refer the Deputy to paragraph 2 of the Joint Government-ICTU statement issued last night which says that discussions have taken place with the nursing unions aimed at resolving, within the framework, the problems arising <Col N="1322" /> from the recently rejected offer, that progress has been made in these discussions and arrangements for doing so have been identified.  The nursing union leadership is in the process of consultation today.  What the Deputy said is, in general terms, in accordance with the framework I announced in the Dáil on the Adjournment some weeks ago.  The new framework being put in place will involve an adjudication process of some items and a review process of others.  I gave more detail in my reply on the Adjournment and the Deputy should check it.  It is difficult to see this problem being resolved without a modification and enhancement of the original package which was rejected by way of ballot.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Drug misuse is a country-wide problem while heroin addiction is confined largely to the Dublin area.  Treatment services for heroin addicts are currently provided by the Eastern Health Board at its centres at Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and Amiens Street.  Such services include methadone maintenance, counselling, <Col N="1324" /> HIV testing and free condoms.  A similar range of services is provided by the drug treatment centre in Trinity Court, Pearse Street.  Approximately 700 patients are on methadone maintenance programmes at these four centres and a further 700 patients are on methadone maintenance with general practitioners in the Dublin area.  Approximately 720 patients are on the waiting lists at the Eastern Health Board centres and Trinity Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To address the problem posed by drug misuse the Government decided, on 20 February last, on the implementation of a range of measures aimed at reducing the demand for drugs.  These measures included the following: (a) that no steps should be taken to legalise or decriminalise the use of so-called &ldquo;soft drugs&rdquo; such as cannabis; (b) there should be further development of education and prevention programmes in conjunction with the Department of Education and other relevant agencies; this will include the development of a multi-media awareness and prevention campaign, a programme aimed specifically at deprived areas and the other educational programmes outlined in the Department of Education Action Plan; (c) a task force under the aegis of the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development will examine the root social factors which give rise to drug misuse in the Dublin inner city area, recommend how best local community groups can be harnessed to prevent misuse and how partnership arrangements with parents on prevention strategies should be structured; (d) new management and evaluation procedures should be put in place for the services of the Eastern Health Board area, these procedures should be ongoing and directed to examine best international practice for application in Ireland; (e) treatment programmes should continue to be developed and have as their objective in the short-term control of the drug misuser's addiction within the context of the long-term aim of a return of the drug misuser to a <Col N="1325" /> drug-free lifestyle.  Methadone maintenance programmes should continue as a valid and successful element in treatment services and the role of general practitioners in providing this service is to be strengthened; (f) the Eastern Health Board Regional Co-ordinating Committee is to make proposals on the provision of appropriate services for persons who smoke heroin; (g) adequate detoxification programmes are to be developed and health boards are to be responsible for the development of appropriate counselling, treatment and rehabilitation programmes, including those provided by voluntary bodies and therapeutic communities, to lead to a drug-free lifestyle; (h) local co-ordination committees representing all local interests should be established at health board level to develop and monitor education and prevention measures and service provision and the demand reduction sub-committee of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse should largely comprise representatives from these local committees; (i) a new unit is to be established to ensure that all businesses involved with controlled drugs comply fully with the terms of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; (j) liaison arrangements between the health services and the prison services should be put in place to ensure that co-ordinated treatment regimes for prisoners are in place.  It is further agreed that the National Co-ordinating Committee be given specific responsibility to achieve maximum co-ordination; and (k) there should be a greater emphasis on providing basic information on the extent and type of drug misuse and more research should be undertaken as to best approaches to demand reduction services. An extra £3.5 million is being made available this year towards implementation of these measures.</P>
    <P>Arising from the decisions each health board was requested to prepare a plan in respect of its area which would provide an effective response to the <Col N="1326" /> problem.  These plans are being finalised at present and the Eastern Health Board has produced proposals which will involve a major development of its existing services in Dublin.  The proposals which are being implemented at present will result in the provision of an additional 1,100 places for methadone treatment for drug misusers by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>The board will also improve the range of other services available by increasing the number of in-patient detoxification beds available, allowing for more outpatient detoxification, extending the number of rehabilitation places, providing early intervention programmes for young heroin smokers, establishing a telephone helpline and organising parenting programmes for drug using parents in the north and south inner city.  I am confident that with the implementation of these proposals significant progress can be made in reaching the vast majority of drug misusers currently in need of services.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to be precise about the amount of funding allocated to drug treatment but it is estimated that a sum in excess of £13 million was expended in 1995.  This included services for HIV-AIDS because our HIV-AIDS and drug treatment strategies are closely interlinked.  This would not include out-patient and in-patient treatment provided at general and psychiatric hospitals or services provided by general practitioners as part of overall patient care.</P>

      <P>It was announced yesterday that the methadone maintenance treatment programme was to be extended to treat up to a total of 2,500 addicts to the end of this year.  I welcome the Minister's acknowledgment that there are other aspects to the Government's proposals in this respect, but does he agree that methadone maintenance represents a substantial plank of <Col N="1327" /> the Government's response to the growing drugs crisis?  While such programmes are accepted as being a beneficial aspect of treatment of destabilised, chaotic drug abusers, does he agree there is need to question whether there should not be a parallel allocation of resources and support for a drug-free therapeutic recovery programme such as that run by the Coolmine and Rutland Centres?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Heroin addiction is very difficult to overcome. The ideal solution is a series of strategies which would restore heroin addicts to a drug-free lifestyle.  That option is now available, with 25 detoxification beds available in Dublin between Beaumont and Cherry Orchard Hospitals.  That is a significantly greater number of beds, for example, than would be provided in, say, Manchester, which has a larger population and a greater heroin problem, and where we understand they are coping well with the problem.  I am concerned about the repeated use of detoxification beds by the same addicts, but it is a very difficult problem.  While methadone maintenance is not an ideal solution, a person on methadone rather than on heroin remains alive, tends to be a better family person, whose wife and children very quickly reap the benefits of his stabilisation.  People can move from methadone treatment to detoxification and quit taking drugs.  A methadone maintenance programme along the lines of that now available will have major social effects.  If we are to believe the claims that a great deal of crime in Dublin is driven by addicts endeavouring to buy heroin, and addicts are provided with methadone free of charge, it is quite clear there will be a major reduction in crime.  We have not yet solved the overall problem and there are some 1,400 people on methadone treatment programmes.  Our best estimate is that just over 700 more people would use the facility and we are in the <Col N="1328" /> course of providing more than 1,000 places.</P>
      <P>What we have done already in Kilbarrack is proving successful.  Deputies will be aware of the difficulties of having methadone clinics accepted by local communities but, in Kilbarrack, health board property is being used and local general practitioners are being invited to dispense the drug.  The clinic in Ballymun has been established and has been dispensing for the past three or four weeks.  In a number of locations around Dublin methadone programmes are having an impact.  When addicts are stabilised at clinics they should move on to general practitioners, a significant number of whom are now taking on a small number of addicts.  I hope we can make significant progress with this development.</P>
      <P>A Government decision on a methadone maintenance programme was taken in February last.  We are now in the final stages of a recruitment selection competition for a programme manager for the Eastern Health Board whose job it will be to drive these decisions within the Eastern Health Board area.  It will be a full-time job to drive and implement this programme.  I must stress that I am dealing with the demand side; the supply side is another day's work.</P>

      <P>The Minister accepts that the overall objective is to attain the recovery of the addict in addition to protecting the community to whom addicts might be a danger.  Has there been an analysis of the success rate of methadone maintenance programmes in terms of addict recovery compared with that of the Coolmine drug-free recovery treatment with a 40 per cent success rate?  Has any cost analysis been undertaken of the relative cost of providing an open-ended methadone maintenance service for a huge number of people compared with providing a drug-free, therapeutic residential care option? Only 70 places are available in Coolmine with another 50 in the Rutland <Col N="1329" /> Centre.  Has any analysis been undertaken of the cost and success rate of both therapies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have no information to date on the relative cost but we have established a co-ordinating committee which will continuously examine issues such as those raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Take an example of an addiction such as alcoholism.  Many Members would be more aware of alcoholics than of drug addicts and of how difficult it is for an alcoholic to stop drinking, even when he participates in a residential course.  Various institutions claim very high success rates, but it depends on how one defines such success rates.  I will not criticise the work being undertaken by any individual or institution.  The heroin problem is an extremely difficult one to tackle and the Coolmine people do a very good job.  What they do is not capable of being applied on a widespread basis but I hope they will continue their work.</P>
      <P>The methadone treatment was successful in other European cities when they were at about the same point as we are now with the heroin problem.  It certainly stabilises people and allows the possibility of initiatives leading to a drug-free lifestyle.  That is the way I foresee the resolution of the problem developing.</P>
      <P>I will be grateful for any advice because this is a very serious problem. When I came to terms with the level of the problem in Dublin, it became quite clear to me that nothing had been done in Dublin for years to combat this problem in terms of the demand side.  Effectively this means we are kick-starting programmes in Dublin, for which nobody had taken political responsibility, for quite a while.  I am not talking about the supply side, the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners, but about a Minister for Health taking responsibility for reducing demand.  It is a major problem but we are making some progress in its resolution.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister does not have figures for or an evaluation of the success rate of methadone maintenance programmes either here or abroad.  That would be very useful, if they are to be a main plank of the Government's response to this problem, particularly since we have clear figures for the success rate of our drug-free therapeutic programmes.  Will the Minister agree to have some research undertaken in his Department on the success of methadone maintenance programmes? Furthermore, does he accept that, in the main, methadone maintenance, represents an official recognition and acceptance of managed drug dependence? Does he accept that, in the long-term, it might be appropriate for us to consider the drug-free therapeutic response, particularly in the case of young addicts?  It is not socially acceptable merely to write off large numbers of young people to managed drug dependence, and the therapeutic response must be considered in parallel.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> While those are comments with which most of us could agree, they are appropriate to an ideal world and inner city Dublin does not represent an ideal world. Indeed it is not so long ago that the parents, brothers and sisters of persons who had died from heroin overdose marched on this House seeking action and someone to take responsibility and provide methadone treatment for their children. We are now doing that.  All this is a reflection of what is ideal is peace time talk, but we are now at war with drugs and people should put themselves on a war footing.  While comparative statistics between one strategy being implemented in, say, Amsterdam, against another in Glasgow would be very interesting, our present priority is to start moving a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; agenda forward.

I realise that only a minority will arrive at that destination and many will stay on methadone for quite a long time.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary concern as Minister of State with special responsibility for child care is to ensure that the legislative and service infrastructure is adequate to protect the welfare of children.  On my taking office only 17 sections of the Child Care Act had been implemented.  An additional 44 sections have now been implemented.  The remaining 18 sections of the Child Care Act, providing for the registration of residential centres and the regulation and inspection of preschool services, will be implemented this year.  Since 1993 additional funding of the order of £35 million on an annualised basis has been provided to develop child care and family support services.  These developments included the creation of over 900 new posts for child care services.</P>
      <P>While there have been substantial improvements in child care services in recent years, further improvements need to be made.  It is my firm intention to ensure that the legislative infrastructure is adequate to provide protection and promote the welfare of children; services continue to develop and fulfil the legal obligations on health boards to protect children and promote their welfare under the Child Care Act, 1991; and professional standards in child care continue to improve and there is ongoing monitoring and review of these standards.</P>
      <P>I am currently preparing proposals for Government for the financing of a new child care programme for the period 1997 to 1999.  These proposals will be brought to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties that <Col N="1333" /> have been encountered by health boards in the recruitment of qualified social workers.  Students in Ireland who commenced training for social work after 1990 are eligible for the award of national qualification in social work. There are a number of recognised university courses leading to this qualification. My Department arranged the funding of 20 extra training places in Trinity College and UCD last year.  It is expected that 86 social workers will qualify from the three colleges providing social work training in 1996 and that approximately 300 additional social workers will qualify from Irish colleges between 1997 and 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, the National Validation Body on Social Work Qualifications and Training recently issued a report outlining the criteria governing the validation of non-national qualifications in social work.  This report was accepted by the Minister for Health on 27 March 1996.  The National Validation Body is now proceeding to deal with applications for the validation of non-national qualifications.  I understand that 55 applications from many parts of the world have been processed and recently ratified by the validation body. The combination of increased training places in Irish colleges together with a system for recognising equivalent non-national qualifications will provide health boards with a large pool for the recruitment of highly qualified, professional social workers.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards are preparing a joint response to help victims of past abuse. The health boards intend to take a positive, helpful and co-ordinating role in this area, in consultation and co-operation with relevant voluntary organisations. It is intended that a full counselling and therapeutic service will be provided by the health boards in response to the needs of those who have been abused in the past.  These services will be provided by the adult health care services and will respond to the problems which may emerge such as depression, guilt, addiction, personality <Col N="1334" /> disorders and relationship problems. The health boards are currently finalising the range of measures to be taken in this regard and an announcement in relation to the details of a support and therapeutic service for victims of past abuse will be made in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is an omnibus one.  She referred to the spiralling reports of child abuse cases, the difficulties being encountered in the recruitment of qualified social workers and the plans, if any, I have for co-ordinated and independent counselling services. I gave the Deputy what I thought were good answers to those three specific queries.  In reply to her further supplementary, I repeat that 900 new jobs have been created in the child care area and they relate to all aspects of the child care area.  They include social workers, but also psychologists and other professionals in the health care area.  I have given her a response as to our intentions in the social worker area.  I accept that we have had some difficulties in that respect and I have told her what we intend to do about it.  We have considered the position regarding social <Col N="1335" /> workers up to the turn of the century. We hope that Trinity College will produce 25 social workers in 1997, 25 in 1998 and 30 in 1999, that UCD will produce 30 in 1997, 30 in 1998 and 30 in 1999 and UCC will produce 41, 50 and 40 for those years, giving a total of 96 in 1997, 105 in 1998 and 100 in 1999.  I am confident that the increase in the number of trained social workers in our jurisdiction, combined with the measures we are taking to attract social workers from other areas, including Northern Ireland and Britain, will be sufficient to provide the required number of social workers to deal with our child care problem.</P>

He and I participated in a radio programme some weeks ago in which the Minister very warmly embraced a helpline which had been set up in Dublin in response to a substantial number of child abuse cases in which adults are now trying to come to terms with the abuse they suffered. Will the Minister state how many counsellors are available to the helpline and whether there is a limit on the number of counselling services provided?  Does he feel that there should be a limit on the number of counselling sessions available to an adult victim of child abuse, whether physical or sexual?  Does he know whether contracts have been given to counsellors involved in the helpline?  Does he feel that an adult victim of child abuse who rang a helpline on 26 February last and was told she would be contacted by return and who has yet to be contacted by the helpline has received adequate support?</P>

      <P>I find it surprising, considering the number of specific questions which the Deputy asked in her original question to which she received replies, that she should now be attempting to interrogate me on matters <Col N="1336" /> to which she did not refer in her original question.  She is going too far when she asks me a question about a specific telephone call which she alleges was not replied to.  All I can say in relation to that question is that I will make the necessary inquiries if she supplies me with the information necessary for me to do so.  I will not judge a service by its handling of one specific matter.</P>
      <P>I would have thought the Deputy would take the opportunity to welcome the announcement which I made in relation to the intentions of the chief executive officers of the health board and the response which they are preparing to help victims of past abuse.  I repeat, it is intended that a full counselling and therapeutic service will be provided by the health boards in response to the needs of those who have been abused in the past.  The adult healthcare service will respond to any of the problems which emerge.  I would have thought she might have acknowledged that this was a positive development.</P>

      <P>I welcome that the health boards are to set up a support and therapeutic service. That is positive and helpful.  In view of the huge demands on health boards throughout the country, and the recognised lack of funding for everything they want to do, could the Minister say whether he or the health boards considered requesting monetary and financial support from, for example, religious orders and others where such abuse might have taken place in the past?  Some of these orders have set up various counselling services but do not seem to have got the response that one would like to see.</P>

      <P>I have already informed the Deputy that I am in the process of drawing up a childcare plan for the years 1996 to 1999 and the demands of counselling are part of that plan.  In reply to her second question, whether we have given consideration to asking for financial assistance from religious orders, I have not paid particular attention to that matter.  I have been aware of the very considerable demands imposed on some of these organisations, religious and others, in recent times because of the number of reports that have come in and the changing attitude in society to things that happened in the past.  I felt it was necessary to give some consideration to assistance to organisations which wanted to help in a greater way.</P>
      <P>In relation to the future and the plan being prepared for the next three or four years, these matters will be given consideration and constructive suggestions will be welcomed.</P>

      <P>Additional funding of £12 million has been made available in 1996 for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This includes £6 million revenue funding, of which £3 million is being provided to meet the 1996 cost of additional services which were put in place in 1995.  The remaining £3 million revenue funding provided will facilitate the provision of an additional 66 residential-respite places and 265 day care places as well as home support services this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital funding of £6 million is being provided, of which £2 million will be used to support general service developments. The remaining £2 million will <Col N="1338" /> be used to develop and improve the quality of training facilities for persons with a mental handicap under the European Regional Development Fund Assisted Programme.  Some £2 million capital funding has also been made available to the Eastern Health Board in respect of the provision of additional residential facilities.  This funding is being made available over a two year period with £1 million available in 1996 and a further £1 million at the beginning of 1997.</P>
    <P>This funding will provide additional residential facilities on the southside of Dublin and will also facilitate the on-going programme of transferring persons with a mental handicap from St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, to more appropriate care settings.  I am also aware of the need for capital funding to continue the on-going maintenance and refurbishment programme in St. Ita's and additional capital funding will be made available in 1996 to enable the Eastern Health Board to continue this work.  As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £44.58 million was invested in the services in the period 1990-1995 which has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services. However, I am aware that more needs to be done.  The Government is committed under both the Health Strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the service as resources become available.  That commitment is reflected in my decision, with my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, to prepare a five year service development plan to meet the needs identified by the new National Handicap Database.  I expect the plan to <Col N="1339" /> be ready later this year when the database becomes available.  This development plan will play an important role in the Estimates discussions later this year with a view to having substantial additional funding made available in 1997 and future years for the continued development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Consequently I do not intend to provide a Supplementary Estimate in 1996 for services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>

I would ask the Deputy to acknowledge that, with the national database completed and a five-year plan in place by the time the Estimates cycle comes into full swing, this is the first time a comprehensive census has been done to make an important distinction between present and future needs.  There is also duplication in relation to waiting lists and work on these is in hand at the moment.

It is the regional co-ordinating committee that decides on priorities within the health board area.  The health boards decide priorities in the context of available extra funding.  The allocation for this year has been made to the Western Health Board.  I have already answered the question about whether a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced.  The database will identify black spots in terms of service provision and help health boards and the Department of Health to focus on priority needs.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Elective admissions have had to be cancelled at times due to an upsurge in the numbers of people seeking in-patient beds admitted through the accident and emergency department.  This has been a feature of the acute hospital services over the past few years.  Casualty admissions by their very nature are unplanned, and while some admissions through the accident and emergency department can be anticipated, it is not possible to predict when the peaks and valleys will occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> While full figures are not readily available on a national basis, indications are that no more than one to two per cent of admissions to hospitals nationally would have been cancelled because of non-availability of beds in 1995.  This figure would be much the same as in 1993 and 1994.</P>
    <P>The hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly over the winter period, in the past number of years.  This is not a problem confined to Ireland but is a feature in other developed countries also.  The causes of the problems which arise have been well documented.  The ageing of our population has contributed to the difficulties in accident and emergency departments. The winter period brings its own set of problems for our elderly population. This in turn can lead to an upsurge in the number of patients present in accident and emergency departments requiring admission to hospital.  Many elderly patients require acute hospital care initially but much of their recovery period could be spent in step-down sub-acute accommodation.</P>
    <P>The shortage of sub-acute beds, particularly in Dublin, has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers, and quickly enough, to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.  This in turn has led to the cancellation of elective admissions to hospitals at times, medical priority being the determining factor. There is nothing new in this.  This has been the position for quite some time and has faced successive Ministers for Health.</P>
    <P>The successful management of the accident and emergency difficulties includes tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and services provided by the acute hospitals which, when taken together, provide a comprehensive and integrated response. I have set out in written replies to Deputy Callely on 8 February 1996 and on 13 March 1996 measures which I <Col N="1343" /> took to tackle the accident and emergency difficulties during the winter of 1995-96.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that any elective admission to acute hospitals should have to be cancelled and I am confident that the measures recently put in place will reduce the need for such cancellations. In cases where elective admissions are cancelled I understand that hospitals endeavour to reschedule these patients for admission as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  However, I asked him for the total numbers.  I hope he will be able to supply them to me at a later date if he does not have them now.  The Minister indicated that problems were due to peaks and valleys which were unpredictable. He also referred to seasonal aspects, particularly winter time and the problems this brings in the context of the elderly.  There are several issues relating to this question which I would like to touch on.  One is whether there is a clear pattern relating to demands on beds in hospitals.  Am I right in saying there is usually a greater demand during the winter months?  I understand there are insufficient hospital beds to meet the requirements in the Dublin area &mdash; as the Minister has indicated, I have tabled questions on this matter in the past &mdash; and this is leading to serious difficulties in accident and emergency departments and in relation to elective procedures.  Care of the elderly is also a serious problem.  I accept there are recurring difficulties but does the Minister have proposals to address the issues?  Surely he will have innovative remedial ways to address this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the late father of Deputy Burke, a respected colleague of Deputy Callelly, once said, &ldquo;strange things are happening in our times&rdquo;.  There is not a contradiction between what I said about accident and emergency admissions to hospital causing disruption and at the same time older people putting pressure on services during the winter months.  If an accident occurs in the greater Dublin area and 12 or 15 people with multiple injuries are taken to the Mater Hospital, consultant staff will have to be drawn down to deal with the crisis and there is a possibility that elective surgery scheduled for that day will be cancelled.  The policy is to reschedule it as quickly as possible.  It is not possible to avoid that and to staff against that eventuality. That superimposed on seasonal difficulties gives us a picture of the difficulties to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
      <P>The population is ageing and as the number of people over 65 years of age increases there will be a greater need for health services for the elderly.  Many elderly go to accident and emergency units as their first encounter with the health services, others go to their GPs who will seek to have them admitted to hospital.  I am not saying that elderly people do not need acute hospital beds during the winter months but their condition can be stabilised very quickly, in a matter of seven or eight days.  However, they may need a further week because they may not be quite fit to go home. They do not need the services of an acute hospital but there is no step-down facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we addressed this problem and the Deputy will be aware that 200 <Col N="1345" /> sub-acute beds were provided in Dublin. Together with better scheduling and ensuring that accident and emergency is a consultant driven service, with better bed management and more movement from acute hospitals to sub-acute services and with the provision of a dedicated unit for the chronically ill young who are inappropriately maintained in hospital year in year out in acute beds, we brought about a situation where patients were no longer on trolleys in hospital corridors and there were not major problems in accident and emergency units in major Dublin hospitals last year.  It went close to the brink on a couple of occasions because it is a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that hospitals were not under pressure but there were strategies put in place last year which improved the situation dramatically throughout the country, with the exception of Galway.  University College Hospital Galway seems to have a particular set of problems.  Officials from my Department have been in consultation with the Western Health Board to see if some of the strategies which were applied in Dublin would be appropriate for Galway.  We are evaluating that with a view to applying them in Galway.</P>
    <P>I gave the Deputy the percentage of total admissions.  The answer to his final supplementary question is between 1 and 2 per cent of that.  If I can get the figure I will communicate with the Deputy later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is very hard to be definitive.  If you ask the patient's opinion he will certainly believe that he should be in Beaumont or the Mater.  A GP or relative may think he should be there as well but a consultant will be aware that somebody in greater need needs to be admitted <Col N="1346" /> and may believe the person should be allocated a bed in a sub-acute unit or a nursing home.  Starting in mid summer last year we examined the situation and it transpired that better managed hospitals had shorter patient stays for treating similar conditions.  We were trying to put best practice in place.  It is an increasingly litigious society.  What happens in practice is that a junior hospital doctor on accident and emergency duty late at night will tend to admit rather than to send a person home, whereas a consultant is more likely to admit people whom he or she considers to be in need of admission and may send others home advising them on appropriate action.  In a pilot scheme at St. James's Hospital we brought senior GPs into the accident and emergency department and found that because they had more experience than the junior doctors admissions were reduced considerably because there were fewer inappropriate admissions.</P>
      <P>In my view there is no one strategy which will alleviate the problems in accident and emergency departments but a series of initiatives tried in Dublin last year proved effective.  I am not saying we will not have difficulties next year but we will be trying out other initiatives and doing more of the same.  One bout of flu among older people could have all accident and emergency services in the major Dublin hospitals and all around the country in great difficulty over a period.  Before Deputy Harney took steps to eliminate the Dublin smog problem people were admitted to hospital not only in January and February but in November with pneumonia, asthma and problems that were smog related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have a very good idea of the problem but it is difficult to put a figure on how many people are in inappropriate beds in hospital.  Chronically ill young people need to be in dedicated units.  If a young person who has had an accident is in a coma for years on end he or she is better off in a unit with dedicated staff and there is a movement in that direction.  We did it in Dublin last <Col N="1347" /> year and we are trying to extend it to other parts of the country.  Some specific patients are in the wrong place and would be better looked after elsewhere. It would be to everyone's advantage if they were moved to more suitable accommodation as this would lead to the full use of acute beds in acute hospitals.  In other cases it is a question of medical opinion as to whether an older person should be discharged from hospital after eight days or 12 days. Doctors differ but we try to keep moving forward.  We have pinpointed one of the major difficulties and we need to plan in the summer to make sure that we will not be very hard hit in the winter.</P>

The output of hospitals is more important now, whether from the day care side or the end patient side.  If we created another 500 beds in Dublin or throughout the country they would be filled.  However, that does not mean they are necessary.  There are mismatches in different parts of the country. Extra beds are probably required in some areas but there are probably more beds than are necessary in others, which will always be filled.  This might change as the extended family becomes more of a rarity and people rush to put aged relatives into care.  However, if beds are free they will be filled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House are uneasy with this legislation which seeks to enforce a resolution of the dispute.  The Minister said the Bill was one which she had hoped would not be necessary.  We all hoped it would not be necessary to legislate to resolve the dispute.  The basic structures of all Garda representative associations have been subject to legislation in the past.  The purpose of this Bill is not to deal with the detail of setting up one body but to pull together dissenting groups which should have been able to resolve their differences.  It is regrettable that we have to legislate for that because legislation should be effective and useful in copperfastening agreement, not forcing the sides together.  We hope the legislation will serve as a conduit to bring the sides together even at this late stage so that they can agree on the various aspects still outstanding.</P>
      <P>The public is baffled by this Bill and by the dispute.  This is a complex trade union matter in so far as the Garda can have a trade union.  The public regards it as a minor skirmish which is irrelevant or unnecessary in the context of the major battle against criminals.  Nevertheless, it is wrong to dismiss their disagreement as irrelevant.  It is vitally important for the Garda to have a representative body to negotiate pay and working conditions.  This need cannot be minimised or dismissed as unimportant even if it is set against a background of public concern at crime levels and the need and ability of the Garda to adequately combat that.  If we expect a good performance from the men and women of the force, they should have agreed negotiation routes to negotiate pay and conditions, pensions, rotas and their day to day concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a lapse of the traditional discipline and loyalty <Col N="1462" /> to the Government.  This is not a good thing.  No Government could operate successfully with the degree of disloyalty which has been evident by leaks and so on.  This is not related so much to the dispute as to an ongoing transitionary period for the force.  We have entered a new era of openness, transparency, and accountability into which the force has to move.  It is going through a period of change.</P>
    <P>I have discussed with the Minister my concerns about the level of accountability that it has been possible to achieve for the operations of the force to the Dáil through her.  Accountability is not just a trendy slogan which everybody uses, it is important that all the organs of State, including the forces of law and order, are accountable to the people via the Minister and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In operational matters there is a democratic deficit.  I do not know how we can overcome this, but debate in this House is paralysed because of the Minister's seeming immunity from debate. Each time an operational matter gives rise to concern, for example, the Brinks Allied raid, the Lansdowne Road riot, the Urlingford drugs seizure, the Duncan extradition case or the general deployment of Garda resources in the face of the drugs crisis and in dealing with vigilantism, the Minister seems to be obliged to say that it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  While this may be true, the Garda Commissioner is not accountable to the Dáil except through the Minister.  When things go wrong and there is public concern about an operational matter there is a democratic deficit.</P>
    <P>While I accept that all operational matters cannot be scrutinised in detail by the Minister and any undue political interference would not be helpful we have to improve on the current accountability structures.</P>
    <P>All has not been well between the Executive and the police force.  There was stark evidence of this recently when it took six weeks for the Minister and the Government to be fully informed that the fault for a failed extradition <Col N="1463" /> attempt lay on the Irish side despite media briefings to the contrary and the tabling of questions in the usual way to find out what happened.  The Minister has expressed her unhappiness at this state of affairs.  I agree with her, but have matters progressed since then? Has this been translated into an improvement of the accountability structures between senior Garda management and her office?</P>
    <P>While the Minister can, given the status quo, wash her hands of operational matters which are in the hands of the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The balance has been tipped too far in the other direction. The same defence cannot be used by the Minister when it comes to discussing responsibility for political matters, such as the bringing forward of proposals on bail, prison reform and the provision of more spaces.  Although promised and mooted by the Government since taking office there is seeming disagreement within the Cabinet on these issues.  Time is passing by and people are beginning to wonder if the law of bail will be reformed whether by way of a referendum or legislation.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in a wide-ranging speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Culligan, called, <i>inter alia,</i> for a wider debate on the changing role of the force.  I agree with everything he said.  Where I am coming from any debate would be useful. It is a pity that he chose to debate the issues in front of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce rather than in a committee of the House.  Has he made his interesting views on the challenges facing the force known to the Minister and submitted any proposals?  Will the Minister respond to his considered comments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner made a valid point when he referred to an undermining of the cultural consensus on which the force used to operate. I believe he is referring to the difficulty of policing in that on the one hand there are people who seek vengenance against the disrupters of domestic peace, while on the other there are those who believe the criminal is society's true victim. Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.  In other words, the worthy analysis of the root causes of crime should not suspend the delivery of law and order.</P>
      <P>I wonder if I will be the only person to respond to the Commissioner's call for a debate.  Who is the Commissioner speaking to when he calls for a debate? I hope he is speaking to the Minister and I hope the Minister will respond to the proposals he made in the speech yesterday, otherwise it will be an inconclusive dialogue of the deaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is an attempt by this Minister, and a culmination of the <Col N="1467" /> previous Minister's attempt, to resolve the ongoing row between members of the Garda Síochána holding the rank of garda.  The Minister gave a helpful chronology of the row and of efforts to mediate in it in her contribution today. Essentially there are three factions involved in this dispute: the GRA, which is the original organisation &mdash; the establishment; the Garda Federation, established in July 1994 in the aftermath of the GRA conference being abandoned as a result of failure to agree on standing orders; and the 1,000 members of the Louth-Meath, Cavan-Monaghan, Cork West and Tipperary divisions of the GRA, who are still members of that organisation but who have stopped sending members to meetings of the Central Executive Committee of the GRA.</P>
    <P>Attempts by the Garda Commissioner, the Minister and her predecessor, Kieran Mulvey, in a personal capacity, and John Horgan have failed to resolve the dispute.  As recently as 22 May federation members were quoted as saying they would never go back to the GRA.</P>
    <P>The legislative solution proposed by the Minister is to amend section 13 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924 to provide that each rank of the Garda Síochána shall have only one representative association.  Previously, more than one association was allowed.  The sting in only allowing one association is that under subsection (3), a member of the Garda Síochána cannot belong to an association which has as its aim the influence of pay, pensions and conditions other than one established under section 13 of the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of this Bill provides that the association established for the rank of garda &ldquo;... shall have the support of such majority of the membership of that rank as satisfies the Minister that, in matters which concern that rank as a whole, the association can speak and make agreements on behalf of that rank <Col N="1468" /> as a whole&rdquo;.  If an association established for the rank of garda in accordance with section 13 (1) of the 1924 Act does not comply with the above requirement or any other requirement of the Garda Síochána Acts, 1923-96 or regulations thereunder, the Minister may give the association 30 days' notice and, at the end of 30 days, make an order to the effect that the association is no longer an association established under section 13 (1) of the 1924 Act.  This will have the consequences that it will be unlawful for a garda to be a member of the association.</P>
    <P>Three issues arise from this approach. How will the Minister satisfy herself that an association complies with section 2?  What will a ministerial order achieve?  There are other aspects which have been mooted by one side of the dispute, the federation, in regard to the possible unconstitutionality of the Act. On balance I believe the Act is probably constitutional in the overall interests of having one Garda representative association.</P>
    <P>Section 2 does not give a precise formula for the type of majority required. For example, is it to be 50 per cent plus one or 75 per cent?  It states that it should be &ldquo;such majority ... as satisfies the Minister that, in matters which concern the rank as a whole, the association can speak and make agreements on behalf of that rank as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a matter of plain English, it might be argued that the only association which can represent the rank of garda as a whole is one which has the support of every garda.  What counts here, however, is the &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo; of the Minister.  There are no indications in the Act as to how the Minister is to be satisfied on that point.  She might indicate, when replying to the debate, the criterion she proposes to use.</P>
    <P>Presumably the aim of the Act is to provide a means by which the GRA, under that or some other name, will become the association recognised by the Minister.  Given that the sides are currently hopelessly irreconciled, however, it is probable that any decision <Col N="1469" /> by the Minister that the GRA represents the rank of garda as a whole could be challenged in the courts by the disaffected members unless they have been persuaded otherwise by that time.</P>
    <P>What will a ministerial order achieve? If the Minister is not satisfied that an association established under section 13 (1) can speak for and make agreements for the rank of garda as a whole, she can serve a 30 day notice.  If, at the end of 30 days, she remains unsatisfied on this point she can then make an order to the effect that the association is no longer an association established under section 13 (1) of the 1924 Act. Strictly speaking, the only consequence of that is that it will be unlawful for a garda to be a member of that association.</P>
    <P>What can the Minister do in such circumstances? Will members who are not members of an association established under section 13 (1) of the 1924 Act be disciplined or expelled from the Garda Síochána?  Will the leaders of such an association be charged with the rather archaic offence under section 14 (1) of the 1924 Act of causing &ldquo;disaffection amongst the members of the Garda Síochána&rdquo; or inducing them to commit a breach of discipline with a punishment of up to two years imprisonment and/or a fine?</P>
    <P>Presumably the Minister hopes that when she makes an order, a new association will be formed which will have the support of all sides but there is no guarantee that such a new association will be able to satisfy the Minister that it can speak for the rank of garda as a whole.  Ultimately there may not be any association representing the rank of garda and all gardaí may be acting unlawfully by continuing to be members of their various associations.  One of the major problems with the legislation &mdash; the Minister adverted to this in her contribution &mdash; is that it does nothing to address the situation where there is no association established under section 13 (1) to represent the rank of garda.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Garda Federation are of the opinion that there are <Col N="1470" /> constitutional problems with the Bill and have suggested they will challenge the constitutional validity of the Bill if it is passed.  The relevant Article of the Constitution is Article 40.6.1. (iii) by which the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the right to form associations and unions.  The exercise of that right, however, is made subject to public order, public morality and public interest.  It is on those bases I believe the Bill could survive a constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>In the 1989 case of Aughey v. Ireland, detectives challenged the validity of the current version of section 3 (1) of the 1924 Act.  The Supreme Court ruled that if the areas of pay, pensions or conditions of service &ldquo;became the subject of multi-union or multiassociation agitation or industrial action by members of the Garda Síochána, it would be a matter of grave public concern and public interest, particularly because of the fact that the Garda Síochána is a unitary national police force.  In the light of these considerations, it cannot be said that [the section] is an unreasonable or disproportionate regulation of the right... to form associations and unions&rdquo;.  Accordingly, I believe there is sufficient weight in terms of precedent for the Bill to survive a constitutional challenge by disaffected members.</P>
    <P>The following are a summary of my questions.  What criteria will the Minister use to satisfy herself that an association meets the requirements of section 2?  What will she do about gardaí who are unlawfully members of an organisation not established under section 13 (1) of the 1924 Act as amended by the Bill?  If no association meets the requirements of section 2, what does she propose to do?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated today that she is open to whatever flexibility might be appropriate even at this late stage, and I welcome that.  With regard to the imbalance of the CEC and paragraph 6 of the Schedule, she stated that 26 members are elected from the divisional committees and the current system did <Col N="1471" /> not take the large difference in the number of gardaí in one division compared to another into consideration.  This is particularly acute in the DMA, which, together with Garda Headquarters and the special detective units, represents 48 per cent of garda rank but has only seven representatives on the 26 member CEC.  The proposal in this Bill goes a long way to alleviate that democratic problem which was a bone of contention between the two sides.  It is proposed to eliminate the representation of the training college and to increase by four the representation from the four larger divisions in Dublin.  In the end, the membership of the CEC will increase to 30 and 11 members will represent the DMA.</P>
    <P>The concept of weighted voting, which was also advocated by the Garda Federation and had the support of the Minister in principle earlier this year, has been dropped and that is still a bone of contention.  However, the Minister has gone a long way to meet and respond to the difficulties on representation and the unfairness to the larger divisions in the DMA.</P>
    <P>In the Schedule the Minister introduced changes to bring about greater democracy and fairness to the structures and procedures of the association.  The proposals purport to allow the annual conference to have more of a say and be more in touch with the elected officers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's indication today that she will consider an amendment relating to automatically entitling those who withdrew from the GRA since January 1994 to be deemed members and to participate in the elections. The difficulty is: what will happen in the interim between now and March when the elections will be held?  I note this issue has not been resolved and that is where the trouble will lie immediately following the passage of this Bill.  Perhaps between now and Committee Stage, this Bill, the fact that we are debating it, that matters are moving and the Minister is taking this initiative will <Col N="1472" /> act as a conduit to bring the people together on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined today the series of mediations and arbitrations which have already gone into this dispute to no avail.  Indeed, the two opposing groups have not had a face to face meeting since January of this year.  That indicates they have not really been engaging in meaningful negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Minister has an open mind on anything that might be raised by us in the debate and I hope she will continue to have an open mind with regard to meeting the disaffected persons and parties affected.  The Minister's final word on this is that she will not be deflected from legislating, so it gives a flavour of the ultimate solution which the Minister has adopted.

      <P>I note the Minister has not taken sides in this matter and it is important that nobody takes sides because it is a complex area.  My information is based on briefings I have had with the Garda Federation.  Its representatives who present a reasonable case met Opposition Deputies and I am sure they met the Minister also.

      <P>I am at a loss to understand why Deputy O'Donnell should feel there is a democratic deficit in talking about policing in this House.  My impression was rather different.  It seems to me the Progressive Democrats are almost manic in the way they approach policing issues in the House.  I can remember cases in the past year or two where they seemed to regard themselves and this House as some kind of super central detective unit with Deputies Harney and O'Donnell doing a &ldquo;Cagney and Lacey&rdquo; on it.  At other times, they seem to think this is almost like a court with McDowell, Senior Counsel, and O'Donnell, Junior Counsel, prosecuting with great ferocity.  I do not know why she is complaining&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon and I beg the Deputy's pardon also; the thought remains the same.</P>
      <P>I see no difficulty in debating policing matters in this House.  We have had five Bills brought before the House by the present Minister for Justice and two sets of regulations which have given us opportunities to talk about these matters. During all those debates I have not heard any considerations from many sides of the House &mdash; not from the Pogressive Democrats nor from Fianna Fáil &mdash; about policing in general which would in any sense match the kind of things the Garda Commissioner said yesterday and a few weeks ago in a speech to the conference of one of the associations.  These matters richly deserved to be said and I applaud him for saying them.  I see no democratic deficit in discussing policing matters other than one which Deputy O'Donnell has perhaps created in her own mind.  The remarks of the Garda Commissioner yesterday, as reported in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times,</i> are in marked contrast to a very wimpish editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> full of cotton wool, and one suspects it could have been written by a member of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What he said was much more focused on the issues before us than much of the comment we hear in this House and outside on issues of policing. One of the matters to which the Commissioner drew attention was the problem of exaggeration and hyperbole of crime reporting in newspapers.  That is a fair comment.  Not long ago the Minister of State.  Deputy Rabbitte, stopped the Fianna Fáil spokesman in his tracks by asking him exactly what he meant by some of the comments he <Col N="1475" /> made about levels of crime.  I had a conversation with a constituent some months ago after some murders had taken place.  The lady asked what the country was coming to, and said you could not walk down any street but you would find the whole country was awash with murderers.  I asked her when was the last time she had met a murderer on a street corner in Naas.  The looseness of the language that people sometimes use, diverts attention from the real issues we should deal with in terms of policing.  Much of the debate we have misses the central point.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner devoted a fair chunk of his speech yesterday to comparing the situation in regard to reported crime in the city of Dublin and in Ireland generally with other places across the water that have a relatively similar population level.  He said, I think we all know it from observation, that in the city of Dublin and in the country generally, crime levels are less than in many places with a comparable population that immediately adjoin us. People are safer here than in a great many other places with similar population levels.  Opposition Deputies will be getting ready to jump and accuse me of complacency, which I am not.</P>
      <P>If we are to deal with the crime problem properly we must recognise it for what it is and not create a monster that does not exist.  Creating a monster that does not exist is often a substitute for thinking about the ferocious beast on our doorstep that does not exist and that we have to deal with.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner said other interesting things too.  He said &mdash; this is the version of his speech printed in <i>The Irish Times</i> and if it is inaccurate I will have to apologise to him for using a second hand source:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Challenges to authority of all kinds permeated society, and police problems were exacerbated further by a lack of understanding of the relationship between authority and the citizen <Col N="1476" /> in a multi-cultural, multi-national world.</P>
    <P>That is a fair point and it is particularly fair in the context of the Bill.  Later he went on to say:</P>
    <P>Reaffirming the neighbourhood as the key area where gardaí, local population and other public agencies meet and form an effective mesh of wisdom, discretion and skills will be one of the essential parts of work in the next decade.</P>
    <P>I hope officers and members of the Garda Síochána were listening to that and that they will take account of it.  I hope that in listening to it and thinking of what it means they will not make the rather artificial distinction, which Deputy O'Donnell made a few moments ago, between preventive gardaí and other gardaí.  All gardaí are essentially preventive in a part of their job.  The job each one of them does is partly intended to prevent crime, the rest of it is designed to detect who is responsible for crime.  To say there is a distinction between the two in an operational sense is an artificial distinction and one which does no good to the proper management of the force.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said some wise things about the Bill and asked some penetrating questions but there is one question I would like to ask which goes to the heart of what we are dealing with. It is simply this: when this Bill becomes law, will people who say they do not accept it be able to claim they are acting in the interests of the community they serve?  Will they be able to claim they are carrying out the duty they took on on the first day they joined the force and went to the Garda college in Templemore? It is not an option for any member of the Garda Síochána to say that he or she will not accept the legislation, properly put in place by the democratically elected representatives of the people, the people whom they also serve?</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the reason this Bill is before the House is, to put it <Col N="1477" /> bluntly, that the Garda Representative Association has been unable to carry out its functions to the satisfaction of its members.  That dissatisfaction has given birth to another association which itself, as far as I know, is beginning to show signs of internal dissent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to make the point that neither the present Minister for Justice nor her predecessor nor any of her predecessors is in any way responsible for the difficulties which create the situation that requires this Bill to be introduced to deal with it. Those difficulties in their entirety were internal to the Garda Representative Association and this Bill is designed to rescue the representative organisation of rank and file gardaí from the consequences of its own internal strife.  That cannot be repeated too often because there is a danger that that simple, solid, appalling fact will be lost to sight in the course of much of the other discussion which is taking place.</P>
      <P>Those people both inside and outside the force who wax so eloquently about the allegedly deplorable state of morale in the force would do well to remember the effect on morale of this dissension within the representative association of the force.  I am not speaking of dissension in the Garda force, I am speaking of dissension within the representative association of the Garda force.  I know, as I think all Members do, that a great many members of the Garda Síochána are as puzzled and appalled by this business as the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representation of the force is provided for and regulated by law for a simple reason, which needs to be restated from time to time and now is a good time to do it.  To put it at its simplest, there has to be an authoritarian element in the relationship between any State and its security forces.  In a democratic state, the nature and the limits of that authoritarian element must be clearly defined and open to scrutiny and debate <Col N="1478" /> but the authoritarian element must exist because a democratic State and a democratic Government must know with absolute confidence that its security forces will do what is required of them without constant questioning and arguing. That applies to the Garda, the Defence Forces and the prison service.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the representative associations, a Bill such as this or any other terms of reference they are given, must be framed with that factor in mind.  All the activities of those representative associations must give due weight to the requirement that the State, the Government, the people must know with confidence that the security forces will do what is democratically required of them under the Constitution and in accordance with the law.  People joining the Garda force and those who exercise representative responsibility in the force have to understand and accept that.  What I am saying is a matter of day to day operational common sense. It is not a recipe for unthinking authoritarianism within the force but a requirement of discipline.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner made a valid point when he said, and I think this is an open-minded statement:</P>
    <P>The value system of our organisation is in transition from a traditional model of control to one of commitment to the core values of the force.</P>
    <P>It is regretable that the commissioner should make such an open-minded statement so late in his term of office.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 the Minister is opening the door for the possible appointment of a professional administrator or general secretary of the association. I fail to understand why the appointee should be required to secure the approval of the Minister for Justice if he or she is not a member of the Garda Síochána, or is a member of the Garda Síochána and not a member of the association.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.  Unless he can give a compelling reason for putting that type of limitation on the appointment of <Col N="1479" /> a professional administrator as general secretary of the organisation, the condition should be dropped.  The requirement that this association and others set up recently must appoint serving members of the groups they represent as general secretaries has created a number of problems and may create more in the future.  If they were given the freedom to appoint their own professional administrators it might eliminate some of the difficulties in those organisations.</P>
    <P>This leads me to express another view which is germane to the subject matter of the Bill.  We should consider, or at least open the way for, the appointment of persons who are not a member of the Garda Síochána as commissioner and deputy or assistant commissioners.  In saying that I am not critical of the current or any previous commissioner or deputy or assistant commissioners, the thought comes from a different source. As the overall management of the Garda is a challenging task, it could be argued that it demands a knowledge and experience of social, societal and other factors not found uniquely among serving members of the force.  It could also be argued that such knowledge and experience could be found more widely outside the force.</P>
    <P>As a great deal of expertise for the functions of personnel managements, fleet managements and treasury exists outside the Garda force, it does not make sense to exclude it from the possibility of acquiring such expertise.  The appointment of a commissioner and of officers at the position immediately below that from civilian ranks would refresh the management of the force and bring in new approaches which would benefit its performance.  Commissioner Culligan said yesterday that the management of the Garda &ldquo;will be characterised by total quality management based on the premise that those we serve will receive the best possible service at the most efficient and cost effective level&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment which I have endeavoured to do for a number of weeks.  St. Paul's School in Brunswick Street, more popularly known as the &ldquo;Brunner&rdquo;, is a famous school and was the original &ldquo;School Around the Corner&rdquo;, which some Members are old enough to remember.</P>
      <P>I received a strongly worded submission from the board of management of that school which reflects the frustration of staff in trying to cater for the needs of disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>The submission is based on a communication the school received from the building unit in Tullamore stating that the building of an extension it sought had not been sanctioned for the current year.  I hope, by raising the matter on the Adjournment, that decision could be reversed.</P>
      <P>The board of management expressed dismay at the apparent injustice of this decision and pointed out that permission was first granted to build the extension some 13 years ago.  Since then, despite many increases in enrolment and the destruction by fire of a six classroom unit, the Department failed to make available the necessary resources for the extension.  The Christian Brothers have endeavoured to provide from their own resources a woodwork room, a computer room, an art room and a counsellors' room.  The board suggests that in many more advantaged areas such facilities are often funded by the Department, but in St. Paul's school, which is located in a very disadvantaged area, the Christian Brothers had to provide those facilities from their own resources.  The board also pointed out that the school restored the burnt-out unit following the Department's refusal to meet various requests for assistance in the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> The board of management state that the end result of not having the required space is that art is taught in a converted kitchen, the children do mechanical drawing on a piece of plywood propped on their knees against a wooden bench, their guidence counsellor operates from a small room on loan from the primary school, the physics room is a poorly equipped converted classroom and they do not have an assembly hall, PE gym or school library.  This places an intolerable disadvantage on children from a deprived area at a time when there is increased emphasis on project work.</P>
    <P>The submission goes on to state that staff conditions are appalling, with 26 people sharing a 15 foot square room. There is one toilet for the entire staff, the principal is obliged to share an office with the school secretary and there is no parents' waiting or consultation room.  The home-school liaison officer operates from an old kitchen at the back of a primary hall.  The board also stated that it should not be necessary to point out that the students of St. Paul's are trying to follow the same curriculum as better endowed schools.</P>
    <P>While the tone and wording of the board of management's submission is strong and serious, it merely reflects the frustration felt by those attempting to provide an education for children in the north inner city, where there is major unemployment and drug abuse problems. I hope the Minister has good news for me.  Will she acknowledge the frustration of staff and accept that they are doing their best for the children concerned in extremely difficult circumstances? The submission outlined in great detail the lack of facilities at the school.  I hope the Minister agrees to provide the funding for the extension.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  It gives me the opportunity to outlined the current position regarding the extension project at St. Paul's Christian Brothers secondary school, North Brunswick Street.  Initially <Col N="1482" /> I would like to give some brief details of the background of this case.</P>
      <P>St. Paul's CBS is an all-boys school with a current enrolment of 358 pupils. The school is divided into three blocks, two of which were built in 1890 and the third in 1955.  In 1983 approval was granted for the provision of 794m² in permanent accommodation to bring the capacity of the school to 350 places. However architectural planning for this extension did not progress at the time as the school had problems with the confined site.</P>
      <P>In April 1988 the school was extensively damaged by fire.  Remedial works were carried out by the school authority.</P>
      <P>In June 1993 the school reactivated its application for additional accommodation and my Department has approved in principle the provision of a permanent extension to caster for the long-term enrolment of 450 pupils at the school.  The architectural planning of this extension is proceeding and is currently at stage V &mdash; bill of quantities.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I am fully aware of the need for additional accommodation at the school.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the architectural planning for this project is progressed as quickly as possible.  Commencement of construction is dependent on the successful completion of the architectural planning process and the availability of resources at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because there is no other way of giving it the due notice it deserves or impinging it on the minds of those who make decisions on the matter.  I recently received correspondence from a very well versed lady in Dublin who is well able to express her opinion.  She explained that she had a bank account which she had forgotten about and the bank had chosen not to remind her of it.  She asked me to follow up the issue of dormant bank accounts.  I would ask <Col N="1483" /> the Minister to request the financial institutions to do a trawl of all dormant bank accounts and send statements of those accounts to the customers involved or their representatives.</P>
      <P>The lady who brought this matter to my attention discovered a balance of approximately £250 in a bank account of about a decade previously, about which she had forgotten.  She discovered the account by accident when she found a statement from the 1980s and inquired if there was money in the account.  It is interesting that no statement of the account had issued for years &mdash; no transaction had been made on the account in eight years.  The woman was told by the bank that the account was considered dormant.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to establish with banks and other financial institutions how many dormant accounts exist.  There could be thousands of such accounts, including those of deceased persons, involving many millions of pounds, which is due to the people concerned or their representatives.  While it would be labour intensive to establish the position of all accounts, banks are in a strong enough financial position to undertake such a programme of work. Given that they are quick to seek charges from customers, such a service on dormant accounts would be a good way of giving consumers value for money.  Once dormant accounts, as they are called by banks, are identified, banks should make an effort to contact the owners.  That would also deal with the position where people lose track of accounts.  The Minister should request banks to send at least one statement per annum on accounts with a plus balance. Such a review would uncover quite an amount of money which is due to individuals or their representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the question of the issuing by financial institutions of statements to holders of so-called dormant accounts it is <Col N="1484" /> necessary to consider the issue of dormant accounts generally and what constitutes a dormant account.  This whole question of dormant accounts is not an easy one as there is no legal or industry definition of when an account becomes &ldquo;dormant&rdquo;.  As a general rule a dormant account is one on which no transaction has taken place within a specified timeframe. I would exclude from this definition accounts where the holder has other active accounts with the institution. However, what this timeframe is or should be is far from clear.</P>
      <P>My Department has been undertakeing an examination of the whole issue of dormant accounts, involving the representatives of both banks and building societies.  This examination includes a process of identification of the number of such accounts in existence and the amount of money held in such accounts. This in turn requires clarification of what accounts could properly be recognised as dormant.  This has involved the collection and collation of data relating to accounts on which there have been no transactions in, say, ten or 15 years, or some other number of years in order to ascertain when an account is truly extinct, rather than just dormant.</P>
      <P>Given that we are talking about an examination of some millions of accounts, this is no easy task.  Both the banks and the building societies have provided data based on a number of criteria and these have been examined. Without going into details, I can assure Deputies that the figures disclosed give no indication that these dormant accounts, in the aggregate, contain significant sums.  Consideration of this matter is not yet completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific question posed by the Deputy I would like to point out that because of the variety of bank accounts now available in the market and the greater range of account options it may not be possible to issue statements in all cases.  In regard to all statement-based accounts, such as current accounts, cashsave accounts and deposit-savings accounts, customers with these accounts generally receive a <Col N="1485" /> statement on these accounts annually, where there has been a transaction during the year.  In certain circumstances, customers specifically request the credit institution concerned not to issue statements. In regard to other types of deposit accounts &mdash; generally pass-book or receipt based &mdash; it is the book or the receipt, as the case may be, which is evidence of the deposit.</P>
    <P>In general, the Deputy will accept that a requirement to issue statements for all accounts to all customers could in the long run increase the level of charges levied on these customers because of the extra time and expense involved for the financial institutions concerned.  Moreover, the consumer too must accept some responsibility for their own actions.  If a consumer is unsure if he or she holds an account with any financial institution, they can write to the institution concerned to seek confirmation.</P>
    <P>In relation to customers who have died I have been advised that solicitors, and appointed personal representatives, can readily obtain information on the state of a deceased customer's balances from his or her bank.  Banks also variously provide an effective tracing service for solicitors or personal representatives seeking to establish whether or not accounts exist in the names of deceased persons, by means of which the whole of a banks' network may be checked.  As a general rule, where an institution becomes aware of the death of a customer, branches endeavour to draw the attention of the next-of-kin to the existence of an account.  That is the Department's general response to the issue but the Deputy raised a specific case.  There is still a gap in terms of an account which a person has forgotten about and where no transaction has taken place.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the Packard Electric workforce on the Adjournment. It is six weeks since the closure of Packard was announced but it is only now that the workforce is beginning to realise the reality of what is involved. <Col N="1487" /> Last night 58 workers on what is known as the &ldquo;twilight shift&rdquo; were made redundant, 295 workers will be made redundant tomorrow and a further 50 will be made redundant next week.  This will continue until all 800 workers are laid off by early July.</P>
      <P>I know of no other workforce which has made as many sacrifices in recent years in order to save and protect their jobs as the Packard workforce.  If it was not for these sacrifices, which included foregoing two wage increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and working overtime without additional earnings, this plant would have been closed long ago.  We are talking about workers on low levels of pay.  Given the penal levels of tax, many of them might have been better off consigned to a life on the dole and may have been tempted to opt for such a life.  The average age of these dedicated works is 40-50 years, they are mainly general operatives and most of them are women.</P>
      <P>As the task force report states, the workers are frustrated and disillustioned not only because of the loss of their jobs but also because of the disgraceful way in which they have been treated by the management of this multinational company.  I do not take sides in industrial disputes but from experience &mdash; I do not have enormous personal experience but I have experience in terms of what I know and read about &mdash; I know of no other case where workers have been treated so badly and where management, at a distance, failed to communicate and co-operate with the very people who had made the plant and company a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those and many other reasons the workers rightly feel that the severance terms do not meet their entitlements. We have been waiting for some time for the Labour Court deliberations on this matter.  The Minister may be able to tell us whether the Labour Court has concluded its deliberations and, it not, I <Col N="1488" /> hope they will be brought to a conclusion speedily because the workers are wondering what they should do and are seriously bewildered.</P>
    <P>I am usually sceptical about task forces but I am pleased that the task force set up to deal with the wreckage which will flow from Packard reported speedily. I am impressed with its comprehensive report which covers many different aspects.  What pleases me most is that it believes many workers will get alternative employment.  It has identified 500 new jobs which will come on stream in the locality over the next year and it believes that with some training many Packard workers have the skills base to fill these jobs.  It also recommends that the regional technical college should offer educational and vocational training courses for these workers.  We must give these people hope.  When the closure of the plant was initially announced many of the workers felt they had no future.  While many Packard workers may never get another job we must not let them lose hope of securing alternative employment.  I am pleased that the task force looked at the suppliers and subcontractors and sees possibilities of them getting work with other Packard plants in Europe and of being able to employ some of the former workers.</P>
    <P>We must move away in the economy from a scenario where a person loses all opportunities once he loses his job.  We must deal with issues such as taxation policy, education, training and the nature of mix of the industrial base if we want to ensure that the transition from one job to another is not as difficult as it is at present for general operatives. The task force highlights ways of dealing with problems of this kind.</P>
    <P>Although the management of Packard in Dusseldorf has given an undertaking that it will not dispose of the plant for two years I am concerned that this is a verbal undertaking.  Given the way management has behaved in the past I would not have any confidence in a verbal undertaking.  The IDA and the Government must move quickly to ensure that the undertaking becomes a <Col N="1489" /> written undertaking so that an alternaive industry can be found for the plant. I hope the Minister will report to the House on the timescale for the implementation of the task force report and the severance package being offered and say whether the Labour Court has finalised its deliberations or when it is likely to do so.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Harney for sharing her time with me.  I have been concerned for many years about the status of the workers in Packard and the way they have been treated.  I understand the Labour Court was meant to report before the last &ldquo;twilight shift&rdquo; this evening and perhaps the Minister can say if it has done so.</P>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Harney about the treatment of the workforce.  There has not been a work stoppage in the plant since 1987, yet it has consistently been referred to as &ldquo;the plant with difficulties&rdquo;.  The workers, who are mostly women, have worked long hours and foregone wage increases under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Yet they were treated in an uncivilised and cruel fashion in the way they were told they would lose their jobs, while over the past two years they endured great uncertainty about their future.</P>
      <P>I commend the task force on its expeditious report.  I hope extra money will be provided and that the agencies identified in the report will not be required to undertake all this work out of their current income; they clearly need additional resources.  The workers have been treated in a casual and cruel way by the management over the years and even at the 11th hour they are not being allowed to leave the plant in a dignified way.  It is conducted with uncertainty and is a very callous way of treating them.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment will be able to inform the House this afternoon of movement on the Labour Court recommendations.</P>

      <P>I share both Deputies' concerns about the imminent redundancies at Tallaght arising from the closure decision by Packard Electric (Ireland) Ltd.  I have had formal meetings and numerous contacts with both unions and company since the decision was announced on 29 April.  On 30 April I got Government approval to establish a task force whose remit was to help locate alternative employment opportunities, to help source alternative industries for the Packard premises, to assist Packard workers in areas such as retraining and further education, support the expansion of small companies and address the loss of business to supply companies.</P>
      <P>The trade unions and management agreed, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, to refer a number of matters relating to the terms of severence &mdash; including the offer of five weeks redundancy per year of service inclusive of statutory entitlement &mdash; to the Labour Court for recommendation.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court has issued its recommendations today to both parties and, <i>inter alia,</i> has recommended as follows: five weeks pay per year of service exclusive of statutory entitlements; for purposes of calculating redundancy payments the outstanding phases 1 and 2 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> due on 1 March 1995 and 1 March 1996 respectively be included; that the company pay the four days holidays claimed; that, for purposes of reckoning service, the termination date for employees know in work should not be earlier than 7 July 1996 &mdash; this is to take account of employees on twilight shift etc. who may finish before that date, and the court would urge the company to give every assistance to employees in the area of financial advice and job replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court did not recommend a number of other claims submitted by the unions.  On the separate <Col N="1491" /> referral, under section 20 of the Industrial Relations Act 1969, the court recommended that the company give the union, on the same basis, the information which it has already been given to Government officials concerning the economic facts surrounding the closure decision.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is the company's intention that approximately 97 employees on twilight shift will finish work tonight and that over the weekend a further 297 employees, currently on lay-offs, will be made redundant.</P>
    <P>I have also taken the interim report of the Tallaght Task Force, whose recommendations, as set out in tabular form, have yesterday been accepted by Government.  I sincerely thank the chairman, Mr. Dan Tierney, and each individual members of the task force for the serious, expeditious and creative manner in which they went about their work.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that those recommendations include top IDA priority to be given to finding replacement industry; skills analysis of the workforce to be carried out &mdash; a recommendation already implemented; retraining, placement, education and counselling options for the workers; establishment of an enterprise fund and an enterprise support programme; survey of and support for Packard suppliers and sub-contractors; and two new enterprise centres for Tallaght, and support for SMEs.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the interim report are costed at £2.1 million over two years.</P>
    <P>The Packard closure is a serious setback to the Tallaght-Clondalkin region and a cause of personal devastation for hundreds of families.  However, I am convinced that, as a result of Government acceptance of the task force proposals and the ongoing work of the IDA and Forbairt, there is genuine cause for optimism about the future.  Both parties, unions and management, will need an opportunity to study the recommendations of the Labour Court.  However, I must appeal to both sides, when they <Col N="1492" /> have had an opportunity to study the recommendations, to accept them in accordance with long established precedent in Irish industrial relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Lough Arrow in County Sligo is one of the most celebrated trout fishing lakes of this country.  At Maytime Lough Arrow fishermen await the arrival of the mayfly.  When there is a good hatch and all the boats are on the lake, Lough Arrow is a glorious sight and, as I know from personal experience, a glorious place to be.</P>
      <P>The arrival of the mayfly was not the only news these fishermen received this May.  Those who used one of the principal access routes to the lake were told that trespassers will be prosecuted and that they must remove their boats by 31 May.  This was at Ballyrush Bridge on the Uinshen River, one of the traditional access points to the lake.  This riverside area has been used by anglers for many years but suddenly they were told that this was private property.  This order was given just as this year's fishing season was moving to its peak.</P>
      <P>Because of the fishing season reaching its peak and the difficulties and dislocation this would cause anglers, some of whom are visitors who have been coming to Lough Arrow for many years, a sort of settlement was reached for the payment of £20 per boat.  Even at that, it appears that boat owners are being asked to sign a document stating that their boats will be removed by 1 November next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of this difficulty being experienced at Ballyrush Bridge follows an exclusion order, on the same north side of the lake, where fishermen who tied up their boats at Ballintine's Pier no longer have freedom to do so.  It should be noted this was a pier built by Sligo County Council and the Irish Tourist Board.  Nonetheless fishermen were told they no longer had right of access so that, in order to get to their pier, they must use either a boat or helicopter, <Col N="1493" /> which must be unique in the case of a pier anywhere in this country.</P>
    <P>These anglers do not appear to have any clear-cut knowledge of the principals claiming ownership of traditional mooring places for boats at Ballyrush Bridge.  There appears to be a company involved, possibly registered in Douglas in the Isle of Man, but the Lough Arrow anglers are uncertain.  However, one thing is certain &mdash; the action taken came at a time designed to cause maximum disruption of the angling season.  This disruption has been patched up for a few months only.</P>
    <P>This is a clear case where the Minister for the Marine should resort to the powers of section 39 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, for the compulsory acquisition of this important right of way to Lough Arrow.  As no doubt the Minister of State will tell us, this is a power used very sparingly, if at all, in the past. While it is better that such disputes be settled amicably, those powers are contained in that Act.  Anglers are very patient people but it is time to begin taking a tough line regarding access to these waters.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country we hear of traditional access points to lakes and shores being closed off.  I hope the Minister, with the North West Regional Fisheries Board, will take quick, decisive action to ensure that the traditional access rights to Lough Arrow are maintained, thereby sending a clear, decisive message to anybody else in any other part of the country contemplating ring-fencing our angling waters, whether by resorting to erecting barbed wire fences or trespass notices.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to reply to this very important local issue which I know he will accept also has serious national implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>Lough Arrow is a public fishery.  Responsibility for the protection, conservation, management and improvement of this fishery rests with the North Western Regional Fisheries Board and I have no <Col N="1494" /> direct function in the matter.  I am fully aware of the difficulties experienced by anglers in gaining access at certain locations around the lake.  The board is working to resolve those difficulties.</P>
      <P>I understand there is good public access to Lough Arrow at Brick Pier on the east, Ballinafad Pier to the south and Ringbawn Pier on the west and that a number of private access points have been traditionally used with the agreement of the landowners.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy notes, one of these private access points in Ballyrush Bridge is at the northern end of Lough Arrow.  I understand that on 14 May last the manager of the North Western Regional Fisheries Board learned that work was under way on the construction of a wall between the Ballyrush Bridge site and the public road, which would block access to the lake from that point. I understand, following approaches by the board, that particular work was halted.  Subsequently, however, a sign was erected advising the public that the property is private and that boat owners should remove their boats from the property by 31 May.  The North Western Regional Fisheries Board advises me that it is endeavouring to contact the owners with a view to discussing ways and means of resolving the difficulty over access and right of way for anglers at the bridge.</P>
      <P>As the lands at Ballyrush Bridge are privately owned, access arrangements are a matter for the owners and prospective users.  As I said, the board is available and willing to help broker an agreement.  Section 39 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, provides that the Central or a Regional Fisheries Board may apply to the Minister for an order to be made creating a right of way to enable a board to carry out its statutory functions or to enable fishermen to gain access.  It is up to the board to consider and advise as to whether this option might be pursued at some stage.  It would, of course, be preferable to get a pragmatic agreement between all parties and this is the strategy currently being pursued by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" /> Overall, the North Western Regional Fisheries Board is looking strategically at the question of access for anglers to Lough Arrow as part of its development programme for the lake.  As part of that assessment the board is actively reviewing all options for improved access points around the lake.</P>
    <P>The general question of access to fisheries has been examined in successive reports, notably the 1976 Report of the Inland Fisheries Commission.  The ownership of fishing rights does not automatically give the owner the right to cross land to reach the fishery or to fish from the river bank.  That being said, the granting of fishing rights frequently includes the right to use adjoining land for the purpose of accessing those fishing rights.</P>
    <P>The goodwill of land owners is a key factor in the development and well regulated use of fisheries.  There are, of course, reciprocal obligations on fishing interests to fully respect the rights and concerns of land owners.  Generally speaking landowners have been amenable to allowing access over their lands to fishery owners or to the public. Indeed, it could be said that it is often in the interests of landowners to facilitate access to developed fisheries given, in particular, the local economic benefits accruing from tourism angling.  The current difficulties on Lough Arrow underline the importance of sorting out assured rights of access over lands to fisheries and along the banks of our rivers and lakes.  Where there are ongoing doubts in relation to the ownership of fisheries and access rights, fisheries conservation and development and enjoyment of the amenity will continue to be inhibited.</P>
    <P>The ownership and access issue has now assumed a greater importance with <Col N="1496" /> the advent of significant EU funding for the inland fisheries sector.  Most notably, the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism, is funding, to the tune of £19 million, the upgrading of our game, coarse and sea fisheries to the highest international standards.  The resultant dividend in terms of tourism revenue and related jobs will be considerable.</P>
    <P>The provision of guarantees in respects of open and regulated access to fisheries being funded under the programme is an essential part of the process. Therefore, to secure and protect all proposed investment in tourism angling we have established and funded a title investigation unit under the aegis of the Central Fisheries Board which is systematically investigating title of fisheries and access rights to fisheries around the country.  This is an important and long overdue initiative and will, I hope, bring a welcome level of certainty and clarity to the situation &mdash; in everyone's interest.</P>
    <P>The North Western Fisheries Board is currently developing funding proposals for the rehabilitation and development of the valuable trout resource in Lough Arrow.  I am confident that the board's strategic plans will result in a restoration of Lough Arrow to its former glory and I fully support the board's efforts and the efforts of the Friends of Lough Arrow to bring about the restoration of one of our finest lakes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>A copy of the report prepared by the inquiry team appointed to review the operation of Madonna House was furnished to my Department by the Sisters of Charity in March 1995.  Following a preliminary examination of the report, it was then referred to the Office of the Attorney General for advice as to whether it could be published.  That office advised 28 March 1995 that it could not be published in full because of the need to protect certain parties and to avoid interference with ongoing investigations and legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, both the Minister for Health and I were most anxious that as much as possible of the report should be published.  The Attorney General accordingly, arranged for a barrister to be engaged to examine the report of the inquiry team to determine what could be published without undue risk of legal complications.  The legal advice received was that substantial parts of the report could not be published without running a serious risk of committing grave contempt and defamation.  In this context, I would remind the Deputy that a number of civil actions has been initiated against the Sisters of Charity and the Eastern Health Board by or on behalf of former residents of the home.  These actions claim damages against the defendants for assault, negligence and breach of duty.  The legal advice indicated that it <Col N="1350" /> would be improper and unlawful to publish any material which prejudices issues arising for determination by the courts in the pending proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the light of this advice, there were two options open to me &mdash; not to publish the report or to publish an abridged version.  Bearing in mind the unequivocal position of the Minister for Health &mdash; and mine &mdash; that as much as possible of the report should be put into the public domain, I asked my officials to arrange for the publication of as much of the report as was legally possible to publish.  Arrangements for this were in train when a further complication arose. This concerned a new allegation of abuse of a child at Madonna House.  My Department was informed of this allegation by the Eastern Health Board at the end of February.  The allegation is currently being investigated by the Garda Síochána, in co-operation with the board.  In view of this development, it was necessary for my Department to seek further legal advice as to whether the proposed publication of the abridged report would in any way interfere with the Garda investigation, which is still ongoing.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it was prudent to ensure that nothing would be done which might possibly prejudice a criminal prosecution arising from this investigation.</P>
    <P>Having received clearance to proceed with publication, my Department arranged for the printing of the report on the inquiry into Madonna House. This process was completed on Tuesday, 7 May and I released the report on Thursday, 9 May.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will accept from the foregoing that there was no undue delay on my part in making available as much of the report prepared by the inquiry team as was legally possible for me to do so.  This was done as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the legal complications involved which of necessity required detailed consideration and numerous consultations with legal advisers.  I am also satisfied that the child care policy unit of my Department dealt with the matter <Col N="1351" /> as quickly as possible, bearing in mind the heavy volume of work within the unit.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I assume that the Deputy is referring to the four cases of meningitis which occurred recently in Majorca.  I should point out that a certain number of cases of meningitis will occur anywhere.  The four cases were all <Col N="1354" /> among visitors, i.e. not necessarily contracted in Majorca bearing in mind the incubation period.  The number is not statistically out of line as there were 25 cases in Majorca in 1995.  It should also be noted that there would be, on average, six or seven cases in Ireland each week.</P>
      <P>On becoming aware of public concern about meningitis in Majorca my Department investigated the situation and was in touch with the Balearic health authorities through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Spain and liaised with the disease surveillance centre in the UK.  A press statement was issued indicating that the small number of cases could not be regarded as an outbreak and that there was no evidence that the cases were connected.  The statement also pointed out that the Department of Health was not advising intending travellers to Majorca to cancel their holidays.</P>
      <P>In addition an information leaflet on meningitis is available from the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and from the health boards. During the winter of 1995-96 some 400,000 leaflets were distributed.  I am satisfied, therefore, that everything is being done to keep the public informed and should the situation change the public will be informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>The position about crèches at supermarkets maintaining a record of names and contact details, is that the supermarket chain involved in the recent meningitis case is now requiring its crèches to keep their records for a period of one month for public health purposes.  I am also arranging that this matter be brought to the attention of the working group preparing guidelines on standards in preschool services under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>As regards research the position is that the expert group on meningitis has examined the diagnostic surveillance and preventive aspects of our approach to this disease and is also considering appropriate areas for research into meningitis and will be making recommendations in this regard.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Demand for orthopaedic operations in the Western Health Board regions has grown in recent times due to a variety of reasons including an increasingly elderly population, changing lifestyle patterns resulting in more accident and trauma cases and advances in the specialty itself.</P>
      <P>Under the 1995 waiting list initiative I allocated a total of £709,097 to the Western Health Board which included funding for the provision of additional inpatient and outpatient orthopaedic procedures.  As a result of this additional funding the board provided an additional 480 inpatient and 1,623 outpatient orthopaedic operations in 1995.  This brought the total number of procedures performed in the year to 6,045 made up of 1,034 in-patient procedures and 5,011 outpatient procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board was also allocated £70,000 in 1995 to provide for continuing developments in orthopaedics at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  My Department had allocated £400,000 to the board in 1994 for this development which made provision for two clean air theatres along with the necessary additional staffing.  As part of this development the Western Health Board has informed me that a new orthopaedic consultant took up duty in January, bringing the total of orthopaedic consultants to five.  I would also like to point out that there is no ongoing dispute between management and the anaesthetists.  There is however, a difference of interpretation over <Col N="1356" /> entitlement to rest days under the consultant contract and clarification on this issue is being sought by the board from the grievance and dispute committee.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Dental Health Action Plan provides for the extension of eligibility for dental services to children up to 16 years of age.  I am implementing the action plan on a phased basis and I have already extended eligibility for dental services to children after they leave national school up to their fourteenth birthday. In addition, emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is currently available to children aged 14 years and over who are dependants of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>Routine dental treatment will be provided by health boards to children up to 14 years of age by extending the targeted approach which is currently used in the national schools.  Children who have left national school will be recalled, as appropriate, screened and provided with appropriate preventive and primary care dental care treatment for any defects noted in the course of screening.  These children will be provided with emergency treatment to relieve pain on demand.  I have requested each health board to implement the extension as soon as possible having regard to the resources available to the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> Under the Dental Health Action Plan an additional £3 million is now part of the health boards annual allocation for the consolidation and extension of routine dental services to children.  This represents an extra 100 full time dental staff.  I will consider the question of a further extension in eligibility in 1997, as provided under the Dental Health Action Plan, in the context of the funds available to me in that year for the development of dental services.  I am aware that the cost of dental treatment obtained on a private basis can be a burden on families and I am keen to extend entitlement up to 16 years of age as soon as I am in a position to do so.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The establishment of an independent living fund is being proposed by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of financing the provision of a personal assistance service. As the Deputy is aware, following the completion in December 1994 of the Centre for Independent Living's two-year action research programme, INCARE, into personal assistance services, I ordered the establishment of an Advisory Group to Personal Assistance Services to examine the whole question of personal assistance services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This group explored the option of establishing an independent living fund funded through the Departments of Social Welfare, Education and Health but considered that this would be too cumbersome to administer.  As an alternative, it recommended that funding be provided through my Department in the <Col N="1358" /> short term except where personal assistance is required for third level education. In the long term, the group considered that the issue was mainly one of income support and it recommended that funding should be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare. The group was also aware that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is examining the issue of income support in detail.</P>
    <P>Finally, the group recommended that funding of a PA service should be considered in the context of the development of support services generally for people with disabilities.  This issue is being addressed by the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities whose report is expected within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose taking <Col N="1359" /> Questions Nos. 16, 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to a &ldquo;Food Surveillance Information Sheet&rdquo; issued by the Food Safety Directorate of the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food concerning a survey which was carried out of phthalates in samples of retail infant formula on sale in the UK.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the UK report has led the Chairman of the Food Safety Advisory Board, Dr. Fergus Hill, to conclude that, on the evidence presented, the results did not present any cause for alarm.  I have no reason to disagree with this opinion.  However, the Food Safety Advisory Board has been asked to consider the matter in more detail and to report to my Department.</P>
      <P>Given the amount of public interest and understandable concern that there has been in the matter, the health boards have been requested to arrange for testing of all infant formula on sale in Ireland for the presence of phthalates and to report their findings to my Department.  The information will also be given to the Food Safety Advisory Board for their consideration.  I understand that the testing may take some weeks to complete.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the establishment of a separate agency for food control, this and related matters are at present the subject of a high level policy review.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the issues raised until this review is completed and the Government has had an opportunity to consider the position. I would, however, like to take this opportunity to say that while the Government is satisfied that food produced in Ireland meets the highest standards of safety and hygiene, it is nevertheless prepared to take any additional steps considered necessary or prudent to uphold its reputation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have agreed to implement the following measures to assist medical card holders who take up employment or participate in community employment and recognised development courses: (a) persons who held the medical card while on the live register are allowed to retain the medical card for a period of two years after securing paid insurable employment if they qualify for family income supplement in respect of that employment; (b) persons who held a medical card while on the live register are allowed to retain the medical card for a period of two years after securing a placement on the community employment programme; (c) persons on the live register starting their own businesses who are paid a back to work allowance by the Department of Social Welfare and who are paid family income supplement in respect of that employment are allowed to retain their medical card for a period of two years; (d) disabled persons participating in the employment support scheme who held a medical card before entering the scheme are allowed retain the card for a period of two years; (e) persons on the live register who participate in education, training or their recognised development courses are allowed retain their medical card; and (f) weekly payments made under the community employment programme, back to work <Col N="1361" /> allowance and family income supplement are excluded income when assessing a persons eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>The recent budget also included a provision in relation to the retention of medical cards by persons who have been unemployed for at least one year prior to re-entering employment.  Arrangements are being made for the implementation of this decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional funding provided in 1996 for the development of new services for persons with a mental handicap will enable the health boards to put in place between 66 and 70 new residential-respite places and 265 day care places as well as home support services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  In the period 1990-95 additional funding amounting to £44.58 million has been invested in the services. New services provided include the development of the home support services and the provision of over 1,000 new residential-respite places and 2,100 new day care places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that this injection of funds has made a substantial impact on the waiting lists.  I am aware that more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of those awaiting services. That commitment is reflected in my decision, with my colleague the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to prepare a five year service development plan to meet the needs identified by the new national mental handicap database which will <Col N="1362" /> give a clearer picture of the level of unmet need.  I expect the plan to be ready later this year when the information from the database becomes available.</P>

    <P>In the case of a chemical incident, which is the more likely of the two, each chemical company has its own decontamination procedures in place.  The fire service also has a body shower for the purposes of decontamination.  It is the major emergency policy worldwide that decontamination takes place at the <Col N="1363" /> scene of the accident.  Once the hospitals have been notified of the accident, the hospital emergency plan is put into operation, which includes notification of all emergency staff.  The victims are then transported by ambulance to any one of three accident and emergency departments in Cork.  The Deputy will wish to know that emergency beds have been allocated to cope with such a situation.</P>
    <P>In the unlikely event of a nuclear accident, Cork University Hospital has equipment specially designed to monitor and measure radioactive contamination including thyroid uptake.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with a <Col N="1364" /> mental handicap, in the first instance, is a matter for the health boards.</P>
      <P>Regional planning and co-ordination of services is carried out by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committees, which operate in seven of the eight health board areas.  The committees are representative of the health boards, the voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap.  The parent representatives in each case are nominated by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped in Ireland &mdash; NAMH.  A parents' committee operates in the North-Western Health Board region which has similar input into the decision-making process as the co-ordinating committees in the other health board regions.</P>
      <P>The co-ordinating committees identify priorities for service developments, agree plans for the development of services for each region and recommend development priorities as resources become available.  I am satisfied that these committees are operating successfully and are effective in the co-ordination of services at regional level.</P>
      <P>The Regional Co-ordinating Committees operate in accordance with the national priorities and policies which the Government determines.  These priorities and plans will be reflected in the five-year service development plan to meet the needs identified by the new National Mental Handicap Database which I announced recently.  Work on the regional plans is already under way in each health board region.  I expect the overall plan to be ready later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is the only board currently providing emergency accommodation for children in hospitals.  At present six children are placed in hospital accommodation in the region.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I do not favour the use of hospital accommodation for this purpose.  However, when small children are placed in the care of the board it is often necessary to refer them to hospital for assessment and/or treatment.  When this assessment is completed, it is not always possible to find an immediate suitable placement for the children.</P>
      <P>Equally, when small children are referred in an emergency or crisis and no suitable alternative placement is available either in a children's residential centre or with foster parents, it has sometimes been found necessary to place the children in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concious that this is not the ideal situation.  The Eastern Health Board are taking all possible steps to provide suitable alternative accommodation, in particular the board is expanding its crisis intervention service which deals with children who need emergency placement out of hours.  A residential unit for children under 12 years of age and two <Col N="1367" /> additional emergency units for older children are being provided, and a major recruitment campaign for additional foster parents was launched in May and it is hoped to assign a number of newly recruited foster parents to provide emergency short-term places.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that when these additional facilities come fully on stream, the use of hospital accommodation in these circumstances will be eliminated.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The amount allocated by my Department to St. James's Hospital in respect of its non-capital expenditure was £63.357 million for 1994, £65.903 million in 1995 and £70.598 million for 1996.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork University Hospital is a health board hospital.  Therefore, it is a matter for the health board to determine how much of its total funding it will allocate <Col N="1369" /> to a particular programme or service. The amount allocated by the Southern Health Board to Cork University Hospital was £38.739 million for 1994, £40.887 million in 1995 and £42.326 million for 1996.</P>
    <P>I might add that, during the course of a year, certain further adjustments may be made to the amount allocated to a hospital, including national pay agreements, approved service developments coming on stream or Government initiatives such as the waiting list programme. Some of these adjustments are of a once-off nature and the funding may not fall to be repeated in the same amount, or at all, in the following year.</P>
    <P>The final allocation for St. James's Hospital in respect of 1994 was £67.852 million and in respect of 1995 was £71.422 million.  The final allocation for Beaumont Hospital in respect of 1994 was £58.759 million and in respect of 1995 was £63.998 million.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Southern Health Board increased its allocation to Cork University Hospital to £40.139 million in respect of 1994 and to £42.985 million in respect of 1995.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 74 and 76 together.  As Minister for Health, I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent elderly people in their own homes.  Indeed, supporting elderly people at home is a major objective of health policy and in recent years my Department has encouraged health boards to provide support services for the elderly and their carers whether by services in the home, such as home help, or by way of respite care in a hospital or nursing home.</P>
      <P>I am also very supportive of the effort made by the Carer's Association in raising the profile of those within the community who care for people with disabilities, the dependent elderly people and those with severe illnesses.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the respite care grants scheme was transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Welfare in 1995.  Last year, £500,000 was allocated to the health boards for the scheme and I understand that the Carer's Association benefited nationally to the tune of £32,500.  The Eastern Health Board allocated £10,000 to the Carer's Association in 1995 towards a &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; home care project in a particular area of the board.  The board also assisted 28 other organisations from their respite care allocation.  Those assisted included organisations serving persons with physical disabilities, psychiatric illness, mental handicap and elderly people.  This year, £500,000 has again been allocated to the health boards for respite care and interested organisations are eligible to apply for funding from their local health board.</P>
      <P>I am currently arranging for senior officials of my Department to meet the Carer's Association.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> At present in Ireland, mammography is used mainly as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women on referral from their general practitioners.  Diagnostic mammography services are currently provided at 19 centres throughout the country, as per list attached.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department supported a major mammographic screening programme at the Mater Foundation and the Eccles Breast Screening Programme was part of a network of pilot schemes being carried out within the European Union.</P>
      <P>A Government of Renewal contains an undertaking to expand the Eccles Breast Screening Programme on a phased basis to cover those women in the high risk category nationwide. However it was necessary to await the independent evaluation of the report from the Eccles Programme on the Epidemiological Aspects of Breast Cancer Screening.  That evaluation report supports the introduction of a breast screening service, subject to the establishment of a population register.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the programme will commence as soon as possible and will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas.  It will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64 which represents 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is guided by the need for the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that the phased introduction of the breast screening programme should take cognisance of these critical success factors.  In this regard, a project team has been established within the Department to liaise closely with the <Col N="1372" /> pilot programme personnel and other relevant agencies to agree the organisational structures and operational arrangements required to implement the phased expansion of the programme. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement of the detailed arrangements for the programme within the next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> My Department has agreed with the Eastern Health Board a framework for the development of its orthodontic services under the Dental Health Action Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board shares the services of a consultant orthodontist with the Dublin Dental Hospital.  This consultant has a <Col N="1373" /> half-time commitment to the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In 1995 I approved the appointment of two orthodontic consultant posts for the Eastern Health Board.  As a result of this competition the board expects that a full-time consultant will take up duty with the board on 1 July 1996 and will be based in the new orthodontic unit under construction at St. James's Hospital.  The board has re-advertised the second consultant post, with extensive advertising abroad.  In addition, the board also plans to recruit seven additional dentists and support staff to work under the direction of the consultant orthodontist in the unit at St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>During 1995 the board increased the number of orthodontists from two to five whole time equivalents.</P>
    <P>Additional funds have been provided by my Department over the last number of years specifically for the development of orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board area.  Since 1995, under the Dental Health Action Plan, I have increased the annual allocation to the board by £65,000 to enable it to provide additional orthodontic treatment services. This additional funding will allow for the recruitment of additional dentists together with support staff to work under the overall direction and supervision of consultant orthodontists to provide an increased level of orthodontic treatment services.  In addition I provided £250,000 capital moneys to the Eastern Health Board in 1995 to provide additional facilities and specialist equipment to assist in the provision of secondary care orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Pending the full implementation of a consultant led orthodontic service the board has also entered into arrangements with a number of private orthodontists for the provision of services.</P>
    <P>The board has, however, experienced considerable difficulties in developing its orthodontic services.  The main problem is not one of resources.  It is the problem faced by the board in securing the services of consultant orthodontists <Col N="1374" /> who can develop its services in accordance with the strategy outlined in the Dental Health Action Plan.</P>
    <P>I agree that the situation whereby eligible patients are waiting for long periods of time for orthodontic services is not desirable.  The board is, however, confident that as a result of the developments, I have outlined, the waiting periods for orthodontic treatment will be greatly reduced.</P>

    <P> (* Note:&mdash; This figure does not include G.P.s. with panels of less than 500 patients) </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> The above statistical information relates to the number of medical card patients on the panels of doctors who are contracted under the GMS scheme. Information on the number of non-medical card patients on doctor's panels is not available.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, health boards are obliged to provide, without charge, a general practitioner medical and surgical service for persons with full eligibility &mdash; i.e. medical card holders. The Act and Regulations made under the Act in 1972, provide that, in so far as is practicable, a person availing of such services shall have a choice of medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>The criteria agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) in relation to the creation or filling of posts in the general medical services scheme (GMS) are:&mdash; (i) health boards are required to make appointments to the degree necessary to provide a proper level of access to general practitioner services for eligible patients; (ii) health boards are required to ensure that patients have a reasonable degree of choice in selecting a practitioner; and (ii) the viability of practices in the locality is taken into account.</P>
    <P>Entry by doctors to the GMS scheme is by open competition for new posts which are created, vacancies which arise or for posts of assistant-with-a-view to partnership.  Participating doctors enter into a contract with the relevant health board for the provision of services for medical card patients who choose to be on their panel.  Doctors who do not hold such a contract are precluded from providing GMS services other than a locum to a participating doctor.  There were 1,655 general practitioners participating in the GMS scheme as at 31 December 1995.</P>
    <P>While it is understood from a survey currently being undertaken by the Irish College of General Practitioners that there are approximately 2,700 doctors in this country who regard themselves as general practitioners, accurate information on the number of doctors who <Col N="1380" /> are interested in obtaining a GMS contract is not readily available.</P>
    <P>Entry for doctors to the GMS by way of open competition is a key principle of the scheme for the purposes of maintaining a high quality general practitioner service and an orderly development of services for patients.  I am satisfied that the arrangements in place governing entry to the GMS scheme by general practitioners provide for a reasonable level of choice for patients and an efficient use of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Last year, officials of my Department met representatives of an organisation representing people with ME, the Irish ME Trust, regarding their concerns relating to increasing awareness of ME and research into its causes.  I am glad to report that awareness of ME is increasing among medical practitioners and the general population through such useful initiatives as ME awareness week.  As agreed at that meeting, my Department gave detailed information on ME provided by the ME Trust to the Irish College of General Practitioners for circulation to its members.  Greater awareness of the condition should lead to faster diagnosis and more effective treatment.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the issues raised by the ME support group.  I did not receive, however, any request for assitance for its awareness week campaign which took place in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health research is carried out under <Col N="1381" /> the aegis of the health research board which has an open invitation policy regarding applications for research funding and allocates its resources annually according to the priorities it attaches to the various requests received.  Organisations, such as the ME support group, seeking to fund research, should contact the health research board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to him of 21 May 1996, my Department has responsibility for the implementation of two measures under the Cross-Border Development Sub-Programme of the EU Support Programme.  A provision of £1 million has been included for this purpose under subhead F.3 of the Foreign Affairs Vote in the 1996 Estimates.</P>
      <P>Measure 1 is concerned with business and cultural linkages and is being administered on both sides of the Border by an intermediary funding body,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> Co-operation North, in association with IBEC and CBI (NI).  My Department's role under this measure is as a channel to Co-operation North of the EU and Government matching funds which will total 9.193 MECU (or IR£7.31 million approximately) over the period of the programme.  I understand that Co-operation North has been active in publicising this measure and has already received a considerable number of applications which it is currently processing. A small number of applications have been approved and letters of offer have issued to the applicants.  Co-operation North expects to announce details of the awarding of grants in the near future.</P>
    <P>My Department's primary involvement under the EU Programme will be in the implementation of Measure 3 (A) concerning co-operation between public bodies.  The rationale behind this measure is the adoption of co-ordinated approaches by public bodies to common problems in the eligible areas, North and South, which will contribute to the advancement of reconciliation in areas which are of significant importance in both social and economic terms.  Total funding of 5.417 MECU (or IR£4.33 million approximately) will be administered by my Department under this measure.</P>
    <P>While a number of project proposals are in preparation, no money has been allocated to date under this measure. Consultation is continuing between Government Departments, North and South, with a view to identifying and bringing forward projects for funding. Among these projects is the health boards' project referred to by the Deputy in his question.  It is anticipated that the first tranche of project applications will be considered in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Irish Aid Programme in Mozambique in recent years has been an interim one, with funds being channelled through NGOs and selected local institutions.</P>
      <P>The Irish Aid Strategy Plan, published in July 1993, signalled that Mozambique would be the next priority country for Irish aid.  This was confirmed in the recent White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>
      <P>This will lead to the development of a structured country programme for Irish aid in Mozambique, beginning in 1996 and continuing and expanding in subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are at present being made to establish a resident Irish mission in the capital, Maputo, to develop and administer the Irish aid programme in Mozambique.  It is expected that this mission will be in place before the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>A budget of £1 million has been allocated for Mozambique in 1996, and this can be expected to expand over the next few years as the Irish Aid Programme in Mozambique develops.</P>

The study was carried out by the British Office for National Statistics and the University of Survey over the period 1971 to 1989.</P>
      <P>From a sample one per cent of the population of England and Wales 6,308 people (3.075 men and 3,233 women) at least one of whose parents was born in Ireland (excluding Northern Ireland) and who were aged 15 and over in 1971 were identified.  Deaths and the causes of death of people in this group were analysed and compared with deaths and the causes of death of people from the sample as a whole during the 18 year period.  The overall conclusion of the study was that &ldquo;mortality of second generation Irish men and women was higher than that of all men and all women and for most major causes of death.  While socio-economic factors remain important, cultural and lifestyle factors are likely to contribute to this adverse mortality.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am concerned about these findings and have asked the Embassy in London about the possibility of further research being done which might pinpoint the causes of this higher mortality.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East:</i> The report of the <Col N="1390" /> Expert Group on a Protocol for the Prescribing of Methadone set out recommendations for the manner in which general practitioners should become involved in the provision of methadone maintenance programmes for drug misusers.  The Irish College of General Practitioners was represented on the expert group, because of its role in training and continuing medical education for general practitioners.  My Department has had regular discussions with representatives of the college on involving general practitioners in prescribing methadone in accordance with the Protocol.  Arising from these discussions a pilot project, which would involve referring 100 estabilised drug misusers from drug treatment centres to general practitioners, commenced in March of this year.  To date 40 such patients have been referred in this manner and the intention is to increase this number as soon as possible.  It is intended also that the pilot project will be evaluated after a period of six months in operation.</P>
      <P>In the interim, during the course of an address to the annual general meeting of the Irish College of General Practitioners, I appealed for the help of the college in encouraging general practitioners to become involved.  I am glad to say that the college responded positively to my appeal and has committed itself to actively supporting my Department in its efforts.  To this end further discussions are now being held with the college to identify any issues which might represent a barrier to progress with involving general practitioners in the treatment of drug misusers.</P>
      <P>The issue is on the agenda for discussion between the Irish Medical Organisation and my Department and I understand that the Organisation proposes to await the evaluation of the pilot project before seeking to agree payments and conditions which would apply nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the numbers to be treated as I have outlined there are approximately 700 addicts being maintained on methadone by 25 general <Col N="1391" /> practitioners.  Efforts are now being made to bring these patients and doctors within the ambit of the Protocol and I welcome this.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made but not as quickly as I would like and it was because of this that I made my appeal to the Irish College of General Practitioners for more general practitioners to become involved and I am confident that this will happen.  In the meantime the Eastern Health Board has initiated a number of alternative ways for involving general practitioners such as having them actually work in the community drug centres or in other health board premises such as health centres.</P>
    <P>The Government decided as part of its decisions on a package of measures to reduce the demand for drugs, which was announced on 20 February, that the greater involvement of general practitioners in the provision of services for drug misusers would be crucial.  It is my aim, therefore, to seriously address any issues which are a cause of concern to general practitioners and which may be making them reluctant to become involved.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives: first, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all registered nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act, and second to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of the subvention scheme on 31 March 1996, 8,231 subventions have been approved by the health boards.  In the same period 354 nursing homes have been registered by <Col N="1392" /> the boards.  The total annual cost of the scheme now stands at approximately £16 million.</P>
    <P>The provision of nursing home subventions under the Act must be consistent with Health Strategy policy that, whenever possible, the elderly should be maintained in dignity and independence in their own homes.  The scheme is not, therefore, a demand-led one but must be based on medical advice about the most appropriate care setting in individual cases.</P>

Once the technical appraisal has been completed it is proposed to put in place the necessary funds to proceed with this capital development.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The incidence of asbestos related illnesses is monitored by the occupational medical service of the Health and Safety Authority.  I am advised by the authority that there were fifteen admissions to hospital for asbestosis in 1995.  Four new cases of the cancer known as mesothelioma which is primarily associated with exposure to asbestos were also seen.  The asbestos related illnesses now being seen are due to exposure which occurred between twenty to forty years ago; some of the patients previously worked in the construction and demolition industry in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of workers exposed to asbestos is regulated by an EU directive given effect here by the European Community (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989.  These regulations, which are implemented by the Health and Safety Authority, protect the health of workers by reducing the level of exposure to asbestos fibres, the setting of exposure limits, the establishment of sampling and measuring methods and the inspection of workplaces by the authority.  The regulations also specify that adequate information must be provided to workers in relation to the potential risks to health from exposure to asbestos and the precautions to be taken.  With <Col N="1395" /> regard to asbestos in the home, an information leaflet is available to the public from the Department of the Environment to help identify asbestos material and the steps to take to deal safely with it.</P>

    <P>One such area which receives particular attention in my Department relates to value for money.

The Comptroller and Auditor General now has a role in auditing health boards and he also has a value for money remit.</P>
    <P>The health services are responding to the needs of a changing environment and are developing systems which allow for greater co-operation between health boards and with other health agencies with a view to ensuring the economical use of resources.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the 1970 Health Act, provision is made for health boards to make arrangements for providing ambulances or other means of transport for the conveyance of patients.  On foot of this provision health boards operate ambulance services which provide both scheduled transport for non-ambulant patients and emergency pre-hospital care services.  In addition, a new mobile intensive care ambulance service to provide an enhanced level of care to critically ill patients being transferred from intensive care units in local hospitals to referral hospitals in Dublin, will shortly commence operation on a pilot basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases and this arrangement has been in place since 1965.  This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill patients over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance. It is also provided for the removal from <Col N="1400" /> islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions are such as to make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service, a standing committee on air ambulance services has been established and is currently engaged in an examination of all the options regarding the most appropriate arrangements for the provision of air ambulance services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Respite Care Fund was transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Welfare in 1995.  The scheme is administered by the health boards as an extension of the national lottery grant scheme for voluntary bodies operated by the boards. The allocation of this funding is subject to the following criteria: that grants are allocated to community-based projects under the headings mental handicap services, physical disability services, psychiatric services, child care services, women's refuges, personal social services; that at least 80 per cent of the block grant should be allocated to local voluntary groups; that grants from the block allocation should not be used in substitution for core funding; and that particular care be taken to ensure that grants are made available only to viable schemes which will be completed within a reasonable period and, in determining priority of schemes, an assessment should be made of any ongoing revenue implications.  Priority should be given to once-off projects which would have no ongoing revenue implications for health boards.</P>
      <P>The respite care grants are not restricted to pilot projects.  The funding allocated to each organisation is used to provide a wide range of respite care including break-away weeks, home care and care in institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in the main, respite care is provided as part of <Col N="1405" /> the ongoing services provided by health boards and voluntary agencies. Additional places in these services have been developed over the past three years from funding provided for new services for people with mental handicap and development funding provided for physical and sensory disability services. The provision of further respite places continues to be one of the priorities for the allocation of additional funding.</P>
    <P>The Respite Care Fund is an additional resource.  The allocation of funding in 1995 to voluntary organisations under this particular scheme by health board area is set out hereunder. A breakdown of the amount allocated in respect of in-home respite care and the amount allocated to hospital respite care is not available.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The health strategy recognised the difficulties which the direct funding by my Department of certain voluntary agencies created for the development and co-ordination of services at local level to the detriment of patients and clients.  In particular, it was considered that this hampered the development of links between community and hospital services, and between statutory and voluntary services. Accordingly, it was decided that voluntary agencies would receive their funding from the health boards and be accountable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of implementing the health strategy in relation to the transfer of responsibility for the funding of voluntary agencies providing services to persons with a mental handicap currently directly funded by my Department has commenced.  This process will, <Col N="1409" /> where appropriate, take account of central management costs in those agencies providing services in more than one health board region.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements will have no detrimental effect on funding for headquarters and will enhance the provision of services to local communities.</P>

      <P>The chief executive officers use income guidelines in deciding on eligibility and will take account of the medical circumstances of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board in the case referred to by the Deputy and I understand that the board withdrew the card, following a review of the person's circumstances, in December of last year.  The case was appealed to and reviewed by the board following representations on the person's behalf.  However, as his income was still considerably in excess of the guidelines and there was no evidence of excessive expenditure on medical services, the appeal was refused.  I understand that the board has informed the person concerned of the various other schemes which are available to assist him with his medical needs.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any information relating to a change in the person's circumstances which would have implications for eligibility for a medical card, perhaps she could relay same to me and I will gladly have the matter followed up with the Eastern Health Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 to 85 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Fluoride is a compound of the element fluorine in combination with another organic or inorganic natural substance.  Fluorine itself is a natural substance which occurs widely in nature and always in combination.  Like many other natural substances, fluoride, if taken to excess, can cause detrimental health effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> I am advised that chronic toxicity can be associated with long-term absorbtion of elevated levels of fluoride, that is, levels well above the optimal level for water fluoridation of public water supplies. There is little morbidity and no mortality associated with this chronic toxicity.  Acute toxicity occurs with the ingestion of a large quantity of fluoride at one time.  It can never occur through ingestion of water fluoridated at the optimal level for water fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    <P>Fluoride is supplemented to the public piped water supplies as a positive public health measure for the reduction and control of dental caries &mdash; decay &mdash; to the optimal level of one part of fluoride per million parts of water, under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.  This has long been recognised internationally as a safe and effective way to improve oral health.  Detrimental health effects can never occur at the level to which the public water supplies are fluoridated.  The fluoridation levels in the public piped water supplied are regularly monitored by health boards to ensure compliance with the statutory level.  All fluoride used in the public piped water supplies, whether as a by-product or as a primary product, is of high quality.</P>
    <P>Dental caries is not itself a life-threatening disease but the sequelae of dental caries can, and have, resulted directly and indirectly in unnecessary and preventable human deaths.  Dental caries is not easily avoidable by proper diet.  It is avoidable with much difficulty and with a degree of commitment to a severe non-cariogenic diet which people generally are unwilling to give.  Dental hygiene, <i>per se,</i> has no demonstrable effect on dental caries prevalence and/or incidence.  Prolonged scientific studies have failed to show any correlation between dental hygiene and dental caries.  Dental hygiene is of course important in the prevention of tooth loss arising from gum disease.</P>
    <P>It would be expected that the termination of the national water fluoridation programme would result in raising the <Col N="1413" /> levels of dental caries to those levels pertaining in Northern Ireland where there is no such comparable scheme. Dental caries in Northern Ireland are generally about 40 to 50 per cent higher than in the Republic.  This has prompted the Northern Ireland authorities to make preparations to introduce into that jurisdiction a scheme similar to that which has been operated here in the South with marked success for over 30 years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The information available on people with a disability is not such as to provide an overall figure of the number of such persons.  If one excludes the dependent elderly, many of whom have disabilities, the main groups affected are those with a mental handicap, a physical or sensory disability and those with a psychiatric disability.  Work is well advanced on the establishment of a database on people with a mental handicap which will be used for the further development of services for that group.</P>

    <P>Detailed information on the numbers of people in the State with physical and sensory disabilities is not available.  I am aware that the review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities endeavoured to estimate the incidence of disability using a number of possible measures, such as the number of recipients of disability-related allowances and benefits.  However, the group was concerned at the accuracy of the results reached and will be making recommendations for the establishment of a national database on persons with a physical or sensory disability.  Its <Col N="1414" /> report will be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to people with a psychiatric disability, information is available on the number of persons with such a disability in the care of the mental health services in the annual reports on the mental health services published by the Health Research Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Article 5 of Council Directive 93/43/EEC on the hygiene of foodstuffs provides for the development of guides to good hygiene practice which may be used voluntarily by food businesses as a guide to compliance with the directive.  Member states are obliged to encourage the development of these guides, but it is worthwhile to note that such guides must be developed primarily by the food business sectors, albeit together with interested parties and in consultation with the authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department has actively and financially encourged the development of such guides.  Two guides have been completed, one for the catering sector and another for the beverage manufacturing industry.  Two more are under development, under the aegis of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, one for the food processing industry and another for the retail sector.  The guide for the catering sector has been published in the form of a national standard &mdash; I.S. 340.  It is envisaged that the guides for the food processing industry, now at final draft stage, and the retail sector will also be published in this form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> My Department welcomes these developments and believes that these guides will be of practical use to the food business sectors concerned and health boards.</P>
    <P>Some preliminary discussions have been held between officials in my Department and representatives of small producers in relation to this matter. It is planned that further meetings will be held in the near future, at which the NSAI will also be represented, with a view to exploring the possibilities of developing specific guides to meet their needs.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department are working on the details of establishing the inspectorate of social services.  While the inspectorate will be initially concerned with child care, it will in time take on responsibility for other vulnerable groups, such as the dependent elderly and people with disabilities. I envisaged that the principal functions of the inspectorate will be the quality assurance and audit of child care practice. It will contribute substantially to the overall quality improvement process and the promotion of good practice in child care services.  It will provide an external overview of the child care services and will evaluate and assess the child care structures and services which health board management has put in place.  It will issue guidelines on good practice and ensure a uniform approach throughout the country.  In addition, the <Col N="1416" /> inspectorate will undertake inquiries on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>There were no additional child care social worker posts approved by my Department in 1990. Details of the number of additional posts approved for each health board by community care area for each of the years 1991 to 1995 are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, additional revenue funding of £35 million on an annualised basis has been provided for the development of child care and family support services and to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands imposed by the implementation of the 1991 Child Care Act.  All the health boards have used some of this additional funding to provide improved training for child care personnel, including social workers.</P>
      <P>Induction courses are provided for new staff as well as in-service training for existing staff.  In addition, a number of the boards have appointed training officers to oversee the delivery of appropriate training to staff.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that over 900 permanent new posts have been approved for the child care services since 1993.  I am preparing proposals for Government for the financing of a new child care programme for the period 1997 to 1999.  This programme includes proposals for the recruitment of additional child care staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware of the value of relevant drug education. The Health Promotion Unit of my Department is involved in the development and dissemination of a wide range of substance abuse prevention programmes targeted at selected groups.  These include:</P>
      <P>Drug Questions Local Answers &mdash; a community based training programme which examines drug problems at local level and seeks to provide local answers.</P>
      <P>Parent Education on Alcohol, Drugs and Family Communication &mdash; a programme developed by the Health Promotion Unit with the Cork Social and Health Education Project of the Southern Health Board, which aims to enhance the skills and personal attributes of parents and their children with a view to the long-term prevention of drug and alcohol misuse.</P>
      <P>Solvent Abuse &mdash; a programme developed in association with the National Youth Council of Ireland, which aims to assist young people in personal skills development thereby enabling them to be informed and decisive in relation to solvent abuse offers.  It is suitable for use by the informal education sector such as youth and community leaders and also in the formal education sector, special schools and by the juvenile liaison scheme of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;&mdash; a programme developed in conjunction with the Psychological Service of the Department of Education with assistance from the Mater Dei Counselling Centre.  It is a comprehensive drug education programme, with the overall aim of enabling students to develop their ability to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit also develops and distributes a wide range of materials for both the professional and <Col N="1420" /> the general public, including leaflets, videos and posters.  The literature and posters are available free of charge from the unit's public office, and the videos are available on a two week loan basis.</P>
    <P>The drug awareness campaign of my Department is not just about highlighting the dangers of drug abuse, but also about giving people the opportunity to develop and practise the skills necessary to resist pressures to use various substances of abuse.</P>
    <P>My Department is in discussion with the Department of Education and the Eastern Health Board concerning the development of further targeted drug education and health promotion measures for inner city and high risk areas.  In developing such education regard must be had not only to the content, but also to the most appropriate format of the programme and the most effective channels of dissemination.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board will shortly appoint a drugs education officer who will be particularly involved in developing initiatives with groups in high risk areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I understand from the Department of the Environment that the only area seriously affected by damage to the ozone layer, which protects the earth from excessive levels of ultra-violet radiation, is over the Antarctic region of the southern hemisphere. Over the Arctic region of the northern hemisphere a small hole in the ozone layer each spring has been identified. Worldwide, the ozone reduction is very slight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> Increased exposure to ultra-violet radiation can cause skin ailments ranging from simple burns to cancer.  The Department of Health has produced public information leaflets &mdash; General Health Information for People Travelling Abroad and The Sun Seekers Guide to Health.  Both of these leaflets provide advice on exposure to the sum. The Meterological Office has recently set up a warning system to advise the public when excessive levels of ultra-violet radiation may occur.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was agreed.  Ireland is a party to the Montreal Protocol which seeks to reduce the production of ozone depleting substances and, ultimately, to phase them out completely.  Ireland strongly supports the progressively tighter controls on ozone depleting substances. From a public health perspective, measures that seek to reduce exposure to excessive levels of ultra-violet radiation are to be welcomed and will contribute to reducing the incidence of burns, skin disease and cancer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A claim was lodged by SIPTU on behalf of ambulance personnel and controllers in provincial locations in 1993.  The claim sought parity of basic pay with their counterpart grades in the Dublin ambulance service where agreement had already been reached.  In February 1994 during the pay talks which formed part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> discussions, agreement was reached to restore basic pay parity with Dublin, payment conditional on agreement to a range of productivity-efficiency <Col N="1422" /> measures, with referral for binding third party decision in the event of disagreement on any of the proposed measures.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been taking place since then to try to reach agreement on a number of productivity-flexibility measures.  This has been a complex set of discussions in the context of the publication, in December 1993, of the report of the review group on the ambulance service which heralded a new strategy for dealing with the major policy issues which had arisen in the ambulance service and which had not been addressed in a comprehensive way by the health services.</P>
      <P>A number of outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Relations Commission in January 1995.  Arising from these conferences a set of proposals were agreed and put to a ballot of the membership.  In July 1995 SIPTU advised that the proposals had been rejected.  A number of meetings have been held since then to try to progress these talks to a satisfactory conclusion. One meeting has already been held this week at the LRC and a further meeting is scheduled for next week.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that this issue can be resolved at a very early date.  With the monetary aspects of this deal already agreed, the Department is anxious, at this stage, to finalise the details of the productivity and flexibility measures as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received any request from the Irish Association of Care Workers to establish a Government task force on this matter.  Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which was brought into operation on 31 October 1995, enables health boards to provide support and assistance to young people who have left the care of the board until they attain 21 years of age.  It also allows boards to arrange for an individual to complete his or her education in cases where they are over 21 years of age.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need to ensure that effective measures are taken in order that young people receive support on leaving care in making the transition to independent living.  The draft Guide to Standards in Children's Residential Centres published by my Department, contains guidelines on steps health boards and residential centres should take to prepare young people for independent living.  It is intended, following consultation with the health boards, that the draft Guide to Standards in Children's Residential Centres will form the basis for the drafting of regulations this year on the registration of children's residential centres pursuant to Part VIII of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>Decisions as to the locations to be used and the optimum time to commence film production rest with the independent producers and are subject to change depending on many variable factors.  My Department does not therefore have reliable information on the number of productions in progress at any given time, their location, or the number of film projects which could yet emerge as part of a particular year's level of production.</P>
      <P>However, to assist the Deputy I have made informal inquiries and my best information is that some six productions, including independent television productions and animation series, are currently being made in Ireland. Some four other films have already completed principal photography this year.  At this point, which is still early, there are some further fourteen films and two television productions scheduled to film in Ireland in the summer and autumn.  Previous trends would suggest that further projects will emerge as the year progresses.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to give concrete information regarding locations.  However my inquiries indicate that Counties Cavan, Clare, Derry, Donegal, Dublin, Galway, Monaghan and Wicklow have been used or will be used as locations for film productions this year.  It is likely that other locations will emerge as the year progresses.  It is not possible to be more specific at this point.</P>

    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 357 of 23 January 1996 which included a tabular statement of the organisations in each county which were allocated grants under the sports capital programme in 1995.  Records are not maintained in such a way that would enable me to provide details of funding on a county by county basis for other categories given the nature of the funding arrangements. A large proportion of overall funding is allocated to national bodies, many of whom disburse the funding to individuals and projects throughout the State.</P>

Included in these measures was a clear statement that &ldquo;no steps should be taken to legalise or decriminalise the use of &ldquo;soft drugs&rdquo; such as cannabis&rdquo;.

      <P>Arising out of the recommendations of the special task force on <Col N="1443" /> security for the elderly, a sum of £2 million was made available to my Department to provide grant-aid to voluntary groups in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  Subsequently, the Department established an advisory committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association for Victim Support, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána are represented, to devise a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds are targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money is achieved.  The scheme, entitled scheme of community support for older people was advertised on Wednesday, 29 May, in the national newspapers.  The deadline for receipt of applications is 28 June 1996.</P>
      <P>The scheme is open to any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people.</P>
      <P>Funding will be available for smallscale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, doors chains, door locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people.  Vulnerability is defined in terms of advanced age, disability, isolation &mdash; social or otherwise &mdash; and those who have previously been victims of crime.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant that will be made available to any voluntary organisation will be 90 per cent of the total cost of the project.  However, the actual grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs.  It is envisaged that in practice grants allocated will only cover 50 per cent of the total cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications will be assessed by the Department's regional managers with the assistance of a regional advisory committee.  The composition of these committees mirrors that of the national advisory committee referred to above. Regional managers will have the power <Col N="1444" /> to authorise grants and all payments will be made from the Department's Regional offices.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of grant schemes for voluntary and community groups, including the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, scheme of grants for locally-based women's groups, scheme of grants for locally-based men's groups and scheme of grants for lone parents. These are all once-off grant schemes. Details of all grants paid under these various schemes in previous years have been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.</P>
      <P>These schemes concentrate on providing support for local self-help groups, community development initiatives, welfare rights and information and the provision of seed capital to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.  Any organisation that feels that it can fulfil these criteria is eligible to apply for funding from my Department under the appropriate scheme.  Grants were not paid under these schemes in 1995 to groups in County Meath in respect of services for people with disabilities.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Health has responsibility for funding of voluntary organisations providing social services appropriate to the health services.  This includes organisations providing services for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, agreement was reached last year with my colleague, the Minister for Health, on more appropriate arrangements for the funding of voluntary and community organisations so as to remedy the considerable degree of overlap which existed in the supports provided to voluntary organisations as between my Department and the health services. It was decided that the Department of Health would have exclusive responsibility for the funding of organisations providing personal social services to the elderly, people with mental handicap and physical disabilities and other people needing social services.  The Carers' Association, given its primary role of representing the interests and needs of carers in the home, would come within that category.</P>
      <P>My Department, on the other hand, now concentrates on support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information services, and seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.  Accordingly, in relation specifically to welfare rights and information services, it is open to any voluntary or community organisation to apply to my Department for assistance towards the cost of providing those services.  Grants are generally made on a once-off basis to assist with the start-up costs of innovative projects leading to an improvement in the provision of information to disadvantaged groups.  However, there is no provision for funding towards the ongoing operating costs of such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Durkan, met with the <Col N="1446" /> Carers' Association at their request on 4 June 1996 to discuss their work and particularly their funding situation.  All applications including the Carers' Association application are examined to identify what entitlement to assistance, if any, there is under various funding schemes, including welfare rights and information services, operated by my Department.  Deputies will appreciate that even those applications which are eligible have to be prioritised.  In addition the making of grants by the Department of Social Welfare to organisations who do not come within our remit reduces the funds available for those organisations who are eligible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that I am fully committed to supporting the role of voluntary and community organisations in improving the quality of life for people dependent on social welfare and in empowering them to change their situation for the better.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons maintenance allowance scheme is not being abolished.  The scheme is being improved and renamed disability allowance and responsibility for the administration of the scheme is being transferred from health boards to my Department.  The transfer will take place later this year under powers given in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are currently in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance will be automatically transferred to disability allowance and any existing entitlement to secondary benefits &mdash; free travel, electricity allowance, telephone rental, television licence, fuel <Col N="1447" /> allowance &mdash; will continue.  The Act also makes provision for a number of improvements in the scheme.  The means test is being improved in relation to the assessment of capital, including a disregard of the first £2,000 and in relation to the assessment of the earnings of a working spouse where a disregard on the lines of that applying for unemployment assistance will apply to disability allowance.</P>
    <P>In addition to a more favourable means assessment, persons in receipt of disability allowance will also benefit from the following improvements: two full personal rates of payment will be paid where both of a couple are eligible for the allowance, a couple in this situation currently receive the rate appropriate to a person with an adult dependant; where a customer is admitted to hospital, payment of disability allowance will continue for 13 weeks, this is currently restricted to eight weeks in any calendar year; if a dependent child remains in full-time education, an increase will be paid in respect of himher up to 22 years of age, currently an increase is paid to 21 years only; a dependent child allowance will no longer be terminated if the child is in hospital for more than eight weeks; customers who are dissatisfied with a decision on their claim may make an appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already pointed out in this House recently, the Government has been responding to the particular problem of long-term unemployment through a variety of targeted measures.  These include the development of more employment friendly taxation and social welfare regimes and the introduction in this year's budget of a series of precisely targeted employment measures:&mdash; the splitting of the Community employment (CE) programme into two distinct options (a) a part-time integration option, and (b) a part-time jobs option and the better targeting of the programme at the long-term unemployed; introduction of a new pilot whole-time jobs option; introduction of a new recruitment subsidy scheme called Jobstart; introduction of a new work experience programme called Work-Place; introduction of special measures for 18-19 year olds; the extension of back to work allowance scheme; the retention of certain benefits for those returning to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the local employment service represents an important component of the Government's response to tackling long-term unemployment.  The distinctive additional elements of this service, in providing an individually tailored progression path towards employment for its clients and in ensuring that there is well co-ordinated employment service delivery at local level, should yield real benefits in terms of securing employment for long-term unemployed persons, as the Service develops.  The fact that it is initially launched in 14 areas, including the major unemployment black spots in the country means that it <Col N="1450" /> is first being targeted where it is most crucially needed.</P>
    <P>My plans for 1996 are that the local employment service should be consolidated in these 14 areas and subject to an initial evaluation before the service is expanded on a planned basis to other areas.  In this way we can ensure that the service is developed to maximum effect for its client population.</P>
    <P>Training is another important component in any measure of active labour market interventions aimed at addressing the problems of long-term unemployment, given the strong link between low levels of education attainment and long-term unemployment.  I will be addressing this problem in the White Paper on Human Resource Development which I will be submitting to the Government shortly for consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are the on-going activities of the industrial development agencies which continue to make a substantial contribution to job creation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The statistics sought by the Deputy are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Full Year 1995</i>
    </P>
    <P>Job Gains. 25,473: Job Losses, 15,122; Net. 10,351.  (These figures cover the activities of IDA Ireland, Forbairt, Údarás na Gaeltachta and SFADCo).</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in CEB-assisted firms there were 2,887 full-time and 815 part-time jobs created during 1995.</P>
    <P>The full results of the 1995 Labour Force survey &mdash; position at mid-April 1995 &mdash; which have just recently been released, show an increase in the numbers at work of 52,000, 4.4 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The criteria by which areas will be selected for extremely severely handicapped status include the presence of a high proportion of extremely poor land of limited grazing potential which could be described as rough grazing land, and also the presence of excessive climatic conditions such as higher levels of rainfall and windspeed than elsewhere.  The selection of the specific areas is being facilitated by the use of satellite imagery, which helps to clearly define the boundaries of rough grazing land.</P>
      <P>At the press conference on 23 May 1996 to announce details of the new areas being designated as disadvantaged, I referred to the areas being considered for the new category of extremely severely handicapped.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, due to a typing error, County Cavan did not appear in the list of counties which are being considered. I can assure the Deputy that deserving areas in Cavan will be given full consideration when the final selection of areas is being made.</P>

Organisations and individuals can avail of the public consultation process to raise the issue of the proposed routes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the majority of fisheries are either privately owned or without proper title and that only a small number of fisheries are under State ownership.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of State fisheries are managed by the central and regional fisheries boards which are independent statutory bodies charged with responsibility for the protection, conservation, development and improvement of fisheries in general.  Many of these State fisheries are leased, mainly to angling clubs, following public tender.  These licences provide, among other matters, that angling be made available to local and visiting anglers at reasonable rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> The division of fisheries into sections, known as beats, is an internationally established practice designed to both afford comfortable and uncrowded fishing to the angler and to exploit fish stocks on a rational basis consistent with conservation requirements.  Such a system is operating on many fisheries managed directly, or leased, by the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there are no plans at present to sell off those State fisheries which are owned by the fisheries boards.  The other State agencies, such as the Office of Public Works, ESB, Coillte, etc., in whom the ownership of certain fisheries is vested keep my Department and the fisheries boards informed of developments in relation to the management of their fisheries. There are no indications at present that these agencies propose to sell off these fisheries.  The Central Fisheries Board is, however, reviewing its policy in relation to the management of these fisheries.</P>
