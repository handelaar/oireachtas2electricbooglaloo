    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The second report, from the Attorney Genreal, on the Implementation of the Report of the Review Group, published on 28 May 1996, referred to the following points on which progress was achieved: the appointment of two additional legal assistants and three additional senior draftsmen; engaging three parliamentary draftsmen on a contract basis; the appointment of both a head of administration and a systems and services manager; and the financial allocation made available for ongoing improvements in staffing and office equipment, especially information technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further progress has continued on a number of fronts since the publication of the second report. These include: in line with the strategic management initiative, the Office of the Attorney General is concluding work on a statement of strategy; two additional legal assistants have been appointed and the Attorney General has recently assigned a legal assistant from the office to act as a legal attaché to Ireland's permanent representation in Brussels.  The legal assistant in question will perform the very valuable task of assisting other members of Ireland's permanent representation <Col N="3" /> in relation to legal matters which may arise on proposed legislation emanating from the institutions of the European Union.  She will also be available to attend EU meetings in Brussels where legal issues arise: the increase in staffing numbers of the current figure of 68.5 from 61 at the end of March 1995, and 45.5 when the Government took office in December 1994.</P>
    <P>Of course, increased staffing and financial allocation is not the complete answer to the difficulties faced by the Office of the Attorney General. The Government is committed to ensuring that the Office of the Attorney General is a modern and fully effective branch of the Government service. Since we took office we have embarked on a major task of computerising the main procedures in the office.  This major task was commenced in early 1995 and will continue into 1997.</P>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Harney on 18 June 1996, I outlined how ongoing work to improve case and correspondence tracking in the Office of the Attorney General had progressed.  At that time the office had just implemented phase 2 of its case-tracking system with continuing expert assistance from the Civil Service Centre for management and organisation development of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Since then the office has concentrated on establishing phase 2 in the day-to-day operations of the office.  The development of such an information technology based system across a whole organisation has the potential to deliver clear benefits to the organisation and its clients.  The achievement of these benefits requires the expertise and commitment of all involved.  This commitment is very much in evidence in the office.  It also requires ongoing information technology development, IT training and IT support. This has been the focus of the office's efforts since the implementation of phase 2.  Following their initial expertise of using phase 2, some refinements and enhancements considered desirable by the staff of the office have also been incorporated.</P>
    <P>Work on phase 3 is now beginning.  The main aim of this phase will be to link the office's wordprocessing facilities to the case-tracking system. In other words, enhancing the link between internal and outgoing correspondence with correspondence received.</P>
    <P>In July 1996, I launched the Chronological Tables of the Statutes 1922-1995, which provides detailed information on the effects of legislation enacted since 1922 on all statutes enacted before and after that year.  This publication was produced electronically, in camera-ready format, using the information technology facilities available in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Modernisation is also taking place in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  A wideranging review of the office by a management consultancy firm is nearing completion.  It is expected that implementation, where appropriate, of the review <Col N="4" /> recommendations will bring about major improvements.  An information technology plan is in the course of preparation for that office.  In line with the plan, it is proposed to commence installation of an extensive computerised network next year.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Attorney General is chairing a group comprising senior managers from his office, including the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office and the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Departments of Finance, Justice and the Taoiseach as well as an independent legal consultant to provide a strategic overview of the law offices of the State.  The terms of reference of the group, require it to identify the strategic policy issues common to the law offices which require detailed examination and consideration.  The group held its first meeting on Thursday last, 10 October, and it will make recommendations to Government as soon as possible on action to ensure that the legal services provided to the State are structured and managed to provide a quality service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the study examining the feasibility of splitting the two functions of the Attorney General, that of legal adviser to the Government and upholder of the public interest in the courts of justice, been carried out, in view of the commitment on page 13 in the programme for Government?  In view of the matter in which the Attorney General conducted the case on behalf of the State against the late Brigid McCole, does the Taoiseach believe it urgent that these roles be separated before the proposed tribunal of inquiry is established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary questions to which I replied relate to the internal procedures of the office.  The Deputy now raises structural questions of a much wider character which are not within the remit of the questions tabled.</P>
      <P>There are arguments for and against the splitting of the office of Attorney General into what is known as the public interest role and the role of adviser to the Government which occupies 99.9 per cent of his time.  It is rare that the Attorney General has a role separate from that as adviser to the Government, usually where a public interest issue arises.  There would not be sufficient work for a separate person performing full time the public interest role the Deputy refers to.  For that reason, the proposal is not far advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also an issue that would be considered in the context of any review of the Constitution.  The Attorney General is a constitutional officer in that his or her role and office are described in the Constitution and can only be changed by means of an amendment to the latter.  The best method of considering the issue the Deputy raises would probably be by the all-party committee, on which the Deputy's party is represented by an eminent person, which is currently engaged in an examination <Col N="5" /> of all aspects of the Constitution and could make recommendations if it wished on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a large backlog of files in the Attorney General's office and does it take several months to receive an opinion from the Attorney General?  Are priority cases lagging far behind and running into difficulty in some Government Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any legal adviser has to prioritise his or her work, be they in private practice or an adviser to one client, as is the case with the Attorney General whose one client is the Government.  That is the normal operation in any law office and priority business is dealt with more quickly than other business.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any significant backlog in furnishing advice.  There may, however, be individual issues where the Attorney General has to refer an issue to independent counsel hired to advise on the issues.  The Attorney General must await that advice from the external counsel brought in to assist him before furnishing it to the Department that sought it.</P>
      <P>My impression is that the office of the Attorney General is working exceptionally well.  The Government has increased the staff of the office by almost 50 per cent since I became Taoiseach. We have also make an investment in information technology on a scale not seen since the office was created at the foundation of the State.  Both these tools exist for the furnishing of necessary advise in good and prompt order.  Having met the main staff in the Attorney General's office myself on a personal basis on numerous occasions, it seems to me the morale in the office is extremely high.  The people concerned are working to a high standard of excellence and are giving good service to the State.  However, if the Deputy is aware of some item on which legal advice is awaited and of which I am not aware, perhaps he will furnish it to me so I can examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I raise relating to the splitting of the two roles is not something I raise anew.  The Government gave a commitment in its programme to examine this matter.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say it is a matter for the Constitutional Review Committee.  Has the Taoiseach considered the matter?  Does he accept it is not always in the public interest that the Attorney General is the person who defends the Government and State agencies and the public interest?  Would he also accept that, in making an application to the court to deny the late Brigid McCole her anonymity, the Attorney General was not representing the public interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the matter in some detail since coming into Government.  As a result of that, it has come to my attention that the number of instances where the Attorney General is called upon to act separately from his role as adviser to the Government, in a role of defender <Col N="6" /> of the wider public interest, represents somewhere in the region of 0.1 per cent of his total workload.  It is a minute proportion of his work and might arise twice or three times in an entire year and then for maybe an hour's work.  I have considered the matter and foresee considerable difficulty in justifying to the taxpayer the idea of having somebody full time, a separate officer of the State, acting in the public interest role.  I have also outlined that any major structural change in the Attorney General's office would require a change in the Constitution because the Attorney General's office is provided for in the Constitution. The Constitution can be changed in this jurisdiction only by means of legislation approved by the people in a referendum.  One would want to have considered the matter carefully before proceeding with the proposal along those lines. That is the present state of my consideration of the issue, but further consideration is not excluded.</P>
      <P>One of the Deputies who has been most vocal and coherent in arguing for a separation of the two roles is Deputy Michael McDowell of Deputy Harney's Party.  The Deputy is a member of the Constitutional Review Group chaired by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  I have no doubt he will avail of the opportunity to advance his arguments in favour of the Deputy Harney's proposals, but will consider the difficulties I outlined which she no doubt considers weighty too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it was events in the Attorney General's office that put the Taoiseach in his present position, I am not surprised he is kind with resources to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not mistaken.  People are waiting months for opinions.  Is it the case that nothing is delegated in the Office of the Attorney General and that an opinion is not released until the Attorney General clears it himself?  Is that the difficulty?  If it is, does the Taoiseach consider that procedure to be correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to say that the reason for the change of Government was related to happenings in the Office of the Attorney General. That is not the case.  History will show there was a breakdown in confidence between the two parties in Government and that was the reason. The Deputy is mistaken in focusing unduly narrowly on one office or one event in that regard. However, that is a matter for others to discuss. The Deputy's assumptions are not entirely correct, although undoubtdly event in the Office <Col N="7" /> of the Attorney General precipitated some of the difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the case that the Attorney General sees each opinion furnished by his office. That has been the case under every Attorney General and it is appropriate because, under the Constitution, the Attorney General acts personally as the adviser to the Government and not officers in his office.  In certain cases where there is conflict with past work it is appropriate that the Attorney General should see and approve &mdash; if he does not necessarily write in every case &mdash; the advice furnished to the Government.  That is a reasonable approach and it need not change at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of extra unestablished staff &mdash; barristers and a solicitor &mdash; were recruited to the Office of the Attorney General to deal with legislation.  They are employed on a part-time basis.  How many extra legal personnel have been recruited on a full-time basis since the change of Government?  The part-time personnel are employed on a daily fee basis.  Would it not be better to employ them full-time and pay them a full-time salary to be present all the time?  Of the six legal staff dealing with legislation in the Office of the Attorney General, four were recruited recently on a daily fee basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people prefer to work on a daily fee rather than a full-time basis.  It is important that we get the best people available on mutually acceptable terms.  The practice of people working in the Office of the Attorney General on a contract which involves the payment of a daily fee or payment on the basis of work delivered has worked reasonably well.  It was not originated by this Attorney General but he has developed it and used it to enable the Government to clear backlogs in drafting legislation. I do not see any difficulty with the present arrangements.  They are working well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked in the first instance was about the number of extra unestablished staff in the legal area who have been recruited on a daily fee basis as opposed to the number recruited on a full-time basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that most of the people recruited on that basis have been taken on in the drafting area and that the number of people employed on a daily fee basis is not large. The Deputy will be aware that the Office of the Attorney General gets advice from practising barristers on a fee basis.  The arrangement whereby people are contracted to the office either as full-time staff or on a daily fee basis is separate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the changeover to a full-time Attorney General, whereby the Attorney General has no outside cases or work, has been completed?  The position was not 100 per cent full-time in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that matter on a previous occasion.  It does not come within the purview of the question, which referred to the procedures of the office and information technology in the office.  The question did not relate to the status of the Attorney General and whether he is full-time.  The Attorney General has maintained his status as a practising barrister. It is necessary for him to do that.  In practice 100 per cent of his work is for the State, which is his sole client.  He makes the necessary arrangements to ensure his status as a practising barrister is maintained for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Taoiseach's earlier replies that, having considered the separation of the two roles, he believes splitting the role of the Attorney General could not be justified for financial and other reasons.  That being the case, who does the Taoiseach propose to represent <Col N="9" /> the public interest before the tribunal of inquiry into blood contamination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not come to a final conclusion on the issue; I have indicated the current status of my thinking.  The matter is currently under consideration.  Any issue the Deputy wishes to raise about the tribunal should be raised during the debate on the proposal to establish a tribunal, which will be held later this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is the person I should question in this regard because he has responsibility for the Office of the Attorney General. There is much concern about how the Attorney General conducted the case against the late Brigid McCole.  There is also concern among the women affected about who will represent the public interest at the proposed tribunal of inquiry.  The Taoiseach should answer those questions. I would not be happy to have them addressed to the Minister for Health.  If the Taoiseach is not in a position to answer them today he should answer them before the tribunal is established so that there will not be a repeat of the beef tribunal where the public interest was not represented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to anticipate a debate in the House.  The Government operates on the basis of collective responsibility.  A proposal put forward by any member of the Government is collectively agreed by all members of the Government and they are collectively accountable for it.  Therefore, the issue of who sets forth Government policy on a matter should not cause the Deputy concern.</P>
      <P>As far as the public interest is concerned, the tribunal will act in the public interest and in accordance with its terms of reference, which give it a public interest function.  The Deputy has made her views known; such views have been made known before.  They will be considered in the course of the Government's consideration of the matter.  I do not wish to anticipate what the Government will put forward and it would be inappropriate for me to be pressed further until it is finalised.  It will be dealt with then.  The Deputy should accept that any Minister is entitled to express and explain Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of the tribunal, did the Attorney General act for the Government in the recent McCole court case?  He has an overriding responsibility to all our citizens.  The public interest arises only in 0.1 per cent of cases.  This was very obviously one of the 0.1 per cent of cases.  It was not appropriate for the Attorney General to act on behalf of the Government in so sensitive a case which has touched so many people.  The overriding responsibility of the <Col N="10" /> Attorney General was to represent the public interest in the women that were affected.</P>

I explained to the Deputy there are certain cases where the Attorney General, under statutes which in many cases predate the creation of his office, has a responsibility to act for the public as distinct from the Government.  Where the government is not involved, he acts for the public.  That is a separate role over and above his primary role as adviser to the Government on Government business.  Those two categories of work are defined by the nature of that work.</P>
      <P>I will not comment on the handling of a particular court case.  It is important the House be aware of the need to maintain an appropriate separation of functions between the courts and the Oireachtas in a matter of this nature.  It is important to recognise that all counsel who appear before a judge in a court are acting to assist the court and it is a matter for the courts to regulate.  If criticism of the conduct of counsel is required, it is not a matter for the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas might cross the boundary in what is appropriate in terms of the separation of powers if it criticised individual counsel in individual cases.  I am sure the Deputy would not wish us to do that.</P>

      <P>Is the only legislation governing the role of the Attorney General the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which predates our Constitution by a considerable time?  We have not recently had a debate on the role of the Attorney General.  Under the Taoiseach's programme, A Government of Renewal, the role of the Attorney General in relation to the State was to be considered.  That Bill is still under consideraction. Is the Taoiseach still considering splitting the office?  Is it still on the Government agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation in preparation to split the office of the Attorney General. Such legislation would not accord properly with the Constitution, which is the most recent legislation on the office of the Attorney General. The Constitution is in itself legislation that applies directly and legislation to change the Constitution is not currently under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Deputy said, the issue has been considered.  I have already indicated in responses to Deputy Harney some of my concerns on the issue but the all-party committee currently looking at the Constitution on the basis <Col N="12" /> of the Whitaker report is not precluded from examining this matter if it wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Drafting of the necessary legislation on Cabinet confidentiality has identified constitutional, legal and administrative issues which require further considerations.  These include (a) how the doctrine of collective responsibility, from which the whole issue of Cabinet confidentiality derives, enshrined in Article 28.4.2º of the Constitution is to be preserved, (b) the manner in which the proposed exception to the confidentiality rule is to be incorporated into the Constitution in a situation where the principle itself is implied rather than stated, (c) whether the test should comprise overriding public interest as referred to in the Report of the Constitution Review Group rather than a matter of grave public importance, (d) the role, if any, to be given to the courts in testing overriding public interest and the effect this would have on the operation of Government and as between the executive, legislative and judicial institutions of the State, (e) the manner in which evidence of statements made at Government meetings is to be provided to a tribunal or committee of inquiry in a situation where, as a matter of principle, discussions are not written down, decisions only being recorded and communicated to those directly concerned and (f) the application of whatever rule or principle is agreed to Government Committees, whose very existence has until recently been regarded entirely as a matter of Government exercising their executive power under the Constitution in ways that to them seem best and for which they are answerable to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>As these matters are of a seriousness to warrant further consideration, it is not proposed to hold a referendum on the Cabinet confidentiality issue this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues at state in the bail referendum are equally complex, but following the murder of a journalist we suddenly received a commitment.  The Government wants to run away from this issue.  What people want is a reversal of the decision made during the beef tribunal.  They were happy with what they believed the law was until then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that three of the six judges who examined this issue, once in the High Court and two in the Supreme Court, felt there was no absolute doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality? <Col N="13" /> Did the Taoiseach consider a previous proposal of mine, which was to introduce legislation defining the limits of Cabinet confidentiality which could be tested by the new Supreme Court.  When I proposed this, the Taoiseach thought it was a good idea and said he would consider it.  Was it considered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the matter as a result of the Deputy's representations.  I concluded it was not a feasible approach because the Government may not promote legislation which is unconstitutional.  Any legislation altering the decision of the Supreme Court in the case the Deputy referred to, which proclaimed the doctrine of absolute Cabinet confidentiality, would be unconstitutional and could not be promoted by the Government.  That is why the Deputy's suggestion, although ingenious and constructive, is not one I could proceed with.  Unless the matter is determined again by the Supreme Court in a separate case and in a different way, the only manner in which it can be dealt with, if at all, is by means of constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>I was anxious not to see this matter put on the long finger.  This is the reason I did not avail of the original option of referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission.  I decided the Government should take this matter on board and draft some proposals.  It was in the process of drafting these proposals that the difficulties I have outlined became evident.  Furthermore, the Whitaker committee, which is reviewing the Constitution, specifically advised caution in changing the Constitution in regard to this matter.  It also recommended that if there is to be a lifting of the doctrine of absolute confidentiality of Cabinet discussions the test applied should be different from the one upon which the Government was working.  All parties were represented on the Whitaker committee, which recommended that the overriding public interest should be the test. The basis upon which the Government had been working was that it would have to be a matter of grave public importance.  These phrases may sound as if they mean the same thing but they do not.  That is why the matter has to be considered further.  We are not ready to produce any proposals we can stand over before the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government gave a commitment for the holding, at the earliest opportunity, of a referendum on relaxing Cabinet confidentiality where the public interest demands it.  Does the Taoiseach agree it still has to happen?  Is he saying it is deferred because it is complex?  What is his precise position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Supreme Court decision, the citizen's right of access to Government papers and documents is subject to question.  This was discussed in the constitutional review report, which gave the various options about how this matter should be dealt with.  Is there a case for Cabinet confidentiality?  This must be clarified as a matter <Col N="14" /> of urgency.  I do not understand how a commitment given in the programme for Government is being ignored.  This is the second question relating to the matter today.  Where does the review on an issue which has been through the Supreme Court stand?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying for certain that we will find an appropriate form of amendment we can stand over.  A decision has not been reached.  We will not be able to put forward a proposal this year because of a number of specific problems I have identified which deserve further consideration.  The most important of them is probably the one of collective responsibility.  The Constitution requires that the Government act on the basis of collective responsibility in all its discussions. It is important to recognise that if the idea of Cabinet confidentiality is departed from, collective responsibility may go out the door also. If individual Members find themselves in court testifying against one another as to the content of a particular discussion, they may not have acted collectively but individually in terms of the way in which they contributed in Cabinet discussions.</P>
      <P>There is concern about the impact of a breach or lifting of Cabinet confidentiality on the question of collective responsibility.  We may be moving towards a situation where Ministers are individually rather than collectively responsible.  This would be a major change in constitutional practices maintained in this country for a long time and may not be one that one would wish to make. It is a matter which requires serious and fundamental discussion and debate.  I hope there will be reasonable learned and considered debate on these issues on the basis of my listing the Government's concerns.  It may be useful that I have put the issues on the record in a manner which enables them to be dissected, criticised or commented upon before a decision is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions should be preserved and any change considered at any stage would be only in the most grave and exceptional circumstances.  The difficulty is that even if it is done in thise cases, it may have unintended adverse effects on the quality of Cabinet discussion, along the lines I have referred to in my reply.  It is a matter that can be discussed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has certainly changed his mind on this matter.  Is he suggesting that even a corrupt Government is entitled to collective responsibility and absolute confidentiality? Surely the Taoiseach accepts this could not possibly be the case.  We do not have confidentiality at the moment.  During the famous committee which looked into the events of 1994, some members of the then Cabinet recalled at great length what did or did not happen.  Perhaps we will have the same in the High Court in London this week.  It is a selective confidentiality, which is not acceptable.  I believe the Taoiseach should proceed with a referendum in this area to return to where we were prior to the Supreme Court decision in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The law was not clear prior to the Supreme Court ruling; if it had been, the court would not have come to that decision.  The law was unclear prior to that point and it is now clear, perhaps in a form which is unacceptable to the Deputy and others but clear nonetheless.  The option of going back to the <i>status quo ante</i>, as the Deputy suggests, is not open to me because there was no <i>status quo ante</i> which contained any degree of clarity.</P>
      <P>As far as the issue of a corrupt Government is concerned, I would want Members of this House who are part of the Government to ensure that the Government would not behave in such a fashion.  Where members of a Government feel that any transaction being engaged in is wrong, it is open to them to take the logical step of distancing themselves from it and bringing the matter to a head in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether there should be a lifting of Cabinet confidentiality, that is not a matter on which <Col N="16" /> I have come to a final view.  As I have indicated in the House there are a number of problems, none of which was challenged by the Deputy in her many questions.  The problems are real and as someone interested in the process of government the Deputy should address herself to those concerns in a reasonable and serious way rather than make the slightly tendentious and unkind statements she has.</P>

The programme for Government used the phrase &ldquo;openness, transparency and accountability&rdquo;.

      <Quest>the progress, if any, in the investigation into the murder of Veronica Guerin; and her views on whether there is a requirement for an organised crime unit within the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime.</Quest>

      <P>It is not the practise for the Minister for Justice to make statements to the House about the progress of individual <Col N="18" /> Garda investigations.  All I can propose to say in this case is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the matter is the subject of a continuing Garda investigation which will be concluded as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matter, there is already a range of specialist units operating within the Garda Síochána which target organised crime. These include the criminal assets bureau, the national drugs unit, the central detective unit, the investigation unit and the bureau of fraud investigations. I am satisfied, from my contacts with the Garda Commissioner, that the activities of those units are sufficiently co-ordinated and focused to deal adequately with organised crime and that the existing structures and their management are best suited to meet the challenge posed by organised crime.  The Commissioner has also informed me that there is no practical policing justification for a new and separate organised crime unit and that, of course, he keeps the effectiveness of all of the above units under continuous review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has stated publicly in recent days that the suspects in the Veronica Guerin case have been narrowed down to a few criminals and that it is hoped to bring charges.  Surely the Minister, who is accountable to the House for the Garda Síochána, could at least advise as to whether there will be a charge in this case.  Can she say whether a person or persons will be charged in the near future for this horrendous offence?</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the Minister's reply, the gardaí investigating this case appear to be meeting with success in the battle against organised crime, which bolsters the argument for a special organised crime unit within the Garda to tackle this scourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy's question because I am not the investigating authority. That is the Garda Síochána.  When it has completed its investigations it will send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who will make a judgment about whether there will be a prosecution. I will enter into a discussion on the investigation of the awful crime we all want to see brought to a conclusion.  As the Deputy knows from newspaper articles, etc., many statements have been taken by the Garda Síochána &mdash; I have been seen a figure of up to 1,000.  The investigation is ongoing and I am not in a a position to answer his question on whether someone will be charged.  That will happen at the end of the investigation if it is so decided by the DPP.</P>
      <P>His second point was that the gardaí appear to be having great success in the investigation of this crime.  I believe this is because the Commissioner has decided to use the existing units to the best effect.  He has assured me there is no need for a separate unit.  There are already a number of units available to the gardaí where specialised people come together to deal with a crime such as the one mentioned in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>It is reported that there were 12 contract killings over the past two years but no one has been charged in respect of any of these offences, let alone convicted.  This underlines the argument that there should be an organised crime unit within the Garda Síochána.  The success of the unit now operating against organised crime in the investigation of the Veronica Guerin case further emphasises the need for such a unit.</P>

      <P>Regardless of whatever title the Deputy, the media or I wish to put on it, every murder is investigated as a murder and not as a murder of a specific person or kind.  Until such investigation is completed it is not for me or the Deputy to say whether something is a contract murder, a domestic violence murder, a crime of passion or a murder of any other description. These incidents were all murders and are being investigated by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Given the advice of the Garda Commissioner, I do not believe we need yet another unit.  There is a central detective unit, an investigation unit, a bureau of fraud investigation, a national drugs unit and a criminal assets bureau.  The resources of these units, depending on the way in which an investigation is proceeding, are available to the Garda Commissioner to deploy whatever way he considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>To announce the establishment of yet another unit is not a sufficient response.  The Garda Commissioner, the most senior member of the Garda Síochána, is satisfied that the resources and units he has available now are adequate to investigate crimes.  He has also assured me that he keeps the effectiveness of all these units under continuous review.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister start living in the real world and acknowledge that there is a subculture of organised crime which is inextricably linked to a drugs subculture and that in this context it is clear there were at least 12 contract killings in the country over the past two years for which nobody was charged, let alone convicted? Will she also recognise that one must fight fire with fire and put the structures in place to fight what is a phenomenon in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>These were killings and murders. The Deputy, the media or I may describe them as we like but for the Garda Síochána they are murders that require to be investigated and are being investigated.  Neither the Deputy nor I can say at present whether somebody will be convicted. People have not been convicted for some of these murders, others are in the process of being investigated.</P>
      <P>It is not for me, the members of the media or anybody else to decide that because a murder occured in specific circumstances it needs a particular unit to investigate it.  The units are being used effectively, the murders are being investigated and I hope that before too long people will be called to account for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> People have been charged for many murders over the years, while nobody has been brought to account for others which were never labelled as, for example, contract murders.  That is the nature of these kind of crimes.  The gardaí will continue to do all in their power to bring somebody to account.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the number of prisoners granted temporary release from Irish prisons in 1995 and to date in 1996; the plans, if any she has to restrict or terminate this practice; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18402/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of individuals granted varying periods of short-term temporary release has averaged about 4,000 a year for the last five years.  In 1993, the latest year for which accurate figures are available, the number was 4,212.  In that year, 3,564 individuals were granted full temporary release.</P>
      <P>I must stress that one cannot simply add these two figures together to arrice at a total number of individuals who obtained some from of temporary release in that year as there would be a significant overlap of individuals between the two groups.  For example, a prisoner may have received a day's temporary release to attend a funeral and subsequently been given full temporary release later in the year.  This prisoner would be counted in both sets of figures.  Figures are not kept in such a way as to readily given the exact extent of this overlap.</P>
      <P>Exact figures for 1995 and 1996 are not yet available.  However, indications are that the number of full temporary releases granted is now about 4,000 per year and approximately 4,500 individuals would be granted varying periods of short-term temporary release in the course of any one year.  Again, there would be a significant overlap of individuals between these two groups. I will, of course, be happy to let the Deputy have the exact information for 1995 and 1996 as it becomes available.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to terminate this practice.  The granting to temporary or early release &mdash; called parole in other jurisdictions &mdash; is a feature of persons systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.  I have outlined the positive reasons for the system in the past, as have my predecessors.</P>
      <P>However, I have acknowledged that some early released do arise due to shortage of prison accommodation. This has been the case for several years.  It would be wrong to suggest that this was the sole reason for early releases generally or, indeed, to imply that serious offenders are being released simply because of accommodation problems and without reference to other criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of releases to cope with accommodation pressures will be addressed by the provision <Col N="21" /> of additional accommodation announced by me in January and July of this year as part of a major package of measures to combat crime. The provision of 640 new spaces over the next 18 months, including 400 spaces for remand prisoners at Cloverhill, beside the existing place of detention at Wheatfield, will greatly ease the pressure on accommodation, especially in the committal prisons.  These new spaces, combined with other additional accommodation announced by me in February of this year, will mean an increase in available accommodation by the end of 1998 of approximately 880 spaces.  This represents a 40 per cent increase in accommodation.</P>
    <P>I also announced that I had obtained Cabinet approval for a new scheme involving intensive supervision initially of 100 prisoners on early release.  Furthermore, I got Government approval for the recruitment of ten additional probation and welfare officers to enable this scheme to be put into effect.</P>
    <P>In relation to temporary release concessions generally, I should explain that before granting temporary release, careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence.  As I said before, the overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases, is the safety of the public. While great care is taken in selecting individuals for release, I am not aware of any system which can guarantee that no individual will commit offences during the period of release.  The very regrettable reality is that some offenders will tend to re-offend irrespective of whether they are released early or serve every day of their sentence. The fact that some, despite the most careful selection, will tend to betray the trust placed in them, does not provide a basis for denying the possibility of release concessions to all offenders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the prison system is in chaos in the light of recent remarks by a judge to the effect that he would not impose a custodial sentence on a person convicted of burglary even though he should have because of the fact that the individual would be on the streets laughing at the system in a short space of time?  Would the Minister be generous enough to acknowledge that she should never have deferred or cancelled the prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy as they might have been close to completion today and that the revolving door prison policy, on which the Minister has provided an excellent historical review, has become an open door policy since she took office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a solicitor, the Deputy will be aware that, no more than anybody else, I as Minister for Justice cannot comment on what a judge does or does not say in the course of dealing with a case in our courts.  I do not accept that our prison system is in chaos.  However, I accept that we do not have enough prison places.  If there is chaos, it was in existence a long time before I took up office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> The proposals I am now putting in place will begin to tackle the shortage of places in our prisons. I gave figures for 1993 because they are accurate and I gave a ballpark figure for 1995 and 1996.  It is clear that it was not in 1995 or 1996 that we began to have an early or temporary release programme in place.</P>
    <P>At the risk of lecturing the Deputy, the Government's decision to postpone the building of the Castlerea programme to enable me to examine the entire prison system and make proposals has resulted in the fact that later this month the Department will take possession of the first 25 places in Castlerea and 68 places in the Curragh in November.  The Deputy is aware that the decision I inherited from the previous Government was that a prison would be provided in a former hospital in Castlerea.  However, the patients in the hospital did not move until August this year.</P>
    <P>This position would be the same if this or the previous Government was in office because alternative accommodation for the patients was not available.  It is untrue that this prison building programme would have been nearly completed at this stage.  I have repeatedly made this point to the Deputy and perhaps he hopes that by repeating it some people in the media who do not follow these issues might pick it up.  However, the Deputy is incorrect and the prison would not have been built now if the proposal I inherited had been pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works, under the chairmanship of Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, have been progressing the various projects under the accelerated prison building programme since July as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction of the building at Castlerea special unit &mdash; 25 places &mdash; has concluded and, following fit out, my Department will take possession of the new facility in late October or early November.  Construction work on the Curragh Prison &mdash; 68 places &mdash; is ongoing and is scheduled to conclude by the end of this month.  My Department will take possession of the new prison in <Col N="23" /> November.  Regarding D-wing of Limerick Prison &mdash; 55 places &mdash; detailed design work has been completed and tenders for construction were invited earlier this month.  Construction is planned to commence in January 1997 and to be completed in autumn that year.  The design and layout of the new women's prison &mdash; 60 places &mdash; has been agreed and observations arising from planning consultation are being examined and considered.  Completion of construction is scheduled for 1998.  The design and layout of Castlerea main prison &mdash; 125 places approximately &mdash; has been agreed.  Work is progressing on outline drawings and the preparation of tender documents will be concluded by the end of October. Completion of construction is scheduled for 1997.</P>
    <P>Taking into consideration the progress to date in planning the Wheatfield remand prison project &mdash; 400 places approximately &mdash; by officials of my Department and the Office of Public Works and the evaluation of the proposals received from the private sector for the construction of the new remand prison arising from a newspaper advertisement, I am satisfied this project remains on target for commencement of construction by May 1997 and completion during 1998.  In addition to the extra places already provided, and when all these projects are completed, it should be noted that there will be approximately 800 additional prison places.  I am satisfied that the overall programme to provide the additional prison places is making solid progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the provision by the State of 400 spaces for remand prisoners at Wheatfield Prison cannot be postponed until 1998?  Even without the proposed changes to the bail laws, which will place further stress on the system and on places, is the Minister aware that Ireland is currently in breach of its international obligations by not providing a separate remand centre?  Will she accept the urgency about this matter which was trumpeted following the unfortunate murder of Veronica Guerin has turned into lethargy in her Department?</P>
      <P>Why has the Department of Justice shown such a lack of interest and lethargy in responding to serious proposals from the private sector in May 1995 in relation to building the Wheatfield centre? It could have built the facility in a much shorter timeframe and at less expense than the current proposals the Minister mentioned.  What is the projected cost of the Wheatfield project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no lethargy in my Department regarding the provision of prison places. The Deputy does not mean to imply it but her knowledge of what is involved in planning and building a prison is lacking if she thinks a project can be announced one day and built the next, no matter who is involved in building it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of the Deputy's points is inaccurate. Nineteen contractor/developer groups submitted proposals to the Department arising from an <Col N="24" /> advertisement in some national newspapers on 20 August 1996 regarding the Government decision which was taken just a month previously.  Most of the groups consist of a number of elements, including building contractors, architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, and, in some cases, financial institutions, which have come together with a view for consideration for the provision of the new remand prison.  An important consideration in placing the advertisement in the newspapers was to gather information from interested parties on how they proposed to provide the new remand facility.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to submissions made in May 1995.  However, at that point, no decision had been made to build a remand prison. I accept such a prison should be available and this is why I secured Government approval to build such a facility, which will be the first targeted remand prison built in the State.  Whatever criticism may land on my desk about the absence of such a prison in the past, we are in the process of preparing and building such a facility now so that remand and convicted prisoners may be segregated.</P>
    <P>The concept of placing the advertisement was to gather information from people who spoke to Deputies and me at social functions saying they could build a prison and outlining how they would do it.  Nineteen contractors replied and the proposals received cover a wide range of options, including traditional tender and construction; design and build; design, build and finance; design, build, finance and operate; off-shelf projects, and management contractor methods. These proposals, with other known methods and variations, are being considered and evaluated with the assistance of the Office of Public Works, the experts in this area.  The main criteria used in the evaluation process are suitability for the project, good value for money and speed of delivery.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate at this point to outline the favoured method of procurement because the 19 submissions are being examined at present.  As soon as they have been fully examined, an announcement will be made as to how the project will proceed.  The Government has approved the finance for the remand facility and this should be taken into account.  The money is available but the Government may decide to operate a system whereby the private sector is more involved in this project than in others in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister about the projected cost of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I omitted to mention that the projected cost at this point is approximately £40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The projected cost for a prison with 400 spaces is £40 million which works out at £100,000 for each space.  Is the Minister aware that experience in Britain indicates that a new <Col N="25" /> medium security prison on a green field site, with accommodation for over 600 prisoners, could be built for under £50 million?  This represents a cost of £80,000 for each space, which is well below the cost of the planned facility at Wheatfield.</P>
      <P>The British experience also shows that the cost per space falls significantly when a new cell block is added to an existing prison because the same need for major expenditure on perimeter is not necessary.  Where did the Minister get the projected cost of £40 million?  Did the private sector project a lower cost for each prison space in discussions with Department officials as was the case in Britain?</P>
      <P>When the changes to the bail laws are implemented, hopefully in the new year following the referendum, where does the Minister propose to place the people who are denied bail under the new legislation?  Will they be placed in Mountjoy Jail, given that she stated a remand centre will not be available in the State until 1998?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to experience in the UK, I arranged for officials from my Department, accompanied by Office of Public Works personnel, to travel to Britain to examine the new style prisons and consider the best aspects.  This has been included in the process but, without the names of specific prisons, I am not aware of their costs.  The figure of £40 million is a ballpark one which was given to me as being the cost of a prison. Until we get down to the final details of awarding a contract and having the final drawings prepared, it is not possible to say how much it will cost.  I will endeavour to bring that cost down as much as possible but Deputies should be aware that although a wall has been built at Wheatfield, we need a secure prison inside the wall.  I do not want prisoners who while they are confined inside a wall, being able to get out of their cells and so on.</P>
      <P>I was asked where prisoners will go if and when the bail referendum is passed.  Until this remand centre is available they will go to where those who are denied bail at present, for fear of absconding or interfering with witnesses, are sent. That is where remand prisoners have been sent since it was made clear in 1966 that bail could be refused on those two grounds.  However, as soon as the remand centre is available they will be sent to it.  I cannot comment on the 600 prison places per 50 million people in the UK.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that the fact that the State will not be in a position to provide a separate remand centre until 1998, as projected, will give fuel and ammunition to those who oppose the change in our Constitution on the grounds that this State has an obligation to provide separate remand facilities under our international obligations?  Does she realise that the fact that the State is not in a position to provide such remand centres will give ammunition to those who will argue against the change in our Constitution in this regard?</P>

      <P>It is not for me to assess the arguments of those who are opposed to the referendum on bail.  They may use that argument or others.  If they are serious enough they will find some reasons to oppose changes in the bail law. This country does not have a separate remand facility and the Government is building one.  At present those who are remanded in custody are sent to our prisons so our prisons hold a mixture of people who are on remand and convicted criminals.  I am now trying to rectify this situation by building a remand prison.  It will be erected as fast as is humanly possible.  There have been many meetings to make progress on this building programme and it is a great tribute to those involved that I am able to say that construction will start early next year.  It took about five years from gestation to completion of the Wheatfield project.  I assure the Deputy it will not take five years to build this remand prison.</P>

      <P>While under our criminal law the general rule is that a person is not required to answer any questions in connection with an offence of which he or she is suspected, it would not be correct to say that there is an unqualified right to silence.  The general rule &mdash; which is in line with a general constitutional protection against self-incrimination &mdash; is subject to a number of statutory exceptions.</P>
      <P>Some of these were included in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Sections 18 and 19 of that Act allow a court or jury to draw inferences from an accused's failure or refusal in the course of Garda questioning to account for certain matters: marks on his or her person or clothing or presence in the vicinity of a crime.  These inferences cannot be drawn unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of failing or refusing to provide the relevant information might be.  While inferences can be treated as amounting to corroboration of other evidence the Act specifically provides that they cannot alone form the basis of a conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that in this area of our law conflicting and competing rights are at issue.  On the one hand it has been argued that the right to silence is an old and very important protection of a suspect's rights and that its removal could place in jeopardy those innocent of any crime.  On the other hand, the concerns which have been increasingly expressed in recent <Col N="27" /> times to the effect that the present situation helps those involved in very serious crimes to avoid conviction require that at the very least the law in this area is kept under constant review in the light of changes that have taken place in the nature of crime and the nature of society.</P>
    <P>The central issue involved is the balance which has to be struck between the rights of an accused and the protection of the community.  The House will be aware that during the passage of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 through the Oireachtas the Government concluded that the right to silence in drug trafficking cases should be further clarified.  I should say that Opposition Deputies also tabled amendments to that effect.  The Act will allow inferences to be drawn from the failure of a person to mention when being questioned a matter which is subsequently relied on in his or her defence which could reasonably have been expected to have been mentioned at the time.  As with the provisions of the 1984 Act, to which I have already referred, such inferences alone cannot form the basis of a conviction.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that this approach was warranted given the nature of drug trafficking both in terms of the gravity of the offence and the organised nature of it.  I am glad to say that this provision received the support of all sides of the House.  I propose to keep the operation of this new provision in the Drug Trafficking Act under review particularly in the context of whether further changes in this area of the law could be usefully made.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the right to silence originated in an age when people were not entitled to put forward a defence, and that it is outdated as we approach the new millennium?  May I put it to the Minister that it makes absolutely no sense in a modern criminal justice system to allow an accused person to pick a spot on the wall to stare at and to say nothing in order, perhaps, to avoid a conviction? Does the Minister agree that an amendment to the criminal law is required to provide that the jury should be entitled to draw an inference from the silence of an accused person and that while that evidence should not stand on its own, it should nonetheless be admissible as corroborative evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A jury can draw inferences from people remaining silent for very specific reasons. If they fail to say why they were at the scene of a crime, why there was blood or dust or some other product on their clothes, an inference can be drawn by the jury.  Under the drug trafficking legislation an inference can be drawn if somebody suddenly puts forward an explanation for being somewhere at the time of the offence, one which they did not advance when they were being questioned. It is not a case of changing the law to allow <Col N="28" /> the jury to draw inferences from silence; that already exists in certain cases.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep an open mind on whether we should extend this provision.  I am conscious that the right to silence exists as a protection for somebody who is, perhaps, innocently detained by the Garda for questioning and may not want to give information about something personal they were doing that does not have anything to do with the investigation of a crime.  It is necessary to be careful and not move too quickly to change something that has stood the test of time. I accept what the Deputy said.  Many other provisions are built into our system to protect innocent people from being convicted and that is why I made further changes in the right to silence in the drug trafficking legislation.  I will continue to keep the issue under review and will inform the House of any changes I propose to introduce.</P>

      <P>For fear the Minister misunderstands me &mdash; I am sure she does not &mdash; I am speaking of a general amendment to the law to provide that an inference may be drawn from a person's silence and that this would be corroborative evidence.  Surely the Minister could not put to this House the proposition that an individual who is innocent would gain anything by staying completely silent?  The time has come for a measured response to what is an extremely serious problem for gardaí investigating crimes and questioning suspects, that is, the absolute right of the individual to stay silent.  A minimalist change would be to allow an inference to be drawn from that silence which could then be used as corroborative evidence in the course of a trial. The Minister should recognise that it is necessary to bring about this change quickly because the current law is not appropriate to a modern criminal justice system.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to her acceptance of an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill which allows for an inference to be drawn if a person relies on a fact he or she failed to mention when being questioned. She refused the second part of that amendment, however, which would have allowed an inference to be drawn where the person remains silent throughout the court case.  Why did the Minister accept one aspect of the right to silence but refuse to accept a change in the law which allows a person &mdash; without any inference being drawn &mdash; to remain silent throughout the trial? On the general point raised by Deputy O'Donoghue, why did the Minister feel she could accept a change in the law on drug trafficking but not other serious crimes?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct.  There were two parts to her amendment and I introduced an amendment to give the correct wording to the intent of her amendment.  I accepted the principle of removing the right to silence for specific charges under a specific Act because the crimes we were discussing were of sufficient seriousness. I said at the time, however, I did not think it was appropriate to abolish the right to silence totally by way of an amendment to an Act dealing with specific crimes.  I agreed to target the further removal of the right to silence to that specific Act. If there is need to further extend it in the future I will do so, but I did not intend to deal with the right to silence in its entirely in that Act.  The Deputy is a lawyer and knows some of these issues, such as the right to silence, are complex and do not lend themselves to being changed in a debate on an item of legislation.  It is better to remove it in its entirety but there are mixed views as to whether that should be done.  It should be done in a more considered way and that is what I am doing.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy agreement &ldquo;A Government of Renewal&rdquo; states that among specific measures included in a reform of the justice system will be a Charter for Victims of Crime.  Work on such a charter has been ongoing and is nearing completion.  It has involved the close co-operation and agreement of the Irish Association for Victim Support who have been assisting and advising my Department on its completion. Publication of the charter is expected in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Both these issues are matters that have been under discussion with the Association for Victim Support.  I agree with the Deputy that, as far as possible, victims should be advised of the progress of any court case in which they have an interest where the person who may have been the perpetrator of some awful crime on them is being tried.  Where possible, the Garda advise people who have been victims of crime if somebody is being released from prison.  The Deputy will know from an earlier question that, because of the numbers involved, it is not possible for everybody to be thus notified.  I accept if somebody escapes from prison, and the victim is identifiable, <Col N="30" /> the victim should be notified, as far as possible, of that escape.  I assume the Deputy has a particular case in mind and I accept it was unfortunate the person he may be thinking of was not informed that somebody had absconded from prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If a prisoner in custody takes a claim against the State for compensation in relation to an event occurring in the prison, and if that person is awarded compensation, the victim of the original crime should have the right to be informed so that he or she, having been the original victim of a crime committed by that prisoner, may seek to garnishee some or all of that award in compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a specific point on which I will have to get back to the Deputy because I do not know whether it arose in the consideration of the Victims' Charter.  If the court fixes, as part of the penalty for a crime, that compensation be paid to a victim, it would be important, if money comes the way of the offender, for the court to ensure it is paid to the victim.  I will give some thought to the matter.  I cannot give the Deputy a specific answer now because I will have to consider the implications of notifying a victim about something that is independent of their association with that offender.</P>

      <P>Recently there has been considerable criticism of sentences handed down by the courts.  The criticism is often both illinformed and wrong.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but I am aware the assessment of the damage done to victims can be made part of the trial during the appeal.  Judges can ask for it to be made available if they are dealing with an appeal of sentence. Whether our law should say they are obliged to do so is a matter I will consider.  Many victims of crime attend our courts and in that regard I will soon launch a series of information booklets &mdash; to which I invite Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell &mdash; about our courts system as well as establishing an information desk, the first time such a consumer friendly facility will be available <Col N="31" /> in our courts.  That will be a useful benefit to victims of crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that many victims feel totally isolated from the prosecution service, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Would she not agree that the charter on which she is working should include that office, as happens in the UK where the Crown prosecution service has a victim liaison officer?  The victim, who is reduced to the status of witness in criminal prosecutions, could in this way be kept informed of progress in a particular criminal prosecution rather than being isolated and left to hear from individual gardaí how a particular matter is being processed by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of setting up a drugs enforcement agency as an entity separate from, and independent of, existing law enforcement agencies was considered in a special report on drugs law enforcement drawn up by my Department in 1994.  That report concluded that the likely effect of introducing a DEA-type agency on the lines operated, for example, in the United States would be to complicate the drugs law enforcement response in this jurisdiction.  It said that the best results would be obtained by maximising the effectiveness of co-operation and co-ordination between existing agencies.  I remain satisfied that the conclusions of the report are sound.  Incidentally, these conclusions were accepted by my predecessor, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the many initiatives taken by me, with the approval of the Government, to facilitate that co-ordinated response.  There are three in particular I want to mention.  The first is the establishment of the national drugs unit arising from this co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, in July 1995 I arranged that a memorandum of understanding be drawn up and agreed by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Commissioner.  The purpose of the memorandum was to facilitate maximum co-operation in tackling drug trafficking.  It was signed by both sides earlier this year and was formally endorsed by the Minister for Finance and myself. This memorandum commits both services to a policy of full co-operation.  It specifically provides for the establishment for special operations of a joint task force comprising representatives of the Garda, Customs and Excise and the Naval Service, as required.  The Deputy will be aware of <Col N="32" /> recent successes achieved through this cooperative effort.</P>
    <P>Third, there has been the setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau on an informal basis in August this year.  Within a few days it will be placed on a statutory footing.  This new body is intended to provide a forceful mechanism for concerted co-operation between State agencies, namely, the Garda, Revenue and Social Welfare, in dealing with drug-related crime.  The provisions of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, will ensure that the bureau can operate with maximum effect.  It will, of course, also be facilitated by the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, passed in July this year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that with the structures now in place to tackle drug trafficking, the establishment of a DEA on the US model is not necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister advise the House how she came to the conclusion that a drugs enforcement agency is not necessary? Would she not accept that her reply today indicates the approach is fragmented?  It was certainly successful in some instances, and the authorities are to be warmly congratulated in that respect, but would the Minister not accept that the best way of having a co-ordinated approach to the fight against drug trafficking is to have a national drugs enforcement agency?</P>
      <P>Given that the Government stated that the fight against drugs would be one of its most important objectives on assuming the Presidency of the EU, could the Minister also advise the House whether there has been any progress in setting up a European coastguard service to tackle drug trafficking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the United States a drugs enforcement agency was set up to unify a plethora of law enforcement agencies.  We have only one police force.  There was, therefore, no need to bring together a number of agencies charged with drugs law enforcement.  Such an agency would not necessarily be suited to this country where we have a single unified police force.  My aim, and that of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has been to get the agencies that need to work together to work with the Garda Síochána in tackling the kind of crimes that have become so prevalent in this society.  I am satisfied that we do not need a stand-alone police force known as a drugs enforcement agency.  A European coastguard service is a different question.  I do not have information on it.  Suffice to say that that issue has been raised at European level and is under discussion, but a number of countries have serious reservations about it.  During my Council meeting with Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs I raised the issue of a more unified approach to how individual countries deal with things like searching vessels that land on their coasts.  It would be appropriate for countries to standardise their methods of dealing with drug trafficking and drug offences and ships that might <Col N="33" /> be carrying drugs.  We could then be sure that the ship that landed in Cork and was successfully searched would have been subject to the same kind of search had it gone on to Spain, Portugal or Rotterdam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts to deal with the drugs problem.  However, the Criminal Assets Bureau is restricted to dealing with assets, a worthwhile task in itself.  The national drugs unit has traditionally proved to be ineffective in that it merely replaced the central drugs unit which had not been effective.  A number of the so-called drugs barons have recently moved to Amsterdam and to England.  The major drugs barons, the heroin barons who have destroyed the centre of Dublin in particular, remain untouched, with one or two exceptions. Clearly there is a need for an initiative, such as a national drugs agency, to deal with these people in an effective and co-ordinated way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau is only about six weeks old and statutorily not even two days old.  It does more than just deal with assets.  Information gathered in the course of investigations can be passed on and used to gain convictions in other crimes that come to light in the course of the investigations.  The bureau is not as tightly focused or targeted as the Deputy implies.  I am satisfied that the bureau is something this country has needed for a very long time.  I have to give credit to the Deputy who, for many years, demanded that the agencies be brought together.  I would ask him to give it time. It is already working.  It is already successful and will continue to be so.</P>

      <P>No, item No. 1 is asking us to agree procedures for tomorrow that would allow the debate on the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill to continue until 1.15 p.m.  For the past week the Opposition has been endeavouring to get replies from the Government to questions regarding the hepatitis C debate.  These questions were put down in the name of our spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, last week but were ruled out of order on the basis that they anticipated a debate in Private Members' time.  On Wednesday last the Minister replying for the Government stated that if we put down the questions it would answer them.  He also said, on two separate occasions during that debate, that any time we put down questions he will answer them.  The Opposition put down the questions again this week but the Government has refused to allow them to be taken.  The view of both Opposition parties is that we cannot have a meaningful debate tomorrow without these questions being fully and comprehensively replied to, it is a nonsense to try, on this important issue, where no facts have been given to the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke here last week about answering questions.  We all remember what Mr. Justice Hamilton stated at the beef tribunal, that there would have been no reason for a tribunal if questions had been answered in this House.  We have tried for the second week running to have important questions replied to to have a meaningful debate but the Government is refusing to reply.  So far as we are concerned we cannot agree on times for tomorrow without information or facts from the Department of Health.  The Government is refusing to reply to these questions. I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as the protector of fair play in this House that before we have that debate you order the Government to give us replies to these questions.</P>

      <P>We intend to provide time tomorrow for a full debate on this subject commencing at 4.15 p.m. wherein there will be statements and a question and answer session where the Minister will answer there and then any questions put to him.  If the Opposition parties are unhappy with the length of time, up to 7 p.m. for the questions the time can, if necessary, be extended.  There will be an extensive period during which the Minister will answer questions.  If any questions tabled by the Opposition which the Ceann Comhairle, for good reasons in accordance with procedure, did not allow at Question Time are put during the course of the debate to the Minister I have no doubt he will answer them as fully as they would otherwise have been answered.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable approach to the matter.

      <P>The Opposition believes that these written questions should be answered.  Under the procedure for answering written questions in the House, the Minister for Health should give us comprehensive replies.  In fairness to him, the Minister has stated on two occasions that he is happy to give us such replies.  All we are asking is to be given those answers before tomorrow's debate.  We can then look at the time allotted and see whether it is adequate.  The questions have been in the domain of the Minister's office for more than a week and we cannot have a meaningful debate tomorrow without detailed replies to these questions.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle's office to consider instructing the Office of the Minister for Health to give us the replies which I am sure have been drafted by the Department.

      <P>Apropos the vote that has just been passed, is it the case under the new rules of the House that questions adjusted to be in order by the Ceann Comhairle's office will be answered if the Ministers so wishes?  Has the Taoiseach agreed that the Minister for Health will answer the 20 written questions individually rather than by way of a composite reply?  That question was not dealt with before the vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No precedent is being established here.  Where a question is put down the decision on ruling it in or out is made independently by the Ceann Comhairle.  The questions were ruled out as anticipatory of the debate, but in order that it can be demonstrated to everybody in the House that the Government has no problem answering questions, I have volunteered that the information will be supplied in the format in which it was prepared.  The Minister for Health had prepared replies to all these questions anyway. I am not certain whether the Ceann Comhairle will decide to rule them in or out, but the replies are ready and will be furnished in the form in which they were prepared.  Some of the questions will be taken together while others will be taken individually, and they will be provided as a courtesy.  This is not normally done to the Deputies concerned and to anybody else who wishes to receive them.  If the press wish to receive the replies they will be made available to them also.</P>
      <P>The Government has no interest in this matter other than to allow the truth to come out.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Health, has nothing to hide in this regard and is willing to co-operate fully with any entity or with this House in any way necessary to get the information. Given the seriousness of the matter, the Opposition should not be so political in its approach to it.</P>

      <P>The Government has offered the two Opposition parties a briefing on the subject this evening when all the information requested by the Deputy will be provided.  If Deputies subsequently wish the information to be put on the record of the House, the questions will be answered on the record.

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach last week if he would consult the Opposition parties so that the terms of reference would be acceptable to all parties, but that has not happened.  A briefing is different from consultation.  In advance of the briefing will the Taoiseach say whether the terms of reference will include what happened up to 1996?  The media probably knows the answer to that question; as I walked in here I heard that a meeting was taking place at 3.30 p.m. because the matter had not been finalised this morning.  For the information of Deputies, will the Taoiseach say whether the agreed terms of reference will include what happened up to 1996?</P>

      <P>As a courtesy if that is not an inappropriate word to use to the Opposition, the briefing is being provided to the Opposition in advance of publication.  It is perfectly reasonable for the Opposition to make a request for a briefing in advance, and that is being done.  It would be best if the Deputy would allow Deputy O'Donnell, on behalf of her party, to be briefed in the normal way about the matter and not try to do the work for the Deputy on the Order of Business.  There would be no point in providing a briefing for the Opposition in advance of publication if I were to answer the Deputy's question now on the terms of reference.  That would remove the value of any briefing from the point of view of the Deputy's party and I do not think the Deputy would wish that to happen.</P>

      <P>In anticipation &mdash; to use the Taoiseach's words &mdash; of the briefing from the Minister for Health, the Taoiseach will recall that I specifically asked him last week if he would give a commitment that the Leaders of the Opposition or spokespersons would be consulted in advance of agreement on the terms of reference of the tribunal.  He indicated then that he would be openminded about the matter.  As I understand it, the purpose of today's briefing will not be to consult us but to tell us what has been agreed by Government, with no input from the Opposition.  One of the difficulties that has beset the Minister for Health on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no wish to debate it, I want to clarify the matter with the Taoiseach.  This is a very serious issue on which there must be all-party agreement, particularly in terms of a tribunal of inquiry which will investigate medical and political aspects of the handling of this controversy from the beginning.  If the Opposition believes that the terms of reference of the inquiry need to be amended, is the Taoiseach or the Minister prepared to accept such recommendations from the Opposition?</P>

      <P>The Government is about to provide a briefing to the Opposition on the matter. I do not wish to anticipate problems that may or may not arise in consideration of the matter by the Opposition.  The Government has nothing to hide.  It is most anxious that the facts be brought out about the activities of this Government and all Governments in the matter back to 1976, as is appropriate.  The medical facts should also be brought to knowledge and all the information requested by the women infected and their families should be made available in the most expeditious fashion possible.  That is the purpose of our work in this matter.  I advise the Deputy that it would be best to await the briefing she will receive shortly and not anticipate any problems where they may not exist or put hypothetical questions of the kind she is putting, which hypotheses may not be justified by the facts.</P>

      <Col N="181" /> Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Justice I have made clear my belief that changes need to be made to our bail regime to tilt the balance in favour of the victims of crime and the protection of the community generally.  If the amendment is passed by the people, as I believe it will be, it will do just that.</P>
    <P>No Government lightly brings forward a proposal to amend the Constitution.  However, it is the strongly held view of the Government that in the public interest changes need to be made to our bail laws and that the effective way of making those changes requires an amendment to the Constitution.  While conventional wisdom suggests that the amendment we are proposing has the support of a large majority of the people, I nevertheless appeal to people to follow the debate over the next few weeks as to whether we should make this fundamental change to their Constitution.</P>
    <P>The amendment being proposed is relatively straightforward.  There are no great complexities of law involved nor sophisticated technicalities at issue.  What people are being asked is whether they agree with the idea that it should be possible to introduce laws which would allow a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence if it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the amendment arises against the background of the Supreme Court decision in the O'Callaghan case in 1965.  Following that decision, bail can be refused by our courts on only two grounds, the likelihood that an accused will not turn up for trial or will interfere with witnesses or evidence.  This means that it is not open to our courts when considering a bail application to take into account at all the question of a person committing serious offences if released on bail, even where, for example, the accused has a long track record of being involved in serious crime while on bail on previous occasions.  If people believe that situation is wrong, then the only way to change it is by amending the Constitution along the lines proposed.</P>
    <P>Since the amendment was published groups which are opposed to it have put forward a number of criticisms and it is important that I should address these issues in my contribution to this debate.  It is argued that changes can be made to our existing law which would deal with the problem of offending on bail without the necessity for an amendment of the Constitution.  The Government accepts that some worthwhile reforms of our bail laws can be made without an amendment to the Constitution and I am preparing legislation to this end.  The main purpose of the legislation is to make changes in three areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> At present bail is often granted on the promise of someone to pay money if the accused fails to turn up for trial.  At that stage no money changes hands.  The new legislation will provide that generally some cash or equivalent of cash has to be put up as part of bail.  The proposed legislation will also allow a condition to be attached to bail that an accused is of good behaviour and bail money can be forfeited if an offence is committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>The legislation will strengthen the provisions of the 1984 Criminal Justice Act relating to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed on bail to ensure as far as possible that an offender is always worse off in terms of penalty where an offence is committed on bail. However, while these changes are worthwhile they cannot ensure that offences will not be committed on bail.  They do not and cannot address the central issue of whether a court should be allowed in certain circumstances to take into account the question of someone committing a serious offence if granted bail.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion is that providing for speedier trials would do away with the need for the bail referendum.  A wide range of measures has been taken to ensure speedier trials.  These measures include the appointment of additional judges, extended sittings in the courts and, perhaps most fundamentally, the establishment of the Working Group on the Courts Commission which is involved in a radical overhaul of the operation of the courts.  Yesterday I announced the establishment of an advisory group on criminal law and procedure which will also have a useful role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, the reality is that despite all the improvements which are being brought about there will always be some lapse of time between a person being charged with an offence and the trial taking place, not least to give the accused an opportunity to prepare a defence.  The provision of speedier trials does not and cannot address the central issue of whether a court should be allowed in certain circumstances to take into account the question of someone committing a serious offence if granted bail.  It is worth putting on record the fact that traditionally the courts give priority to hearing cases where the accused has been remanded in custody.</P>
    <P>Opponents of the amendment have also suggested that our prisons will not be able to cope with the extra numbers of prisoners who will have to be accommodated on remand.  This suggestion seems to overlook that the changes we propose in our bail laws are being brought forward against a background of a major programme of prison building which will involve the provision of about 800 extra places, an unprecedented increase of about one-third of our existing accommodation.  I think it fair to describe the criticisms I have mentioned as being to some extent tactical in nature rather than going to the heart of the issue.</P>
    <P>Opponents of the amendment believe that as a matter of principle it is wrong to deprive someone <Col N="183" /> of their liberty without that person having been convicted.  It is perfectly legitimate to argue in favour of that principle but the question which arises is whether, given the modern realities of crime, we can afford to make that principle absolute or whether it should be modified in the interest of providing an appropriate balance in our law.  Treating the principle as an absolute one means that there would be no circumstances in which a person is deprived of his or her liberty on remand no matter how strong the evidence that an offence will be committed by that person if granted bail.  In fact, under the law as it stands the courts are allowed to detain a person in custody pending trial on the basis of taking a view of the accused's likely behaviour if released.  This arises where a court has to take a view as to whether the current grounds for refusing bail apply, the likelihood that an accused will fail to turn up for trial or interfere with witnesses or evidence. The concept of taking a view as to someone's future behaviour in deciding whether bail should be granted is, therefore, not new, as some would suggest.  What is at issue in the amendment is whether the question of offending if granted bail should also be a matter which the court can take into account.</P>
    <P>Our bail laws are regarded as liberal compared to those which apply elsewhere.  The Law Reform Commission's report on the law of bail examined the position in many other jurisdictions and found that all of these allowed the question of offending on bail to be taken into account by the courts in deciding whether to refuse bail.  It is not, I suggest, a sustainable proposition to argue that our crime problems are so uniquely different from those in other jurisdictions that we need not arm ourselves with provisions in our law to prevent offending while on bail which are readily available in other countries.</P>
    <P>A balance must be struck in our bail laws between the rights of the accused and the rights of the community.  The present proposals represent a measured way to tilt the present balance in favour of the victims and potential victims of crime and the community generally while building in necessary safeguards.  What is at issue in passing this legislation is allowing the people to express a view &mdash; in the light of their knowledge and in too many cases, unfortunately, their experience of the modern realities of crime &mdash; and to decide whether we as a society can afford to have our present liberal bail laws.  It gives the people an opportunity to have their say as to how one aspect of our crime problem should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Much consideration went into the task of devising a suitable amendment to the Constitution.  On one hand, we did not want to bring about a situation where people would be refused bail in relation to relatively trivial offences.  On the other, we wanted to produce a wording that would make a genuine difference in practice to the bail regime where serious offences were at <Col N="184" /> issue.  We finally settled on a proposed wording which we believe strikes this balance and has two practical advantages.  First, it is relatively straightforward and it will be easily understood by the people.  Second, in the longer term it has the advantage that it is based on the relevant part of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 5(1), which allows for the deprivation of liberty &ldquo;when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent [a person] committing an offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Government has made available an outline of the main provisions of the bail legislation it proposes to introduce should the Constitution be amended.  The Government believes these proposals should help to inform public debate on the proposed amendment of the Constitution.  The outline legislation sets out the serious offences to which the new bail regime would apply and the criteria to which the courts would have regard in considering whether the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.</P>
    <P>A dual approach is taken to specifying the offences to which the new bail regime can apply. First, a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; offence is defined as an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment or more.  Second, a schedule is included setting out the wide range of offences covered by the legislation.  This approach means that, while all offences to which the legislation will apply must carry a maximum penalty of five years or more, not all such offences will be covered by the legislation, primarily on the grounds that some of the offences in our current law carrying such a penalty are archaic or unlikely to be ones where the question of reoffending is relevant.</P>
    <P>Refusal of bail will not apply automatically in respect of any particular offence or category of offence.  Such refusal in relation to any particular offence is and will continue to be a matter for the courts to decide in the light of the criteria set out in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The outline legislation sets out seven matters to be taken into account by the courts, where appropriate, in deciding whether it is reasonably considered necessary to refuse bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  The first is the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and the potential penalty; second, the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence apprehended and the potential penalty; third, the conviction of the accused person in respect of an offence committed while on bail on a previous occasion; fourth, any previous conviction of the accused person including a conviction under appeal; fifth, any other offence in respect of which the accused person is charged and is awaiting trial; sixth, the nature and strength of the evidence in support of the charge; and seventh, whether the accused has a substance addiction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> It is important to note that the outline legislation provides that in determining whether refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence it shall not be necessary that the commission of a specific offence is apprehended.  To have to prove that a specific offence would be at issue if bail were to be granted would be likely in practice to impose a standard of proof which could rarely, if ever, be met.  The particular provision I mentioned will ensure that the new bail regime will be workable and effective.</P>
    <P>The outline legislation provides for a review of bail applications if the trial has not commenced within four months of the initial refusal of a bail application.  While the granting of bail would not be automatic in such circumstances, the court is to have regard to any undue delay on the part of the prosecution in bringing the case to trial and to order the release on bail of the accused if satisfied that the interests of justice require it.</P>
    <P>When announcing the wording of the amendment, I indicated I was still considering with my Government colleagues the best way to make information available to the public in the run-up to the vote.  In keeping with the McKenna judgment the Government will not be spending public moneys to achieve a particular outcome to the referendum.  However, it has decided today that there will be an <i>ad hoc</i> commission in relation to the provision of information and the Minister for the Environment will make the details known shortly.</P>
    <P>The issue of bail has been discussed in this House on numerous occasions over the past couple of years.  Opposition Deputies have expressed frustration at what they regarded as delays in dealing with this matter.  All Governments over the past 30 years have grappled with this issue but this is the first one which has succeeded in grasping the nettle and bringing forward comprehensive, considered and practical proposals which should deal with it once and for all.  I believe it will be possible for all sides of the House to put aside political differences and not detract from the message which I am sure all of us want to go clearly from this House to the people: this is a necessary change to the Constitution which will help in the fight against crime.  Amending our bail laws is no panacea for dealing with all our crime problems but the referendum provides a practical opportunity for people who are so understandably concerned about crime to use their democratic franchise to make a difference for the better to the quality of life in our society.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill, ultimately to the people and for the present to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle behind the Bill which the Minister has introduced today.  On 27 September 1995 I, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, introduced the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill to the House.  In introducing the Bill I stated:  &ldquo;The manner in which Article 40.4.1º of the Constitution <Col N="186" /> has been interpreted by the courts has, in recent years, resulted in a real, substantial and continuing injustice to the people of Ireland&rdquo;. That statement is as true today as it was 13 months ago.  I believed then, as now, that there is a need to amend the Constitution to enable a judge to remand an accused person in custody pending trial if he is satisfied by credible evidence that the person is likely to commit further serious crime if released.</P>
      <P>Much has changed since September of last year when Fianna Fáil proposed a referendum on bail. People have needlessly suffered at the hands of criminals.  People have reluctantly joined the ranks of those in favour of the holding of a bail referendum.  The number of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies who voted in favour of the referendum has been swollen by the majority of Deputies who saw fit to walk through the &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; lobby in 1995.  I welcome their change of heart and their recognition that change is necessary.  Public opinion has resulted in a stampede towards the referendum shuttle.</P>

      <P>Politicians who blocked progress last year are seeking to occupy standing room only seats this year.  I wonder why?  The principle behind this amendment cannot be considered constitutionally adventurous so that it would render our law out of line with international norms.  It would merely give people the protection which other countries have for some years past recognised as being necessary.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom, the Bail Act, 1976, provides:</P>
      <P>The Defendant need not be granted bail if the Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the Defendant, if released on bail (whether subject to conditions or not) would</P>
      <P>(a)  fail to surrender to custody, or</P>
      <P>(b)  commit an offence while on bail, or</P>
      <P>(c)  interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, whether in relation to himself or any other person.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in New South Wales the Bail Act, 1978, permits a court to consider &ldquo;...the likelihood that a person will or will not commit an offence while at liberty on bail&rdquo; in deciding whether an accused should be released on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment of the type proposed would bring Ireland into line with other common law jurisdictions.  It would give practical effect to the right to liberty enshrined in Article 40 of the Constitution which is not an absolute right but is subject to other constitutional rights.  It is expressly provided in the Constitution that it is a right <Col N="187" /> which may be prescribed &ldquo;by law&rdquo;.  Ordinarily, this occurs after a trial and conviction.</P>
    <P>However, it is significant that both the Supreme Court and the Oireachtas have recognised there are circumstances in which people may be deprived of their liberty prior to conviction. Arrest and detention under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, or under the provisions of the recently enacted drug trafficking legislation are examples of statutory curtailments of the right to liberty necessitated by the requirement of the common good.</P>
    <P>In the O'Callaghan case, the Supreme Court also recognised there were circumstances in which an accused person could be deprived of his or her right to liberty prior to trial and conviction. A judicial acceptance of the likelihood that an accused person will abscond or interfere with witnesses are acknowledged grounds upon which an accused person may be deprived of his liberty prior to trial.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment merely suggests a limited extension of the existing criteria on which bail can be lawfully withheld.  It is a matter of regret to everyone that this limited action is necessitated by the nature and extent of criminal activity.  Thirty years ago the idea of large numbers of drug addicts who would need hundreds of pounds per day to feed their addictions was unthinkable.  Unfortunately, for us it is a reality today.  It is a part of our society which must be addressed.  The existing law, which compels a judge to release on bail a drug addict who as a matter of certainty can only feed his addiction through crime serves neither society nor the drug addict well.</P>
    <P>There is no constitutional right to steal.  The right to liberty carries with it a corresponding responsibility to respect the constitutional rights of others.  I am reminded of the words of an English philosopher who once sat in the House of Lords and who said: &ldquo;Freedom to do every mortal thing one wants why that is to have no freedom at all&rdquo;.  This is logical.  In the unlikely event of the Minister attempting to kill me or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash; we have come close &mdash; the proposition could be fairly made that neither of us has any freedom.</P>
    <P>If a court is satisfied that a person charged with a serious criminal offence is likely to interfere in a significant way with the constitutional rights of other citizens that court must have the power to protect those citizens.</P>
    <P>The number of offences committed by accused persons on bail is unacceptably high and has increased in recent years.  This referendum will offer the people some protection against this type of crime.  It is both necessary and overdue.  In the past thirteen months thousands of offences have been committed by people on bail.  Many of them <Col N="188" /> could have been prevented had this referendum taken place last year.  The reason it did not take place is readily ascertainable.  One only has to turn to cols. 1171 and 1172 of the Official Report, 4 October 1995, vol. 456, which set out a list of the Deputies who voted against holding a bail referendum in 1995.  Included on this list are those Labour Party Deputies who have made a career of talking tough and voting soft when it comes to the issues of crime and drugs, including Deputies who proclaim the need for radical changes in press releases and who slink through the division lobbies in support of the <i>status quo.</i> Deputies Bhreathnach and Shortall led the charge for the Labour Party against the amendment group.  How strange is the silence from them now.  Do they think silence now will ward off the wrath of their constituents?</P>
    <P>I regret that a majority of the House voted against holding a constitutional referendum last year, and that when the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the lord of the dance, clicked his fingers the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party danced through the &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; lobby.  It is not the first time, and it will not be the last time that the members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party will waltz when the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs clicks his fingers.</P>
    <P>I also regret that the Minister for Justice provided the intellectual justification for opposing the Fianna Fáil Bill which proposed holding such a referendum.  It is instructive of her motives and the manner in which she has gone about the management of her portfolio to note what she had to say in the debate on holding a constitutional referendum on bail last year.  According to the Official Report, 27 September 1995, vol. 456, col. 267, she stated: &ldquo;...not only has Deputy O'Donoghue brought forward his amendment at the wrong time, certainly too early, but he is putting it in the wrong place.&rdquo;  This jeering jibe was tossed across the floor of the House in an attempt to belittle the legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil and to give a spurious legal solemnity to the Government's opposition to holding a bail referendum.</P>
    <P>The Minister's words have returned to haunt her.  She argued that any proposed amendment of the Constitution relating to bail would have to meet the provisions of Article 38.  According to the Official Report, 27 September 1995, vol. 456, col. 267, the Minister stated: &ldquo;Article 38 of the Constitution deals with the `Trial of Offences' and, in those circumstances, an amendment dealing with bail might more properly be made to Article 38&rdquo;.  The Minister's tenuous and inadequate grasp of the complexities of her portfolio is adequately demonstrated by the fact that when she eventually got around to introducing legislation 13 months after voting down the Fianna Fáil Bill the amendment which she proposes is to Article 40, the Article to which the Fianna Fáil <Col N="189" /> amendment was addressed, and not Article 38 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Who told the Minister to say in autumn 1995 that the Fianna Fáil amendment was in the wrong place?  Did she make this constitutional blunder or did she blindly rely on deficient legal advice? What conclusion should be drawn about the ability of a Minister for Justice who cannot correctly tell the House which Article of the Constitution needs to be amended to curtail the right to bail?  Will she apologise or even say she was wrong?  Will she say that Fianna Fáil was right in asserting that an amendment to Article 40 was the appropriate method of bringing about the required change?  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>Her record in office is a catalogue of illfounded criticism of legislation initiated on this side of the House followed by acceptance of the pressing need for such legislation.  This side has become accustomed to wild and unsubstantiated allegations of unconstitutionality emanating from the Minister to be followed rapidly by an acceptance of the need for such legislation.  The policy of derision followed by transcription has been implied by the Minister.  Measures which the Minister derided and voted down last year have now become her policies.  I welcome her change of mind and the manner in which the Government has accepted legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil.  However, I regret that its initial tardiness has caused needless suffering to a new generation of victims.</P>
    <P>The second criticism by the Minister in September 1995 of the Fianna Fáil Bill to provide for a constitutional referendum on bail was that it was &ldquo;certainly too early&rdquo;.  If that Bill had been passed, the referendum could have been held on the same day as the divorce referendum.  The Minister suggested this when she made her politically infamous solo run on the Farrell programme on RTÉ television.  Why was it &ldquo;certainly too early&rdquo; when I proposed it but politically apt when the Minister proposed it?  The reason is that the Minister was going through her protracted legislative avoidance phase and any excuse for inaction would do.  However, her words return to haunt her.  It is unnecessary to look beyond the inconsistencies of her utterances to recognise the absurdity of her contradictions.</P>
    <P>Jabbed into action by the fury of the people, the Minister has become a new age Winnie the Pooh, frantically looking for legislative honey pots in which to dip her paw.</P>

They will change their minds and their votes as they did on the issue of a bail referendum.</P>
      <P>The two grounds on which the Minister opposed the Fianna Fáil Bill can now be seen as nakedly spurious.  Neither had substance or reality and were invented for a selfish political purpose of denying the people the right to air their voice on the issue of bail.  The Government wanted to deny the people this right because it was divided.  It took a landslide in public opinion to sweep away the political barriers which were erected in the path of such a referendum.  I am pleased the people will, belatedly, be given the opportunity to remedy the injustice which results from the manner in which Article 40 of the Constitution has been interpreted by the courts in recent years and to realign the scales of justice. For far too long the Constitution has been viewed as a document which confers rights only on those charged with criminal offences.  The Constitution exists for the protection of citizens and society.  It does not exist exclusively for the protection of alleged wrongdoers.  However, this does not mean we should turn our backs on safeguards and protections.  The concept of bail arises as a result of the inevitable lapse of time which occurs between the arrest and trial of a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some delay is inevitable because the prosecution must be afforded an opportunity to prepare its case and the accused must have an opportunity to consider the nature of the evidence <Col N="191" /> against him or her.  However, there is a world of difference between necessary and unnecessary delay.  Justice must be swift but, unfortunately, the procedures under which the courts are forced to operate effectively guarantee unacceptable delay.</P>
    <P>It is Fianna Fáil's position that, save in exceptional circumstances, trials for serious crimes should take place within 90 days of arrest.  My party has brought forward detailed legislative proposals which would make the necessary procedural changes to enable this to happen.  Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, those changes have been voted down by the rainbow coalition Government.  For some reason, which has not been adequately explained to the House, the Government is committed to the time consuming and wasteful preliminary examination process. The fact that less than 1 per cent of offences are filtered from the system by this process has not deterred the Government in its support for this system which guarantees inefficiency and delay.</P>
    <P>The usual delay between the date of arrest and the date of a return for trial order being sought is approximately four months.  This is before the case joins the queue of cases waiting to be heard. When I complained about this last year and earlier this year, the Minister's constant reply was that new judges would be appointed.  These judges are now in place but in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, which deals with the greatest volume of serious criminal cases, dates for trials are being set for mid-March next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the appointment of new judges, a delay of approximately five months still exists between a case being ready for trial and the court being available to hear it.  However, this delay does not reflect adversely on the three judges regularly available to hear criminal cases in the court.  The manner in which they have dealt with the avalanche of cases is a credit to them. My complaint is that despite the appointment of the new judges and the cosmetic changes the Minister has made to the preliminary examination system, an institutionalised delay of close to nine months still exists between arrest and probable trial date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is unacceptable and I lament the absence of any plan on the Minister's part to deal with it. In the light of this position, the inclusion in the proposed legislation of a review of a refusal to grant bail, based on the probability of further offences being committed, is a cynical and shallow <Col N="192" /> piece of window dressing.  As the system stands, and as the Minister permits it to stand, such reviews are guaranteed for every case.</P>
    <P>It was once wisely stated that a week is a long time in politics.  In the context of this Bill, it must be acknowledged that a year in politics is an eternity. Last year Labour Party and Democratic Left Deputies espoused so-called civil libertarian principles against holding a referendum on bail.  They got their way but this year those principles have been scattered to the four winds like snuff at a wake.  The reason for this is a public outpour of anger and outrage in relation to the frozen indifference and inactivity of the Minister for Justice and the Government in dealing with the serious problem of crime.</P>
    <P>Why else would Deputies in the Labour Party and in Democratic Left seek to jump aboard what I have described as the referendum shuttle?  The reason is quite simple. They want to get aboard before the shuttle pulls out of the station because they know the electorate is waiting for them.  The proposed referendum on bail is not a solution to all of the ills of society, nor do I suggest that it is.  It addresses a specific and limited problem.  We will still need radical law reform legislation when this measure has been enacted.  The Minister's record clearly indicates that it will not be forthcoming from this Government.</P>
    <P>Following the debate in this House in July there were comments, possibly inspired by the Minister, that Fianna Fáil failed to catch the mood of the occasion.  I remind those who suggested this that the proceeds of crime legislation is a testament to the fact that far from not catching the mood, we very much caught the ball, which was falling down because the Minister for Justice and the Government displayed an appalling lack of ability to tackle the crime problem. There is a very subtle difference between a humorist and a satirist.  A humorist runs with the hares while a satirist hunts with the hounds.  I hunt with the hounds.</P>

      <P>Now that the Minister has calmed down, I will begin, if I am permitted.  I want to put the Minister out of whatever minor agony she might be in by saying that I do not oppose this Bill and this proposed amendment.  I <Col N="193" /> have things to say about it, however, because I am not entirely happy about certain aspects, in particular aspects of what lies in the background to the need for this provision.</P>
      <P>The first thing that needs to be said is that this amendment must be read on its own.  Any part of the Constitution being interpreted by the High Court or the Supreme Court must be read on its own.  It cannot be read in conjunction with whatever legislation arises from it or is passed as a result of its insertion in the Constitution.  The Minister's approach has been to seek to explain the constitutional amendment by reference to the legislative changes or provisions which would follow it.  That is putting the cart before the horse and it cannot be done.  One must read the provision on its own.</P>
      <P>The onus of proof in this provision, in other words the onus of proving that the refusal of bail should be reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the person in custody, is on the State in opposing the application made by the person for bail.  The onus of proof in the wording of this proposed amendment is quite serious and difficult.  It is not possible to have resort to the various circumstances set out in the proposed supporting legislation to fulfil that onus of proof.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out seven different headings in the statement she issued last week.  Six of those form part of what were called the O'Callaghan rules and they are not new.  The seventh heading is new and was not envisaged in O'Callaghan, which was decided in 1965 or 1966.  That relates to whether or not the accused has a substance addiction.  People did not have substance addictions in those days, or if they did, they only had them to drink or cigarettes.  They were not addicted to anything worse and they were not seen in a criminal context in those times.  It is interesting that with that exception, all the other headings in that section of the Minister's statement are contained in the O'Callaghan judgment and are not new.</P>
      <P>If they are contained in the O'Callaghan judgment they pertain to the two grounds which O'Callaghan indicates are valid grounds for turning down an application for bail.  These are that the defendant will not turn up or that the defendant will interfere with witnesses or with the evidence. We will use the same grounds to support a third reason, that the defendant will commit another offence.  That was one of the original grounds of O'Callaghan as decided by Mr. Justice Murnaghan in the High Court in 1965, but it was overruled by the Supreme Court.  It is intended to put it into the Constitution now, thereby overruling the Supreme Court.  However, it is not as simple as that.  It is a very complex issue which needs a lot of thought and balancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> I draw the attention of the Minister to the part of the judgment of the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay, in Ryan <i>v.</i> DPP [1989 IR 399] which is quoted at page 846 of <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by J.M. Kelly, where he discusses all the difficulties encountered, including difficulties encountered even if O'Callaghan is overruled.  It is pointless to pick out just one example.  If one had time one should read it all.  However, one of the difficulties encountered is that of proving an intention to commit another crime.  By what standard of proof must it be established?  That is a fair question and it is up to the Minister to answer it.  She will run into that difficulty whether or not this constitutional change is made.</P>
    <P>The other questions asked by the then chief justice, who retired a year or two ago, are valid and show what a difficult field this is.  It is worth putting on the record that this excerpt from the judgment finishes with the following sentiment:</P>
    <P>The criminalising of mere intention has been usually a badge of an oppressive or unjust legal system.  The proper methods of preventing crime are the long established combination of police surveillance, speedy trial and deterrent sentences.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a serious dilemma where a significant and substantial proportion of the serious crime here is committed by people on bail.  The interpretation of O'Callaghan, as we have seen it in recent years, has led to the release on bail of approximately 99 per cent of people who are charged.  I do not know the exact percentage because some people who are not charged with serious offences but who, because they are not quick mentally or not well advised, do not apply for bail or do not get it.  Of those who seek it, however, approximately 99 per cent get bail.  The proportion of the serious crime committed by those on bail is very high and we must be seen to be doing something about that.  That may be where the major problem lies.  The Oireachtas has to be seen to be doing something about this problem.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing attention to a recent case. It was referred to by Mr. Gerard Hogan who is co-author of the book I just cited and is accepted as one of the leading constitutional authorities in the country.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 October 1996 he stated:</P>
    <P>And to illustrate the &ldquo;misapplication&rdquo; argument, [that is the misapplication of the O'Callaghan rules] one need look no further than one notable recent case in which the High Court granted bail to an accused person who had a previous serious criminal record and who had also escaped from lawful custody.</P>
    <P>Even though there was an apparent discordance between the O'Callaghan rules and its application to the facts in this particular case, it does not appear that this decision of the High <Col N="195" /> Court to grant bail in this case was ever appealed to the Supreme Court ... this case, taken together with some other contemporary instances, tends to demonstrate the unduly liberal application of the O'Callaghan principles in some of the recent case law.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that some of these decisions have given rise to public unease.</P>
    <P>He went on in the article to say that the better remedy might lie in appealing these decisions.  It is worth drawing attention to that particular case. It is the Quinlivan-McAuley case.  I understand Mr. Quinlivan is now back in custody.  Mr. McAuley was living in the Limerick area and he has been missing since a particular day in early June when Detective Garda McCabe was murdered; he has not been seen since.  I wonder if any application has yet been made by the State to estreat his bail and, if not, why not?  He is in flagrant breach of the conditions of his bail but nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes into this House and tells us that our bail laws are unsatisfactory.  One of the reasons for that is that the existing laws, many of which she is re-enacting in her proposed legislation, are not being used and are not being enforced.</P>

It is making a joke of our existing law and it clearly shows that non-enforcement of that law is as much of a problem as lacunae in the law or in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation short of that which flows from a constitutional amendment of this kind would be valuable.  In her opening contribution the Minister stated she is now proposing legislation to strengthen the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed on bail; to <Col N="196" /> require persons going bail to guarantee the good behaviour of the accused while on bail and allow for forfeiture of bail in this regard; and to require cash, or the equivalent of cash, to be lodged as part of bail.</P>
    <P>That measure was contained in a Bill brought forward in this House by Deputy O'Donnell at the beginning of this year.  It was not alone defeated by the Government, it was rubbished by the Minister in her usual rubbishing voice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the difficulties that would arise if this proposed constitutional amendment, and the legislation that is supposed to flow from it, were enacted is that, presumably, substantial pressure would be put on the prisons and on prison space if a large number of people were expected to be remanded in custody, perhaps for lengthy periods of up to four months, before their trial takes place.  That is worth consideration because if there were a serious intent to have large numbers of people in custody, I do not see how they can be coped with in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>We have what is called a revolving door policy and, as far as I can see, the only people who are not allowed avail of the Minister's revolving door policy are civil debtors because she is not allowed to release those under law.  If one is anything other than a civil debtor, however, even a kidnapper or some other serious offender, one can avail of this revolving door policy.  We are well aware of people who were arrested and convicted of quite serious crimes only to reappear on the streets within a matter of weeks even though they were given long terms of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>How is it envisaged that the prison system will cope if large numbers of people are held in custody under this proposal?  Those who have examined it are not at all sure that there will be large numbers of people in custody.  The article I already quoted, by Mr. Gerard Hogan, is headed &ldquo;bail reform will affect only marginal cases&rdquo;. Having analysed it, he has come to the view that only a small number of cases will be affected by what is proposed here.  If that is so, it is something of an effort to mislead the public in respect of what the outcome would be.</P>
      <P>It seems that, while this constitutional change may well be desirable and, on balance, should be proceeded with, equally essential and perhaps more important in terms of fighting crime is what is called the other bail legislation which, on the Minister's own admission, has nothing to do with this proposed amendment or the legislation subsequent to it, and which she now says she will introduce, even though she rubbished it recently when it was proposed by others.  That is more likely to have an effect on the situation we face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we should strive to do is to give the Judiciary discretion on bail similar to that in other common law jurisdictions.  At present the Judiciary does not have that.  We have the most liberal bail laws, certainly in the common law world and, I believe, in the entire world.  I do not know that what is being proposed will make any major change to that.  It greatly depends on how it is interpreted, and it will have to be interpreted on its own, not by reference to the legislation that follows it.  The public may buy that from the Minister, <Col N="198" /> but the Supreme Court will not.  I ask myself whether people like the two defendants I mentioned earlier, who got bail in very unusual circumstances, would get bail in the same circumstances in any other country.  I venture to suggest they would not.  I am not sure that this provision will have any effect.  Surely what was relevant there is not what future crimes might have been committed by these two gentlemen but the crimes they committed in the past and, in particular, their actions while they were on remand.  There was nothing in the O'Callaghan case to stop the court or the State taking that into account when they made their application.</P>
    <P>We clearly cannot continue as we are, but we have to ask ourselves whether what is proposed is adequate to deal with the very serious problem we face and whether it is the appropriate way of dealing with it.  An alternative way of wording this amendment, which would overcome some of the difficulties I foresee in relation to this, would be to have a provision on the lines that bail can be refused to a person charged with a serious offence where the court considers it just to do so, having regard to (1) the nature of the offence charged, (2) the circumstances of the arrest of the accused, (3) the character of the accused, including his actions while on bail in the past and (4) such other matters as the court considers relevant, such as drug dependence or other matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is trying to cure all the difficulties and ills of our bail system by putting the onus on the State to prove that a defendant or an applicant for bail is likely to commit further offences, she may not help herself very greatly. The onus put on the State by that may be too heavy in many cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy an alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how the courts interpret it.  Given the manner in which they interpreted O'Callaghan and the three occasions subsequently when the Supreme Court was invited to overrule O'Callaghan in Ryan and two other cases, and given the unchallenged decision of the High Court recently to release Quinlivan and McAuley in the manner that it did, I do not know that the courts are of a mind to interpret this proposed new provision of the Constitution in a way that will make a major difference.  I would prefer that it did make a major difference. I would prefer that it was more complete and that it gave a wider discretion.  The wording I have suggested here, which I am not putting forward as an alternative but as something that should be thought about, would overcome some of those problems.  Those problems will be overcome if the courts are given a wider discretion rather than tying them down to specific things.  If the courts have a wide enough discretion, and if they exercise <Col N="199" /> common sense, which they usually do, we will avoid some of the awful consequences we have had in terms of people being released and committing serious offences while on bail.</P>
      <P>There is a major problem, a major conflict between the philosophy of this and the philosophy as laid down repeatedly by the Supreme Court.  Much will depend on how the Supreme Court interprets this when it is passed.  There are different ways of interpreting it.  Some of the other ways may be superior.  It would be better if the Minister kept an open mind on these things because she seems nearly always to be opposed to views expressed in this House and then finds she has to change her mind.</P>

      <P>It is rather sad that we are reduced to this level of debate.  I am not sure in these circumstances that there is very much future in trying to make serious points arising out of this.  There are some very serious matters relating to it that I would have thought might have been considered.  In particular, the article by Mr. Hogan, to which I have referred, has some telling things to say.  Nothing the Minister said today contradicted or dealt with any of it.  I am fearful that what is being done will not be particularly effective in the long term and that it will not make the major difference which is being claimed.  However, I hope the other bail legislation referred to in paragraph eight of the Minister's recent statement will be brought forward rapidly and that it is not dependent on the passage <Col N="200" /> of this amendment or its adoption in a referendum. It can be introduced now and I believe it should be.  An attempt has already been made to introduce it but it was voted down.  If the Minister brings it in, it will not be voted down in the future.</P>
      <P>We face serious crime with hardened criminals apparently free to walk our streets.  There is a sense of fear that is without parallel in our history as an independent State.

I am surprised nobody from the left is here to listen to the debate as they were conspicuous by their presence during the two previous debates on this issue.  On that occasion they <Col N="201" /> rubbished and undermined the proposals put forward by this side of the House just because they came from this side.  Today the Minister came in with a carbon copy of those proposals which she introduced as the font of wisdom, a panacea, which she had suddenly discovered to tackle the serious crime problem.</P>
      <P>The proposals we put forward, while broadly similar to those before the House today, were not put forward in isolation as apparently is this proposal. They were accompanied by other proposals on prison reform, increasing the number of prison places and by detailed legislative proposals on shortening the period between arrest and trial. We proposed a 90 day maximum period and a legislative mechanism to bring that about which the Minister voted down and rubbished, supported by her colleagues on the left.</P>
      <P>Any change in the law which makes bail more difficult to obtain will result in more people being remanded in custody.  That is a diminution of civil liberties but, at the very least, it should be accompanied by a provision that these people will spend the least possible period in custody by reducing the amount of time between arrest and trial.  That is precisely what we proposed.  We had specific proposals to abolish the outdated, antiquated, outmoded preliminary examination system which is a relic of history at this stage.  It is a device being used by certain criminals I am aware of some who deliberately used it to make a mockery of the criminal justice system and it has no place in the 1990s.  For reasons best known to itself and which have never been adequately explained to this House the Government resolutely insists on keeping it in place.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Government has appointed extra judges &mdash; for which we had been calling for some time.  It has shortened the waiting period between arrest and trial which is necessary in the context of the bail laws but the Government has set its face steadfastly against other procedural changes which would shorten that period even further.  The Minister must recognise that if Deputy O'Malley's worst fears do not come to pass and if this legislation makes a real change in that many more people will be remanded in custody than previously the detention period between arrest and trial must be shortened.  If not, many people who would ultimately be found not guilty by the courts would have served an unconscionable period in custody for a crime they did not commit.  The procedural changes proposed would cost little and would be minimal in comparison with other items of expenditure in the Minister's Department.  I do not understand why the Government has steadfastly sets its face against them.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees that the O'Callaghan case of 1966 is redundant.  Times have changed.  The O'Callaghan decision was made to cater for the needs of society that effectively no longer exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> The nature of crime has changed dramatically. The main agent of change has been the advent of the drugs culture.  As Deputy O'Malley rightly said, drug addiction was unknown in 1966 so the nature of society has changed and the need for changes in the bail laws to accommodate that change has long been evident.  It has been proposed here and has been consistently voted down by the Government.  The reality is that the Government because of public reaction to events has been forced to do a U-turn.  The notion that somebody can be denied bail because they are likely to commit another offence while on bail is a feature of the criminal justice system of almost every civilised country in the world.  The only other European country that has a common law system similar to that of Ireland is the United Kingdom which, with possible exceptions in west Yorkshire and other places, is hardly a bastion of repression.  That has been on the Statute Book of the United Kingdom for some time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley there is a lack of bail law enforcement.  He referred specifically to the case involving Mr. McAuley.  I was recently presented with the startling statistic that last year in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court there were 189 cases involving people who were in breach of their bail conditions and that in 188 of these cases no application has been made to estreat bail.  I was given this statistic by an unusually reliable source and I ask the Minister to confirm or deny it.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the wording of the Government's amendment which will be written into the Constitution and which will be interpreted by the Supreme Court.  The subsequent legislation must be read in the light of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the change being made in the Constitution to make that legislation possible.  The Fianna Fáil amendment states: &ldquo;If a judge is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a person will commit a further class of offence which is also an indictable offence if admitted to bail then he may refuse bail for that offence also&rdquo;.  The Government amendment states: &ldquo;Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person&rdquo;.  I have substantial difficulty with the wording of that amendment. Section 4 of the United Kingdom Bail Act, 1976 and schedule 1 to that Act state: &ldquo;The court may refuse bail if there are substantial grounds for believing that if released on bail he would, <i>inter alia</i>, commit an offence whilst on bail&rdquo;.  That wording and the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment are more compelling and clearer than the Government wording.</P>
    <P>I would hate to think the Government wording, which is peculiar, is drafted in such a way that a judge will only be entitled to refuse bail as a last <Col N="203" /> resort.  If the Supreme Court interprets the wording in that way then we are allowing the Constitution to be turned into a charter for criminals and the proposed change is cosmetic and will make no impact on the serious problem with which we are trying to deal and with which the public demand we deal.  Will the Minister clarify why the Government amendment is worded in this rather strange tortuous manner?</P>
    <P>I have referred to the necessity to make changes in criminal procedure to get rid of antiquated relics which are a device used by criminals to frustrate the system, to escape justice for as long as possible and to make a mockery of the long as possible and to make a mockery of the system.  If the legislation has more than a marginal impact I would like to believe the Government is bona fide and intends it to make a difference then more people will be incarcerated.  Does the Minister propose to establish a separate remand centre for the presumably increased number of people who will be remanded after being denied bail?  Is it seriously proposed to imprison them with the other criminals of various hues who make up the prison population, in a gigantic human warehouse from which people leave more skilled in the ways of crime than when they entered in the first instance?  The Minister must know that prisons have become universities of crime; it is where criminals learn about crime. To imprison prisoners on remand who ultimately may be found not guilty with serious criminals can have devastating consequences and put people who would otherwise have gone straight into a life of crime.  Will there be a separate remand centre for people remanded on bail?</P>
    <P>Given that the prison system is horrifically overcrowded, what is the Minister doing about the provision of extra prison spaces?  If the Minister's pronouncements are to be believed the Estimates are fairly incredible we need more prison spaces even without any change.  There are various Estimates and we do not know how the amendment will be interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Neither we nor the Minister know what the figures will be and I would like to know the provision being made for these extra places.  The Minister is well acquainted with the revolving door syndrome.  If we go ahead with a proposal which will bring extra people into the prison system then the revolving door will revolve even more quickly.</P>
    <P>As regards the prison system, somebody recently said that more than 700 people are not serving their sentences.  How many more prisoners will not serve sentences if the amendment is brought into effect without a corresponding increase in the number of prison places?  People who have been convicted of serious offences &mdash; people familiar with the legal system will know that apart from the civil debtors who should not be in prison in the first place, it is only the gougers <Col N="204" /> who are sent to prison at the end of the day &mdash; will continue to serve an unacceptably short proportion of their sentences because of overcrowding if, without making any change in the number of places, we ensure that more people are imported into the prison system.  Is this desirable or necessary?  Is that what we want?</P>
    <P>We want to see changes in the bail laws and to ensure that people who might commit a serious offence while on bail are put away and kept out of circulation until their trials come up.  If convicted, we want them to be given a good long sentence, most of which they will serve.  However, if we simply pass legislation, which presumably will bring many more people into the system, without providing more spaces then many prisoners will serve an even shorter proportion of their sentences. This is neither necessary nor desirable.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister carried out a study on the cost of the prison system?  Is she aware that it costs an average £42,000 per annum to keep a prisoner in prison and that the corresponding figure in the United Kingdom is £20,000 and £15,000 in France?  We are not talking about gigantic expenditure and further heavy impositions on the taxpayer; rather we are talking about a rational system which will give us value for money.  This debate does not deal with prison reform, but we could keep many more prisoners for the same amount of money if we got our act together.</P>
    <P>What input will victims of crime have on this issue?  I have come across cases &mdash; this is not a flight of fancy &mdash; where people who committed vicious assaults were released early from prison having served only a fraction of the sentence. Their victims complained to me that they met those people on the street.  The victims were not informed that consideration was being given to granting early release to the persons who had beat them to within an inch of their life, nor were they asked for their views on it.  Will the victim be consulted and given the right to say whether a person should be granted bail?  Will he or she be allowed contribute to the proceedings on early release?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is not a commensurate increase in funding to provide the necessary prison places to accommodate this change in the law, which I support, there will be more and even earlier releases.  People tend to forget about the victims.  They are marginalised to the edges of the process and used by the prosecution in the adversarial contest only if they are needed to win a case.  They are then brought in without any advance notification of court procedures or warning about what to say.  The system is alien to many victims, but they are subjected to rigorous cross examination and consequently some have been traumatised for life.  Will they be brought closer <Col N="205" /> to the centre of the criminal justice system?  Will they have a say in the proceedings against a person who allegedly attacked or violated them and is being allowed bail or early release?</P>
      <P>What about the other changes proposed by Members on this side and by independent commentators outside?  What about the right to silence and implementation of the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 on video taping of interviews, which should be introduced in tandem with the right to silence?  The video taping of interviews is still being carried out on a pilot basis, a rare pilot scheme that has been ongoing for 12 years.  The Minister might comment on those serious matters which relate to the question of bail.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to reduce the length of time between arrest and trial?  What does she propose to do about the archaic procedures in that regard which should have been abolished years ago, perhaps even when we were in Government?  How does she propose to increase prison spaces to the level she envisages will be necessary as a result of this desirable change in our bail laws?  Does she intend to provide a separate remand centre for those remanded in custody and denied bail?</P>

      <P>I am delighted at Fianna Fáil's conversion on this issue.  In preparing for the debate I discovered Dáil questions which I and my colleagues tabled when in Opposition to a number of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice, but they rejected the notion of a referendum on bail. I discovered a motion which I, as shadow Minister for Justice, tabled some five years ago but which was rejected by Fianna Fáil.  Newspaper headlines at the time stated, &ldquo;Bail change plebiscite ruled out by Minister&rdquo;.  The Minister in question was the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, who rejected out of hand my request for a referendum on bail.  My successor as Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Barrett, tabled a Bill on the matter, but that was also rejected by Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Gay Mitchell also introduced legislation in this regard. However, I am delighted at Fianna Fáil's conversion. Like St. Paul on the road to Damascus, a Pauline conversion can bring about an even more radical approach.  Fianna Fáil's suggestions about tougher measures on bail and about the delay in introducing the necessary legislation should be considered in that historical context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to the Progressive Democrats Party is even more amusing.  I recall its outrage when Fine Gael, in Opposition, had the temerity to table motions or legislation on bail.  Its spokesperson, Deputy MacDowell, was outraged that civil liberties should be trampled on by daring to touch the bail legislation or suggesting that the Constitution should be amended. I am pleased the Progressive Democrats Party <Col N="206" /> now recognises the need for change in this area and accepts that it does not make much sense for us to continue to have the most liberal bail laws in Europe.  In 1984 Fine Gael introduced a change in the legislation which had the effect of temporarily reducing the number of crimes committed by people while on bail but the figures increased again at the beginning of this decade.  While further changes in legislation can be made, as outlined by the Minister, it is refreshing to note that Members from all parties support the view promoted by Fine Gael for many years.  I am pleased that there will be an all-party agreement on the need for a bail referendum.</P>
    <P>In referring to the historical background to the question of bail, it is necessary to recall the circumstances surrounding the case of Roger O'Callaghan, whose application to the High Court was refused by Mr. Justice Murnaghan in 1966.  The matter went before the Supreme Court where the landmark decision was made which provided that bail could not be refused except in two circumstances, the possibility of the accused not turning up for trial or interfering with witnesses.  It is ironic that from the foundation of the State until 1966 many other factors were taken into account. Mr. Justice Murnaghan decided that 11 grounds should and could be taken into account by the court when deciding on a bail application.  These included the seriousness of the charge, the nature of the evidence in support of the charge, the likely sentence, the likelihood of the commission of further offences, the possibility of the disposal, while on bail, of illegally acquired property, the possibility of interference with witnesses and jurors, the prisoner's failure to answer to bail on a previous occasion and the fact that the prisoner was caught red-handed.  It was only on appeal that the Supreme Court reversed that decision and decided it was unconstitutional to refuse bail except on the basis that the accused might not attend court for trial or interfere with witnesses. All other grounds for refusal were found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Belgium paedophile murders is the most horrific case I have heard of in my time as a lawyer or politician.  I understand the accused gentleman gave a statement to the prosecuting authorities with led them to discover bodies.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's lack of commitment towards the economic development of the Border counties; stresses the absolute necessity to draw down the maximum amount of EU funding available to this area; and calls on the Government to utilise all available peace initiative funds <Col N="207" /> towards industrial infrastructural development in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>I add the name of Deputy Keaveney, who has joined us since this motion was tabled, to those in whose names it has been tabled.  I thank my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and those on the Front Bench for granting us the liberty to table this motion which many might regard as a parochial matter, but Deputies representing Border counties are extremely grateful for this opportunity and the recognition by our parliamentary party and Front Bench of the difficulties under which a Border Deputy must work.</P>
    <P>Last week we had a full day's debate on Northern Ireland on the effects of the aftermath of the horrific bombs in Lisburn which has been rightly condemned by Members on all sides of the House.  Because of my absence from that debate due to another commitment I wish to record my condemnation of that vile act perpetrated by the Provisional IRA and, in particular, its apparent intention to maim and kill the injured by placing a second bomb strategically near the medical attention area.  My party leader used the only possible words to describe it, &ldquo;an act of cowardice&rdquo;.  I ask those who ordered that atrocity to go to the GPO to read the Proclamation of the Irish Republic which states that no one should dishonour the Republic by acts of cowardice and inhumanity.  This was surely an act of cowardice and a betrayal of all those who have worked on behalf of the Nationalist people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This motion was originally tabled with the intention of being debated early in the year.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that in proposing this motion Deputies representing Border counties are motivated by a genuine and sincere desire to contribute to the economic wellbeing of those counties.  This motion was not brought forward by my party at that time because, in response to several parliamentary questions, the Taoiseach asked the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to chair a task force on funding arrangements for the Border regions.  We suspected that this was a typical delaying tactical device but, nevertheless, Fianna Fáil decided to have patience in the hope that the funds would begin to flow before the year was out.</P>
    <P>I received a copy of the long awaited report in the past few weeks, but I am extremely disappointed with what I have read.  When one hears of a task force being called upon, the image that presents itself is that of a dynamic group of experts who sit down to tackle a problem with due urgency.  I do not know even one member of that task force.  The problem in this case is outlined in the first paragraph of the introduction to the so-called report.  It is described as follows:</P>
    <P>Economic development in the region has been hindered by the fact that because this is a Border region it is cut off from its natural <Col N="208" /> hinterland.  The violence that has taken place in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years has also had a negative impact.  There has been a decline in employment, income and population in the region.  The region also has a higher than average number of workers engaged in agriculture and a relatively weak urban structure.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that no one in my part of the country needed a task force to come up with that description of the disadvantages that surround us. However, when I read those opening remarks I was immediately impressed because I thought this was a document that fully recognised the problem.  I turned over the pages with a modest degree of enthusiasm, but my joy was short lived. What followed were 46 pages of statistics and general information which would have been available on request to any Deputy in the House through parliamentary questions.  It is merely an outline of how funding is supposed to be available from at least six different sources in the European Union with reference to the fact that Forbairt and the IDA also have regional offices in the area.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned at the outset that I wish to share my time with my party leader and Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>

      <P>The second page of the report lists the objectives of the Government's socioeconomic activity.  They turn out to be a list of what probably every Government in the history of the State has included in its priorities and they apply to the country.  It does not state that the six counties immediately south of the Border must be treated as an area for special and urgent action for the very reasons outlined in the opening paragraph I quoted.  We did not ask to be placed alongside a totally unnatural border which carved up our hinterland.  I remind the House that Donegal is surrounded by the Atlantic on one side and the Border on the other and during the worst episodes of the troubles many Donegal people felt that they had only one safe access to and from the county by way of the bridge at Ballyshannon. It was rather like a drawbridge across the moat of an ancient castle.  That is a fair representation of the sense of isolation from Dublin that is often felt in that part of this State.  It is an unfortunate fact that there was always a &ldquo;beyond the pale&rdquo; attitude among many civil servants and politicians when they became ensconced in the corridors of power.  People in the six Border counties that are the subject of this debate consider that they often suffer from that attitude and I am sure people in the other five counties, with the possible exception of Leitrim, will forgive me if I stress the unique position of Donegal in this regard.  For example, if a petrol station across the Border in Strabane had been blown up during the troubles it would have built up twice the level of business it had previously in a period when there was twice the level of unemployment because of the pride <Col N="209" /> of the British Government, but a petrol station across the Border in Donegal would have closed down.  My colleagues representing Border areas will agree that many towns along the Border became ghost towns as a result of the troubles.</P>
      <P>My colleagues from the other Border constituencies will undoubtedly inform the House about specific problems that relate to their areas.  I will refer to some of the shortcomings as they affect Donegal, but I would also like to mention one or two matters which involve the region.  Less than a week ago we became aware of quite an extraordinary episode in the European Parliament when its budget committee voted by 18 votes to five, with nine abstentions, to slash this year's allocation of the peace and reconciliation fund from a proposed £125 million to £47 million.  I was glad that the three voting members of the group to which Fianna Fáil belongs voted against the amendment tabled by the socialist group. What was even more extraordinary was the remark by the president of the budget committee, Mr. Samland, that the Irish Presidency had not pressed the issue against the amendment.  I find that hard to credit and I ask the Minister to clarify this position.  I would also like justification from the Tánaiste and the Labour MEP for the remarks made on RTE radio that it was acceptable that funding be diverted from the peace process if it was not being utilised.  If funding is not being rapidly availed of, I am almost certain that is because of the red tape and confusion involved in the manner in which the scheme is administered. I respectfully suggest that the Minister requests the Government to advise its Members to stay silent on the North if they do not know what they are talking about.  I compliment my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP, for being so vigilant in bringing this matter to our attention and he should not be accused, as he has been by some Fine Gael politicians today, of seeking mischievous political gain.  I sincerely hope that the deliberations of the task force will bring about a simplification of the whole process as promised so that the funding can be drawn down and allocated to where it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I became aware only recently of a rather bizarre event concerning the funding for the transmission of Kinsale Gas which took place some time ago.  A meeting was called by Bord Gáis of all local authorities from the Border counties.  The meeting apparently took place in Monaghan where representatives of the board outlined its plans for extending the pipeline from Drogheda through Cavan and Monaghan to Sligo and on to Letterkenny.  A map was displayed showing the route to be followed.  Naturally the various authorities gave the plan their full support and Bord Gáis went to Brussels where a fund of £1.2 billion was made available.  My information is that the portion of funds intended for the extension went instead to the link-up with Scotland.  Since I am always open to correction, I would welcome a statement from the Minister on <Col N="210" /> whether I have been misinformed.  At least one major industrialist in Donegal has cancelled a huge expansion plan because of the comparatively high cost of energy and another equally major industry in the county has decided to build a new plant close to Dublin where gas is readily available.</P>
    <P>Because of the reasons outlined in the task force report, it goes without saying that the Border region deserves positive discrimination regarding job creation.  That should include a mechanism whereby some compensatory allowance is made to counteract such disadvantages as distance and lack of access to the natural gas grid. Such positive discrimination should also include EU funding to the region at a proportionately higher level than other more developed areas.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for repeating, <i>ad nauseam</i> if necessary, my demand that Donegal more than most counties deserves special attention.  It is potentially one of our richest tourist areas, yet Bord Fáilte down the years has rarely promoted its attractions abroad.  Last June on a Private Member's motion on tourism I said that invariably Bord Fáilte files in plane loads of travel agents from the United States for customary trips to Dublin, Galway and Killarney while the region north of a line from Dublin to Galway is seldom included.  I also said that this year's Bord Fáilte European Workshop was organised for Killarney, having previously been held in Galway and Cork, and that the board's brochure on &ldquo;Walking Tours in Ireland&rdquo;, includes a paid advertisement from Donegal, but there was not a single mention of the county in the editorial.  I mention these matters in the hope that even if the Government ignores them my colleagues in the incoming Fianna Fáil Government will pay attention.  I will continue to remind them.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the task force report, under the heading Recommendations for the Future, the suggestions put forward comprise advice on how to complete an application form and a list of the various offices involved.  Other than stating that there is an urgent need for publicity and information, there are no proposals for positive action.  It is surely a case of the monkey going into labour and producing a mouse.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 28 July 1996 Aileen Hickie in a report headed &ldquo;Are you looking for a job?&rdquo; provided a guide for the job seeker giving details on who is recruiting, where and what types of jobs are on offer.  There is nothing to offer the job seeker in the Border region.  A total of 2,374 were listed, with the names of the companies involved, but not one of them relates to the region from Deputy McGahon's constituency to my area in County Donegal.  On 19 July a shirt manufacturer in Newtowncunningham, County Donegal, was refused a grant by the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  The letter that issued states:</P>
    <P>...we regret to inform you that your project has been unsuccessful on this occasion.  In this case we are unable to offer you assistance but <Col N="211" /> would encourage you to reconsider your application in the light of those guidelines which ADM/CPA have produced.</P>
    <P>At the same time across the Border in Strabane £800,000 was made available to a similar factory. On 31 March 1995 IDB approved £26 million for another factory in Artigarvan.  A sum of £13.5 million was made available by the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to upgrade the Strabane water service.  Castlederg, a small town along the Border in County Tyrone, received a huge cash injection from the British Government.  In a short time £47.5 million was made available for projects across the Border.</P>
    <P>In 1987 a letter from the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, stated:</P>
    <P>This lack of financial additionality is the major drawback from the Government's point of view in so far as integrated operations are concerned.  It could in practice lead to a situation where the existing receipts from Structural Funds would be over concentrated in certain areas at the expense of broader national development priorities.</P>
    <P>That statement was made by the Fine Gael-Labour Government 11 years ago.  Has anything changed in the current climate?  Has action been taken in terms of the proposal for cross-Border development?  Has the task force even mentioned that report which was launched in October 1985? That was a lead-up to the cross-Border study launched by Charles J. Haughey and Peter Brooke in 1990.  Where is that report?</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon should request the Government to follow up on these studies, for which the task force has no need.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to what is probably the most serious development in terms of the Border region and its well being, that is the current crisis north of the Border where once again the threat of murder and mayhem hangs over the entire area, including the region referred to in this motion.  I did not have an opportunity to contribute to last week's debate on this issue because I was in Northern Ireland on another matter, but I mention it here because it is highly relevant to the motion before the House.  During the 18 months or so of the ceasefire the atmosphere on both sides of the Border was transformed and jobs were created, even without Government or EU funding.  Thousands of tourists moved in both directions.  I have already described what happened in the &ldquo;getting to know you&rdquo; process.  This could only lead to increased economic and political development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the present at least peace has been shattered by the bombs in Canary Wharf and Manchester, the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe and more recently the Lisburn bombing.  The murder <Col N="212" /> and maiming by the Provo hard men has been seen by the loyalist hard men as an invitation and a justification to resume the horrible titfortat slaughter of the type seen in Greysteel and the Shankill Road.  Whoever was responsible for the Lisburn bombing should say whether there is a single benefit to any cause from what they did. We can all blame various people for lack of political progress during the ceasefire, but there is no justification whatsoever for placing deadly bombs where human beings, including school children, can so easily be blown to pieces.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleagues who have appealed to the Provisional IRA to make an historic decision to put a stop to this mayhem.  By so doing they would be contributing more to the Border region than a million times any EU fund. Whoever is in Government in 1999 must realise that the west and the Southern Border counties are not ready to lose their objective one status despite wonderful economic progress in Europe. I, therefore, request my colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party to join with us in supporting the motion to ensure that the west and the Southern Border counties are given an opportunity to build infrastructure on a par with the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to speak to the motion which was tabled some time ago following a meeting between an allparty committee, made up of Deputies who represent three of the Border counties and IDA personnel, the aim of which was to exert pressure on the powers that be to ensure that some of the peace and reconciliation programme moneys would be used to fund industrial infrastructural development in Border areas because of the acute problem in enticing industry to the region.  The position in a number of counties is particularly bad.  The view was expressed that some of the moneys under the Delors package should be used to assist the IDA.  As my colleague said, thankfully we have since been joined by Deputy Keaveney who also put her name to the motion.</P>
      <P>The motion calls on the Government &ldquo;to utilise all available peace initiative funds towards industrial infrastructural development in the Border areas&rdquo;.  I ask Deputies on the far side of the House to look carefully at the amendment tabled by the Minister for Finance to the motion, particularly the last paragraph which reads:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann...also recognises that the weight to be given to the various strands of the Peace Programme, including the question of aid towards infrastructural development in the Border region, was based on this local consultative process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated at the recent meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Bath, nobody asked me or any other Oireachtas Member who represents a Border county for our views on the disbursement of these moneys.  The <Col N="213" /> decision was made without reference to the Deputies who represent Border counties who found it necessary to meet the IDA and Ministers to insist that some of the moneys be earmarked for industrial infrastructural development. Deputies on the far side of the House should be conscious of this fact when they troop through the lobbies.</P>
    <P>The need to table the motion became even more acute in light of the efforts by the socialist group in the European Parliament, made up of Labour types, to slash the peace and reconciliation programme funds by £78 million.  MEP Bernie Malone was eloquent in trying to justify this decision on radio recently.  The term &ldquo;national sabotage&rdquo; is often used.  That is what the efforts of Ms Malone and others, to deny Border areas much needed funds for industrial infrastructural development or any of the other matters specified in the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, amount to.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Wulf-Mathies subsequently issued a statement to the effect that the decision to reduce the funding for 1997 shows a lack of solidarity and that a reduction in funding would jeopardise projects that contribute to peace and reconciliation.  I understand that the people who support this move in the EU are now saying it was a bookkeeping exercise to force the budgetary committee to take a different direction in other areas.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter with the Taoiseach last week he was quite dismissive and informed me that I should pursue it with the members of the committee concerned.  In other words, he was washing his hands of the matter.  The following day I was glad when the Tánaiste said he hoped the decision would be reversed.</P>
    <P>The excuse has been given that this was a bookkeeping exercise.  This is indicative of the way in which the funds have been handled from the beginning.  That brings me back to my original point, that the views of public representatives were not taken into account, although meetings were held in the Nuremore Hotel and other places.</P>
    <P>The reason the uptake of funds was slow is that the wrong structures were put in place by the Government.  People in the Border areas did not know what was happening and they were not properly advised as to how they should apply for funds.  When the Minister was asked how many allocations were made out of the initial tranche he declined to give the information to the Dáil. Eleven days later he announced the allocations in the Border region even though the decisions had been made well in advance of our tabling questions in the House.</P>
    <P>This is an urgent matter.  On 24 October the European Parliament will be asked to vote on the issue.  I exhort the Taoiseach and particularly the Tánaiste to intercede with Ms Malone and her Socialist colleagues in Europe to have the peace <Col N="214" /> and reconciliation programme moneys restored. Last week Deputies on the far side of the House, particularly Labour Party Members, berated us and accused us of scaremongering.  They claimed it was not a book-keeping exercise.  Senator Gallagher who represents a Border county said, however, that the decision &ldquo;was flying in the face of many people in the community groups on both sides of the Border who were set to benefit from the peace and reconciliation funds.  The approach they have taken is a matter of profound regret&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When my party's chairman, Deputy O'Hanlon, and I raised the issue on the Adjournment last week the Minister for Finance said that the intermediary bodies were set up following consultation with local groups who stated that the matter should be taken out of the hands of central Government.  In August 1995 the Government decided to involve the Combat Poverty Agency and ADM in the disbursement of these moneys. Nobody, however, took the views of Deputies and Senators into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>They never do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGahon has been a member of a local authority.  On the proper disbursement of moneys to the benefit of local communities, there are no better intermediaries in Border areas than the local authorities.  The decision of not alone the Government but the permanent government to include ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency and not take into account the views of the local authorities beggars belief.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to ensure that cognisance is taken of the fact that the local authorities in Border areas are second to none when it comes to development issues.  They should have been allowed to make an input.</P>
      <P>One of the committees of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body published a report on the EU fund for peace and reconciliation in which it referred to the funding split of 20:80.  I refused to accept its view that the funding split was equitable and reasonable.  I do not know how it arrived at that conclusion and I speak for most Border Deputies, although few of them supported me on that occasion.  The fund was divided on the basis of population, but it did not take into account the fact that the population in the Six Counties had the backing of the British Exchequer while the smaller population on the southern side of the Border did not have the backing of a strong Exchequer over the past 25 years.  Although the Border counties also experienced difficult times during those years, they did not benefit from EU funding as much as they should have.  That is why the split of 20:80 is wrong and should never have been agreed by whatever Government was in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report acknowledges there is a potential problem which must be kept under review.  I ask <Col N="215" /> the Minister to take into account the views of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  I also speak for people like Mr. Seamus Mallon who agreed with me after the meeting in Bath that the lack of consultation between Oireachtas Members and MPs on the other side of the Border in relation to the disbursement of the EU fund for peace and reconciliation was deplorable.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, was an afterthought in that he was appointed a Minister of State after the first 15 were chosen.  It was also an afterthought when he was given responsibility for Border areas.  There are Deputies on his side of the House who know the Border areas a lot better than he does, so I pity him in his task.  He produced the Report of the Task Force on Funding Arrangements in the Border Areas, but it only contains what we have known about the various Border funds for the past couple of years.  The only recommendation he can make is that there should be a better application form and more information leaflets so that people are better informed.</P>
    <P>This motion was tabled a long time ago so the Minister had an opportunity to take into account what all Deputies, particularly those on this side of the House, said.  However, he did not take our views on board.  That is indicative of the way the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare have treated the Border areas. Not one Border Deputy from the three Government parties was nominated as a Minister or a Minister of State.  I say shame on the Government. What happened at the European Parliament budgetary committee is indicative of this Government's lack of priority which we saw from day one when it did not appoint anyone from the Border areas as a Minister.  The Minister comes from a county well divorced from the Border areas.  There is no one with knowledge about the Border areas at Cabinet or junior Minister level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  My main contribution to underpinning the peace process as Minister for Finance was in the autumn of 1994 when I negotiated the substantial and impressive EU aid package worth £240 million.  It was the last thing I completed at the European Council before I was removed from office.  It reflected other member states' strong commitment and support for the peace process in Northern Ireland.  President Jacques Delors took a particular interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a scandal that under the Irish Presidency a European Parliament budgetary committee has decided to cut £78 million from next year's funding. A letter in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by a British socialist MEP, a colleague of Ms Bernie Malone, explains why the Border areas are not a high priority for the Parliament.  I have <Col N="216" /> no doubt the Minister will castigate those people later on.  Deputy Pat Gallagher vigorously opposed the committee's decision and Mr. Joe McCartan abstained from the vote.  I am sure he explained his reasons to the Minister.  Luckily, the EU Regional Affairs Commissioner, Monika WulfMathies, attacked the Parliament's decision in strong terms.  She said she deeply regretted it and she accused MEPs of a lack of solidarity with those who suffered most during the Northern Ireland violence over the years.  She said that &ldquo;reducing the funding would jeopardise projects that contribute to peace and reconciliation&rdquo;.  The reallocation has left dozens of schemes and cross-Border projects at risk, including many road maintenance works in Border counties.  The EU Commissioner has confirmed that the EU's peace packages were overwhelmingly well received and that expenditure on projects was gathering pace. She also said there was no doubt there were enough projects to fully absorb the amounts in 1997 which the Commissioner requested and the Council confirmed.  Fianna Fáil and its UFE colleagues voted in support of the Commission and against the budgetary committee's decision.</P>
    <P>I have long believed that Fine Gael and Labour members of the European Parliament are feeble defenders of the national interest in these matters. I am sure Mr. McCartan will make his position clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>He might clarify why he abstained.  The Tánaiste failed to exercise any influence over the socialist MEPs.  What is the point in the Tánaiste hosting a meeting of socialist leaders in Dublin Castle with lavish hospitality when they vote against Ireland's interests in the peace process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the socialist group's decision leave aspiring Labour candidates in Border areas?  This is a deeply embarrassing saga for the Government which shows an abysmal lack of political co-ordination between the members of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago the Minister for the Environment promised to get rid of potholes over a period of ten years.  Some of the money, which was for the worst affected counties, has now been lost as a result of last week's action.  The responsibility lies not only with the Government MEPs in the European Parliament but with the Government, which has given no priority to the Border counties.  It has little interest in its welfare and this was emphasised when the Government did not appoint a Minister of State for the area.  The Minister, Deputy Carey, looks after the west and <Col N="217" /> the islands.  He cannot be expected to look after everything.</P>
    <P>The US Administration has organised special conferences in Washington and in Pittsburgh to attract investment not just to Northern Ireland but to the Border counties.  However, some time ago an IDA official explained, without contradiction by the Government, that there would be no investments in thinly populated areas along the Border.  Perhaps the Minister could give me a list of the industrial projects announced for or established in the Border counties since December 1994.  What percentage is this of the total number of new industrial jobs announced since then?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy like a list for 1993?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the list for 1993.  When did the peace process start?  The latest statistics show that unemployment is higher in the Border region than in any other region over the last three months compared with a year ago.  The Taoiseach has no interest in cross-Border co-operation. Despite the presence of the US President, the Vice-President, the Secretary of State and the Commerce Secretary at the Washington conference last year, the Taoiseach was conspicuous by his absence.  He was also absent from the Pittsburgh conference last week.  Regardless of what Mr. Major did the Taoiseach should have been at that conference.</P>
      <P>His mention of Northern Ireland in his speech to Congress, though it ran to ten pages, was also imbued with a lack of interest.  In saying we were not motivated by any interest of our own other than that of obtaining an agreement which is reasonable and fair to the aspirations of both communities in the North he was entirely ignoring what a number of Deputies would see as the legitimate economic interest of the Southern border counties in an intensification of cross-Border co-operation.  He talked about reconciliation within Northern Ireland but not reconciliation across the border, which is important also.  He referred to the International Fund for Ireland solely in a Northern Ireland context, ignoring US promotion of investment in the Southern Border counties.  The Taoiseach is completely lacking in the economic vision of his predecessors reflected in the Framework Document, which he mentions so infrequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Séamus Mallon of the SDLP and even members of the British Labour Party, have expressed concern in public and in private in recent weeks about the internal settlement thinking emanating from the vicinity of certain Government parties.  I have had complaints from Northern Ireland about this Government's lack of real commitment to cross-Border co-operation. There has been no adequate effort to increase Civil Service resources to process the big increase <Col N="218" /> in applications following the increase in funding. We have neither openness nor an effort to move on this matter.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are deeply committed to seeing that the Southern Border counties, which were the worst affected by partition and the troubles of the last quarter of a century, get their fair share of the resources available for economic construction.  We brought major industry as well as Government offices and improvements in infrastructure to the Border counties.</P>

We have given full support to the development of the fishing industry, in which Deputy Harte was involved.  The biggest flagship project using Structural Funds in the 1989 National Development Plan, was the restored Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, with which I was glad to be associated and which has transformed tourism in Deputy Nealon's constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  It has never been so good there.  We forced the pace and obtained agreement from the British Government on reopening all Border crossings in the autumn of 1994.  There is little that this Government can point to by way of any comparable commitment and it must not rest till the money is restored.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the autumn of 1994, shortly after the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, the European Commission created a special task force to look into further ways of giving practical assistance to Northern Ireland and the Border counties in consultation with the national authorities. The creation of the task force was a practical expression of the European Union's commitment to the peace and reconciliation process, which had been underlined in the statement of the then Commission President Jacques Delors welcoming the cessation of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its deliberations, the task force considered the new opportunities and special needs arising from the cessation of violence and the developing peace process.  It came to the conclusion that the European Union has a clear interest and vital role in maintaining the momentum for peace and reconciliation, not only for the benefit of the <Col N="220" /> region most affected, but also for the wider benefit of the EU as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this conclusion, the Commission adopted a proposal for a special support programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties to be implemented in the form of a Community initiative under the Structural Funds.  It was proposed that the initiative would run for five years from 1995 to 1999, equivalent to the remaining period of application of the current Structural Funds programme.  Community funding amounting to 300 million ECUs or £24 million would be provided initially for a three year period from 1995 to 1997.  Further financing for the last two years would be subject to review based on a Commission report.  The principle of a special support programme and the allocation of financial resources for the period 1995 to 1997 were subsequently endorsed by the European Council of Heads of Government at Essen, in December 1994.  Deputy Bertie Ahern was at that meeting.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption by the European Commission of draft guidelines for the initiative on 14 February 1995, the two member states drew up an Operational Programme on a parallel timetable with the Commission's consultation on the guidelines with the other EU bodies.  This was informed by an extensive consultation exercise in both eligible areas.  I attended the consultation conference in the Border region, which was held in Ballyconnell, County Cavan on 20 April and was attended by more than 200 delegates, including participants from across the Border in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the two Government sponsored conferences, a further conference was organised on behalf of the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy in conjunction with the European Commission.  The impetus for the conference came from a joint initiative of Northern Ireland's three MEPs, who had been closely associated with the work of the task force from the outset.  The conference, which brought together a broad range of interests from both Northern Ireland and the border counties, was an important opportunity for the European institutions to express, at the highest level, their ongoing support for the developing peace process. It was addressed on behalf of the European Parliament, by Mr. Díaz, the vice president, and Mr. Speciale, the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy and for the European Commission by both President Santer and Mrs. Wulf-Mathies, the Commissioner for Regional Policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned briefly earlier, the consultation process in the Border counties included a conference organised by the Department of Finance held in Ballyconnell, County Cavan on 20 April <Col N="221" /> 1995.  The conference was divided into workshops which dealt with each of the five themes set out in the guidelines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Minister had to do was implement these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will briefly summarise the findings. The social inclusion workshop considered that social inclusion should be the biggest priority within the initiative and that activities should concentrate on development of people.  Social inclusion should be taken into account in all measures under the initiative.  To assist in this process social inclusion should be taken into account in the output and performance indicators from the beginning.  The workshop concluded that emphasis on social inclusion could lead to considerable progress towards reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The urban/rural regeneration workshop stressed the need for a bottom up approach and that funding should be clearly seen as additional. Funding must reach the most disadvantaged and should build bridges not only between Border communities but also within communities.  Social inclusion was considered to be the most important theme of the initiative and one which should be included, not only in this measure but in all measures.</P>
      <P>The cross-Border development workshop saw the need for the initiative to be people oriented. Projects should be directed towards young people, community groups and the disabled.  It was especially desirable to involve young people as the older age groups tended to be more entrenched in their views.  Consequently, there was greater scope for reconciliation among young people.  Large infrastructure projects would quickly use up all the limited resources available under the initiative and should be excluded. However, there should be room for small scale projects which would benefit local people.  This is especially true in the case of improvements to county roads and would also include local north-south electricity interconnectors.</P>
      <P>The productive investment workshop stressed that the priorities should be locally driven, especially where the potential for market expansion was identified, and not be entirely constrained by national policy perspectives.  The employment workshop agreed that activities should be locally concentrated and controlled. Activity should be on a small scale, well publicised, transparently administered and the chosen agency should be accessible to all.  The priority was to create longterm sustainable jobs, especially in the services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Border Regional Authority, which is made up of the local representatives of each of the political parties, and the EU Operational Committee were closely involved in the consultation process and in addition were asked to make a specific <Col N="222" /> submission in response to the commission's guidelines.  The submission by the authority emphasised the following points: first, the need to use the initiative to promote reconciliation, both cross-Border and cross-community, which must ultimately occur between people, that is, people meeting each other, doing business with each other, exchanging experience, addressing shared problems and visiting each other's regions; second, the need to focus the initiative on communities, areas, problems and opportunities associated with the peace process, and not merely on socio-economic development generally, however worthwhile this may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Who better to do that than the local representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Third, the need to differentiate the initiative from the many EU-assisted national, regional and local development programmes operating in the region; fourth, the need to minimise further proliferation of new institutional structures in the already crowded landscape of development in the region.  Specifically, account must be taken of the existing activities of national Government departments and agencies in the region, of local authorities and of new and local developments, such as Leader groups, county enterprise boards and the partnership companies, and of the programmes of the IFI.  Fifth, regarding management of the initiative, the authority wants a genuinely bottom up approach whereby organisations and communities in the region can be involved in decisions about the programme over and above what occurs in mainstream operational programmes.  This is what is happening in the region.</P>
      <P>The views I have outlined are only a small sample of the many initiatives received by the Government.  All recognise the particular emphasis the programme would need to place on measures to support peace and reconciliation. There was no support for the view that the programme should allocate significant sums to infrastructure. The overwhelming consensus of those consulted endorsed the view that the prospect of lasting peace requires particular efforts to overcome the effects of the destruction of normal economic and social relations.  By addressing these challenges the programme aims to help secure a lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In drawing together proposals for the special support programme for peace and reconciliation, the relevant authority in both member states took into account the overwhelming need to maintain the momentum for peace, the prevailing economic and social conditions in eligible areas, the priorities set for the initiative by the Commission, the results of the prior appraisal and the outcome of the consultation arrangements.  All of these have combined to provide the rationale for the <Col N="223" /> programme.  In addition, in drawing up the programme full regard was had to ensuring the optimum of complementarity and integration with the Community Support Framework Operational Programmes and relevant Community initiatives, especially the Northern Ireland INTERREG programmes, in addition to the range of activities carried out under the IFI.</P>
    <P>In the Border regions especially there was a clearly perceived need to build on the support available under the Community Support Framework and the INTERREG programme to fully address the negative perceptions that the region has had to face.  There are specific tourism measures under the urban and rural regeneration sub-programme with set out to give the necessary boost to ongoing efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>While there will be some scope for the statutory tourism agencies in this, the major emphasis is on bottom up development arising from community-based actions.  If the present peace process proves successful, then the restoration of economic and other normality in Northern Ireland should result in considerably lessening the specific and unique problems faced by the Border region <i>vis à vis</i> the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As to how the programme should be implemented, the European Commission task force, following its own widespread consultations in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland, strongly recommended that as much as possible of the implementation of the programme be devolved to local delivery mechanisms.  Given the objectives of peace and reconciliation and the paramount importance of the need to combat social exclusion, it was considered that implementing mechanisms independent of Government and closer to the grassroots offered the best means of achieving these goals.  The Commission, in adopting the report of the task force, required the respective administrations to draw up proposals putting these recommendations into effect.</P>
    <P>To ensure the independence of the intermediary funding bodies the Commission required that they be funded through the medium of global grant agreements signed directly between them and the Commission.  The bodies set up have full discretion within the parameters set by the programme in relation to the implementation of the measures for which they are responsible. Deputies have been critical of differences in emphasis in approach, north and south.  They should bear in mind that the exercise of this discretion sometimes gives rise to differences in interpretation between intermediary funding bodies north and south dealing with similar actions and measures.  The joint monitoring committee for the programme monitors the activities of all of the implementing mechanisms and is in <Col N="224" /> a position to require coordination of actions where this is appropriate and necessary.</P>
    <P>This devolution of responsibility for implementing measures under the programme required a number of innovative mechanisms north and south, and the difficulties experienced have been broadly similar.  I am pleased to note that while the setting up of the partnership structure based on district councils in Northern Ireland was long and complex, the cooperation of all parties in the partnership has survived the ending of the IRA ceasefire and the community strife engendered in the aftermath of Drumcree.</P>
    <P>The devolved delivery mechanisms for the Border counties were put in place following a series of extensive consultations between Government Departments and the Commission.  ADM Limited, already charged with responsibility for local development, and the Combat Poverty Agency were the bodies charged with delivering a wide range of measures across the programme.  These report to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Social Welfare respectively. Cooperation North, in conjunction with IBEC and the CBI, implements the cross-Border business and culture measure.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for overseeing this.</P>

      <P>While the intermediary funding bodies were aware, from the middle of 1995, of the role required of them under the programme, their statutory responsibilities became effective on 8 December 1995 when, with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on behalf of the Commission, they signed the global grant agreements.  The bodies then had to set up offices and take on staff.  This process will be substantially completed by the end of 1996, which is expeditious.  Since that date the bodies have been actively involved in <Col N="225" /> implementing the actions provided for under the measures.</P>
      <P>Another innovative delivery mechanism involved county led task forces operating in each of the six Border counties.  They are responsible for delivering a wide range of actions in the urban and rural regeneration areas.  The task forces have a considerable degree of discretion in deciding how the allocation should be spent, but the programme requires that representatives and relevant local interests are consulted as appropriate. The Department of the Environment has responsibility for overseeing the activities of the task forces.  The total EU funding disbursed under these devolved mechanisms totals £33.7 million or over 70 per cent of the amount allocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It said the funds provided under this measure should not be used for large infrastructural developments.  Deputy Bertie Ahern agreed to this at Essen, long before this Government took office.  I am somewhat puzzled by these queries but I promised the Deputies that I will raise this matter during the mid term review and I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposal of the budget committee of the European Parliament to cut 100 million ECU from the peace programme.  As I stated earlier, the Essen European Council in December 1994 agreed the principle of a multi-annual programme and the allocation of additional funding of 300 million ECU which <Col N="226" /> would provide support for urban and rural regeneration, employment, cross-Border development, social inclusion and investment promotion for Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  Funding for this initiative has been provided through the annual EU budget.  The first 200 million ECU was funded from Structural Funds resources while the additional 100 million ECU was drawn from the reserve for Community initiatives.</P>
    <P>In the draft 1997 budget sent to the Parliament by the Council, provision was made for commitment appropriations of 159.9 million ECU for the special programme for regions in both parts of Ireland.  The draft budget for 1997 is now being considered by the European Parliament as part of the budgetary procedure.  However, the European Parliament's committee on budgets has reduced the commitment appropriation by 100 million ECU.  Its justification for doing so is that the resources provided were not fully utilised in 1995 and that expenditure in 1996 is likely to be significantly below the amounts provided.  The committee envisages that the unused appropriations from previous years should be carried forward.</P>
    <P>The Parliament has taken the view that the savings which would accrue in 1997 should be used to provide additional funds for other programmes. Ireland totally rejects the position of the budget committee and calls on the European Parliament at its plenary session on 24 October to restore the amounts proposed by the Council.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the budget council at its second reading of the budget in November will reject any amendment which would put at risk the funding of the programme in 1997.  I hope the Parliament will take account of the Council's strong view on this matter.  As the Deputies mentioned, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Ms Wulf-Mathies, issued a statement which was strongly critical of the European Parliament budgets committee's action.  Ireland supports her view and this matter was dealt with in the House last week on the Adjournment.  The House is united in rejecting the committee's proposal.</P>
    <P>The special EU programme for peace and reconciliation was originally conceived to support the peace process in the North of Ireland following the IRA ceasefire.  It was not initially the Commission's intention that it should also apply to the Border counties.  The Government argued strongly that the Border region should also be included in the emerging aid framework and following much discussion the Commission agreed to include Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Monaghan.  The Government continued to push for the inclusion of the entire Border region and the inclusion of County Sligo was eventually conceded by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that during the consultation period indicative proportions of a 75:25 per cent breakdown between north and south were discussed.  However, Deputies of the party opposite signed a protest resolution which was highly critical of the Commission's thinking on <Col N="227" /> the matter.  Copies were sent to the EU President, Mr. Santer, and the regional Commissioner, Ms Wulf-Mathies, and soon afterwards the Commissioner informed both member states that the funding would be proportioned on an 80:20 basis. I will allow the House to draw its own conclusions and I ask Deputy McDaid to ensure that meetings of his party discuss this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to give some of my time to Deputy Nealon. I am committed to working with everybody in the region and I am disappointed that the Deputies are trying to create a smokescreen about EU funding and the peace initiative which are trying to lift the people in the North of Ireland, not to drag them down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have full confidence that the Government will draw down every penny available to it from EU funding.  The Government may have some small faults but refusing money is not one of them.  Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, every Government has drawn the maximum amounts available and our real difficulty will start when the funds begin to dry up in 1999.</P>
      <P>However, the mechanism for processing and handling the funds available in the Border areas to which the motion applies needs urgent attention. There is a plethora of organisations, including Leader, which is answerable to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Partnership is run by the Department of the Taoiseach and county enterprise boards are under the Department of Enterprise and Employment. INTERREG is under the Department of Tourism and Trade, and the peace and reconciliation programme and the IFI are answerable to many Departments.  There is undoubtedly great difficulty in that respect.  The end result of all these hands on board is not greater efficiency but confusion, overlapping and passing the buck.  The duplication and triplication of administration is costly and office expenses, etc., also eat a fair share of the cake.  My impression is that one agency does not have a clue about what another agency is doing.  How could it?</P>
      <P>County Sligo has tried to alleviate this problem by housing as many agencies as possible in one location; it is a semionestopshop.  I understand no other county has taken this action and this aspect needs urgent attention.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has a good track record in terms of trying to bring the agencies together under one roof to save on administration costs and he should apply himself to this point.</P>
      <P>Regarding local input, another aspect the Minister of State could consider is giving more beef to the county strategy boards which represent many people.  However, there is no point improving it on the bottom up level, unless improvements are also made at the top.  There is a need for co-ordination and a bringing together at Government level because the position is chaotic in terms of the mechanism for delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Regarding the slow takeup of what is on offer, I understand it is proving difficult to get good projects which meet the criteria.  One area of particular difficulty is the cross-community aspect of the peace and reconciliation programme.  It is not easy to get suitable projects which fulfil the criteria or to find a common cause between communities in Counties Sligo and Tyrone or Leitrim and Antrim.  There is a problem and the criteria should be examined in that respect.  However, the type of mechanism I mentioned earlier is of even more urgency.</P>
    <P>Overall, the concept of special designation for the Border counties is good and the schemes are basically good.  They meet the real needs which are created by the difficulties of the Border.  They have produced some excellent results but they are not doing it to maximum efficiency.  The most important thing, alluded to by Deputy McDaid, is peace along the Border and north of the Border. One of the great pleasures of my career was to see the movement of tourists from north to south resumed during the summer of 1995.  That can be reinstated and I hope it will happen before too long.</P>

      <P>Today's decision of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to exclude Monaghan from the Russian beef market was appalling.  I know two other counties in the south were also involved.  This was indicative of this Government's approach to so many aspects of our life, but particularly its approach to the Border area.  The same Minister is going to Russia next week having agreed to that exclusion.  I thought that at the very least the Taoiseach would go to Russia next week to undo the damage done by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is about the neglect of the Border counties by the Government, but the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, spoke only of the programme for peace and reconciliation.  I do not know why.  There are many other good programmes in existence.  Reference has already been made to the fact that the EU budget committee wants to reduce that programme by £78 million and that a Labour MEP voted for that decision.  I can understand that because the Labour Party has never offered anything to the Border counties or to rural Ireland.  The three Fianna Fáil members voted against the decision of the budget committee.  My colleagues have referred to the remarks of the President of the budget committee that the Irish Presidency was not fighting hard enough.  I compliment Deputy Gallagher for raising this issue.  It is interesting to note that Mr. Bob McCartan referred to him as being mischievous. <Col N="229" /> This is in keeping with what some of the Members on the Government side of the House had to say about him; he was anything but mischievous.</P>
    <P>Another point worth recording is that the Tánaiste was supposed to make a major speech in Pittsburgh but he did not go there.  There was no reason he should not have gone.  It is not sufficient to say that because he had to go to the Middle East for a day he could not go to Pittsburgh. That too is an indication of the Government's indifference to the Border counties.  We had great expectations after the Washington Conference but saw very little in terms of overseas investment.  In my constituency, which covers two of the Ulster counties, 41 jobs were created in one county and 79 in the other out of a total of 11,500 overseas jobs created in this country in 1995.  That is an indication of this Government's commitment to the Border area.</P>

      <P>The Minister should study the census.  If he did he might do something to help the Border counties.  The Minister's task force made two recommendations.  One was that nothing should be done to integrate the bodies that have funding to distribute.  This is in conflict with the speech the Minister made here tonight; the other is that we should have more information, a newsletter and more documents about European funding.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to take an interest in the Border areas and to interest himself in what is going on in Europe and make sure that, on the next occasion, the Labour MEP votes in favour of the decision that would suit the Irish people. He should, even at this late stage, reshuffle his Cabinet and appoint a Minister from the Border counties.</P>
      <P>We want to see the money spent on worthwhile projects.  We want to see better infrastructure, including a national primary road from Dundalk to Sligo and IDA advance factories.  Reference has already been made to the fact that Strabane got 75 per cent of the cost of an advance factory. The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has studied the maps and he can see where the national primary roads are.  One glaring omission is a road east-west-north of the Dublin-Galway road.  This is another indication that the Border counties are not getting the attention they deserve.  Funding is available at the moment and the Minister should ensure the money is spent in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> A resolution is before the United States Congress to introduce tax free measures in the 12 Border counties, six north and six south.  I ask the Government to look at that and co-operate with the members of Congress because I am told this would be the greatest single measure to attract overseas investment to the Border counties.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to cross-Border co-operation and to the fact that competitiveness on this side of the Border is not what it should be <i>vis-à-vis</i> the northern side of the Border.  I appeal to the Government, and specifically the Minister for Finance, to address that difficulty in the budget particularly in regard to PRSI.  There is a very serious problem in regard to the value of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.  The labour intensive industries along the Border, particularly the food sector, are feeling the pinch.  I have already referred to the very serious damage done by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in his announcement today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Hanlon for sharing his time.  The debate on Border funding generally is long overdue.  For the last year or two it has been a major bone of contention with the public representatives in the Border areas that lots of money seemed to be available under different headings, yet when I looked for tangible evidence of money being spent in our area, it was not there.  My constituency has one of the highest unemployment levels in the country.  It is a Border county and has been very seriously affected by the troubles of the last 26 years.  I am sure there were public representatives from other constituencies who felt envious because there was a perception that money was available under different headings, but that money was not having a direct impact in the Border counties.  County Louth might not be as badly affected as other counties which, because of their geographic location, would find it even more difficult to attract industrial development.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach decided to give responsibility for Border county development to a Minister of State our hopes were raised.  This decision was overdue and we all felt that appointment would prove to be a focal point for a coordinated approach to the development of the Border counties. Sadly, the results we had hoped for have not materialised.  The funds are in place, we have different agencies and intermediary bodies who have resources available to them, yet they are not making the necessary impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forces of economic development mean that there is a gravitational pull to the centre of population.  The greater Dublin area holds a certain attraction to investors from outside the country, because the whole range of support requirements which would form part of their shopping list is available there.  The attractiveness of industrial sites in the greater Dublin area means that industrial sites in Border counties, are considerably less attractive.  The major priority in the Border counties is the industrial infrastructure which <Col N="231" /> is very deficient.  If the Minister of State does nothing other than redirect money which is available for a wide range of activities into industrial site development, he will have done a good day's work for the Border counties and they will be grateful to him if he succeeds.  I do not see any indication in the report his Department produced recently that there is a move in that direction. The report merely outlined what representatives in the Border counties already know in regard to the responsible agencies, existing funding, etc. There is no indication in that report that the Department is taking the decision to expend money in areas where it is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border development has been mentioned. The town of Crossmaglen has been in the cockpit of the troubles in Northern Ireland for the past 25 years.  Successive British Governments did not invest one penny in that town.  The families who grew up in South Armagh had to go to Dundalk and further afield to seek employment. A calculated decision was taken that there would not be any industrial development in the area.</P>
    <P>Anyone familiar with the geography of the area will know that parts of Monaghan and of the Louth constituency are contiguous to Crossmaglen.  The type of economic activity in the town is relevant to the townlands immediately south of the Border because if employment opportunities had been available there, it would have been the logical place for families to seek employment.</P>
    <P>I am talking about a town that has been in a pivotal position with regard to the troubles in Northern Ireland for the past 25 years, yet the agencies in place are not doing anything to rectify its position.  Industrial investment in this area would create employment and go a long way towards social inclusion with resulting tangible and positive economic development.  I invite the Minister of State to visit the area.  The public representatives would be happy to meet him to discuss its problems.</P>
    <P>In the past two years various trade conferences have been held in different locations around the Border.  High profile personalities were invited to speak at these conferences and give the impression that something was being done for the Border counties.  These people stood up, made their speeches and left.  Nothing else happened.</P>
    <P>A group in the House of Representatives in the United States is currently trying to progress a Bill through the House that will establish a special trade arrangement for the 12 Northern counties, but the responsible Government Departments here do not want to know anything about it.  A more positive move could not have been made than to establish a special bilateral trade arrangement between the 12 Northern counties and the United States.  It would transform that whole area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to immediately contact the relevant Department, be it Foreign Affairs or Tourism and Trade, and request it to <Col N="232" /> urgently examine and actively pursue the proposal on the table.  Representatives visited this House last week and sought a meeting with the public representatives in the Border counties. Will the Minister of State examine that proposal with urgency?  I wanted to make a number of other points but I wish to share my time with Deputy Keaveney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for affording me an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As a Deputy who has lived close to the Border I support the motion.  The number of people on the live register in County Donegal has increased by 476 in the past 12 months.  That is significant.  The hardest hit areas in regard to unemployment are Ballybofey, Letterkenny and Búncrana which, like the rest of Inishowen, is almost solely reliant on one industry and, in particular, one company.  Is this a sign of the Government's commitment to economic development, particularly in the Border counties?</P>
      <P>What incentives are given to people who set up in businesses that can match those which exist less than a mile across the Border?  We should not compare one regime with another, but in terms of the economy in Border areas another regime impinges on everything we do.  If a new industry wishing to set up has a choice of location, it will go across the Border as my colleague, Deputy McDaid, already outlined.  This has been seen recently and repeatedly in Donegal due to the incentives given by the UK Government throughout the 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland. It attracts and supports economic investment and replaces what has been lost in terms of business due to the destruction that has occurred in the North.  Such support is not given to the southern Border counties for their loss of business which is as significant as that in the North.</P>
      <P>Our current industry has sister companies on the other side of the Border and the double taxation issue alone is forcing many employees to seek employment in the Northern branch.  This in turn places great pressure on the employers. Beyond industry, the double taxation issue is driving young and old alike out of our Border counties.  They are moving away to teach, nurse or follow other professions.  With them goes their expertise and their spending power, and their leaving creates a hole in the fabric of many rural areas.</P>
      <P>What steps have been taken to address this problem and redress the economic deficit?  No steps have been taken, and that encourages many families to move across the Border, such as those referred to by my colleague in the Crossmaglen area.  People will settle in areas where there is employment and avoid the difficulties currently being experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On economic commitment, we look to our natural resources in Donegal, particularly the fishing industry.  This industry is heavily relied upon for jobs and the economic benefit it creates. While it has great potential we have what has <Col N="233" /> been termed a dilapidated fleet, not a term of which we can be proud.  Pressure must be brought to bear to ensure Ireland is given the same opportunities as our European counterparts.  Instead of policies geared towards repairing and expanding our harbours, renewing our boats and chasing an increase in quota, we are getting collapsed piers, the threat of a reduction in quota and an older fleet which is patched up every so often to stop it from being decommissioned entirely.  Would a new parachute be put on a 50 year old plane?</P>
    <P>Major fishing ports such as Greencastle, which has a substantial turnover, are not receiving serious attention.  Without any national primary or secondary roads in Inishowen, large fishing lorries must negotiate narrow roads and the two biggest boats in the fleet are unable to berth in the harbour at Greencastle.  Do we really appreciate the resources in our fishing industry?  Will there be a commitment now when our fleet is under threat of a 40 per cent reduction that the Government will fight this issue to the end?  If it does not, a particular Border area will be beyond help.</P>
    <P>Through participating in the north west region cross-Border group, many aspects of our peripherality have been examined.  Cross-Border groups have begun the search for help by looking to Europe.  These are strong, well established groups with a great deal of expertise on where funding is needed.  They and other local authorities should have been asked to help.  The EU gave a practical commitment that needed the backing of political will.  The commitment was given at the time in relation to the Jacques Delors package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to raise a matter which is especially important to young people.  I refer to the issue of driving licences and the associated driving test.</P>
      <P>Currently, young people are being discriminated against in an unfair manner, and I ask that the situation be reviewed immediately.  A person aged 18 who gets a provisional licence is likely to spend this first licence just learning to drive. Many young people go through the first two licences learning to drive, if they have access to a car.  If a person does not take the test by then, he or she may not get a third or subsequent licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> The rules relating to provisional licences indicate that a person can be regarded as an applicant for a first provisional licence only after five years has elapsed from the time they previously held a provisional licence.  This amounts to a five-year ban, which is unfair, and I would like the Minister to clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>Many third level students have a licence which they renew in order to be able to learn to drive but do not have the time to properly address their driving lessons, and time can run out unexpectedly for them.  This can mean that somebody looking for a job which specifies the need for a car is automatically faced with a battle to get a subsequent licence.  Similarly, people who are unemployed when they leave secondary school may have an interest in learning to drive but may not have the financial resources to follow up a strict regime of learning to drive.  Either way, a person who reaches the age of 22 or 23 can find himself or herself in no-man's-land when trying to get a third or subsequent licence.  Surely it is very harsh treatment if there is a five-year wait before they are treated as first-time provisional licence holders again.</P>
    <P>It is galling that many people convicted of serious driving offences are disqualified from driving from six months to a year.  If people who want to learn legally to drive a car are effectively banned by the current regulations and others who have been convicted of an offence are back on the road, is this not an anomaly?  Young people have enough burdens in relation to mobility without the added complication of having to fight a case over years for a subsequent provisional driving licence.  The cost of car insurance for young people makes it almost impossible for young people to drive a car.  Insurance companies are planning to increase insurance premiums by five to ten per cent.  The rates for under 25s makes one wonder how anyone can afford to drive even if they had a provisional or full driving licence. The cost of insurance might explain why someone might not have a provisional licence, but that is an issue for another day.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to clarify and, if necessary, review the five-year wait and replace it with something more humane and more in line with punishments meted out for the serious offences. I ask the Minister to look at the exceptional circumstances clause in relation to the third or subsequent licence and make the provisional licence accessible.  This would be in the interest of having people legally on the road, not sitting at home waiting for a bus, because in rural areas the wait can be long.  Travel broadens the mind; perhaps the Minister would broaden the rules.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support everything that my colleague, Deputy Keaveney has said.  This matter has been brought to my attention by a number of younger people.  One case in point is <Col N="235" /> that of a young teacher in Roscarberry in my constituency who applied for and got a provisional licence, became familiar with driving and did her test on the second licence.  She failed the test.  She applied to the licensing authority in the County Hall in Cork to be told that she could not get another provisional licence for five years.  She was appalled because she had a job and had to drive to work.  She made the case that people who have been convicted as a result of serious irregularities, accidents, sometimes drunken driving, can get back on the road in about six months, but she has been sentenced to a five-year term off the road. I would like the Minister to look sympathetically at changing the statutory order relating to this matter, to give young people a chance by allowing them to have three provisional licences and by reducing the five years very substantially to, perhaps, one year.  I am not saying that people should be able to get 15 provisional licences.  I am just asking the Minister to look more humanely and sympathetically at the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to clarify the situation in relation to granting provisional licences and driving tests.  I would like to thank Deputies Keaveney and Walsh for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the provisional driving licence system is to facilitate persons who wish to learn to drive in order to pass a driving test.  The provisional licence was never intended to be an ongoing permit to drive &mdash; that is the purpose of the driving licence which is available only to those who pass the driving test.</P>
      <P>Over the years, far too many people have been able to drive, year after year, on the basis of a provisional licence, often in noncompliance with the law as regards being accompanied by a qualified driver.  Up to 1984, the only requirement necessary to allow renewal of a provisional licence was evidence of having applied for a driving test.  There was no absolute need to actually sit the test and many people simply applied for a test, took out a new provisional licence, then cancelled the application for the test, and were refunded the test fee.</P>
      <P>Obviously, this practice could not be permitted to continue.  While the letter of the law was being met, the spirit was being flouted, and people were allowed go on driving for years with only a provisional licence and with clear implications for safety on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1994, therefore, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, made amending regulations which made it a requirement for eligibility for a third or subsequent provisional licence that an applicant would have undergone a driving test within the previous two years.  These regulations came into effect on 1 August 1994.  The <Col N="236" /> changes could not be said to have been unreasonable; they were designed simply to encourage people to undergo the driving test and qualify for a full driving licence as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>After the new regulations were made, initial approaches by applicants for a third and subsequent provisional licence, who had not undergone the driving test, were dealt with in a flexible manner by licensing authorities where applicants indicated that they were unaware of the new regulations.  Each such individual was informed in writing, however, that on the next occasion two years later a further licence would not be available unless he or she had undergone the test. Such people, therefore, had two years in which to complete their preparations and undergo the test. It appears, however, that numbers of them did not do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not wish to put people off the road without good reason but, at the same time, he wants to ensure that the basic purpose of the 1994 regulations is generally confirmed.  He is anxious that people will not be trapped in a classic dilemma of being able neither to get a new licence nor to undergo the driving test, and he is having the regulations specially examined with a view to finding an acceptable solution to this.  I assure the House that the Minister will take action on the matter at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had cause on several occasions to raise my concerns as to the management of our major committal prison, Mountjoy.  I thought we had heard it all in relation to well-known criticisms of our detention system and, in particular, Mountjoy.  We know there are over 1,000 prisoners unlawfully at large, that 4,000 prisoners are released early on so-called temporary release just to make space, that thousands of pounds in compensation has been paid out to the victims of serious crimes committed by people out on temporary release, that a young man charged with a serious sexual offence, on a mobility trip to the cinema, was able to escape from custody, that people sent to jail for some of the most serious crimes are able to nip down to the pub from an open prison, that 197 persons have absconded from our open prisons this year, 55 of whom are still at large.  Such a catalogue of disasters has warranted the bringing of our detention system into serious disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can imagine my surprise when I learnt that Mountjoy Prison would be used as a public concert venue for five evenings from 15 to 21 November. One of the main exercise yards in the prison will be used to stage a production of &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo;.  The show will be open to the paying public and tickets are on sale in retail outlets at prices of up to £25 per performance.  There is a reasonable case to be made under ideal and <Col N="237" /> agreed conditions of security for providing some occasional entertainment for prison inmates but there must be serious questions as to whether such entertainment should be open to the public by the purchase by way of credit card of tickets sold in a retail outlet and as to whether Mountjoy is an appropriate venue for such a public event. In previous times I understand there was a strict selection process by way of invited guest lists which would be scrutinised by the Department of Justice, but I understand from the Prison Officers Association that this is an unprecedented departure from the normal safety and security arrangements for such events in the prison.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy is no ordinary penal institution.  It has been described by its own visiting committee as a potential volcano.  It is a prison by all accounts in a state of permanent crisis.  It has a serious drugs problem, both of the hard and soft variety.  A significant number of inmates are HIV positive or suffering from full-blown AIDS. There are concerns at all times about security in Mountjoy.  This year there have been nine escapes from security prisons and almost all of these have been from Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Justice how anyone could consider such a place as a suitable venue for the staging of a musical in these conditions.  On whose initiative is this show being staged at the prison?  Was the Minister involved in the decision to approve this?  Has there been adequate or, indeed, any consultation with the prison officers in Mountjoy in relation to putting on this event? Has the security risk been fully assessed?  Could the State be liable for substantial damages in the event of a paying member of the public being attacked or injured at this performance?</P>
    <P>Our whole prison system is in crisis.  Public confidence as to the management of the system has all but evaporated, yet the Minister presides over all these matters without a blush.  It should be the Minister's priority to inject some strategic and accountable structures of management into our prison service rather than inviting trouble by becoming involved in an event such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague the Minister for Justice, I assure Deputy O'Donnell that the Minister is grateful she has raised this matter this evening and wishes to assure the House that she and the governor of Mountjoy have taken immediate steps to have discontinued the sale of tickets through retail outlets for this event.  My view is that it is not entirely fair to infer from that that the concept of putting on such a performance at Mountjoy is necessarily a bad idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to set out for Deputy O'Donnell the background to this production.  Pimlico Productions, which is a non-profit making organisation, in association with the governor and staff <Col N="238" /> of Mountjoy Prison, is staging a production of &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo; in Mountjoy Prison.  The show is scheduled to run from 15 to 21 November.</P>
    <P>The annual drama project has been staged in Mountjoy for over ten years.  Since 1985 public performances have been a feature of the project. Audiences have been made up of relatives of the prisoners taking part and invited members of the public.  For this year's production Pimlico proposed, and it was agreed, to allow members of the public attend a number of performances and to make a subscription in the form of the price of a ticket towards the cost of the production.  It is also proposed to make a donation to a relevant Irish charitable organisation from the proceeds.  The tickets were to be made available through a method which would allow the applicants to be vetted.  It was not the intention that tickets would be sold in retail outlets and the Minister for Justice, in co-operation with the governor of Mountjoy, has ordered that no further tickets be sold in retail outlets from today.  The Minister is investigating how this came about and how many tickets have been sold to date.  When she has ascertained all the facts she will then review the situation.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for raising this issue which I understand was raised on a radio show today.  The Deputy is probably aware that productions such as this are staged as part of the normal educational and rehabilitation programmes which are in place in our prisons.  It should be noted that the Mountjoy branch of the Prison Officers Association has no difficulty with the staging of this production in Mountjoy Prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to deal with this issue.  What progress has been made in relation to a potential purchaser for the Semperit Plant following the visit of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the US recently?  We would all agree that every effort should be made to save the 650 jobs at this plant.  My understanding is that there are two potential purchasers, Cooper US and Kumho Company in Korea.  It is unfair of Continental AG to close this plant by 6 December.  Representatives of the workforce have sought a three-month extension and it should be granted.  If a viable concern is to take over the plant, time is required.  I call on Continental AG, the parent company, to demonstrate publicly its sincerity and that it wants to save these valuable jobs by agreeing to a three month extension on the closure date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to undertake a visit to the Kumho Company in Korea to demonstrate the Government's interest in its purchase of this plant.  It goes without saying that a strong lobby <Col N="239" /> by an Irish Government Minister has added significance in that part of the world.  No stone should be left unturned by the Government in endeavouring to attract a purchaser who would save the jobs of the 650 workers.</P>
    <P>I stress the importance of ensuring that a potential global competitor of Continental AG is not excluded from purchasing this factory.  It has been said that the Korean company, Kumho, would fall into this category.  I seek an absolute assurance from the Minister that he has got a guarantee from the Semperit parent company that it will not veto such a competitor coming into Ireland and purchasing this plant.  This is a central issue in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to be up front on this point and if he has any concerns or doubts he should spell them out.  A fallback option would be an employee buyout.  This option should not be ruled out and should be assisted by the Department if all else fails.  A feasibility study is being carried out with State aid and I support this approach.  These jobs in Semperit are extremely valuable, not only for the individuals but also for their families, the local community and businesses and individuals whose livelihoods are connected to and dependent on this major enterprise.  There is much at stake and I ask the Minister to maximise his efforts and those of the IDA and other relevant agencies in the coming weeks and months to ensure that these people can continue to work in their community and that the company can continue to grow and develop within the EU into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter.  During his recent visit to the United States the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, was able to have extensive discussions with senior executives of a major tyre manufacturer.  The IDA had already made contact with the company which has visited and inspected the plant at Ballyfermot.  The company has confirmed that it is interested in acquiring a production plant in Europe and that it has a preference for an acquisition rather than a green field development.  It has agreed to visit the Semperit plant again as soon as prior travel commitments will permit and has indicated that this will be around mid-November.  As I already told the unions at Semperit, this company is not interested in acquiring the plant as a going concern and any acquisition would take place after liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During our discussions the company representatives signalled a number of difficulties foreseen in relation to a takeover.  Chief among these would be the absence of established brands and markets.  It pointed out that it would take five years to fully establish new markets.  It also regards labour costs at Semperit as high.  I understand the company is in communication with the <Col N="240" /> Semperit management and that a number of issues raised by it are being addressed.</P>
    <P>The IDA has carried out an intensive marketing programme of the Semperit plant and, to this end, all leading tyre companies worldwide have been contacted.  A Korean company has also expressed an interest in the Semperit plant.  The IDA is engaged in intensive follow-up contact with both prospective purchasers and with Semperit and Continental in an effort to arrange site visits and to facilitate and encourage communications between the parties.  The Deputy may be assured that the IDA and I are making every effort possible to ensure that the maximum number of jobs at the plant are saved through arranging a suitable sale.  I understand that a financial adviser is to travel from Dublin this evening to visit Continental to assist in making arrangements for preliminary discussions on a sale, should that be possible.  To ensure a future for Semperit at Ballyfermot, the present situation requires not only a willing purchaser but also a willing seller. I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House will join me in encouraging the parent company, Continental, to facilitate the work in hands in the effort to effect a sale for the plant at Ballyfermot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for being present to reply.  This matter relates to the recently announced recruitment drive for the Defence Forces, in particular, the very low age cut-off, and the fact that FCA service is not being taken into account for age qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>Even though it is late and limited, I welcome the recruitment drive for the Defence Forces.  I say this as someone from Athlone, a town which has depended for much of its modern life on the local Custume Barracks, the headquarters of the Western Command.  To say that the advertisements in the daily and Sunday newspapers for new recruits caused consternation in Athlone and, I am sure, other Army towns, would be to minimise the shock at the very low cut-off age of 22 years.  During the period 1974-94 the cut-off age was much higher I think it was as high as 35 at one stage and 27 at another stage.  The Gleeson and Price Waterhouse reports referred to a new, young and vibrant Army.  No one would quibble with the recruitment of younger personnel but I do not think anyone expected the cut-off age to be as low as 22 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> This cut-off age will inhibit many worthwhile people from applying for recruitment to the Defence Forces.  Most young people now do their leaving certificate while many others do repeat leaving certificate and PLC courses or spend two to three years at a regional college.  Many young people keen to enter the Army will be precluded from recruitment by this ridiculously low cut-off age.  Heretofore people who served for three years in An Slua Muirí or the FCA had those years added on in determining eligibility for recruitment.  However, this will not apply in this recruitment drive.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for finally initiating this recruitment drive but I ask him to raise the cut-off age.  The valuable experience gained through membership of An Slua Muirí and the FCA would add to a young person's ability to perform as a member of the Defence Forces.  The cut-off age of 22 is ridiculous and I ask the Minister to raise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy O'Rourke in seeking to have the cut-off age for recruitment to the Defence Forces raised. While we were happy to hear this announcement it had been promised at least seven times over the past year and a half this recruitment drive will be clearly inhibited by the qualifying criteria.  The age profile in the Army has caused problems and we do not need further restrictions.  Rather there should be consistent annual recruitment open to the best possible personnel in terms of their interests and how they see their future in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>It will also be necessary to review the five year contract in the context of this recruitment drive so that those who are eligible and want to be involved can have a longer term future in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to review his decision and, more importantly, to ensure that the basis for consistent recruitment to the Permanent Defence Forces is established once and for all because long periods without recruitment exacerbates the age profile difficulty.  We would be pleased if the Minister reconsidered this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Rourke and Smith for providing me with this opportunity to address the House on the question of recruitment to the Permanent Defence Forces.  I am also happy to set the record straight on a number of the issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most serious problems facing the Defence Forces, which was identified by the Efficiency Audit Group and its consultants Price Waterhouse, is the unsatisfactory age profile of personnel.  Left unaddressed, this problem would have compounded until the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Forces was <Col N="242" /> seriously compromised.  The recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group on a voluntary early retirement scheme to allow older and less fit personnel leave on favourable severance terms, combined with an intake of 1,000 recruits over the three year life of the first phase implementation plan, is designed to redress this problem.</P>
    <P>As the House may be aware, advertisements seeking applicants for positions in the Permanent Defence Forces appeared in the newspapers last week and the selection process has begun.  It is intended to take in 200 recruits before the end of this year and it is my intention that further recruitment will take place again next year.  Over the period of the implementation plan, up to 1,000 young people will be provided with an opportunity to acquire a skill, self-discipline and character development in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It is true that the age limits under which new recruits are inducted into the Defence Forces have been reduced in the case of the present competition from 27 years to 22 years.  This follows specifically on the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group and its consultants.  The purpose of this modification is to specifically address the age profile problem.  If we are trying to reduce the average age of the Defence Forces, it makes sense to recruit people at a younger age. The military authorities fully support this policy.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that it is more sensible for those who will not make a long-term career in the Defence Forces to return to the jobs market at a young age, when they are relatively more employable and having acquired job experience and skills in the Defence Forces.  As I previously said in the House, soldiering is essentially a young person's profession.  If we are to maintain the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces, it is essential that we continue to introduce new and young blood into the organisation.</P>
    <P>On the question of service with the FCA and An Slua Muirí, the policy of extending the PDF enlistment age limits in the past for service with the Reserve Forces was designed to address the circumstances of the time when securing adequate recruitment to the PDF could prove difficult. This is no longer the case.  It is not true that extra points were awarded to candidates who had service with the Reserve.  However, there is no doubt the military authorities, in selecting recruits for the Permanent Defence Forces, have shown an understandable preference for those who have demonstrated their commitment to military life by their membership, as teenagers, of the FCA and An Slua Muirí.  Thus, while there is no formal system of advantage for membership of the Reserve, the type of person who gives voluntary service with the Reserve is often the type of person the Permanent Defence Forces want to recruit.  In the last group of recruits inducted in 1994 two thirds had previous service with the FCA and An Slua Muirí.  I expect this pattern will be reflected in this year's intake.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> I am sure Deputy O'Rourke will agree that recruitment to the Defence Forces as quickly as possible of young, committed and enthusiastic recruits is an essential ingredient for the far-reaching programme of restructuring and reform <Col N="244" /> this Government has undertaken in respect of the Defence Forces.</P>

    <P>If the Deputy wishes I can provide, in due course, a breakdown of those figures by Garda division.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are fully committed to providing all necessary specialist resources to deal with this most heinous form of crime.  The main effort is centred on the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit &mdash; formerly known as the woman and child unit.  The unit is staffed by Garda personnel who are specially trained and experienced in dealing with this form of crime.  The functions of the unit include general oversight of the investigation of all violent and sexual offences committed against women and children.  It works in close contact with the Garda community relations section and liaises with all organisations, statutory and voluntary, which are involved in cases of violent or sexual crime against women and children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> The main specific aims of the unit are to oversee the investigation of all cases of domestic violence, sexual abuse involving children, rape and sexual assault; to assist in the investigation of particularly serious or complex cases; to monitor the investigative relationship between the Garda Síochána and bodies such as child abuse and sexual assault clinics; to promote maximum co-operation between statutory and voluntary agencies working in these areas, and, finally, through training programmes, to develop necessary specialist investigative skills in the Force.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, since 1995, there are in place strict guidelines between the health boards and the Garda concerning the reporting of suspected sexual abuse.  In this regard, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Health, recently provided the Deputy with information regarding the number of suspected cases of child sex abuse which were reported by health boards to the Garda.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 43 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>Circuit Court No. 24, which was formerly Circuit Court No. 14, situated at Chancery Place, Dublin 7, is used at present for jury call-over and will continue to be used for this purpose for the present.</P>
      <P>I accept that other than as a necessary temporary arrangement, this court is not considered suitable as a jury call-over court and I wish to confirm that it is my intention that the new courtroom in the Public Records Building will be used for jury call-over.  However, with the recent appointment of additional judges it has been necessary, in the short-term, to utilise the court facilities available in the Public Records Building for purposes other than that originally envisaged. The large lobby area of the courtroom in the building has been converted, on a temporary basis, into an additional courtroom for use as a Circuit Family Law Court.  The main courtroom in the Public Records Office has been in use since 16 September 1996 for the hearing of Circuit Court civil business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of these necessary interim arrangements, it is not possible to utilise the court for jury call-over at this time.  The situation will be <Col N="36" /> reviewed when additional courtroom facilities, which are being planned, become operational in the new year.  Detention facilities are planned for the Public Records Building so that the option to utilise the courtroom as a jury call-over in the future will be facilitated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The legislation in relation to corners is mainly contained in the Coroners Act, 1962, and various statutory orders.  There are 49 coroners in the State &mdash; some counties being sub-divided into two or more coroner's districts.  There are roughly 1,200 inquests conducted each year by coroners.</P>
      <P>A coroner is a statutory officer exercising quasi-judicial functions, in relation to which he/she is independent.  A coroner is responsible for deciding if a <i>post mortem</i> examination and/or inquest is required in any particular case and for the conduct of an inquest if one is deemed necessary. To be considered for appointment as a coroner the applicant must be (a) a practising barrister or solicitor of at least five years standing or (b) a registered medical practitioner for at least five years.  Coroners are required to retire on reaching 70 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, legislative responsibility for the Coroners Act devolves on the Minister for Justice whereas responsibilities of other Departments and agencies are as prescribed by law, but some salient features are as follows.  Coroners are appointed by the relevant local authority following selection by the Local Appointments Commission.  Coroners are paid by the local authority such salary as is fixed by the <Col N="37" /> local authority with the approval of the Minister for Justice.  The Act provides that the Minister for Justice shall not give any approval as aforesaid save after consultation with the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>During 1995, I met with the coroners who made a number of points relating to their terms of employment, etc.  However, I was able to fund the first ever seminar for coroners held in December 1995.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a need to take an overall look at the coroner service and the demands placed on it by a rapidly changing society and I have already agreed in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, that a working group should be set up which will have the task of examining a range of issues relating to the coroner service.  The group will consist of representatives of the Departments of Finance, Justice, Environment and Health.  The precise terms of reference for this working group have yet to be finalised.  I anticipate, however that the review will focus not only on the issues which are of concern to the Deputy but it will also consider the relevant legislative environment underlying the coroner service as framed in the 1962 Act, and under which coroners have been operating up to now.  It should deal with, for example, such issues as which line Department should have responsibility.  At present, the Departments of Justice, Environment, Health, all share a responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> The total number of serving gardaí (all ranks) on the dates referred to by the Deputy are as follows: 1 January 1994 &mdash; 10,892; 1 January 1995 &mdash; 10,837; 1 January 1996 &mdash; 10,825 and 11 October 1996 &mdash; 10,798.  There are at present 418 trainee gardaí in phases 1, 2 and 3 of the current training programme for gardaí.  These trainee gardaí are not included in the above figures.</P>
    <P>The current Garda recruitment competition covers the period 1995 to 1997, inclusive, and provides for the recruitment of a total of 1,050 new gardaí over that period.  One of the main elements of the anti-crime measures which I announced in July of this year was the recruitment of a further additional 400 gardaí to the force over the period July 1996 to October 1997. When both campaigns have been completed, towards the end of 1997, the total additional recruitment over the 1995-97 period will have been 1,450.  The anti-crime package approved in July also provided for the recruitment of an additional 200 civilians to facilitate the release of an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.</P>
    <P>I am confident that all these measures will maintain the strength of An Garda Síochána at a level sufficient to meet the changing needs of our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to point out that I do not have a direct function in the matters referred to by the Deputies.  The Coroners Act, 1962, provides that coroners are appointed and paid by local authorities and Deputy O'Hanlon will understand that my Department does not, accordingly, have the detailed information requested by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards problems in holding <i>post mortems,</i> two particular instances were brought to my attention; both occurred in the coroner district of County Louth.  The first referred to difficulties which arose at the end of July in relation to the availability of pathology services, for which, of course, I am not responsible.  However, as indicated <Col N="39" /> in my reply to Questions Nos. 45 and 72 on today's Order Paper, it is proposed to involve representatives from the Department of Health in the study group examining the future responsibilities of coroners and the provision of services to coroners will arise in this context.</P>
    <P>The second instance referred to difficulties which arose during last August in relation to the resignations of the Louth coroner and the deputy coroner on 7 and 28 August, respectively.  While, as I have already pointed out, the appointment and replacement of coroners is a matter for the local authority, my Department provided as much assistance as possible in resolving the difficulty caused by the vacancies at that time.  I understand that the temporary coroner, who was appointed by Louth County Council on 29 August 1996, is not experiencing any difficulties in the holding of <i>post mortems.</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities report that the Garda Criminal Records Office already maintains indexed records of all persons convicted of criminal offences, including persons convicted of sexual offences.  While these records are confidential and cannot normally be disclosed there is an important exception.  The Garda Síochána may disclose the information to employers &mdash; including those in children's residential centres &mdash; on the criminal convictions, if any, recorded in respect of applicants for posts which involve substantial access to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the basic principle behind the idea of a paedophile register (or a sex offender register) is a requirement that persons convicted of certain offences should be required under penalty of law, following completion of their sentence, to notify the police of any change of address &mdash; this legal obligation to apply for the rest of life.  On a personal level, I have no difficulty <Col N="40" /> with that concept, in the interests, especially, of children, but there are complex issues, including constitutional ones, involved.  I have the matter under active review in my Department at present and I will make a further statement on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>At present, there is already a range of specialist units operating within the Garda Síochána which targets organised crime.  These include the Criminal Assets Bureau, the National Drugs Unit, the Central Detective Unit, the Investigation Unit and Bureau of Fraud Investigations.  I am satisfied, from my contacts with the Garda Commissioner, that the activities of these units are sufficiently co-ordinated and focused to deal adequately with organised crime and that the existing structures and their management are best suited to meet the challenge posed by organised crime.  The commissioner has also informed me that there is no practical policing justification for a new and separate organised crime unit and he keeps all of the above units under review.</P>

      <P>The prison system has no &ldquo;hold&rdquo; on an offender once the offender has served his or her sentence and no authority at that stage to direct an offender's behaviour in any way.  Despite this, however, I am aware that a proportion of offenders would welcome some guidance and assistance to enable them to integrate into society.  My Department's policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; acknowledged that one of the greatest difficulties facing offenders, and especially those who have served long prison sentences, is that of coping in the community when released from custody.  The question, for example, of compulsory supervision post-expiry of sentence may well present legal and, indeed, constitutional problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should point out to the Deputy that the probation and welfare service of my Department is already involved in the supervision of offenders on release from custody but only where <Col N="41" /> those releases occur prior to the end of the sentence. In this regard I got Government approval, as part of the major crime package I announced last July, for the appointment of ten additional staff for the probation and welfare service to supervise offenders on early release.  There are a number of services within the prison system where offenders can avail of counselling and training with a view to their rehabilitation and reintegration in society: the psychology service, the probation and welfare service, the chaplaincy service and the education and work and training service. All these services have a role to play in preparing offenders for their eventual release and very often for putting in train arrangements in the community to help them to reintegrate.  A number of offenders, upon release, go to hostels where assistance is provided to help these people to re-integrate into society.</P>
    <P>I am not currently proposing to establish a separate statutory body over and above the many statutory agencies that exist to assist people in society in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 77, 118 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>A new drug treatment facility has been in operation for some months now at the prison's health care unit.  This unit provides for the continuance of methadone maintenance for those prisoners who are committed to prison while undergoing a recognised programme in the community.  I fully accept that close co-operation with the relevant health board or authority will be essential in all such cases and the fact that the staffing of the unit includes both medical and psychiatric staff who are also engaged in this type of work with the Eastern Health Board is particularly propitious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seizures of illegal drugs in Mountjoy Prison tend to indicate that heroin and cannabis are the most commonly used substances.  For obvious <Col N="43" /> reasons it is not possible to quantify the total daily volume of drugs illegally consumed except to say that I am aware that the improved security and related measures which I have introduced over the last two years have been successful in significantly curbing the smuggling in and use of illegal substances within the prisons.</P>
    <P>The 14 day programme which was introduced by the medical officers at Mountjoy Prison earlier this year must be seen in its proper context.  This is a detoxification programme aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone.  Detoxification programmes generally are of a limited duration and I believe that the practice in Mountjoy is comparable to programmes available elsewhere in the community.  The prescription of any controlled drug is a matter in every case for a doctor and particularly so in prison environment where the dangers of prisoners using illegal substances in conjunction with prescribed medication cannot be overstated.</P>
    <P>The drug free unit which has been in operation at the training unit since last June has accommodation for 96 prisoners.  To date occupancy has been running at approximately 80 per cent.  This is regarded as satisfactory in the light of the regime in force at the unit, the necessarily strict selection process and the overall need to ensure that the integrity of what is, in essence, a pilot programme is maintained.  Indications to date are very encouraging.  Plans are under way to extend the concept to other institutions and I hope to announce progress in this respect over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 59, 80 and 245 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain that in almost every comparable jurisdiction, a certain proportion of offenders are accommodated in open institutions similar to Shelton Abbey.</P>
      <P>While there is a lesser emphasis on security in Shelton Abbey than in the closed institutions, there are very good reasons for this.  An element of trust is crucial to the successful operation of even the most secure prison in the State.  In the case of offenders who are serving longer sentences in closed prisons, it is long-standing policy to build on this trust on a gradual basis leading eventually, in suitable cases, to a transfer to a low security environment, such as Shelton Abbey. Several other categories of offender for whom a closed prison environment is neither desirable nor necessary also benefit from the availability of such institutions.</P>
      <P>There are a number of safeguards in place to prevent incidents such as the absconding of offenders from Shelton Abbey and the other open centres.  All inmates are monitored on a daily basis and some are, from time to time, for various reasons including security related ones, returned to closed prisons.  The risk of absconding is, of course, a major consideration in the selection of offenders for open centres.  Other factors include the nature of the offence, the length of sentence left to serve and the individual offender's compatibility with the regime.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above, it is regrettably the case that some offenders do, occasionally, abscond from open centres.  This, however, must be kept in context.  The vast majority of offenders who transfer to Shelton Abbey complete their sentences without incident and this is testament to the overall integrity of the regime there and to the prisoner selection process.  Any practical suggestions to ensure better security are always thoroughly examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to publish the names, offences and other details in respect of every person granted temporary release.  Such a scheme would not serve any worthwhile purpose and in any event it would be impossible to administer effectively.</P>
      <P>Concern for the victims of crime is reflected in the various measures implemented in the courts in recent years.  These include the video link system and the provision of facilities for the use of victims at courthouses.  Regarding the question of temporary release, I assure the Deputies that in making individual decisions, particularly in cases involving violence or other serious offences, due consideration is given to the situation of the victims.</P>
      <P>In many such cases there would, in any event, be no question of any form of early release.  The vast majority of prisoners have determinate sentences, even offenders who are in custody for very violent offences and, of course, I have no option but to release them once they have completed their sentence.  In cases where the release of a serious offender on expiry of sentence or for any other reason is assessed as likely to pose potential difficulties for a victim, efforts are made to contact the victim through the Garda.  It is not possible, however, to adhere to this procedure in the case of every temporary release given the sheer volume of numbers involved.  The sentences of serious risk offenders are very carefully managed and the approach to these cases is kept under scrutiny and review in my Department in consultation with prison Governors and the Garda.</P>

      <P>I have also noted the findings of the Law Reform Commission in its report on sentencing which states that the commission is absolutely satisfied that even the most rudimentary cost benefit analysis would indicate that the probation service should be a primary target for additional resources in the area of sentencing.</P>

      <P>Section 14 of the Children Act, 1908, provides that where a parent sends his or her child out to beg, the parent will, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding £25.  Alternatively, or in default of payment of such fine, or in addition to <Col N="50" /> the fine, the parent may be liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months.</P>
      <P>In addition, section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act, 1847, provides that a parent who causes, procures or encourages his or her child to beg, is liable to be imprisoned for a period not exceeding one month.</P>
      <P>In practice, however, the Garda have experienced considerable difficulty in enforcing this legislation, particularly because of the need to prove that the parent sent the child out to beg.</P>
      <P>Following an examination of the legislation at present in operation, I decided to update and strengthen the law in this regard.  The Children Bill, which will replace the Children Act, 1908, with a comprehensive modern statute dealing with all aspects of juvenile justice, will give greater protection to children from being sent out to beg by their parents.</P>
      <P>The provision in section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act, 1847, which relates to procuring children to beg will be repealed in line with a recommendation from the Law Reform Commission in their report on vagrancy and related offences.</P>

      <P>I take it that what lies behind the Deputy's question is the possibility of jurors being intimidated by the accused during the course of a trial or by a convicted person after the trial in the light of the fact that in a criminal trial the defence is provided with the names and addresses of the panel of jurors.</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the Juries Act, 1976 provides that every person shall be entitled to reasonable facilities to inspect a panel of jurors free of charge and a party to any proceedings, civil or criminal, to be tried with a jury shall be entitled to a copy free of charge on application to the county registrar.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is the practice of the court offices to issue the names, addresses and occupations of the jury panel to the accused's solicitor on request.  The right to challenge a juror is one of the safeguards which experience has shown to be necessary to prevent trial by a packed jury or trial by a jury that is not unbiased or not independent.</P>
      <P>Assaulting or threatening any person including a juror in court during or going to or coming from proceedings or after the completion of a trial is contempt of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> The Deputy's question raises the issues of the right of challenge to a juror by the prosecution and the defence and the need to ensure that the law fully protects the position of jurors.

      <P>The opening hours of the several offices of the Supreme and High Courts, including the Probate and Central Office in the Four Courts, are governed by Order 118, Rule 4 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1986 (S.I.

Section 68 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, provides that the power of making, annulling or altering rules of court for the High and Supreme Courts shall be exercisable by the Superior Courts Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  It is not, therefore, open to me to make any amendments to Order 118 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.</P>

      <P>The arrangements which are currently in place in the prisons provide for the conduct of visits generally, and allow only minimal physical contact between visitors and prisoners.  The Deputy will, however, appreciate, that the category of prisoners held throughout the system varies greatly in several respects.  A certain proportion of prisoners are, of course, not convicted.  Among the sentenced population, there is a wide variation in terms of <Col N="53" /> sentence length, criminal background, drug history, etc.  To impose closed visits prohibiting all physical contact in every case would cause undue hardship, particularly in the case of prisoners with young families.  In addition, such arrangements would be inappropriate and impractical in the open prisons.</P>
      <P>I can, however, assure the Deputy that in all cases where a serious identifiable security risk exists or the passing of contraband such as illegal drugs is suspected, visits are conducted under the strictest conditions, without any physical contact between visitors and prisoners.  We also have in all closed institutions supervision of visiting time both by staff and in some instances cameras which are being used effectively to reduce passing of drugs etc.</P>

    <P>The policy of An Garda Síochána is to grant voluntary retirement to any qualified member requesting same.  Under the terms of Article 4 of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1925, members are entitled to retire on reaching 50 years of age provided they have completed 30 years of &ldquo;Approved Service&rdquo; or 25 years of &ldquo;Approved Service&rdquo; in the case of those who opted for the 25 years condition.</P>
    <P>The number of voluntary retirements in 1994 and 1995 were higher than average, which is believed to have been prompted by the implementation of an agreement reached at the Garda Conciliation Council in 1994 which provided for the pensionability of certain unsocial hours allowances. It is expected that voluntary retirements will level out with effect from this year, as indicated by the lower figure for 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary concern on staff disciplinary matters in the prison service in recent times has been the establishment of a code of discipline for the prison service.  Such a code has now been established with the introduction of the Prisons (Disciplinary Code for Officers) Rules, 1996, with effect from 1 October 1996 (S.I. No. 289 of 1996 refers).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this code is to establish a formal structure for dealing with disciplinary matters <Col N="59" /> which recognises the principles of natural justice established in recent case law, for example, the entitlement of an officer accused of a disciplinary offence to have an oral hearing and to have the opportunity to cross-examine the person making allegations against him or her and any relevant witness.  The Governor of each institution is responsible for the administration of the disciplinary system prescribed by the code up to the point of conclusion of an oral hearing which should establish fault or otherwise, at which stage the Governor makes the appropriate recommendation to the Minister, including a recommendation as to the appropriate penalty.  I have no plans to change this situation.</P>
    <P>The prison service code of discipine does not alter the role of the Minister as the person who must make all decisions in disciplinary cases under the Prison Rules of 1947 or as the &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956.  The powers of the Minister under the 1947 Rules or the 1956 Act do not provide for the delegation of the decision-making function.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for sufficient beds in the Central Mental Hospital to accommodate prisoners requiring treatment and to eliminate the unsatisfactory situation of these mentally ill prisoners being placed on a waiting list for such beds.  To this end, officials of my Department sat on a working group on the development of services for the care of the mentally disturbed at the Central Mental Hospital.  This group was under the auspices of the Department of Health and also comprised officials of that Department and of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The working group reported to the Minister for Health in June 1995.  A key finding of the group was that additional places could be made available in the Central Mental Hospital if persons who have been assessed as fit for discharge by the clinical director were transferred to mainstream psychiatric services.  The Minister for Health accepted the recommendations of the report and asked the assistant inspector of mental hospitals to facilitate the transfer of these persons to local mental health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I have taken a personal interest in this question and I have kept in touch with the Minister for Health in this respect.  Progress has been slow in effecting transfers of suitable <Col N="60" /> patients from the Central Mental Hospital to local psychiatric hospitals but, as I understand it, dialogue continues between the Department of Health and the health boards in this regard.</P>

These facilities provide for the placement of each offender, including those convicted of serious offences or sentenced to long-term sentences, in the most appropriate institution within the system having regard to a number of considerations including security and rehabilitative services.  The plans already announced for additional prison places will, when implemented, enhance the options available for the placement of offenders within the system as well as allowing for a review of the existing arrangements for the accommodation of the various classes and categories of prisoners within the institutions.</P>

      <P>The Special European Council in Dublin on 5 October instructed the General Affairs Council, at its next meeting at the end of October, to consider a mandate for the position of a European Union envoy to the Middle East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> The idea of appointing an EU envoy to the Middle East reflects a strong willingness on the Union's part to become more actively involved in efforts to assist in the revitalisation of the Middle East peace process on the basis of its major contribution to the process so far and its already wide engagement with the region.  Since the General Affairs Council has been asked to establish a mandate for the position of envoy, it will be necessary to await the outcome of the deliberation of the council before the mandate of an EU envoy can be specified.  The appointment of the EU envoy will be a matter for the Council of Ministers on behalf of the Union as a whole, rather than for the Government of Ireland in its capacity as Presidency.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my written reply to the Deputy on 25 September 1996, the EU special envoy, Mr. Aldo Ajello, is carrying out a mission to capitals in the Great Lakes regions to assist directly in the regional efforts to commence a process of negotiations between the various parties in Burundi.  This follows the declaration made by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union on 19 August in support of the regional leaders, the Organisation of African Unity and the former President of Tanzania, Mr. Julius Nyerere, in their efforts to assist Burundi in overcoming the grave crisis which it is facing.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ajello departed for the Great Lakes region on 2 October and has met with the leading figures on all sides to the conflict in Burundi, with regional leaders and with former President Nyerere.  He also attended the third summit of East African leaders on Burundi which took place in Arusha, Tanzania, on 12 October, and is following this up with further contacts in the region.  In his contacts, Mr. Ajello is reiterating the position taken by the European Union in its declaration of 19 August, with particular reference to the Union's view that it is essential for a dialogue to be organised without delay, bringing together all of Burundi's political forces without exception, including representatives of civil society, in order to negotiate a democratic, institutional consensus ensuring security for all.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency, along with its EU partners, will continue to work in close liaison with special envoy Ajello in supporting the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and Mr. Nyerere in their efforts to bring about a negotiated and peaceful resolution of the conflict.</P>

      <P>With regard to the particular point raised by Deputy Burke, I understand from the European Commission that consideration is being given to the possibility of making administrative changes in relation to the EU Somalia Unit, which is at present under the responsibility of the EU special envoy, Mr. Sigurd Illing.  The changes being considered by the Commission could involve the EU Somalia Unit being made the responsibility of the EU Commission's Kenyan delegation which is also based in Nairobi.  The Commission believes that if this were done there would be no effect on the operations of the EU Somalia Unit which were outlined in the recently approved second rehabilitation programme for Somalia, and which involves funding of $60 million over the next two years.</P>
      <P>The Government is consulting with partners and the Commission with a view to ensuring that the administrative and practical arrangements continue to be adequate to support the programme of assistance to Somalia.</P>

      <P>The declaration adopted by the General Affairs Council on 1-2 October 1996 set out the position of the Union at this critical juncture in the peace process.  It called on both sides to exercise restraint and specified those areas where it believes that progress is crucial to the peace process. The declaration also makes clear that the Union's close relations with states in the region, as embodied in the Euro-Mediterranean Association agreements, are based on a common commitment to the peace process.  In that context, the Union called on Israel to give clear practical demonstration of its confirmed intention to implement fully the agreements already reached with the PLO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterated that position, and stressed the importance that the Union attaches to the revitalisation of the peace process, during my recent visit to the region on 6 October.  It is my sincere <Col N="69" /> hope that the talks currently under way between Israel and the Palestinians will make progress and thus help restore the momentum to the peace process on the basis of the principles of Madrid and the terms of the Declaration of Principles. The Union has close relations with Israel based on economic, historical, geographical and cultural ties.  Israel has consistently indicated that it appreciates the efforts of the EU to support the peace process, particularly in its role as the largest donor of aid of the Palestinian people.  As part of these ongoing, constructive and balanced efforts, the Union will continue to maintain its close relations with Israel with the aim of supporting the Middle East peace process.</P>

      <P>In December 1995, the European Council agreed conclusions based on a Commission communication on a long-term policy for EU-China relations.  Among the Council's goals for the EU's strategy towards China are to support sustainable development, the smooth and gradual integration of China into the world economy, the fight against poverty, the promotion of democracy, structures based on the rule of law and the respect for human rights based on the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.  These objectives and basic principles constitute essential elements in relations between the EU and China.</P>
      <P>The Government's concern at the human rights situation in China has been raised at every appropriate opportunity with the Chinese authorities. Most recently, on 23 September 1996, I led the EU Ministerial Troika at a meeting in New York with the Chinese Vice-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Qian Qichen.  I availed of this opportunity to pursue the question of human rights in the People's Republic China, which I have raised consistently in previous meetings with the Vice-Premier.  One of the matters which I addressed was the question of the continuation of the EU Troika/China human rights dialogue at expert level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dialogue was initiated in 1995 in order to discuss the whole spectrum of human rights issues in China.  The EU's concerns have related in particular, <i>inter alia,</i> to the excessive use of capital punishment, the treatment of political dissidents, the conditions in orphanages and the situation in Tibet.  The EU has urged China to implement legislation and other positive measures in the human rights field, particularly the early <Col N="70" /> accession to the international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights.  I am hopeful that there will be a positive response from China shortly on the continuation of this dialogue.</P>
    <P>At the European Council, which was held in Florence earlier this year, acknowledgment was given to the efforts and progress made by China in restructuring its economy.  In this context, Ireland and its EU partners support China's membership of the WTO.  WTO membership will consolidate China's economic reform process, induce further reforms and integrate China into the world economy.  However, the EU is looking for, and will continue to actively seek, a more committed respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms from the Chinese authorities.</P>

The secretariat of ENIASA presented the Minister of State with a report which it had prepared on South Africa, Ireland and the European Union with special reference to the proposed EU-South Africa trade and co-operation agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, outlined the current position in relation to the negotiation of an EU-South Africa trade and co-operation agreement.  The European Union presented its negotiating mandate to the South African authorities on 29 March.  A meeting took place between Commission and South African negotiators in Brussels on 21/22 June at which the non-trade aspects of the agreement were discussed. The South African authorities continue to study the trade aspects of the mandate, and until their reaction is forthcoming, negotiations in this field cannot start.  We have encouraged the South African authorities to finalise their process of internal reflection as soon as possible so that negotiations on an agreement can resume.</P>

      <P>In response to a similar question in January, 1996 I indicated that the localised nature of &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo;, making passports available more quickly and conveniently through the post office network, and the upgrading of the Cork passport office to a full issuing office had greatly increased the reliability and efficiency of the passport service and that I was, therefore, confident that the passport offices in Cork and Dublin would be able to ensure a continued high quality of service to the public for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; has become even more widely available in the course of this year, as the number of post offices offering the service increased to over 600, and over 55 per cent of applicants are now using it.  Applicants residing in Counties Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Sligo do not have to travel any further than their local Garda station and one of the 96 post offices in those counties offering the service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the passport offices in Cork and Dublin are providing a high quality of service to the public and that, in these circumstances, the opening of further regional passport offices is not warranted.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> In the last six-month period, the UN repaid arrears totalling some IR£3,034,334.  However, since our commitment to UN peacekeeping operations, and therefore our costs, are ongoing, there has been no actual reduction in the total amount of arrears owing.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of serious concern that these substantial arrears are still outstanding.  On 26 September, I raised these concerns with the Secretary-General of the UN, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at our meeting in New York during UNGA ministerial week.  I reiterated our view that every effort should be made by the UN secretariat to reduce the amount of arrears owing to troop-contributing countries such as Ireland, particularly with regard to outstanding claims for death and disability, contingent-owned equipment and letters of assist.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that the problem of substantial arrears owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries is a direct result of the unprecedented financial crisis which the UN is currently experiencing and not due to any unwillingness on the part of the UN secretariat to clear them.  This crisis has been caused by the failure of many member states, and in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time.  This has led to a situation in which the Secretary General has been forced to delay normal reimbursements to troop contributors in order to deal with the serious cash flow problem facing the UN system.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, is firm in the demand that all member states of the UN must honour promptly and in full their financial obligations to the organisation under the UN Charter.</P>
    <P>Whilst appreciating the difficulties caused by the financial crisis within the UN, Ireland and our EU partners are nevertheless resolved to maintain pressure on the UN to honour its obligation to make an early and full settlement of arrears owing.  We will continue to do so at every opportunity. We hope that efforts to resolve the financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries.</P>

      <P>The Government remains seriously concerned over the number of deaths which have resulted from the ongoing struggle between Kurdish guerillas and the Turkish security forces. This conflict, which has lasted 12 years, has resulted in the deaths of 22,500 people, including Kurdish rebels, members of the security forces and civilians.  We hope that intensive efforts could be made, on both sides, to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.</P>
      <P>While recognising the difficulties posed for the Turkish authorities by a sustained campaign of guerilla violence, we firmly believe that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the law and with full respect for human rights.  The Government believes, moreover, that the situation in the Kurdish provinces should not be approached purely as a security problem and has called for a political settlement which, while respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Turkish state, would allow for appropriate expression of the Kurdish cultural identity.  In common with our partners in the European Union, we have made it clear that observance of a state of law underlies the development of our relations with Turkey.</P>

      <P>Since April 1996, there has been a well-publicised Government campaign against criminality and corruption throughout China.  This campaign, known as the &ldquo;strike-hard&rdquo; campaign has resulted in the arrest and conviction of a large number of persons engaged in a wide range of criminal activities.  This campaign continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as is customary on the occasion of large-scale Government and Communist Party gatherings, security was noticeably increased to coincide with the sixth plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party which took place in Beijing from 7 to 10 October 1996.  During the period of the plenum, <Col N="74" /> Chinese dissident circles in Hong Kong reported that two prominent members of the pro-democracy movement had been arrested.</P>
    <P>Through the Embassy of Ireland at Beijing, in consultation with the embassies of other EU member states, we have been seeking to ascertain the authenticity of these reports.  If it emerges that either or both persons have been arrested, charged or sentenced for activities connected with their campaign for wider democratic freedoms in China, we will consider, as a matter of urgency, how best to make clear to the Chinese Government the unacceptability of its repression of those who peacefully advocate freedom of expression and other universally accepted democratic principles, and our concern at the cases in question.</P>

      <P>Both the Government and our EU partners continue to have serious concerns about the general human rights situation, including that in Ogoniland, and the pace and manner of the transition to democratic rule in Nigeria.  Foreign Ministers of the European Union discussed these issues at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 15-16 July.  On that occasion we noted that there has been a number of potentially positive developments including the interim response of the Nigerian Government to the recommendations of the fact finding mission of the UN Secretary-General, the resumption of dialogue with the Commonwealth, the release of a number of political prisioners and the establishment of a commission on human rights.  At the same time, however, we continued to have serious concerns and called on the Nigerian Government to expedite the process of transition to democracy and to ensure full respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recalling the measures the Union had already taken in regard to Nigeria, particularly the common positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995 &mdash; the latter having been renewed for a further six months on 3 June 1996 &mdash; the Council stated its intention to continue its identification and examination of further measures, and to do so in consultation with other interested countries and bodies.  The Council also undertook to keep developments in the country under close review, especially the examination of the cases of detainees and the issue of further releases of political prisoners.  The Irish Presidency is actively engaged with EU partners and other interested parties in this ongoing process of consultation and close review which includes within its remit the human rights situation in Ogoniland and possible further Ogoni trials.  On behalf of the EU, the <Col N="75" /> Presidency made a further demarche to the Nigerian authorities in Abuja on 24 September about human rights and the pace and manner of the transition to democracy.</P>

      <P>The 1994 Finance Act provided for this very generous stamp duty relief, which costs the Exchequer approximately £4 million annually, in respect of transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers.  The relief involves a two thirds reduction in the stamp duty that would otherwise be payable and applies in respect of transfers occuring between 7 January 1994 and 31 December 1996.  There are a number of conditions attaching to the relief in order to target the relief at young trained farmers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that where the transferee has completed at least one year of the prescribed course on the date of transfer, stamp duty must be paid in full at the time of transfer. However, the amount of stamp duty equal to the relief will be refunded where, within three years of the date of transfer, the transferee furnishes evidence to the Revenue Commissioners within six months of the completion of the course, that he/she has completed the Teagasc certificate in farming &mdash; the green certificate &mdash; or equivalent and that the other conditions attaching to the relief were satisfied at the date of transfer.</P>
      <P>This stamp duty relief has greatly improved the climate for land transfer and complements the EU farmers retirement scheme in facilitating lifetime transfer to young farmers.  However, a principal rationale for the relief is that it is a temporary measure designed to encourage early transfers of lands.  At this stage it is not intended, therefore, to extend the relief beyond the end of this year.</P>

      <P>There are various incentive schemes operated by the Departments of Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment which are designed to facilitate job creation and the take-up of these jobs by the unemployed.</P>
      <P>The employer's PRSI exemption scheme exempts employers from paying PRSI for two years where they employ additional workers who have been on the live register for a minimum of 13 continuous weeks.  There is no limit to the number of employees that can be recruited but they must be taken on between 6 April 1995 and 5 April 1997.  The new employees must represent a net increase in the number of people employed. The net increase must be maintained throughout the two years of the exemption.</P>
      <P>The Jobstart scheme provides for a payment of £80 per week for 52 weeks to an employer taking on someone who is at least three years on the live register.  The employer is not entitled to receive a PRSI exemption if the Jobstart allowance is being paid.  Where appropriate, an employee taken on under Jobstart can qualify for retention of child dependant allowances for a period of 13 weeks after taking up employment and is also entitled to retain a medical card for three years.  Because of the nature of these benefits, the monetary value of overall entitlements differs with the individual's circumstances.</P>
      <P>Under the back to work allowance scheme &mdash; BTWAS &mdash; persons who have been on the live register for at least one year and lone parents, are allowed to retain 75 per cent of their social welfare payment for the first year of employment, including self-employment, 50 per cent for the second year and 25 per cent for the third year. In general.  BTWAS participants also retain their secondary benefits e.g. medical cards, etc.  There is also an incentive for employers to take on BTWAS participants through the availability of a two year exemption from the employers PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>The area enterprise allowance is available to those who are long-term unemployed in a partnership area, that is, an area designated disadvantaged by the EU; there are 38 such areas nationwide. This allows the person taking up employment to retain 100 per cent of their live register entitlements for one year and works on the same principles as the back to work allowance scheme.  People on the area enterprise allowance can go on to the BTWAS after AEA time period has elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> The current family income support system is designed to encourage married people with children to re-enter employment by providing cash support to those whose potential income levels are such that as a result of taking up employment, they are only marginally better off than if they were claiming social welfare benefits.  Entitlement to FIS is calculated on the basis of of 60 per cent of the difference between gross income and a prescribed income limit set according to the number of children.</P>
    <P>Current PRSI ceilings and exemptions are as follows: employee's PRSI ceiling, £22,300 per annum and employer's PRSI ceiling, £26,800 per annum.  With regard to PRSI allowance for employees, a weekly, non-cumulative allowance of £80 per week applies to the employee social insurance contribution in classes A, E and H.  The allowances for people in classes B, C, D and S is £20 per week.  This allowance does not apply to the health contribution or to the employment and training levy.  The health contribution, 1.25 per cent and the employment and training levy, 1 per cent, are not applicable to earnings under £188 per week.  However, when this threshold is exceeded, all earnings become liable to both.</P>
    <P>Income tax exemption limits are: single person, £3,900 per annum; and married couple, £7,800 per annum plus £450 for each of the first two children and £650 for the third and each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>What is the cost to an employer of an employee who is earning £100 per week, taking into account any schemes and exemptions applicable to a person coming off the live register?  The employer's cost of taking on an individual who earns £100 per week amounts to their liability for employer PRSI plus the gross wage payable; thus, any incentive aimed at the employer would seek to reduce or eliminate the PRSI liability for some period and/or reduce their wage costs.  Of the schemes mentioned previously, Jobstart, the back to work allowance scheme, the area enterprise allowance and the general PRSI exemption scheme for employers feature such incentives. For example, an employer who qualifies for a PRSI exemption bears only the actual labour cost, in this case £100.  In the case of the Jobstart scheme, the cost to the employer is the labour cost plus PRSI less the grant £100 + £8.50 - £80, that is, £28.50 per week.</P>
    <P>What is the current situation for an unemployed person entering employment at £100 per week?  The net income position of any individual depends on the interaction of many factors, that is, gross pay less the person's tax and PRSI liability when their particular family circumstances have been assessed and their eligibility for the various schemes mentioned.  From an income tax point of view, it should be borne in mind that any tax free allowances are cumulative and, if an individual begins work at any time during the tax year, their tax free allowance will be the same as if the person was working for a full year.  This will <Col N="79" /> only be a factor in the person's first or last year in employment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated yield to the Exchequer from capital acquisitions tax for 1996 is £77 million.  This figure comprises £44 million for mainstream inheritance tax, £8 million for gift tax, £14 million for probate tax and £11 million for discretionary trust tax.  In this connection, it should be noted that probate tax and discretionary trust tax are inheritance taxes.  It is not possible to estimate the yield to the Exchequer from capital acquisition tax for 1997 in advance of the budget.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost to the Exchequer of reducing the top rate of capital acquisions tax to 25 per cent is £11 million.  As data are not available to enable a reliable costing to be made, this figure is tentative.</P>

    <P>The Edinburgh European Council in 1992 agreed the framework for the Union's finances up to and including 1999 in the financial perspective. Accordingly, funding to the end of 1999 is settled and is likely to remain broadly at current levels.</P>
    <P>The Madrid European Council in December 1995 called on the Commission to submit a communication on the future financial framework from 1999 onwards, immediately after the intergovernmental conference concludes.  This communication will begin the process of negotiating the new financial perspective which will apply from 2000 to 2005.  The detailed negotiations between the Commission and member states are expected to commence in the latter part of next year and conclude towards the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>While the issue will not, therefore, arise directly during our Presidency, the Government <Col N="82" /> is monitoring all aspects of Ireland's position in relation to eligibility for Structural and Cohesion Funds post-1999.  The Government is also developing its negotiating strategy and is taking every opportunity to influence EU thinking on the future of structural and cohesion funding so as to enable Ireland to continue to benefit to the maximum extent from these funds, in order to maintain and build upon our achievements to date.</P>

      <P>The national debt at 30 September 1996, the latest date for which figures are available, amounted to £29,646 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy is to maintain low budget deficits in order to continue downward pressure on the debt burden and meet the fiscal criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; that is, to adhere to an annual general Government deficit of no more than 3 per cent of GDP and to reduce the general Government debt to GDP ratio towards 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace.</P>
      <P>In this context the 1996 budget allowed for an EBR of just £729 million or 2.0 per cent of GNP which equates to a general Government deficit, GGD, of just 2.5 per cent of GDP.  The latest Exchequer returns indicate that the EBR and GGD are set to emerge well below the budget target.</P>
      <P>The national debt to GNP ratio has declined from a peak of 125 per cent at end of 1987 to 89 per cent at end of 1995.  Over the same period, general Government debt as a percentage of GDP has declined from 117 per cent to 82 per cent.  It is expected that continued strong economic growth and prudent budgetary policies will see further substantial progress made in 1996 and subsequent years.</P>

Proposals have been prepared to upgrade the present unsatisfactory exterior of the building; renovate the premises currently utilised by the homeless persons unit and develop the remainder of the building to provide accommodation for medical, nursing, social work, chiropody and dietetic services. The question of funding for this project will be considered in the context of the board's health centre priority list and available capital finances.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have had inquiries made regarding this matter and I have been advised that this patient has been assessed by the consultant ophthalmologist and is on the waiting list for a cataract operation <Col N="84" /> at Cork University Hospital.  However, if this patient's general practitioner feels that her condition has deteriorated or that she needs a more urgent admission date, he should contact the hospital directly for a further assessment.</P>
      <P>In 1996 I approved an allocation of 59,400 to Cork University Hospital, under the waiting list initiative, for an additional 60 cataract procedures to be carried out.  In recent days, I have made a further allocation to the Southern Health Board in respect of the waiting list initiative and it is expected that some of these funds will be directed towards ophthalmic procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Breast cancer is responsible for about 650 deaths of women in Ireland every year and the incidence of breast cancer in Irish women is among the highest in Europe.  For these reasons I am anxious that a national breast screening programme commences as soon as possible.  A national breast screening programme is one of a series of initiatives in a national cancer strategy which has been circulated to other Government Departments for their comments.  When I have taken cognisance of these comments I intend to bring the national cancer strategy to Government in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of the national breast screening programme will commence in the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards.  A major factor affecting the success of a screening programme is the establishment of a population register, as 75 per cent of the target population must participate in the screening programme if the programme is to significantly reduce mortality. However, there are difficulties under current data protection legislation in obtaining <Col N="85" /> names and addresses from existing data sources &mdash; for example, the VHI, social welfare and GMS &mdash; of women who should be offered screening.  I am currently having the legal problems involved here examined with a view to resolving these difficulties.</P>
    <P>To coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month the Irish Cancer Society has arranged, in association with the Eastern Health Board, the staging of a play on breast cancer in a number of venues in the health board area.  The play aims to increase the public's knowledge and understanding of the importance of early detection of breast cancer and the role of self-examination and breast cancer screening.  Admission is free and the organisers encourage men and women to come along.  The performance is followed by a workshop session where a breast cancer nurse and a cancer specialist answer any queries which are raised.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to have cancer and especially breast cancer as a priority for action in the months ahead and I look forward to the commencement of the national breast screening programme as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The question of a lower retirement package for general nurses was considered as part of the discussions with the nursing unions under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>The nurses claim in relation to early retirement could not be agreed between the parties and was one of the issues referred for adjudication as provided for in the framework agreed between the Government and ICTU.  The finding by the Adjudication Board was issued to management and unions on Monday, 23 September.  In relation to the issue of early retirement the board found as follows:</P>
      <P>The Board has noted also [sic] that the Government has established a Public Service Pensions Commission, including representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with terms of reference which, in the Boards's view, would embrace examination of the voluntary early retirement issue....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, the Board recommends the implementation of a limited initiative from January 1997 to address the immediate situation of nurses (other than nurses who already enjoy enhanced superannuation terms) who find the demands of the profession are such that they are no longer able to function at the level of professional performance they themselves and management require.  Accordingly, the Board has concluded that an early retirement facility should be introduced for such nurses, aged 57 <Col N="87" /> or over with at least 35 years service subject to a number of criteria which would underpin the delivery of a consistently high quality nursing service.  The Board recommends that the overall number of retirements under the Scheme be limited to a quota of 100 per annum and that it should operate on a pilot basis pending the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>A revised set of proposals incorporating this and the other recommendations of the Adjudication Board are currently being balloted on by the nursing unions.  The unions have recommended the revised proposals for positive consideration by their members.  Their positive response is most welcome and I hope that this new package will meet with the approval of nurses throughout the country.  Subject to an early and positive outcome to the ballot it is my intention that all elements of the package proposed be implemented at an early date.</P>

      <Quest>the total funding provided by his Department for current and capital expenditure in the health services in County Galway in each of the years from 1987 to 1996.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In the first instance, funding provided by my Department in respect of non-capital &mdash; current &mdash; spending is approved in respect of an individual health board.  It is then a matter for each health board to determine the budgeted non-capital expenditure for each service programme for that particular year.  At health board level, non-capital spending is analysed by programme and by service.  However, analysis by county is not a feature of existing systems.</P>
      <P>It is not the normal practice to give capital allocations to health boards or voluntary hospitals, other than in respect of urgent fire precaution and maintenance works.  The capital commitments for each year generally arise from decisions on individual projects, many of which involve expenditure over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I am setting out in the following statement, for the Deputy's information, (i) the non-capital funding made available to the Western Health Board for the years 1987 to 1996 and (ii) the capital funding which was made available by my Department to finance expenditure on health facilities in County Galway for the years 1987 to 1995.  The expenditure figure for 1996 will not be available until the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is concerned about arrangements for the protection of children at risk who come to the attention of staff in accident and emergency departments.  The procedures to be followed by hospital staff in such circumstances are in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department in 1987.  These guidelines were amended last year by the guidelines for the <i>Notification of Suspected Cases of Child Abuse between Health Boards and Gardaí</i> in relation to the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda are to notify suspected cases of child abuse to each other and in relation to the consultations that should take <Col N="89" /> place between both agencies following a notification.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of health boards have drawn up detailed regional guidelines and procedures for the investigation and management of cases of suspected child abuse based on my Department's guidelines.  The purpose of these guidelines is to protect vulnerable children by ensuring that staff have guidance on the investigation and management of situations where children are considered to be at risk of abuse or neglect.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy will be aware that the annual cost of maintaining a child with autism or a child with special needs in residential and-or day care services varies considerably depending on the needs of the individual child.  The cost in relation to residential care is dependent on many factors, including the level of disability, whether the child is in five day or seven day care, the type of care setting required, i.e., a group home in the community or a more secure setting on a residential campus.  Costs for residential care could range between £15,000 and £40,000 per annum, depending on the individual needs of the child.</P>
      <P>As in the case of residential care, costs associated with health funded day services for children with autism or a mental handicap, such as child education and development centres, could also range from around £5,000 to £15,000 in exceptional cases where a child has a very severe level of disability.  While the health services provide support services to children with autism or a mental handicap attending special schools or classes, the costs associated with the school or class are met by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Given that many levels of disabilities and other factors, such as disturbed behaviour, which can affect these children, it is difficult to be more specific in relation to this group as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A wide range of services is provided for drug misusers, ranging from prevention and education to detoxification and rehabilitation.  This treatment is provided through either drug treatment centres or general practitioners.  Drug treatment services are provided at the following centres: Baggot Street; City Clinic, Amiens Street; the Aisling Clinic, Ballyfermot; the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street; Ballymun; Clondalkin and Kilbarrack.  Fifty six general practitioners are also involved in the provision of treatment to drug misusers.</P>
      <P>Needle exchange services are provided at the following health centres: Ballyfermot, Summerhill, North Strand, Wellmount and Inchicore. In addition, a mobile methadone treatment unit, which was launched at the beginning of September is providing services to drug misusers in the south inner city area.</P>
      <P>The board's consultant psychiatrists are contributing to the development of working Protocols and facilities for detoxification within the prison system, with a general practitioner working in this service under the direction of the board's consultants.  The board's counselling staff also visit prisons on a regular basis to maintain continuity of care for those under treatment in the community who have been sentenced to prison and also to prepare prisoners for discharge back to the community services.</P>
      <P>The Talbot Centre provides counselling and support for young people and their families.  In 1995, 105 young people were in ongoing contact with the service and 79 families, involving 340 family members, received family therapy.</P>
      <P>Rehabilitation is provided through two EHB programmes, the Saol project and the Soilse project. The projects, provide people who are stabilised on methadone with skills in numeracy and literacy and other skills necessary for returing to the workforce and to a normal lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Voluntary organisations play a key role in supporting statutory agencies in providing a range of preventive and treatment services.  During 1996, for example, the Eastern Health Board is supporting the following organisations: Inter Agency Drugs Project, Ballymun Youth Action Project, Community Awareness of Drugs, Coolmine Therapeutic Community, Merchants Quay Project, Anna Liffey Project, Rialto Community Drug Team, Mater Dei Counselling Centre, Clondalkin Addiction Support Group, Fettercairn Drug Project, Community Response, Killinarden Drugs Project, Ringsend Action Project and Fatima Development Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detoxification is provided by either in-patient or outpatient methods.  Experience to date indicates <Col N="92" /> that only about one person in four needs detoxification on an in-patient basis.  There are currently 22 in-patient specialised detoxification beds in the Dublin area &mdash; ten in Beaumont Hospital and 12, to be increased later this year to 15, in Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
    <P>The number of people waiting for detoxification in the Eastern Health Board area is as follows: Beaumont Hospital, 24 people and Cherry Orchard Hospital, 25 people.  The average waiting time in both facilities is approximately six weeks from the date of referral.  This situation will be greatly improved when Cherry Orchard is fully operational with 15 beds and when a &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; detoxification programme from Cherry Orchard, which is at present being phased in, in conjunction with the Merchants Quay Project, commences.  This will reduce the time spent in in-patient beds to two weeks, so significantly reducing waiting times and waiting lists for in-patient detoxifictaion.  The Eastern Health Board is confident that with 25 in-patient beds and with &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; detoxification on offer through Merchants Quay, there will be adequate in-patient detoxification facilities to cope with the need for these services.</P>
    <P>Despite the development of these services which have grown significantly over the years, there are still waiting lists for treatment and other deficiencies in services for drug misusers in the Eastern Health Board area.  These issues have been addressed in the first report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs, which was approved by the Government recently.  The recommendations of the report in relation to service provision are: speedy establishment of information databases by the health boards in order to establish the extent of addiction; health boards to move to eliminate drug treatment waiting lists, with the Eastern Health Board waiting list to be eliminated in 1997; particular attention to the needs of young misusers in the priority areas; priority status for community employment (CE) applications offering integrated services for recovering addicts; a series of education and prevention steps, including enhanced truancy measures and anti-drug programmes for all primary schools in priority areas; an estate improvement programme for severely run-down urban housing estates and local authorities to develop sports and recreation activities in the priority areas within the national sports strategy framework.  Additional funding of £14 million has been approved and arrangements to implement these recommendations are being put in place as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  Additional funding of £56.8 million was invested in the services in the period 1990-96 which has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential-respite places and 2,300 day care places.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons with a mental handicap awaiting services. However, I am aware that more needs to be done.  The Government is committed under both the health strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the service as resources become available.  The commitment is reflected in my decision, with my colleague Minister Noonan, to prepare a five year service development plan based on the need for additional residential-respite and day care places identified by the Irish Intellectual Disability Database.  The plan will be ready later this year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> In accordance with the Health Act, 1970, health boards are required, under the General Medical Services scheme (GMS), to provide, without charge, general practitioner services, drugs, medicines and appliances to persons with full eligibility i.e. medical card holders.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, general practitioner services are provided by doctors registered with the Medical Council under the statutory provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, while drugs and medicines are dispensed by pharmacists registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland under the provisions of the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977.</P>
      <P>General practitioners participating in the GMS scheme are required to provide all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner.  Drugs and medicines, which are considered necessary for any person receiving services under the scheme, must be examined and accredited by the National Medicines Board and covered by a product authorisation. The granting of a product authorisation ensures that the medicinal products concerned have satisfied certain minimum standards regarding their quality, safety and efficacy before they are placed on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that services provided by herbalists <Col N="94" /> and acupuncturists are not eligible for reimbursement under the GMS scheme and I have no plans to change the current arrangements under the scheme.</P>

The rest of the region, because of its proximity to Dublin, is served by Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the North-Eastern Health Board and I understand that the board has looked at the feasibility of setting up a new service for the Louth-Meath area but at present the numbers are insufficient to justify the costs involved.  It is satisfied that the needs of Louth-Meath patients are, for the most part, well met by the Cavan and Dublin based services.  However, it is aware that there is some hardship endured by a limited number of patients in north Louth who have to leave home very early to attend for dialysis in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that as far as possible the dialysis service is available to patients at all times of the day, every day. However, in this case, the early appointments are designed to facilitate those patients who have to attend work afterwards.</P>
      <P>The board has confirmed that it is keeping the service needs under review, and in the interim, it will make every effort to improve the arrangements for individual dialysis patients.</P>

      <P>Recycling grant schemes have been operated by <Col N="103" /> my Department since 1989.  Information has already been published in relation to grants paid each year and is contained in Environment Bulletin Nos. 9, 12, 15, 20, 21, 25 and 29, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. This year, to date, one grant payment of £100,000 has been made to Kerbside Dublin.  I expect to be in a position shortly to announce further grant approvals for both local authority and private sector recycling projects under the Operational Programme for Environment Services.</P>
      <P>Good progress is being achieved in the development of waste recycling and the achievement of national recycling targets.  The various grant schemes which have operated since 1989 have contributed significantly to the substantial expansion of recycling activities and infrastructure which has occurred in that period.  The number of recycling bring bank sites increased from some 60 sites in 1988 to 200 in 1993 and there are now an estimated 426 sites throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The most recent and comprehensive information on waste and recycling is contained in the National Waste Database Report, 1995, published by the Environmental Protection Agency. A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas Library.  In relation to combined household and commercial waste, the report indicates that between 1993 and 1995 the recycling rates have increased from 7.4 per cent to 10.4 per cent for all such waste, and from 10.3 per cent to 15.6 per cent for packaging waste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing aims of Rural Resettlement Ireland have my full support. Since 1992, my Department has approved grants totalling £215,000 towards the administrative and general expenses of RRI in respect of their housing-related activities, including £60,000 this year.  RRI have also been granted approved body status for the purposes of the voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes and are providing a number of houses under these schemes.</P>
      <P>Households moving under the RRI programme may be eligible for local authority house purchase loans or shared ownership, and the deposit requirement under the latter scheme has been eased in these cases.  The mortgage allowance and improvement works-in-lieu schemes can also be used to assist families wishing to resettle in a rural area.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new resettlement mortgage jointly funded by the Housing Finance Agency (through the local authority), Bank of Ireland, and RRI was introduced on 1 July 1996 on a pilot basis.  This new mortgage will assist qualifying families to resettle permanently by purchasing and restoring, where necessary, existing houses.</P>
      <P>The significant support provided by my Department to RRI means that their programme can already be regarded as one of the range of social housing options now available.  However, as I have indicated previously, I do not have proposals to provide for an additional &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; grant along the lines envisaged by RRI.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was established in 1989 to cater for long-term unemployed people.  It was on this basis that EU structural fund support was obtained.</P>
      <P>The scheme was broadened in 1993 to include lone parents, disabled people and their spouses for whom adult dependent allowances under the relevant schemes are paid.  An overall quota of up to 10 per cent of places applies to these categories.</P>

All eligible schools were invited by the education research centre to provide data relating to the pupils in their intake classes under a range of objective criteria.  The criteria in question had been devised by the education research centre in consultation with the Combat Poverty Agency and after detailed consideration of a wide range of possible indicators.</P>
      <P>The education research centre reviewed all applicants and selected schools for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of the data submitted.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the schools mentioned by the Deputies did not rate high enough on the priority list to justify their selection by the education research centre.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it absolutely clear that the criteria under which schools were selected and the selected process were devised and carried out entirely by the education research centre.  I am satisfied that my decision to give the centre this responsibility was fully justified.  This is particularly so, given the complexity of the issues involved and the recognised expertise of the centre and the Combat Poverty Agency in this area. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to seek the inclusion of schools which failed to qualify on the basis of the objective criteria applied to all applicants.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.

      <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 62 and <Col N="118" /> 67 of 25 January 1996 in which I outlined in detail the background to this matter.  In that answer I said:</P>
      <P>A request was received from the Pilgrim House Community in June 1993 outlining a project about which they were in discussion with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and seeking my Department's approval in principle to provide care in Ireland for a small group of Somali orphans and in the event of a parent subsequently presenting themselves that contact with the children would be facilitated.</P>
      <P>The community was informed that its proposals had implications for a number of Departments, in particular the Departments of Health and Foreign Affairs.  Although my Department has responsibility for immigration controls generally, any proposal regarding the admission of a group of people into the State in these circumstances &mdash; and especially a group of persons in need of constant medical attention &mdash; would need consideration by these other Departments.</P>
      <P>The Pilgrim House Community was informed by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in January 1994 that the proposal was outside the scope of that Department's responsibilities for refugees as determined by Government decisions.  My predecessor informed the community in February 1994 of her consequent inability to accede to its request.</P>

    <P>I understand that there are currently two courts hearing road traffic cases on a full-time basis in the Four Courts complex and that half the time of another court is also taken up with these cases.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have, since becoming Minister instituted a number of anti-crime measures, both immediate and long-term.  I am confident that these measures will prove effective in tackling crime.  These measures include the recruitment of extra gardaí, increased civilianisation, the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, an increase in the number of youth diversion projects, the strengthening of the Juvenile Liaison Officer Scheme and the expansion of the <Col N="122" /> CCTV network.  I have also introduced a number of Bills some of which have now become law.</P>
      <P>The shortfall in prison places is being addressed by the extensive prisons building programme which I initiated and which is under way at present.  Over 90 of these extra places will become available within the next two months at the Curragh and Castlerea.

      <P>A total of 107 Irish persons who are serving sentences in the United Kingdom have applied or expressed an interest in transferring into this jurisdiction, to date.</P>
      <P>Forty-five applications have been transmitted to my Department by the United Kingdom Authorities for consideration by the Irish authorities. Such a transmission is a formal requirement and does not give approval for the transfer by the UK authorities.  Three of the applicants whose cases were transmitted have since been released by the UK authorities.  A further applicant has died in custody there.</P>
      <P>I have been in a position to give my formal consent to ten of the remaining 41 applications. Two of the applicants have since been transferred to Ireland.  The UK authorities recently gave consent to three applications, that I had already consented to, and my Department will be applying shortly to the High Court for the necessary warrants to bring these persons back here.  I have also consented, in principle, to an eleventh application subject to certain information being provided by the person on his domestic arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the remaining 30 applications, five are still being examined by officials in my Department, having only recently been received; one application is the subject of correspondence between my Department and the UK authorities &mdash; we are seeking additional information; 18 applications have been forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for advice in accordance with the Act and seven of these are now the subject of further queries with the UK authorities as a result of the <Col N="123" /> advice received from the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Six other applications are in the process of being finalised for submission to me.  It should be noted that my consent to a transfer must be matched by the consent of both the offender and the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>Thirty-six persons serving sentences in Ireland initially applied for transfer to the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.  Nine of the applicants subsequently withdrew from the process; two were deemed to be ineligible, four were released pursuant to the powers vested in me, as Minister, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>The first outward transfer to the UK occurred on 4 September 1996 and I expect some more will follow in the months ahead.  This leaves 20 outward applications still being considered.</P>
    <P>Twelve of these applications have been formally transmitted &mdash; six to the UK and six to Northern Ireland.  The eight remaining applications are due to be submitted to me for my consent, in principle, prior to the preparation of the reports required to allow an application to be considered by another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>As regards the length of time it takes to process an application, this is due in no small degree to the cumbersome but necessary procedures and requirements which have their roots in the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and, to an extent, in our legislation.</P>
    <P>The Home Secretary and I have discussed this issue only recently and are well aware of the importance of processing applications without undue delay.  We have agreed that our officials should take another look at the operation of the convention as between our two countries to see if any administrative changes can be made which might expedite the process.</P>
    <P>It is not understood what the Deputy means by the term &ldquo;category of prisoners&rdquo;.  Applications for inward and outward transfers have been received from persons serving determinate and indeterminate sentences.  The nature of the offences differ from case to case as do the sentences imposed.  The security classifications of the applicants also differ.  It is, however, important to state that each application is treated on its own individual merits.</P>

They have informed me that the overall Garda strength on the Border, together with that of the Army as an aid to the civil power, is the subject of ongoing review based on operational requirements.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware from recent media reports the Garda authorities have reviewed their operations in regard to combating the drugs problem in Dublin city and the Garda Commissioner announced their new strategy, Operation Dóchas, which came into effect on Monday, 7 October 1996.  The new strategy will operate in all Dublin districts and will involve the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain-clothes gardaí. Uniformed gardaí will adopt a high profile through both foot patrols and mobile patrols and will work to forge greater links with local communities, both community leaders and individual families.  Backup will be provided by specialist mobile units and other units.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, with the support of the community, this strategy will tackle drugs related crime and in particular that it will bring an end to the unacceptable practice of open street dealing.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the above strategy will be kept under review for an initial period of three months and that any changes necessary will be made to ensure its success.</P>

      <P>The Constitutional independence of the Judiciary excludes any action by the Minister which could be interpreted as direct interference in the exercise of their judicial function including imposing a training or briefing programme on them.</P>
      <P>However, I am committed to assisting the Judiciary with any initiatives which they may bring forward in this regard and to promoting in so far as is open to me the training of the Judiciary.  The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 provides that persons wishing to be considered for judicial appointment must agree to undertake training courses following their appointment and it also enables me to make funding available for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>The Chief Justice is in the process of establishing the judicial studies board and the provision of training for all newly appointed judges will be among the matters for consideration by this board.  The President of the District Court has already introduced training for newly appointed judges, an initiative which I very much welcome.</P>

      <P>The need for overnight transcripts arose in the Central Criminal Court in October 1995 when one of the trial judges insisted upon having this facility available to him in the course of a particular trial.  Since then all the trial judges in the Central Criminal <Col N="127" /> Court have requested that this service be made available to them in murder trials and other serious cases involving rape, armed robbery, etc. As the courts stenography service was unable to provide this service, arrangements were put in place to have it provided using a private stenography firm.  Before any company was engaged quotations were sought from a number of private stenography firms to provide the service.  On the basis of the quotations received and with the agreement of the Department of Finance a private company was engaged at a rate of £1,000 per day.  I understand that this company is providing a satisfactory service.</P>
      <P>The demand for overnight transcripts is set to continue as part of a modern courts system and my Department is making plans to ensure that the courts stenography service will, in the future, be in a position to provide this service.  Currently only two of the serving court stenographers are trained in taking electronically recorded shorthand notes of court proceedings.  The other stenographers take manual shorthand notes.</P>
      <P>There are also a number of vacancies for court stenographer and efforts are being made to fill these vacancies through the Civil Service Commission. However, before advertising the competition, the Commission is undertaking a job analysis of the post of court stenographer to include the modern day requirements of the position and the developments likely to take place in the future.  In addition, any of the script stenographers who so wish will be offered the opportunity to retrain as computer stenographers.  In the mean-time private firms will have to be employed to provide overnight transcripts as and when required.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that two <Col N="130" /> women died in 1995 as a result of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>The Garda domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit oversees the investigation of violent and sexual offences committed against women and children.  Enforcement practices in respect of protection and barring orders are also carefully examined.  The unit works in close contact with the Garda community relations section and liaises with organisations, both statutory and voluntary, which deal with violent or sexual crime against women and children.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have impressed on members of the Force the importance of active follow-up of incidents of domestic violence.  The primary role of the gardaí in such circumstances is one of protection of the victims of domestic violence through law enforcement.  In addition, victims are made aware of the legal redress available to them through the civil courts and of the social services which are available.</P>
      <P>The Domestic Violence Act, 1996, initiated by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, improves protection for the victims of domestic violence.  It extends the powers of the courts and strengthens the powers of the gardaí to make arrests.  That Act came into operation on 27 March 1996.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, as stated in the Official Report, Volume 469, columns 71 and 72, the Tánaiste, following consultation with relevant Government Departments, has set up a working group to develop a co-ordinated response and strategy on mental, physical and sexual violence against women, with a particular focus on domestic violence.</P>

      <P>The Video Recordings Act, 1989 which was enacted to control and regulate the supply and importation of video recordings was brought into operation in stages by ministerial order.</P>
      <P>The Act contains three levels of control.  First, it contains provisions for the licensing of wholesale and retail video outlets.  Second, it provides that the Film Censor may, on grounds specified in the Act, prohibit the supply of video films which he considers unsuitable for viewing, and third, it provides for the classification of video films in terms of their suitability for viewing by different age groups.  The first two levels of control were brought into operation in 1991, with the third level coming into operation on 12 May 1994.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Act provides for the making of an order prohibiting the supply of video recordings if it is considered that the work is unfit for viewing.  Since that section of the Act was commenced, at the end of 1991, 2,449 works have been prohibited.  Most of these works were submitted to the Film Censor by the Garda or the Customs officers.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Act requires video distributors to submit all new release films to the Film Censor for examination.  Those videos which are found by the censor to be suitable for viewing are certified and classified accordingly and those found unsuitable are prohibited.  Classified videos have to be labelled accordingly prior to supply.</P>
      <P>The licensing provisions of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 require all wholesalers and retailers, including renters of videos, to be registered with the Film Censor's Office and to display appropriate licences on their premises.  A very important element of this licensing control is the fact that the licences may be forfeited by order of the courts in the event of the holder being convicted of certain offences under the Act.  This can happen if a licence holder trades in prohibited videos.  In other words, the courts can put the owner of a shop renting or selling so-called video nasties out of business in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>Since 1 September 1994, it is an offence to offer for sale or rent any new video which has not been certified and classified by the Censor, or which does not carry prescribed labelling, indicating that it has been certified and showing the appropriate classification symbol.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of the law in relation to the Video Recordings Act, 1989 is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  If the Deputy is aware that so-called video nasties are available for hire at a particular location, I would urge her to pass on the details to her local gardaí.</P>

      <P>The Coroner's inquest into the death of the person referred to by the Deputy has not yet been held. At 1.35 p.m. on 27 February 1996 an officer checked the deceased in his cell.  He appeared to be normal.  The officer returned to the cell at 1.45 p.m. and found him hanging from the toilet door in his cell.  He had a sheet tied around his neck.  Two officers entered the cell and removed the sheet from his neck and they began to resuscitate him.  Almost immediately other officers arrived in the area and they notified the medical orderlies, who immediately responded and on their arrival commenced Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation.  The ambulance arrived at 1.55 p.m., and the deceased was removed to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Mater Hospital.  He died on Friday, 1 March at 3.40 p.m.</P>
      <P>It was a most unfortunate death, as it appears that the resuscitation efforts undertaken by prison staff, the ambulance crew and the medical staff at the Mater Hospital almost saved the deceased's life.  I am also satisfied that nothing more could have been done in the prison to prevent the death.  This death, like any other suicide in prison, has been referred to and examined by the suicide awareness group in Mountjoy Prison in accordance with the recommendations made in the report of the advisory group on Prison Deaths that was published in August 1991.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 252 and 287 on 2 July 1996 in regard to extradition arrangements between EU member states and the measures being taken at EU level to enhance those arrangements.  The Convention referred to in the final paragraph of that reply was adopted at the Informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Dublin on 27 September 1996.  That Convention provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a limited relaxation of the dual criminality rule, the further restriction of the political offence exemption, provision for extradition of own nationals, a limited relaxation of the rule of speciality and the abolition of the revenue offence exemption.  Legislation will have to be enacted at national level to give effect to that Convention, to the 1995 EU Convention on Simplified Extradition Procedures and to an Agreement between the EU member states on the Simplification and Modernisation of Methods of Transmitting Extradition Requests which Ireland has yet to sign.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the years 1993 to 1995, inclusive, six requests were made by Ireland to EU member states for the extradition of persons wanted in connection with drug trafficking offences, three in 1993, two in 1994 and one in 1995.  One of the six persons comprehended by those requests returned voluntarily and three others were extradited to this jurisdiction, two in 1993 and one in 1994.  The remaining two cases are still current.</P>

The Commissioner is satisfied that the search was conducted in a professional <Col N="136" /> and competent manner.  While the Deputy does not suggest that advance information about this visit had been given to the media by the gardaí, I want to say, for the avoidance of any doubt that might arise from the way her question is framed, that the Commissioner did not authorise release of any information on this matter to the media and he does not accept that officers of the Garda Síochána released such information either.  To have done so would have been totally contrary to the established policy of preserving the anonymity of persons affected by these searches.</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions, an increase is payable in respect of a spouse or partner as an adult dependant where the spouse or partner is not in receipt of a social welfare payment in his or her own right and does not have income in excess of £60 per week.  Increasing the present limit of £60 would not resolve the problems associated with the current arrangements whereby a beneficiary loses entitlement to both the adult dependant allowance and half of any increases payable in respect of dependant children, where the earnings of a spouse or partner exceeds the income limit.  A more effective arrangement might be to introduce a gradual or tapered withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance where the income of the spouse or partner is within specified income limits.  Any changes along these lines would have substantial cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 267 together.  The information with regard to fraud detected is not maintained on a month by month or on a county basis.  The detection and prevention of fraud and abuse of social welfare payments is an integral part of the day to day work of my Department, which also has a programme of ongoing specialist control activities as <Col N="137" /> part of its drive against fraud, abuse and unwarranted recourse to social welfare.  The estimated savings from these activities was of the order of £124 million in 1995 which was factored into our expenditure projections for that year.  The savings for 1996 which was factored into our expenditure projections were £140 million.  These savings arise from the prevention and detection of a variety of irregularities which can range from short-term minor abuses to very serious fraud of a deliberate nature.</P>
      <P>Where overpayments are identified in respect of past benefit incorrectly claimed or paid, deciding officers nominate those which they believe to have been fraudulent.  The total number of such individual overpayments held to be fraudulent in 1995 was 10,701, the total value of which amounted to £11.6 million.  The total number recorded to the end of September 1996 was 6,841 with a total value of £9 million.  The number of prosecutions finalised in court in 1995 was 57 of which 36 resulted in fines being imposed, one resulted in a term of imprisonment, six sentences were suspended, five were given the benefit of the Probation Act, three were sent on community service and six were struck out.  Four of these related to prosecutions in County Cork and all four received fines.  Three were employers who had failed to comply with their obligations regarding payment of PRSI and one was a disability benefit recipient who had obtained benefit fraudulently.  Between 1 January 1996 and 30 September 1996, 50 prosecutions were finalised. The results were: 25 received fines, two were imprisoned, eight were suspended, six received the Probation Act, four community service, one was bound to the peace and four were struck out. All cases involving fraud and abuse of the social welfare system are examined with a view to initiating legal proceedings.</P>

      <P>Under the SWA scheme, a supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.  Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards who administer the scheme, and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances &mdash; equivalent to short-term unemployment assistance &mdash; less a nominal sum of £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation costs. Each applicant is assessed on an individual basis and not on the basis of their former employment. There is no specific provision under social welfare legislation to provide assistance towards the cost of private medical insurance or pension contributions.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission in July 1994, proposed that with the support of the European Regional Development Fund, a large dedicated Conference Centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates be established in Dublin.  The present position is that following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, I have been pursuing since January last, as recommended by the independent Product Development Management Board, an alternative strategy for a major international conference centre under the tourism operational programme.  In accordance with this strategy, Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the aforementioned product board, have been examining a proposal from the Royal Dublin Society &mdash; RDS &mdash; which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under the OP for public and similar bodies.  The RDS has been advised, <i>inter alia,</i> that their proposed centre, which would be located at their headquarters in Ballsbridge, would have to operate without <Col N="139" /> annual operating subsidy from the State or revenue from casino gaming.</P>
      <P>The possibility of a second proposal, involving a public/private joint venture, was also explored during the year but I am informed by Bord Fáilte, who are responsible for assessing such proposals, that the promoters were not in a position to submit the necessary outline details within deadlines set to allow assessment of suitability for inclusion in the alternative strategy.  Bord Fáilte and the product board have now completed their examination of the RDS proposal and have recommended a separate independent cost/benefit analysis.  This analysis is being undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm, selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure, who are expected to report shortly.  Once available, I will consider their findings, along with those of the product board, with a view to referring the RDS proposal, if appropriate, for decision by Government as to possible submission to the European Commission who must individually approve major projects of this magnitude under the OP.  With regard to the continuing availability of funding for the project, European Commission Division C(94) 1972 of 29 July 1994 in relation to the Operational Programme for Tourism provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that European Regional Development Fund support committed at national level before the end of the programme period may still be spent after that period has expired.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271, 272, 273, 276, and 277 together.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland &mdash; IFI &mdash; is an independent body which does not fall within the remit of my Department.  It conducts its work through a number of different programmes.  Several State agencies are represented on teams which operate these programmes.  In relation to the North American Partnership Programme &mdash; NAPP &mdash; for example, Forbairt has been appointed by IFI as an agent to operate the programme on its behalf.  However, issues of an operational nature relating to the NAPP still remain the responsibility of IFI and any queries thereon should be put to the IFI directly.  Specifically in relation to the question of whether a tendering process was used in seeking assistance to run the programme, I can confirm that a detailed tendering process did in fact take place.  In relation to the Deputy's query concerning Forbairt's appointment of technology transfer executives throughout the regions, these appointments were made as part of the agency's long-established Technology Transfer and Partnership Programme which is operated on a national basis.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the difference between this programme and the NAPP/IFI Programme which is focused on the Border region only.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 and 275 together.  Regarding the Deputy's question relating to the level of activity to date under the NAPP/IFI Programme, as indicated in my separate reply, operational matters relating to the IFI do not fall within the remit of my Department. The Department of Foreign Affairs have, however, issued a number of press releases on the matter, copies of which I have arranged to be sent to the Deputy directly.  In so far as duplication and streamling of the roles of agencies is concerned, Forbairt's activities under its Technology Transfer/Partnership Programme&mdash;which helps companies to develop new products and processes&mdash;are complementary to, rather than overlapping with, those of ABT, which focus on helping companies find/develop overseas markets for new or existing products.  Typically companies will avail themselves of assistance from both agencies as part of their strategic development.</P>
      <P>Forbairt's small number of executives in North America, who are based in IDA offices to maximise information flows and minimise costs, are responsible for the identification of potential US based partners to meet the identified needs of Irish companies for technology transfers partnerships and also represent Forbairt's interests in the attraction of overseas investment in the natural resources sectors.  I am satisfied that there is no overlap between Forbairt's activities in relation to the IFI/NAPP and ABT's marketing role in North America.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the updating and consolidation <Col N="142" /> of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which date in some cases from 1893, are well advanced.  The scope of the Bill has necessarily required detailed attention on the part of both my Department and the Attorney General's office.  However, I am pleased to be able to say that a first draft of the Bill, which involves up to 200 sections, has been received from the parliamentary draftsman, and it is at present being examined in detail by my Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of credit unions.  The text of the Bill will be finalised in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman in the coming weeks, after which Government approval will be sought.  The Credit Union Bill is my priority for legislative action, and while I am not able to give a precise date for publication at present.  I can assure Deputies that every effort is being made to have the Bill published as quickly as possible in order that it can be considered during the forthcoming Dáil session.</P>

While the agreement for the implementation of the programme with one of the groups originally selected was terminated by my Department in February 1993, in general the Leader 1 Programme was operated in compliance with the regulations laid down.  Some 3,200 projects were grant aided by the approved groups, a very small proportion of which were aided under the terms of a flexibility clause contained in the guidelines laid down by my Department.  This clause provided groups with some discretion to aid local projects which would not normally qualify for aid, by references to local circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of difficulties being <Col N="143" /> experienced by farmers in complying with the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996 which, as the Deputy will be aware, update the law in this area.  The requirement to keep records in relation to the administration of certain animal remedies is an extension of a requirement that has existed since 1985.  There are no plans to issue preprinted registers; while the form of record to be kept is laid down in the regulations, farmers may use any suitable book.  I understand that one farm body is preparing a standard format for use by its members.  An advertisment advising farmers of the records to be maintained was published in the farming press in August 1996.  In addition, an information notice for farmers has been prepared and is available from my Department.  By maintaining the records required, farmers will enhance the image of their product among consumers. This is to be welcomed and is to the obvious advantage of farmers themselves.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to payments under the 1996 livestock headage and premia schemes is that the first instalment of the 1996 ewe premium was paid in July 1996.  The special once-off top-up for sheep producers in non-disadvantaged <Col N="145" /> areas was formally approved by EU at the end of July and was paid in early August.  Payments under the 1996 deseasonalisation slaughter premium commenced on 1 March 1996.  Payments under the 1996 cattle and sheep headage schemes commenced on 26 September.  Advance payments &mdash; representing 80 per cent of entitlement &mdash; under the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 special beef premium scheme are due to commence on 1 November.  Extensification premium payments cannot be made until such time as the final instalments of the 1996 suckler cow premium and special beef premium have been paid.  It is expected that 1996 extensification premium payments will be made in the period April to June 1997.  Advance payments under the arable aid oilseeds scheme were paid on 30 September 1996 and payments under the remaining arable schemes will commence shortly.  I can confrim that over recent weeks my Department has concentrated solely on making payments valued at £70 million under the BSE compensation package. This involved over 190,000 payments which had to be made by 15 October 1996.  This money has now been paid.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the amount paid to farmers under the various livestock headage and premia schemes in the period 1 January 1996 to 8 October 1996.  This includes payments made under the 1995 and 1996 schemes.  I regret that if has not been possible to give a breakdown by county.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to encourage the use of non-food farm crops to maximise the potential for our natural resources and to enhance the rural economy.  Set-aside land may be used for the production <Col N="146" /> of such crops and a wide range of crops are permitted under the regulations.  For example, oilseed rape for bio-diesel, cereals and sugar beet for bio-ethanol and short rotation forestry for biomass production are permitted.  Except for sugar beet, payments are made of all set-aside land used for the production of these crops.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, significant funds are made available for non-food uses of land.  These relate to forestry and alternative enterprises, mainly horse and greyhound production.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of the £3.5 million in EU funds lost to his Department in each of the years 1994 and 1995 due to delays in making payments which related to the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the cattle headage scheme, the sheep headage scheme, the ewe premium scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme.

      <P>In his annual report on the 1995 Appropriation Accounts, which was published recently, the Comptroller and Auditor General made reference to a sum of approximately £3.5 million which was disallowed by the EU because of payment delays.  Of this figure, £169,332 related to the 1993 suckler cow scheme.  The remainder related to the extensification scheme &mdash; £2,714,282 under the 1993 scheme and £627,189 under the 1994 scheme.  The extensification scheme was one of the new measures introduced in 1993 resulting from CAP reform. These new measures resulted in a substantial increase in the number of scheme payments made to farmers in 1993 &mdash; 600,000 as compared with 370,000 in 1992 &mdash; and involved greater complexity in administration.  While additional resources were put in place in the Department, there was some delay in recruiting and training staff and some teething problems with new computer systems.  In addition farmers had difficulty in understanding the various new requirements resulting in many errors in applications which took time to sort out.  All of these elements were factors in the difficulty in meeting the new payment deadlines in full as set by the European Commission.  As an extensification scheme payment could be made to a farmer only after all his other scheme applications had been paid, most of the late payments occurred in this area.  My Department is continuing to pursue with the European Commission the matter of securing some EU funding for these extensification payments.</P>

In view of the limited funding available under this scheme and the need to ensure a suitable geographic spread of centres, applications were invited from interested parties for consideration. A total of 33 applications were received including one from the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  The applications will be now evaluated by an expert working group within my Department and the applications will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.  In the course of examining the applications my officials may arrange meetings with the applicants in order to clarify aspects of individual applications.</P>

Mr. Cleary was informed by ESB of the offer of grant-aid on 5 October 1995. Under the terms of the scheme the offer of financial assistance must be accepted within one month of it being made and the premises must be wired and ready to have electricity supply connected within three months of the date of offer of grant aid.  This condition is clearly stated on the application form.  While the applicant accepted the offer, he did not carry out the necessary work at his end within the stipulated time period, to enable electricity supply to be provided.

Cé nach raibh sé d'aon guth, tuigim gur mhol Coiste Teicniúil Theilifís na Gaeilge, a bunaíodh, <i>inter alia,</i> chun córas craolacháin a shocrú do Theilifís na Gaeilge, nach raibh aon dul as ach cloí leis an gcóras UHF ionas go mbeadh sé ar fáil ar fud na tíre.  Is é sin an córas a úsáideann RTÉ níos minicí anois agus is é sin an córas a úsáidfear chun TV3 a craoladh nuair a bheidh sé bunaithe.</P>
      <P>Maidir le MMDS, níl aon ordú den saghas atá luaite ag an Teachta déanta agam.  I gcomhluadar leis an Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta tá sé beartaithe go mbeidh Teilifís na Gaeilge le fáil go foirleathan sa tír ins an tslí chéanna ina bhfuil RTÉ 1 agus Network 2 ar fáil faoi láthair.  De thoradh san, ní gá Teilifís na Gaeilge a iompar ar MMDS. Pé scéala níl RTÉ 1 nó Network 2 ar fáil faoí láthair ar MMDS agus bheadh sé deacair na seirbhísí seo a chuir ar fáil ar MMDS toisc an ganntanas acmhainne atá ar fáil don chóras sin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The full terms of reference are as follows: to advise on the nature of the appropriate technical parameters to be provided by South Coast Community TV so that their application may be fully assessed; to provide a detailed analysis of the application which will allow the Minister to make a clear judgement on whether, and if so how, the proposed service should be licensed; in conjunction with the above and with reference to paragraph 127 of the Government's policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to provide a general analysis of the feasibility of licensing other such systems; to advise and comment on the parameters <Col N="152" /> and mechanisms used in the development of the UHF frequency plan for the four national TV services having regard to best practice in spectrum management; and to advise and comment, as is considered necessary, on the potential implications for capacity and coverage in the UHF broadcasting band of likely new technical developments in the broadcasting field.</P>
    <P>In formulating the advice and analysis the consultant will have regard to: best practice in frequency planning and management of the UHF broadcasting spectrum and any relevant technical issues related thereto in the context of this application; the obligations which arise from existing assignments under the current national ratio frequency plan as it applies to the geographic area in question and the changes to that plan which are likely to arise from anticipated developments in radio frequency use and from international obligations; Government policy with regard to the establishment of two new TV channels &mdash; Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3; and the co-ordination of radio frequency use with other administrations. The consultant may be requested to provide other advice and assistance to the Minister so that he may be in a position to discharge his obligations under the court judgment.</P>

      <P>I have made no decision as to any legislation of the type referred to by the Deputy.  Arising from the High Court judgement in the Carrigaline case, I have appointed independent technical consultants, nominated by the European Broadcasting Union, to assist me with the assessment of the application in that case and I expect that they will be in a position to report to me in the matter by the end of November next. While the High Court judgment related only to an application from South Coast Community Television, I will, of course, have regard to the implications for other deflector systems which may arise from that assessment.  I assume the Deputy's reference to financial concerns is to charges for the service.  I think it is important to note that anyone providing a quality multi-channel service will be faced with certain costs and that these will be reflected in the charge for the service.  For those who have concerns about health aspects, I will reiterate what I said previously in this matter.  MMDS licences specify that the system must work within the guidelines laid down by the International Radiation Protection <Col N="153" /> Agency &mdash; IRPA &mdash; which is the expert body in the field.  Studies carried out in this country show that exposure levels from MMDS transmitters were many thousands of times lower than the IRPA limits.</P>

      <Quest>if the Irish Marine Emergency Service is to be reviewed in view of the inadequate response by public authorities to the recent oil spill in Dublin Bay which took such a high toll on wildlife and the maritime coastal environment.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that IMES responded adequately and comprehensively to the recent oil spill incident in Dublin Bay.  When the emergency service was first notified of a possible oil pollution incident near Burford Bank in Dublin Bay, it immediately activated the oil spill response contingency plan. All relevant agencies were advised of the report. Following confirmation that an oil spillage had occurred, all relevant local and harbour authorities were asked to activate their own contingency plans.  Because no vessel reported an accidental oil discharge it must be assumed that the pollution resulted from an illegal discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The response to the pollution incident was co-ordinated by IMES which liaised with all response agencies and interested parties including Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the harbour authorities, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  It would appear that, fortunately, very little damage was done to the marine and coastal environments. However, there was a significant impact on bird life in the bay area.  Up to 600 oiled birds were recovered for treatment.  This aspect of the response was co-ordinated by the Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. I can assure the Deputy that it is normal practice that marine emergency contingency plans are reviewed after each emergency and any <Col N="154" /> necessary adjustments are made in the light of operational experiences.</P>

      <P>A recommendation of the <i>Report of Review Group on Air-Sea Rescue Services</i> which was published in 1990 was that a Marine Emergency Advisory Group &mdash; MEAG &mdash; be set up by the Minister responsible for maritime matters.  As a result of the recommendation the MEAG was established by Government decision in 1991.  The group is made up of high-level officers of the maritime and landbased emergency services.  It is chaired by the Director of the Irish Marine Emergency Service &mdash; IMES &mdash; under the aegis of my Department and includes senior officers from the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Garda Síochána, the Irish Aviation Authority, the Marine Survey Office, the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and the Fire Service of the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>The role of the MEAG is as follows: to assemble as a task force at the IMES headquarters during major emergencies to advise the Director of IMES and or the Minister on the appropriate response; to review and amend any plans in existence for dealing with marine emergencies in territorial waters and the Irish search and rescue region and to approve new contingency plans, paying particular attention to the interface between land and marine emergency plans; to consider the implications of any intended changes in equipment, deployment or organisation in any relevant agency in advance of such changes and to respond appropriately and to exercise the authority to commit the resources of their own agencies to emergency response.</P>
      <P>In co-ordinating marine emergency response operations, the Irish Marine Emergency Service liaises closely with a large number of statutory and non-statutory agencies including, as appropriate, the local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  It has not been considered necessary for this service to be permanently represented on the Marine Emergency Advisory Group.  However, I will review whether liaison arrangements with this service can be improved, including its possible permanent representation on the MEAG.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission's views and observations on the proposed Development Project at Drogheda were conveyed, in a letter on 2 August 1996 from officials of my Department, to the Chief executive officer of Drogheda Harbour Commissioners. These views were arrived at following consideration of the detailed evaluation of the project prepared by the External Evaluator for the monitoring committee of the Operational Programme for Transport &mdash; OPT.  While the Commission recognise that a strong case could be made for supporting the proposed investments at Drogheda, there are a number of issues which they believe need to be addressed before a positive decision can be taken to grant aid the project. In particular the port charges at Drogheda are, they believe, excessive &mdash; in relation to those pertaining at other Irish ports &mdash; and the Commission doubt if these charges can become competitive without fundamental changes to the present costs structure.</P>
      <P>The Commission has informed my Department that it can only agree to co-finance the proposed investment in Drogheda if the following changes are put in place: the ending of existing dock labour arrangements and their replacement with labour practices which will yield costs comparable to those at neighbouring ports in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland; 2. and end to any arrangements which may restrict competition between stevedores; 3. the opening of the port to new stevedores; 4. the freedom for own-account operators to do business for third parties; and 5. adequate measures to control the port authorities own costs and charges.</P>
      <P>The conditions do not specifically provided for the drawing up of a legal contract.  Compliance with the conditions is, however, entirely a matter for Drogheda Harbour Commissioners.  Evidence will be sought by both my Department and the European Commission that the requisite changes have been made before any final decision to co-finance the project is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment proposed for Drogheda Port must fulfil the basic criteria and objectives of the Operational Programme for Transport, the overriding objective of which is to focus on measures which will assist in improving competitiveness and expanding the capacity of the internationally traded sectors of the economy.  In the case of ports, this should result in a more efficient and cost effective service for exports.  One of the aims of the programme is to ensure that the benefits of subsidised investments are passed on to end <Col N="157" /> users.  The Programme also strives to promote increased competition between ports.</P>

      <P>The Department has on hand four applications for licensing for finfish farming in the Galway and Connemara area.  Of the four applications on hand, two relate to a marine salmon farming development and the remaining two are for land based facilities.  The marine applications have been submitted by Killary Salmon Company Ltd., and Mannin Bay Salmon Company.  A number of technical, legal and other considerations will determine the timeframe for decision in these cases.  The two applications for the land based operations have been submitted by Mr. Joe McElwee and Mr. John J. Coyne.  These applications are currently being assessed by the Department's technical services.  A decision on <Col N="159" /> both cases is contingent upon the outcome of the technical assessment and completion of the local authority planning process.</P>

      <P>Inishbofin Island is one of a number of locations proposed by Galway County Council for consideration for aid under the Coastal Protection measure of the Environmental Services Operational Programme 1994-99.  In 1995, grant aid was provided to Galway County Council to undertake a £100,000 protection scheme on the island.  This work has been carried out by the council.  Galway County Council's proposals were given further consideration in 1996.  Another location proposed by the council, Tawin Island, was considered by the council and my Department to be more critical in the short-term.  I am aware from the council's original submission and letter of 26 March 1996, of the erosion problem on Inishbofin Island and consideration will continue to be given to this location subject to the availability of funding.</P>
