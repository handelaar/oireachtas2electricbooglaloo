      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív.  I call on the Deputy to state the matter on which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>De bharr an eolais mhí-chruinn a tugadh d'oileánaigh i bhfógraí poiblí agus ar na cártaí vótála, an gá atá ann go gcinnteoidh an tAire Chomhshaoil go n-osclófar na bothanna vótála ar na h-oileáin ar an Déardaoin, an 28ú Samhain, 1996 le cinntiú go mbeidh deis ag oileánaigh vótáil ar an lá a fógraíodh.</P>
      <P>In view of the incorrect information given to islanders in both public notices and polling cards, there is a need for the Minister for the Environment to ensure that polling booths are open on the offshore islands on 28 November 1996 to ensure that all islanders have an opportunity to vote on the day advertised.</P>

Beidh sé ro-mhall amárach nó an tseachtain seo chugainn an cheist seo a thógáil sa Dáil.  Tá íontas orm nach bhfuil tú sásta a chinntiú go mbeidh a gcearta bunreachtúil ag na hoileánaigh.</P>

      <P>There are six items to put before the House.  Is the proposal that the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government provide time early next week for a debate on developments in Northern Ireland?  This urgent matter should be debated in the House following what appears to be the effective rejection of John Hume's initiative.  Will the Tánaiste confirm that, as in 1993 when the Hume-Adams initiative that led to the Dowing Street Declaration was rejected by the British Government, the Government will not accept &ldquo;no&rdquo; in this instance from the British Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to providing time in the House, I am sure that can be discussed between the Whips.  As Deputy Ahern is aware negotiations have been ongoing for many months and as with any negotiations when it comes to making the ultimate decisions there will be difficulties.  As I said last night, there are difficulties now but work is ongoing.  We were in contact with the British Government at many levels yesterday evening and will continue to be. The gaps that divide the parties can be bridged and every effort will be made today and in the coming days to ensure that we bridge those gaps to avail of the opportunity to bring about the ultimate prize we are all seeking, peace, a reinstatement of the cessation of violence and inclusive all party negotiations as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I permitted that matter to be raised, but I dissuade Members from the notion that they can discuss this matter now or that we should engage in a question and answer session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that the real stumbling block all along has been and is that even if there was an unequivocal IRA ceasefire, which everyone in this House continually urges, the British Government would not be willing or able to challenge the Unionist veto to allow Sinn Féin participation in all party talks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful if the two Governments met at this time with a view to moving forward with a common strategy.  Will the Tánaiste confirm if a meeting is planned between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in the next fortnight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of a date having been fixed for a meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, but normally one would be held between now and the conclusion of business this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify a point.  There was a newspaper report this morning to the effect that yesterday the Cabinet decided to introduce legislation in this area.  Can I take it that is not the case?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Harney is aware, there is a report from the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.  The Government is studying the implications of it, but to the best of my knowledge what I told her is factual, legislation was not promised in the House to that effect.</P>

      <P>For more than a year, ten Bills have been promised from the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  On each occasion I raised the matters individually I was told the Bills would be introduced some time next year.  Apart from the Minister, what is the problem in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On legislation before the House, is the Tánaiste aware that his colleagues in Democratic Left have issued a veto on two sections of the Employment Equality Bill?  Is it his intention to allow the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to amend that Bill so that the concerns of Democratic Left can be allayed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if the Deputy raised that matter in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding this Bill is unusual.  Yesterday Democratic Left exercised a veto and the Minister was forced to withdraw an amendment and bypass the normal Committee Stage.  He gave an undertaking that when he has had discussions with the Government and the Attorney General he will bring an amendment on Report Stage and arrange for a recommittal at <Col N="261" /> that Stage.  It would seem the Bill before the House does not have the full support of the Government.  What arose yesterday in committee creates a difficulty for the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am merely asking when the Government will give its view on the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure when Report Stage is taken up and ordered by the Whips, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, will be able to present the amendment to committee to which Deputy Woods referred, and that there should not be any difficulties.</P>

      <P>In view of the uncertainty in the agricultural sector, the fact that the operational programme is now in shreds and there are about 800 unopened letters of application for licences in the Department of the Marine, will the Tánaiste indicate when the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill will be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Tánaiste's attention to paragraph 56 of the programme for Government which states, &ldquo;We will examine the possibility of legislationg to enable journalists to protect the confidentiality of their sources in certain circumstances.&rdquo;  The Tánaiste will be aware that matter has acquired a certain urgency for reasons I cannot go into.  Will he agree that Ireland's present laws in that regard are draconian and out of line with similar systems in other jurisdictions?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on Deputy <Col N="262" /> O'Dea's assertions about draconian laws here other than say his party was in Government for a long time and introduced a good deal of legislation.  Our consideration of this matter is not yet complete.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Employment Equality legislation, it is unacceptable that the Government ordered this Bill in the House while members of a Government party condemned section 37, the central section to the Bill.  It is not good enough to consider the provision of this section on Report Stage.  Numerous organisations negotiated with the Minister over many months on the wording of the section.  It has now been delayed until Report Stage because one party in Government is refusing to indicate its support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government, I am pleased to open this debate on the situation in the Great Lakes region.  I know that all of us in this House have been following the crisis in Eastern Zaire with the deepest concern.  Ireland, by virtue of our Presidency of the European Union, has been actively involved in the international response to the crisis.  I welcome the opportunity of this debate to brief the House on those efforts and for an exchange of views as to where we go from here.</P>
      <P>When the current crisis broke several weeks ago there appeared to be a real danger that horrendous scenes similar to those witnessed in Rwanda in 1994 were about to be repeated.  Thankfully, that has not happened so far.  If anything, events in the past two and a half weeks have taken a positive turn with the voluntary repatriation, in relatively good condition, of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Zaire to Rwanda. That is not to understate in any way the enormity of the problems that lie ahead.  The challenge for the Rwandan Government of absorbing returnees on the current scale is truly daunting.  Moreover, the plight of large numbers of refugees and displaced people in Eastern Zaire remains a major source of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary in the response of the international community to the crisis in Eastern Zaire rests with the United Nations.  The House will be aware that there have been a number of Security Council Resolutions on the situation.  The most recent of these, Resolution 1080 of 15 November, sanctioned the &ldquo;establishment for humanitarian purposes of a temporary multinational force [the MNF] to facilitate the immediate return of humanitarian organisations and the effective delivery by civilian relief organisations of humanitarian aid to alleviate the immediate suffering of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in Eastern Zaire, and to facilitate <Col N="267" /> the voluntary, orderly repatriation of refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the voluntary return of displaced persons&rdquo;.  Deputies will be aware that Canada has agreed to take the lead in putting together the MNF.  I take this opportunity to offer our congratulations to the Canadian Government on this important initiative.  I will return to Ireland's intention to participate in this force.</P>
    <P>The European Union, under the Irish Presidency, has been playing an active role in the major humanitarian operation under way in the region but we have also recognised that there are fundamental political issues at the core of the problem and that a humanitarian response alone will not be sufficient to bring a lasting solution. These are the twin realities which we have taken forward together in our approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Presidency and our partners in the European Union are continuing their intensive efforts to assist in averting further human tragedy in Eastern Zaire and to avert a potentially catastrophic humanitarian disaster in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  In our ongoing efforts we are working in close co-operation with the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other concerned members of the international community.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers of the European Union discussed the situation in Eastern Zaire at the two most recent General Affairs Council meetings, in Luxembourg on 28-29 October and Brussels on Monday of this week.  On Monday we were briefed by Mr. Ajello on his recent contacts.  The Special Envoy has played a valuable part in the European Union's contribution to the process in the Great Lakes region.  At the Luxembourg General Affairs Council in October we specifically mandated Mr. Ajello to travel on behalf of the Union to the Great Lakes region for a renewed and intensive series of consulations with the Governments of Rwanda and Burundi, the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity and other concerned parties.  Mr. Ajello also attended, on behalf of the European Union, the summit of regional leaders on the crisis in Eastern Zaire held in Nairobi on 5 November.</P>
    <P>The European Union welcomed the outcome of that summit which called for a full and immediate ceasefire to facilitate the intensification of diplomatic efforts to achieve lasting peace.  The summit also strongly supported, in conjunction with the respective Secretaries General of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity, the establishment of safe corridors and areas of sanctuary inside Zaire with an appropriate protection force to facilitate humanitarian assistance and the voluntary and safe repatriation of refugees.  In the interim Mr. Ajello has <Col N="268" /> continued his discussions with the Rwandan and Zairean Governments with the aim of encouraging a direct dialogue between them, either bilaterally or in the regional framework.</P>
    <P>As a further element of the Presidency's response to the crisis, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Joan Burton, chaired a special meeting of European Union Development and Humanitarian Aid Ministers in Brussels on 7 November.  The European Commission was represented by Mrs. Emma Bonino and Professor Pinheiro. Commissioner Pinheiro outlined to Ministers the situation facing the Great Lakes region and Commissioner Bonino briefed Ministers on the humanitarian response of the Commission to the crisis to date and presented a plan of action for humanitarian assistance.  Mr. Akashi, UnderSecretary of the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, DHA, Mrs. Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and representatives of several other major international agencies also gave briefings on the humanitarian situation in the region.</P>
    <P>The meeting agreed to send immediately a special mission of Development Ministers from Ireland, the Netherlands and Italy to make an assessment of the humanitarian situation and to identify ways and means to speed up humanitarian assistance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, accompanied by Minister Pronk of the Netherlands and Minister Serri of Italy, visited Zaire and Rwanda between 9-12 November.  Commissioner Bonino also participated in the visit.</P>
    <P>The Troika delegation visited Kinshasa on 9-10 November and held discussions with Prime Minister Kengo as well as other Zairean Government Ministers, including the Foreign Minister, the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Development.  In Kigali it met with the President and Vice-President.  It met in Rwanda with Ambassador Chretien, the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary General, and with representatives of the international humanitarian agencies and NGOs.</P>
    <P>Overall, the assessment of the Troika was that the exercise had been a valuable one.  It provided the opportunity to assess directly the immediate humanitarian requirements resulting from the crisis in Eastern Zaire and to hear at first hand the perspectives and concerns of the Governments of Zaire and Rwanda.  The Troika also had useful meetings in Rwanda with the UN agencies and NGOs working on the provision of humanitarian aid.  The visit demonstrated in a tangible way the commitment of the European Union to make its full contribution both to the immediate life-sustaining humanitarian tasks ahead and to the wider political process needed if a comprehensive, durable solution to the problems of the region is to be found.</P>
    <P>A further element of the European Union's response to the crisis was the adoption last Friday of a Joint Action drawing together the <Col N="269" /> contribution which the Union could make to the efforts which the United Nations has undertaken to solve the crisis in the region together with a Council Decision requesting the Western European Union to elaborate and implement aspects of the Joint Action.  These are important measures in ensuring a Union approach to the crisis that is as cohesive and effective as possible.</P>
    <P>Overall, there are two main challenges which must now be addressed.  The first is the immediate humanitarian requirements in the region and the second is the longer term challenge of securing a comprehensive, durable settlement to its problems.  The humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes region is in a critical phase and is characterised by a massive and rapid return of Rwandan refugees from Zaire and large-scale population movements in the region.</P>
    <P>At a regional level the situation is as follows: since 15 November an estimated 500,000 Rwandans have returned to Rwanda from camps in Eastern Zaire; in the same timeframe significant population movements have occurred from camps further west into Zaire and into Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi; large numbers of Zaireans have been displaced by the fighting in Eastern Zaire and a further 500,000 Rwandan refugees remain in exile in camps in Tanzania.</P>
    <P>I would like to summarise the Government's assessment of the situation.  First, it is our view, based on contacts with Irish aid agencies and the UNHCR and present information, that the internal and external population movements in the Great Lakes region are not yet over and that we can expect further significant movements throughout the entire Great Lakes region.  There is a strong likelihood, for instance, that the Rwandan refugees in Tanzania may shortly begin to repatriate to Rwanda also.</P>
    <P>Second, with regard to the massive voluntary influx of refugees to Rwanda, we are satisfied that the reintegration of these refugees is proceeding well.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reports that almost all of these refugees have now returned to their home communes and that, from a human rights perspective, the safety and dignity of ordinary refugees as they return are being respected by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Third, international aid agencies are involved in the distribution of food and non-food essential items.  Irish NGOs, including Concern and Trócaire, are to the forefront of the resettlement efforts.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Government remains deeply concerned about the fate and welfare of the estimated 300,000 to 700,000 refugees who remain in eastern Zaire.  The voluntary return of these refugees has been aspired to by the international community for many years and our strong desire is that they should be able to do so unhampered by intimidation or duress.  Fifth, the Government also remains concerned about the fate of the many tens of thousands of Zairean people who have been displaced by the conflict.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> On Friday, 22 November in Brussels, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, hosted a meeting of the EU Council of Ministers on development.  The Council strongly affirmed the commitment of the European Union to support the Government of Rwanda in its work to reintegrate the refugees on a just and equitable basis and to promote reconciliation and dialogue between all parties and the development of civil society.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed a series of measures to provide both immediate and long-term humanitarian and development assistance.  A package of 170 million ECU for the Great Lakes region was proposed.  The immediate priority of this aid will be to provide food and shelter for returning refugees.  An ambitious housing programme as well as support for health and education in Rwanda are long-term objectives. The European Commission will propose in early December a strategic and comprehensive plan of action for EU assistance to the Great Lakes region.  This plan will support social and economic rehabilitation, the reconstruction of independent and equitable justice systems, rebuilding and reinforcement of administrative systems and constitutional institutions and regional peace building efforts.</P>
    <P>On November 23, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, attended a meeting in Geneva of major donors, multinational organisations and international agencies to discuss critical needs related to the reintegration of refugees in Rwanda.  The meeting discussed priorities identified by the ministerial delegation of the Government of Rwanda, which include support for housing, justice, security and capacity building.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has already announced an aid package of £2.25 million in response to the current crisis.  This includes a grant of £1 million received from the national lottery.  This money is being channelled to the Irish NGOs operational in Rwanda, the International Red Cross and UN agencies for immediate humanitarian relief.  The package includes a grant of £250,000 for human rights monitors as well as support for the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reintegrate returning Rwandan refugees.</P>
    <P>I met Mr. Julius Nyerere, the distinguished former President of Tanzania, last evening and when I asked him how he assessed the priorities for the period ahead I was struck by the emphasis he put on helping the Rwandan Government to end impunity.  He believes there can be no reconciliation in Rwanda if those principally responsible for the genocide in 1994 are not held accountable for their crimes.  Mr. Nyerere feels that Rwanda cannot develop the necessary justice system on its own and the international community can help in this area in an important way.  The work of the international tribunal is critical in this regard also.  Ireland has contributed substantially already in these areas and I assure <Col N="271" /> the House that we will continue to play our part in assisting to bring about an end to impunity.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, meanwhile, planning for the deployment of the multinational force to assist the humanitarian process in eastern Zaire, sanctioned by UN Resolution 1080, has been continuing.  There have been intensive consultations between the troop contributing countries in recent days, including in Stuttgart last weekend and New York yesterday.  The Government has decided to agree to a request from the UN to contribute to the humanitarian mission involved and proposes to provide a contingent from the Defence Forces.  The necessary resolution will be brought before the House next week for its approval under the terms of the appropriate Defence Acts.  It is the Government's view that in light of the long and proud tradition of service by the Defence Forces in peacekeeping missions overseas and the deep concern which the situation in the Great Lakes region has given rise to here, the people would wish very strongly that Ireland play its full part in the proposed humanitarian operation.  I believe this view is widely shared in the House.</P>
    <P>Ireland, therefore, has attended the planning meetings for the mission and there have been bilateral exchanges between the Defence Forces and Canada about the precise nature of the contribution from Ireland.  The proposed mission is complex and its context has been altered considerably by the voluntary return of refugees to Rwanda already on such an unprecedented scale.  At the same time, there is a recognition, as I said earlier, that there are still many people in eastern Zaire, both refugees and displaced Zaireans, who need help.  It is now a matter of establishing how best that help can be provided to them.  I assure the House that Ireland will continue to work closely with our EU and UN partners in ensuring, in the most effective and safest way, that this help reaches those people and that the remaining refugees in eastern Zaire who wish to return to Rwanda can do so.</P>
    <P>I stress the fact that the proposed force is designated to be &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;, deployable until March of next year, together with the fact that its mandate in relation to refugees is specific to the UN High Commissioner.  This makes it clear that it is intended to augment and support humanitarian efforts rather than in any way compete with them.  The logistical and airlift support proposed under UN Resolution 1080 remains essential to enable the relevant agencies to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of the many refugees and internally displaced persons in eastern Zaire.</P>
    <P>Regarding the longer term perspective, I suggested earlier that humanitarian action alone, although important, cannot solve the problems of the Great Lakes region.  There is a critical need to develop mechanisms which address the underlying political problems and which do so in a comprehensive and coherent way.  That is the <Col N="272" /> only route to a durable, political settlement in the region.  I see much hope in this regard in the process which has been developed by the heads of state of the Great Lakes region themselves.</P>
    <P>Beginning some months ago with Burundi, and using Mr. Julius Nyerere as a mediator, the heads of state have begun taking a proactive, political approach to the problems of the region.  This approach is based on the premise that many of the problems inside separate borders are interrelated and can only be resolved on a collective, comprehensive basis.  The regional heads of state, as indicated, have now involved themselves in trying to facilitate the resolution of the conflict in eastern Zaire.  The European Union, through, <i>inter alia</i>, Special Envoy Ajello, has been actively supporting the efforts of the regional leaders and Mr. Nyerere and it is a process to which the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and I have assigned a considerable priority during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>In support of this concept, Ireland and the European Union also strongly favour the proposal for an international conference on peace, stability and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. The purpose of this conference would be the achievement of a comprehensive settlement of the problems of the region.  In addressing this challenge, it would build on the work to date of the regional leaders themselves.  Indeed, the current process under way in the region in regard to Burundi and now eastern Zaire might serve as a bridge into that wider conference. I also raised this issue with Mr. Nyerere last evening and he believes that such a conference has a positive role to play in building a better future in central Africa.</P>
    <P>I also discussed with Mr. Nyerere the situation in Burundi. which continues to be a concern to us all.  While the process is very difficult, he remains hopeful that his mediation efforts can yet bear fruit.  However, he warned that it will be a lengthy process and that the building of trust between the parties to the conflict will not be easily achieved. He asked for the continued support of the international community for his work and I assured him of Ireland's continued support, both during the Presidency and afterwards.  The situation in Burundi is a critical part of the overall jigsaw in central Africa and securing progress there will be vital to the overall settlement we seek in the region.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the wider political situation in Zaire, which remains a major concern.  Zaire is due to hold elections next year which are critical to its democratic transition process.  The EU is committed to the future of Zaire and its territorial integrity and considers such a process essential to the well-being of the region as a whole.  In tandem with the UN, the Union has undertaken to assist with the holding of the elections.  We have stressed to the Zairean Government the importance of ensuring that all <Col N="273" /> Zaireans can participate in those elections.  It remains to be seen what impact the current difficulties in the east of the country will have on that process.</P>
    <P>Mr. Nyerere's work in the region has been invaluable and it was an honour and a privilege to receive him in Ireland this week.  In that regard, I compliment Oxfam and Concern for their choice of Mr. Nyerere as the keynote speaker at the excellent conference they arranged this week on the theme, &ldquo;Europe's evolving foreign policy: Implications for developing countries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This debate on the Great Lakes region is most timely.  It reflects the continuing priority which all parties attach to the area and the deep concern which we feel about the continuing conflicts there.  It is obvious that there are no instant solutions.  However, there is a gathering consensus that the solutions to the terrible problems of the region cannot be found in humanitarian action alone and that a comprehensive approach is necessary, involving a partnership between region and international communities, if the harrowing images of the past two years are not to be repeated in short order. Ireland and its partners in the European Union have been playing a significant role in the efforts to achieve progress in the region.  I assure the House that we remain committed to continuing that work in the challenging period ahead.</P>

      <P>At the end of 1994 I spoke in the House about the time bomb which was ticking in the Great Lakes region.  In October 1995 I spoke about the catastrophe waiting to occur in the region and at the end of that year I raised the dangerous and volatile situation which prevailed there.  As 1996 draws to a close, it is with great sadness that I address the House on what has become the Great Lakes disaster.  History continues to repeat itself and the international community continues to fail to take action.  The first part of the Tánaiste's contribution amounted to a record of activity rather than achievement. Unfortunately, the international community has failed miserably in its discussions and consideration of the issue of Rwanda, Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current crisis in the Great Lakes region has been brewing since 1994.  In the wake of the Rwandan crisis of that year, the Government, the EU, the UN and the international political community failed to formulate a coherent response to the severe threat that the presence of 1.2 million Hutu refugees in Zaire was to pose to the stability of the Great Lakes region.  Low level conflict turned to open war in December 1995 when the extremist Hutu militia forced hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and indigenous Zaireans out of North Kivu, but Ireland and the <Col N="274" /> international political community as a whole failed to respond.</P>
    <P>In May 1996 the Rwandan Ambassador to the UN called on the Security Council to take immediate action to prevent genocide in eastern Zaire, but again the international political community ignored the request.  As a result of the repeated failure of the international community to address the problem in the Great Lakes region, the aid community has been forced to assume responsibility for what is essentially a political problem.  Ireland, as a member of the international political community, shares in the collective guilt of inaction.  As President of the EU, Ireland has failed to exercise its duty to lead EU member states at this time of crisis by forcing early and concerted action.  The action being taken now is too late.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, must assume responsibility for Ireland's inaction.  As President of the EU, Ireland has expressed concern at what the Tánaiste has described on numerous occasions as the disastrous situation in the Great Lakes region. The EU response to the crisis in Eastern Zaire has amounted to little more than a wait and see policy, focused on crisis management rather than crisis prevention.  Ireland, the EU and the UN have dithered and still no action is taken.  We are now told that a multinational military force is to go into the area.</P>
    <P>The position in the Great Lakes region has become a disgrace purely because the international community, including Ireland and our European partners, have not exercised their collective resources to alleviate the horrors which inflict that part of the world.  Two years after the first wave of genocide in Rwanda the horrific conditions which have persisted in that country have spread to Tanzania and Burundi, which are yet again embroiled in the tragedy that bedevils Central Africa.</P>
    <P>This morning we were due to debate a motion approving the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to Eastern Zaire, but instead we are having a debate which will result in the Tánaiste and Minister of State doing little new or of use to the people of the Great Lakes region.  While it is important to keep the Great Lakes on the agenda with a debate such as this, it is most disappointing that we are not thrashing out the pros and cons of sending Irish troops to the region.  It is shocking that the international community, including Ireland, is still dithering as to the type of force that will be sent into the area. We on this side of the House welcome the idea of the force and warmly support the sending of troops to that region to assist in every way possible.  There is an historical precedent for sending Irish troops to that region as the first UN mission carried out by Irish troops in the early 1960s was in the then Congo, now Zaire.</P>
    <P>As GOAL, the third world agency, recently concluded, it seems there is little interest in the fate of the Rwandan refugees stranded in Zaire. <Col N="275" /> As a member of the international community and the United Nations and, critically, as President of the EU, Ireland, through the Tánaiste, must renew the call for immediate action in terms of the international peacekeeping force to ensure it is on the ground as early as possible.  The presence of such a military force would alleviate the problem in several ways.  A military force deployed in the region could act as a conduit towards the ultimate aim of achieving basic human rights for Hutu refugees and the resettled Tutsi population in Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire. The presence of a military force in the region could play a critical part in locating and protecting the 700,000 refugees who failed to return to Rwanda in the past ten days.  The presence of a military force would hugely encourage the remaining refugees, who undoubtedly feel threatened and frightened, to return to Zaire by guaranteeing to protect and safeguard their interests.  It is shameful that although the World Food Programme has reported that aid agencies active in the Great Lakes region are in possession of adequate food and water to support 2.3 million refugees until January, without the protection afforded by an international peacekeeping force aid agencies in Zaire have as yet been unable to gain access to the 700,000 refugees who have failed to return to Rwanda.</P>
    <P>As EU president, Ireland has failed to secure agreement on the crucial questions facing us.  It is very well for the Tánaiste to be in the Middle East one week and another part of the globe the next, and while we are not cribbing with this we are appalled at the lack of priority given to the Great Lakes disaster by the Presidency.  It is a fundamental obligation of any administration to protect the basic human rights of its citizens and it is the obligation of the Government to protect not only the rights of Irish citizens but also those of the citizens in other regions who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in conditions which we would not tolerate.</P>
    <P>In the hierarchy of obligations the protection of human rights is a superior one.  The Government, particularly the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, have fundamentally failed in their duties. They have failed to protect and safeguard the human rights of people who are crying out for help and protection.  In mid-December when the Tánaiste stands up at the Dublin summit and beats his chest to claim a successful Irish Presidency of the European Union, it will not wash because we all know we will have failed to act in regard to the Great Lakes disaster.  We have completely failed to take a lead at national level and have yet to impose effective leadership at EU and UN level.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil document, Our Place in the World, I referred to the Defence Force which has been active in peacekeeping operations under the blue flag of the United Nations.  I paid tribute to the Irish non-governmental organisations such as <Col N="276" /> Concern, Trócaire and GOAL for their continued unfailing contribution in terms of humanitarian aid and assistance.  It is a pity the Tánaiste and the Minister of State did not take a leaf out of the books of these tireless organisations.  Hollow promises and publicity are not for them; action and results are the key words of the NGOs.  As has become the norm with the rainbow coalition, proposals, promises and publicity outdo any semblance of substance.  Action, achievements, goals and results do not feature in the Government agenda, which is most unfortunate for the desperate people of Central Africa.  It is essential that the Tánaiste is under no illusion in terms of the role of a military force in this area, which we fully support.</P>
    <P>The Government must show the world that continued suffering cannot and should not be tolerated.  The Tánaiste has a duty to act in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and, more importantly, given his present capacity within the European Union, it is incumbent upon him to act.  We have had enough bluster and inaction.  The people of the Great Lakes region need results now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for sharing his time with me.  I agree with the Tánaiste that the problems of the Great Lakes region of Africa cannot be resolved by humanitarian action alone, that a comprehensive approach is necessary involving a partnership between the region and the international community.  I accept that is very important, but the Tánaiste failed to refer to many issues which I had hoped he would cover, particularly the motion passed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  That committee dealt with many of the issues we hoped would be raised by the Government, particularly humanitarian aid, military protection for such an operation and the provision of safe corridors.  The committee was anxious that the Heads of State and Foreign Ministers should make this a priority issue, but I am not happy that has been done.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest problems is the dithering that has been evident on this issue, particularly at UN level.  Until we see powerful television pictures such as those on the humanitarian disaster in Ethiopia, the desired action will not be taken.  We discussed this issue in the subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  John O'Shea from GOAL informed the committee of the number of warring factions there and that begs the question as to who is supplying arms to the region.  We are told, for example, that approximately 12 countries are involved in this trade.  That must be condemned and the international community must take action to deal with the supply of arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's reference this morning to the issue of international monitoring and that funding is to be provided in that respect because the question of impunity, to which Mr. Nyerere referred also, is one of the most important issues in the region.  Those of us in the <Col N="277" /> western world find it difficult to understand that perpetrators of violations in Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda, which are at the root of the violence in the region, have not been tackled.  Those three countries must produce comprehensive proposals to put in place a justice system which conforms to international standards of fairness and ensures that those who violate human rights are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>While this dithering continues we have not had any response &mdash; although I hope a response will be forthcoming next week &mdash; on the question of Ireland's contribution to the resolution of this problem.  I saw a cartoon in <i>The Irish Times</i> two weeks ago which referred to &ldquo;our&rdquo; boundaries and &ldquo;our&rdquo; arms but &ldquo;their&rdquo; problem.  That seems to be the way the problem is being dealt with.</P>
    <P>The views of the Army officers' association in this regard are not encouraging; it stated the Army would not be in a position to send one battalion to the region.  We do not know the type of assistance that will be sent, and I thought the Tánaiste would have given some indication of that in his contribution this morning.  Will a medical corps be provided?  What numbers are envisaged?  Where will this international force be based?  Recent reports indicate the force may be based in Uganda and that the figures may be in the region of 1,000 rather than the 10,000 originally mentioned by Canada.  These are some of the questions I thought we would discuss this morning.</P>
    <P>We must continue to put pressure &mdash; and this was requested of the foreign affairs committee &mdash; on the President of the United States and the leaders in the region; President Mandela has said he is prepared to give every assistance.  That is important because the question of the involvement of an African force must be addressed.  While we are talking about the issue people remain lost in Zaire.  We do not know the total number of refugees, their location or what is happening to them and it is important that we reach agreement now and action is taken.</P>
    <P>The director general of MSF said that the average assessment in a crisis such as this is that ten out of every 10,000 refugees die each day.  His estimate is that approximately 13,000 people have died since the crisis began.  I hope action will be taken in that regard.  The UN Secretary General has thrown his weight behind the multinational force but it is important we come to a definite decision.  Perhaps the Minister of State, when replying, will give us some information on that.</P>
    <P>The recent reports that refugees are leaving Tanzania are alarming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact they are going home but we do not seem to have made any provision for humanitarian action to be taken. That is also the position in the case of Burundi. We must ensure that whatever assistance can be <Col N="278" /> given is given.  The EU has pledged £150 million to its programme in the region but, as Commissioner Bonino said, we do not seem to know exactly what is happening there.  The Tánaiste said this morning the situation is still fluid with people returning to their homes, but I hope we will get a decision from the Government as soon as possible.  We have the EU Presidency and the Government must ensure that the multinational force is made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taken aback when I discovered last Thursday night that the motion ordered for today by the Government to send troops to Zaire was withdrawn because apparently the Government lost its enthusiasm for sending even the most nominal force there. The reasons given included the fact that the situation in the Great Lakes region is changing from day to day and the multinational humanitarian intervention force may unravel completely over the next few days.</P>
      <P>That decision was made the night before the conference began in Stuttgart on the question of sending these troops.  Coming from the Presidency of the European Union that seems to have been the worst possible signal to send, that it was the view of the Irish Government that hopefully it, and the European Union generally, would not have to send anybody to the region.</P>
      <P>We are now told in the course of the contribution by the Tánaiste this morning, who has left for greater and bigger things than listening to a minor debate in this little House, that a motion will be put down by the Department of Defence next week, not by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to deal with the question of sending troops to the region.  The number and nature of the troops, however, is disappointing because we are talking about a figure of not more than 100 and there is mention of lorry drivers and other people providing services of that kind rather than fighting troops.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that the three day meeting in Stuttgart over the weekend concluded the way it did.  It is worth reminding the House what Chris McGreal had to say about that meeting and the consequences of it in Monday's <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper.  I will quote briefly from his report from Kigali.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Last week American and United Nations officials studied the same satellite photos of the same tracts of eastern Zaire and came up with entirely contradictory conclusions.  The Americans saw almost nothing.  The UN spotted 750,000 miserable souls being driven in circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the international debate shifts from what can be done to assist the Rwandan Hutu refugees still in Zaire to whether they even exist, the Rwandan government and its allies appear ever more willing to write them off.  The third day of a meeting of Western military chiefs in Germany yesterday was unable to <Col N="279" /> agree whether there was any need for foreign intervention in eastern Zaire.</P>
    <P>The anxiety of the United States, the European Union and Ireland, both as an individual country and as the Presidency of the European Union, to placate the Rwandan government and to see it as the solution to this problem is quite disturbing.  In his contribution this morning the Tánaiste stated: &ldquo;The Council of Ministers strongly affirmed the commitment of the European Union to support the Government of Rwanda in its work to reintegrate the refugees on a just and equitable basis and to promote reconciliation and dialogue between all parties and the development of civil society&rdquo;.  That, of course, is rubbish.  The Rwandan Government has no such intentions. Why does it still retain in its appalling prisons after more than two years 85,000 people who have not been brought to trial or released?  Why has no effort been made to provide a judicial system to try these people as the vast majority of them must, by definition, be innocent of any crimes.  Why are they held in custody in the most appalling circumstances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, in the genocide in Rwanda it is generally acknowledged by international experts, including the UN, that one million people were killed by their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State control herself and let somebody who has a different point of view speak?  She is such an arrogant person that she seems to think anyone who expresses a point of view that does not precisely concur with hers is wrong.</P>
      <P>I wish to contrast the completely different view taken by Commissioner Bonino to the attitude taken in the Council of Ministers.  Time and again in recent weeks the Commissioner has called for the United Nations and the European Union to send troops into this area to protect the vast number of unprotected refugees who are being killed and dying on a daily basis.  We do not know to what extent this is happening because people cannot get in to check it accurately.  What she said is in total contrast with what is said regularly by the Council of Ministers of the European Union.</P>
      <P>As recently as today Commissioner Bonino is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as follows:</P>
      <P>Troops should go to eastern Zaire now and they should use force, if they have to, to get access to refugees and other people stranded there, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian aid said yesterday.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Access to the area must be gained now, either by peaceful means or `manu militari' &rdquo;, Ms Emma Bonino said in a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner expanded further on that statement.  She has made a statement of that nature on almost a daily basis over the past two <Col N="280" /> or three weeks but she has been ignored.  She is in a minority within the European Community and it does not bode well that the Council of Ministers is taking the view it is taking.</P>
    <P>To listen to the Tánaiste today one would think that all was well in this region.  On the same page of <i>The Irish Times</i> is a report by Paul Cullen, development correspondent of that newspaper, on what is happening in the region and it is absolutely appalling.  The headlines read: &ldquo;Aid agencies left to pick up the pieces as the idea of an international force slowly dissipates&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eight year olds sent into battle on promise of a square meal.&rdquo;  The article continues:</P>
    <P>Reports coming out of eastern Zaire suggest that children as young as eight have been sent into battle with the promise of a square meal and an immunity to bullets.  Those not armed with AK-47s have been sent out by the Interahamwe forces to set land mines in early morning puddles on the roads of south-western Rwanda...</P>
    <P>A girl of ten is raped repeatedly by rampaging Zairean soldiers, then mutilated; another is defiled in front of her family, who are then shot.  Children who survive one set of marauders are killed by the next set of bandits to show up in their area.</P>
    <P>These were the crimes which an efficiently deployed force might have averted or minimised.  Now that the idea of a force is being slowly buried, it is left to the aid agencies to deal with a new layer of human suffering which has resulted.</P>
    <P>That is the reality there, yet Ministers and Ministers of State and all the rest of them are running around having talks, consultations and dialogue and congratulating one another on how successful those talks are.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that between 400,000 and 500,000 Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire have returned to Rwanda.  It is also estimated, although the Tánaiste has very different figures, that between 750,000 and 800,000 are still there. The Tánaiste said the Government remains deeply concerned about the fate and welfare of the estimated 300,000 to 700,000 refugees who remain in eastern Zaire.  I do not know how one can make an estimate of two figures that are so widely different from one another.  At least the United Nations estimates that there are 750,000 plus in that area and nobody knows their fate at present.  They are wandering around in circles and there is no international force to guarantee their protection.  There is a variety of potential aggressors as the article by Mr. Cullen makes clear today.  Those aggressors are only too anxious to take advantage of these unfortunate defenceless people, even children as young as eight and ten years of age.  That will continue as long as those people have no protection and I protest very strongly at that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> One of the points Commissioner Bonino made forcefully in her numerous statements about this situation is that if this were happening anywhere other than in Africa the international community would respond very rapidly to it.  She has accused the international community of, in effect, taking a racist view by allowing to happen in Africa something that they would not allow to happen anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being constantly interrupted by the Minister of State, Sir. I crave your protection.  I feel like a helpless Hutu.</P>
      <P>If this awful situation was happening in Europe or somewhere else in the world great concern would be shown.  Because it is happening in Africa, the international community prefers to ignore the problem and turn its back on a vast number of innocent people who are left there to suffer and die.  It is interesting to read international commentary on what is going on and to put it into context.</P>
      <P>The French, who might be described as the more active in the European Union in this respect, were quoted in <i>The Economist</i> last week as further complaining that the United States is giving unqualified support to a regime in Rwanda which is dominated by a minority that took power by force and shows no sign of allowing much democracy.  I would say it shows no sign of allowing any democracy.  It is highly unsatisfactory that a minority rules a majority within a country which was artificially created towards the end of the last century, where there is huge dissension between the two ethnic groupings and incredible bitterness which exhibits itself in constant violence.  This, unfortunately, is likely to continue unless the international community is prepared to step in to prevent that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same issue of <i>The Economist</i> quotes what it describes as a European diplomat in Kigali last week in the following terms: &ldquo;The Americans are playing a power game.  It matters much more to them to keep this Rwandan regime in power than it does to help the refugees&rdquo;.  That is very <Col N="282" /> probably true.  When one sees this power game being played and the attitude of various outside states, particularly the stronger ones, it makes one sad to think that the European Union, led by a small country that does not have a colonial background or history, is not prepared to stand up for those who are now suffering as a result of colonial activities in previous times.  It is not just colonial activities in previous times that contribute to this suffering.  Much of it is caused by the fact that until recently member states of the European Union were supplying arms in this region to all sides and any who would buy them, and we have been powerless to stop them.  Until recently the British, among others, were supplying.  It came to light in a recent report that the British were not just supplying firearms; they were even supplying machetes to one side in order that they might dispose of their opponents in the most painful and distressing way possible &mdash; shooting through the heart or the head was too easy a way to dispose of their enemies.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the European powers of the past to the creation of this situation is very great.  Their present contribution is, unhappily, still a significant one.  The best contribution we can make is to face up to the fact that these artificial countries created by European princes drawing lines on maps in the last century have not worked and will not work, and there will have to be some recognition of the ethnic and tribal differences and, if necessary for their own safety, some redrawing of the map so that people can live behind boundaries of their own choosing in safety from those who are of a different ethnic background.  The present lines on the map in the Great Lakes Region, dividing it into countries like Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire, have no real meaning on the ground.  They were drawn by European princelings in the last century, and the sooner the better Europe of today undoes some of that damage and contributes in a meaningful way, not in just a purely verbal way, to the establishment of peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first comment on Deputy O'Malley's remark about redrawing the map of Africa.  It was not well drawn in that it did not take ethnicity into account, but it would be a brave man who would redraw the boundaries.  It would also be unwise.</P>
      <P>The problem with a country like Zaire is that it has been ruled corruptly for the past 30 or more years, and the great powers in the world, particularly the western powers, supported Mobuto and his regime.  Everybody said it was the most corrupt regime in Africa but it got economic assistance from the West, economic assistance that went into its own coffers.  It is the most underdeveloped country in Africa, even though it is one of the largest in that part of central Africa, as large almost as Western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hate to sound as if I am scoring political points, but when I hear the bleating of Deputies <Col N="283" /> O'Malley and Burke I am reminded that when they were in Government together from 1989 to 1992 that Government, for the first time in several years, cut our overseas development assistance significantly.  At that time in Africa there was an appalling civil war in Angola, killing hundreds of thousands of people; there was an appalling ongoing civil war in Mozambique; Mobuto Sésé Séko in Zaire was oppressing his population; there was a famine in sub-Saharan Africa killing perhaps millions of people who can never be counted, and the contribution of this country, despite the moralistic bleating here today, was to cut overseas development assistance.  It took the return of the Government in 1992, and the influence of the Labour Party in that Government, for overseas development assistance to be brought back on track with a programme by which we would reach the United Nations target for overseas development assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, who has taken the initiative at meetings held at European Council level and during her visit to Africa, has spearheaded the campaign for a multinational force to go to the region and for greater humanitarian assistance.  She has stated, and it needs to be stated, that whatever we say about the new regime in Rwanda it is doing its best within the constraints under which it has to operate to repatriate its people.  It has set up centres for bringing people back to their communities and returning them to their own land.  It is taking the very unpopular measure of evicting people who have taken over homes and lands that belonged to people who became refugees and went to places like Zaire and Tanzania.  The international community needs to support the Rwandan Government in a much more meaningful way because it does not have the wherewithal from its own resources.  The UNHCR reports state that about 3,500 refugees are returning everyday from the camps in Zaire to their homes in Rwanda.  If one multiplies that figure by the number of days over which the exodus has been taking place, one is not going to account for anything like the numbers reported to have been in the camps up to a month or so ago.  Nevertheless there is a significant flow of people returning home.  The Government of Rwanda needs greater international support.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is good to have an opportunity to discuss this very important issue not alone in its own right but as part of the wider responsibility which the Minister and the Department have for heritage and conservation.  While welcoming this debate I was most disappointed to hear Deputy de Valera personalise and in some cases try to trivialise this debate.  Phrases such as &ldquo;the Minister dancing excitedly to his desk&rdquo; etc. may go down well in a student debate in a university but they do not do justice to the seriousness of this issue or to the work the Minister has done since coming into office.  Having listened to Deputy de Valera last night one would think the Minister had done nothing since coming into office.  She claimed vicarious association and compliments for everything the Minister had <Col N="285" /> done as having been done by previous Fianna Fáil Ministers, that Teilifís na Gaeilge had been in operation for the past four or five years and that the film industry had been revived somewhere in the last decade.  No attention was paid to the great strides made in protecting our natural heritage, greater policy direction and greater administrative and financial backup.  The Minister's record in this regard bears no comparison.  Deputy de Valera almost said there was no need for this Department although the achievements of the Department and the Minister in recent years indicated the need for this Department.</P>
      <P>The directive we are discussing has been around since 1992.  Prior to this Department being set up little attention had been given to it.  In the intervening years between 1992 and 1994 we had the split function of the Office of Public Works whereby policy was decided by one Department and implemented by another.  That too was unsatisfactory.  It is only since the transfer of the heritage services division to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht earlier this year that there has been real action on this and many other issues.  Deputy de Valera more or less said this area of activity was fine when it was a subsidiary section of the Department of the Taoiseach and there had been definite achievements in that Department.  It is more desirable for this matter to be treated in its own right in its own Department rather than remain as the personal playground of any Taoiseach or Minister.  That we can have accountability for this type of activity through a Minister and a Department is preferable in terms of the interest which Members have in monitoring what is going on and influencing that process.</P>
      <P>This matter and indeed many others would not receive the same attention had not the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Monuments and Historic Property Service and the Inland Waterways Service been transferred this year to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Those services now have a higher profile, better policy direction and more funding at their disposal to implement their plans.  An example of this can be found in the type of work being done by all three services under the National Development Plan where large sums of European funding have been secured by the Minister through negotiation for those important areas of our natural heritage.  Deputy de Valera and everybody in the House will make every effort to be associated with the developments taking place in all our constituencies but it is only because a specific Department was set up with specific functions assigned to it, funding provided and policy direction given that we are witnessing action in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate we are concerned about the implementation of the 1992 habitats directive. Sometimes people are confused by the titles of these directives and think we are talking about another planet.  We are talking about an <Col N="286" /> important part of our natural heritage, elements of which make this country attractive to visitors. It is important therefore that we afford them proper protection to ensure that our heritage continues to be a major source of attraction to overseas visitors.</P>
    <P>The habitats directive deals with the introduction of provisions to cover two areas: the protection of species and the protection of habitats.  These measures are necessary to conserve the most important flora and fauna habitats and to ensure Ireland is well represented at the NATURA 2000 initiative of the European Union &mdash; that is the designation and promotion of a community wide network of sites of natural heritage importance.  Given the pride in our natural heritage it is imperative that as many elements as possible are recognised, protected and promoted at European level.  It is important to be at the forefront of this movement and not be seen to drag our heels.  When we advertise our wares in the stalls of the European Union to attract visitors here we display, first, our natural heritage and, second, our cultural heritage.  We should be seen to be the vanguard of this type of protection.  Obviously this type of policy development needs to be implemented with sensitivity following consultation with other interests.  The concerns of people who are affected at local level need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last night the Minister stated that all interests, farming, environmental and conservation, need to be consulted as all share a common objective to protect our environment in a way which enhances rural development.  I welcome the Minister's commitment prior to this debate, to ongoing consultation in implementing the directive.  That is the only way to proceed and ensure local support for the types of initiatives we are endeavouring to have implemented.</P>
    <P>I was very heartened that the Minister acknowledged the farming community's contribution as custodians of our national heritage.  With proper consultation and the necessary elements built in I am hopeful this type of initiative will represent a landmark in the practical recognition of the role of members of the farming community in this respect.</P>
    <P>Since entering the EEC in 1973 the farming community has been pushed and pulled in many different directions.  They were initially encouraged to modernise, develop and increase production.  Then there were policy changes in Brussels, the wind blew from another direction, when farmers were pressured into set-aside, production limitations and capping of many developmental projects they had previously been encouraged to undertake.  With the positive engagement of the farming community in the conservation of our natural heritage, this type of initiative will complement those already in train under REPS.  This process has the potential to build on lessons learned in other member states where farmers are clearly recognised by the wider <Col N="287" /> community as performing a function in the protection of their national heritage for the common good.  As we move beyond the expiry of the present tranche of Structural Funds in 1999 into the 21st century this type of approach will become ever more important.  Whatever about the overall Community budget, tremendous pressure will be brought to bear on its agricultural element.  In enhancing farmers' role in the conservation of our natural environment we shall ensure the existence of a genuine explorative element in respect of rural Ireland when the next round of Structural Funds come on stream.</P>
    <P>Within the proposals being discussed by the Minister's Department, a number of different types of areas are being proposed, including natural heritage areas, their proposed and designated aspects, special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  Under the heading of proposed natural heritage areas there are approximately 1,200, comprised of some 750,000 hectares, a large portion of the country, for listing as important wildlife conservation areas, most of which have already been advertised in local and regional papers.  We are now talking about converting them from proposed to designated areas.</P>
    <P>The designation of national heritage areas to some degree has already been taken into account under REPS.  I urge the Minister to introduce and implement the necessary legislation for their designation as soon as possible.  It is important that Members are afforded an opportunity to examine that designation procedure.  The Minister has said these areas will have to be taken into account by local authorities in their local development plans.</P>
    <P>I understand that an amendment of the 1976 Wildlife Act will be necessary to allow that procedure to take place.  I presume the amendment will provide for an appeals procedure.  Where necessary, I urge the Minister to clarify the compensatory arrangements that will arise in certain cases.</P>
    <P>A number of natural heritage areas will be selected for designation as special areas of conservation, selected from the best NHAs, identified initially by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I anticipate a process of advertisement and public notification, with provision for an appeals procedure and that our national list will be finalised as soon as possible for submission to Brussels for inclusion in the European network of such sites.  As best practice dictates &mdash; I accept the Minister's assurances in this respect &mdash; the National Parks and Wildlife Service will consult the farming community on appropriate changes in farming practices with regard to special areas of conservation ensuring that, whenever and wherever action is necessary for the protection of a site, compensation will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Similarly, under the birds directive, in the case of special protection areas, proposed action will <Col N="288" /> be advertised in local and regional papers with a similar appeals mechanism applicable.  I am aware that many farmers in such areas adopt measures amenable to the conservation of various species within their locality.  Whenever and wherever such changes are necessary to implement these protective measures I hope that level of financial support will be payable.  While critics may allege that the farming community is looking for more money that is not what we are talking about here. The Minister has clearly recognised their value and importance in the protection of our national heritage.  I anticipate that the consultation process to which he has committed himself will result in measures on which all party consensus can be reached.  He has already indicated his willingness and that of his departmental officials to compromise in this area and acknowledged that, whenever financial support is necessary &mdash; in some cases to ensure that our objectives are attained &mdash; it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's action in this area, I support his amendment to the motion and urge him to proceed expeditiously with the introduction of the relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the House, I should like my remaining time shared between Deputies Ring, McCormack and Nealon.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue highlighted by a number of public meetings held throughout our constituencies.  On 18 November I attended a public meeting in Westport at which in excess of 700 farmers participated on the matter of natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation. The following day I met the Minister and clearly drew his attention to the fact that he had not engaged in any consultation with the farming community.  He promised he would write to me outlining the meetings he had had with the farming organisations, which he did, showing that he has had seven meetings with them, with another today, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party is saying that this latest process of consultation constitutes a pull back, that the Government has now withdrawn whatever plans it had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government had no plans.  This directive emanated from the European Union.  I was interested to note that successive Ministers had brought in these regulations without consultation, for example, a former Deputy and Minister for Fisheries, Brendan Daly, in 1982, former Minister for Justice, now European Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn in 1989 and former Minister for Finance, Bertie Ahern in 1994, clearly demonstrating that that party is familiar with directives, yet their representatives in my constituency pretended to know nothing about <Col N="289" /> them.  I was indeed interested to discover that all those directives had been implemented without the degree of consultation now being engaged in.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has agreed to engage in further consultation because the farmers of the west are entitled to know what will happen to their land.  If restrictions will be placed on its usage they should be fully consulted and informed.  I have heard farmers predict they will be unable to plant, will lose some of their ground and that auctioneers will be unable to obtain adequate financial return for certain lands.  I am an auctioneer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I will get a good price for land in any area.  I have always got above the odds for agricultural land in County Mayo.  That is probably because I am a good auctioneer.</P>
      <P>I make no apology to anybody for saying that if restrictions are placed on land then farmers are entitled to compensation.  I raised this matter with the Minister and I am glad he is responding to it. It is very important for farmers to be consulted so that they know which land is being designated and have an opportunity to appeal decisions.  I am glad the matter is being dealt with in a common sense way as this will eliminate the hysteria created by people who used it for their own political reasons.  I am not talking about members of Fianna Fáil on this occasion; rather I am talking about people who used this matter to secure their political future down the line.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Hughes said at a public meeting in Westport, the IFA has not had many meetings since we came into office two years ago.  The reason is that the Government is doing a very good job on behalf of farmers.</P>

      <P>This is not a U-turn.  Deputy McCormack, Deputy Nealon, I and other Fine Gael public representatives from the west met with Ministers.  The difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is that Fine Gael Ministers listen to Government backbenchers.

      <P>As we have done in the past, we will continue to look after the interests of farmers in the west.  I assure the IFA delegation in the public gallery that farmers will be given adequate compensation and people will be available to discuss their problems with them.  Members of the IFA are also members of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael but, in fairness to them, they always try to get the best possible deal for farmers.  The Minister must give them whatever compensation they require as they are entitled to it.</P>
      <P>I am glad the heat has been taken out of this debate.  Most people are satisfied with the Minister's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great unease among farmers about these provisions.  This matter is about the ownership and control of land, the most sensitive issue in so far as farmers are concerned. This does not imply a lack of interest or good will among farmers in the protection of our natural heritage; the contrary is the case.  This issue needs to be dealt with in a sensitive way.  We are transposing into Irish law Council Directive 92/43/EEC which deals with ecosystems and habitats.  However, as far as farmers are concerned it deals with their land.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has given a commitment to the three &ldquo;Cs&rdquo;&mdash; consultation, compromise and compensation, of which one could not have too much.  The Minister should consider adding another &ldquo;C&rdquo; to his list, cartography.  Many farmers do not know whether their land is included as it is impossible to read some of the maps.  The use of decent maps would relieve much unnecessary anxiety among farmers.</P>
      <P>The only way to proceed with this issue is on the basis of agreement.  Regardless of how long it takes or how laborious it may be, we must proceed by way of agreement.  In addition to the sensitive issue of land, there is also the question of massive amounts of money.  The difference between whether there can be afforestation on land or not can be as much as £500,000 or £250,000 if the land is on the side of a mountain. Conservation of our natural heritage can take place side by side with farming; these issues are not mutually exclusive.  Vast areas of counties Sligo and Mayo and other counties in the west are involved and agreement must be reached through negotiation and a commitment to the three &ldquo;Cs&rdquo;. This is the only way to proceed.</P>

      <P>The motion notes the Minister's intention to introduce an amendment to the Wildlife Act.  I welcome this as it will give us an opportunity to discuss this matter in greater detail.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil easpa mor eolais ar an gceist seo.  Tá an-íonadh ar na feirmeoirí agus ar na daoine a bhfuil talamh acu i gConamara faoin riail seo atá á shíniú ag an Aire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This directive was introduced in 1992 and I am puzzled as to why we are only working out the compromises at the eleventh hour.  Why was <Col N="291" /> action not taken four and a half years ago by the parties in Government and the Ministers who had responsibility for working out a package in the interests of all concerned?  Many of the concerns arise from a lack of knowledge of the proposals and fear of the unknown.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon is concerned about conservation, consultation, compromise and compensation.  Landowners must be compensated for any devaluation of their assets under this directive.  The Minister has met with farming organisations on seven occasions and he will meet with representatives of the IFA today.  I encourage them to iron out whatever difficulties they may have and to ensure that questions are answered so that concerns can be allayed.</P>
    <P>Two years ago compensation was offered for land which had been flooded in south Galway.  As well as offering compensation to landowners and those who will be disadvantaged as a result of the directive, compensation should be channelled to communities.  There is nothing wrong in compensating communities by improving services such as community halls, harbours and roads. Last year some of the compensation paid to farmers in Ballindereen and Kilcolgan whose land was flooded was channelled to a drainage scheme which helped to improve the environment and the lot of the community and ensured schools, nursing homes, houses and roads would not be flooded in the future.  This type of compensation is of more benefit to communities than compensation paid to individuals.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about the regulations. Regulation 19 provides that where an operation or activity is carried out on a European site in contravention of the regulations, the Minister may direct the owner, occupier or user of the land to restore the land in accordance with the directive.  That could prevent farmers from carrying out necessary drainage or other essential works on their farms.  When a local community in my area initiated a drainage scheme to prevent their houses from flooding, I encountered serious difficulties, not with this Minister, but with the Office of Public Works.  If the local community had not started the work prior to getting permission to do so, I do not believe it would have been granted permission for the scheme.  In hindsight everybody recognises it is a worthwhile and environmentally friendly project.</P>
    <P>Farmers are the best conservationists in the country.  A farmer will not destroy land he or she has been handed down over generations.  I do not want farmers to feel threatened because of this directive.  Will the Minister examine this matter before it is signed?</P>

      <P>I was pleased Deputy Gallagher referred to the range of activities dealt with in the Minister's Department, particularly the waterways service.  When Fianna Fáil in Government decided to restore the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal it gave particular instructions to the Office of Public Works and ESB International not to damage the flora and fauna.  The works were carried out without causing such damage.  I am still awaiting a financial allocation for the additional mooring facilities in Ballyconnell.  Such a development would be welcome in 1997.  Will the Minister advance the environmental impact assessment study of the Erne navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra?  While that may not be relevant to the debate, it is relevant to the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputies de Valera and Lawlor for giving us an opportunity to debate this comprehensive and important motion.  Otherwise we would not have had an opportunity to discuss the matter.  The Fianna Fáil motion refers in particular to the lack of consultation on areas designated for conservation.  Each Fianna Fáil speaker last night referred specifically to the need to consult and communicate with all the people involved in the designation of such areas.  Not only did the Minister's proposals exclude adequate consultation with landowners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the views of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas would also have been ignored.  The views of local communities and farmers are fundamental to any conservation programme.  The farming community has a key role to play in such conservation work. Unfortunately, there is widespread concern throughout the farming community about the Minister's proposals.  The farm organisations have put forward reasonable and practical proposals on this matter.  A meaningful and proper consultation procedure must be followed, involving direct consultation with the landowners. Consultation should not be of a hurried nature. The parties to any consultation must be given adequate time to tease out all the issues involved.</P>
      <P>Directives, be they of domestic or European Union origin, should not be imposed on large numbers of people and communities without all sides having an opportunity to put forward their viewpoints.  The passing of legislation through the two Houses of the Oireachtas enables various interest groups to put their views to Deputies and Senators and frequently the legislation passed by both Houses is much improved on that initially published.  Legislation involves consultation and openness to ideas and important and far reaching decisions in the crucial area of conservation should be made through legislative mechanisms rather than through directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism and farming, both of which are crucial in rural Ireland, will be affected by these <Col N="293" /> designations.  There must be coexistence between farming and environmental interests.  Farming and tourism can grow side by side with proper implementation of measures.  Too often particular interest groups try to confer on themselves exclusive rights to environmental and other matters.  The majority of farmers are keen conservationists and try hard to respect and improve the environment.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry made a disgraceful decision to suspend the control of farm pollution scheme which is necessary to ensure that farmers put in place adequate and proper on-farm facilities to offset the dangers of pollution.  Farmers need grant assistance to meet the huge costs involved in installing proper pollution control mechanisms on their farms.</P>

      <P>Since when?  I hope the Deputy is correct, but to my knowledge it is not.</P>
      <P>Many areas could be preserved by the rural and farming communities.  Farming has changed dramatically since our accession to the European Economic Community in 1973.  Thankfully, farm incomes have improved substantially and many farmers have availed of incentives such as the Common Agricultural Policy, direct income supports, limitations to quota regimes, increased production and intensification.  The efforts of farmers have contributed substantially to income generation in rural communities, but the livelihood of many is now at stake.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to defer implementation of the directive for three months, the minimum time necessary to ensure adequate consultation.  Will he ensure adequate consultation takes place with all interested parties?  The concerns of farmers about farming practices post designation time must be allayed and adequate compensation must be put in place to offset losses incurred by landowners.</P>

    <P>Farmers felt it would be a November or December dawn, but it appears it will be a February dawn when the regulations are made by the Minister.  Many farmers are concerned that it might bring a dull sunset, particularly for small farmers in the west and small family farmers in the Connemara region.</P>
    <P>We must look at a number of &ldquo;Cs&rdquo; in relation to this area.  For example, history has imprinted certain events on people's minds.  One thinks of the buoyancy and resoluteness of farmers who despite a great deal of bloodshed were able to survive Cromwell, the harsh penal laws and the brutal landlord system.  Their survival shows the commitment of the farming community over generations.  They feel under threat at the moment and while there will not be bloodshed, they are being attacked by the State sector.  Our business as politicians must be to articulate their fear and ensure the Minister takes our views into account when preparing the regulations.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that areas such as Connemara, which is rich in cultural and natural heritage, could easily be turned into a huge, beautiful national park where nobody lived.  Family farmers, who have subsisted on very small farms, are under threat and may not continue such farming in the future.  There is concern among farmers that they are under attack.  We are not talking here about ranchers or large farms of 100 or even 50 acres in that part of the west.  The farming carried out there is a necessity which ensures families can be educated and get on in life.  It is a type of farming which needs to be supported and it is hugely important.</P>
    <P>I do not believe farmers and environmentalists cannot live together.  There is such a &ldquo;C&rdquo; as coexistence. With courtesy, civility and co-operation they can all live together and preserve our very important natural heritage.</P>
    <P>I am not attacking officers of the Office of Public Works because they have done a huge <Col N="295" /> amount of important and vital work in preservation and conservation throughout the country.  However, we should recognise and discuss the current fear that officers of the Office of Public Works will wield huge powers under the law.  That is how it should be but it must be done in full and absolute consultation with the farming community.</P>

      <P>Consultation is very important because otherwise everybody is afraid, concerned and suspicious.  Wherever there is conflict &mdash; and there is the potential for conflict here &mdash; we must have compromise.  I am glad the Minister will open the appeals system, which was sadly lacking for so long, in this regard.  Those who deserve compensation will now have an appeals procedure through which they can operate.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I have been local authority members.  If a local authority decides to widen a road or take out a bad corner it has to acquire land by way of compulsory purchase order and pay compensation.  A great deal of compensation is paid in other areas of the public service and local government.  It is only natural, right and fair for compensation to be paid to farmers whose livelihoods are taken away.</P>
      <P>These family farmers are located in the most isolated areas along the western seaboard which is thinly populated and deprived of many luxuries.  I lived in that area for 20 years beside people who had to eke out a living on rocky farming land and where every arm of the State put blockades in their way.  Over the years we have ironed out many of the problems and difficulties and have simplified rules and regulations.  Why should we now impose further regulations which will drive more of those family farmers off the land?</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has given a public, formal commitment to the House that there will be consultation.  It is very important that there be compromise and compensation.  It will show that although the Office of Public Works has substantial powers, nobody need be afraid that they will be used to make impositions without consulting or compensating anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that we have had this debate.  As public representatives, in helping to draft and formulate legislation we can ensure that legislation is fair, that we consult those who will be affected by it and that it is implementable.  We <Col N="296" /> cannot ask people to sign a blank sheet of paper and hope for the best.</P>
    <P>I was delighted the Minister gave an undertaking last night that the regulations would not come into operation until the beginning of next February.  I think he will get a generous response from the farming community to that announcement because they are anxious to cooperate, consult the Minister and have a real input into those regulations.  I implore the Minister to ensure that consultation takes place in an atmosphere conducive to getting a result with which we can all live.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to Deputy de Valera for tabling the motion and creating the conditions where we can discuss this important matter.  This discussion will help to heighten public awareness of the importance of what is proposed under this directive.  It will also help to enlist the support of every citizen, including farmers, for the fundamental importance of what is at stake here in this important element of our natural heritage.</P>
      <P>Our natural heritage is an important element of our overall heritage.  It is the legacy of geological history and climate, tempered by the hand of man over the generations.  There is a clear obligation on us to cherish this legacy and to take all steps open to us to conserve, maintain and protect this vitally important part of our inheritance.</P>
      <P>The natural environment, with its flora and fauna, is particularly important to a country such as Ireland.  These features are among the main reasons for our flourishing tourism industry. Discerning tourists of the non weather dependent variety are the mainstay of our future tourism trade.  Therefore, apart from our moral obligation to protect items of key intrinsic value, it makes sound economic sense to protect and conserve our natural heritage.</P>
      <P>The formulation of Government policy on nature conservation is based mainly on EU directives.  How we transcribe those directives into law is fundamental.  I would prefer if we proceeded by way of legislation rather than regulation because of the nature of the process involved in making legislation in this House.  That process helps to engage media attention, to arouse public interest and it puts politicians in a position to give leadership to their communities on an issue.  Proceeding by way of regulation passes up that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success or otherwise of Ireland's efforts to implement Council Directive 92/43 EEC on the conservation of natural habitats, fauna and flora depends mainly on two factors, the degree of co-operation from the farming community and the degree of public education on the importance of the items we set out to conserve.  The need to preserve nature is widely recognised, particularly among our young citizens, because bio-diversity is under threat on a scale unknown since the beginning of human history.  A quarter of all <Col N="297" /> existing species are threatened with extinction within the next 30 years.  In Europe 22 per cent of higher plants, 42 per cent of mammals and 52 per cent of fish are believed to be under threat. Ecosystems and habitats are being constantly downgraded and destroyed.  Once they are lost or destroyed they are gone forever, they can never again be recreated and future generations of young people will be stripped of their natural birthright.  How we set about preserving and conserving our natural environment is very important.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased last night when the Minister outlined the three pillars of consultation, compromise and compensation under which he proposes to proceed.  I am also pleased that the time has been extended until February which will allow time and space for those three processes.</P>
    <P>The most important of those processes is consultation.  The obligation to act as custodians of our environment falls equally on every citizen, but citizens needs to be educated and alerted to have a sense of responsibility in regard to our environment.  The main custodians of our natural habitats are farmers or occupiers of land.  It is of critical importance that the Government should enter into dialogue with farmers that would lead to concordance where farmers and the Government would work in close co-ordination and co-operation.  To achieve that there must be a thorough programme of consultation from the outset.  Farmers must be fully informed, listened to and their concerns taken into account.  They must know their role is valued and critical to success.  There must not be a directive from the top or imposition from the outside.  This must be a joint venture in the truest and most important sense of the word.  We must put in place at local level programmes of agreed management.</P>
    <P>There must be compromise.  Landowners and land occupiers must be given the categoric assurance that no decision will be made without full consultation.  They must also be given the assurance from the outset that if a decision adversely affects their livelihoods they will have access to a clearly defined independent appeal system, a system under which their concerns will be taken into account before any decision is finally implemented.</P>
    <P>There must be adequate compensation in all cases of SAC designation at all levels.  That is critical to the success of the venture.  Such compensation must be worked out in advance so that farmers will know what is entailed, what they stand to gain as well as what will be required of them to make this a success.</P>
    <P>Armed with that three-pronged approach to the process, we are in a position to make a success of this proposal.  There is a good deal at stake and I am very anxious to play my part as vigorously as I can in assuring farmers that we will proceed in the proper manner, that we are conscious of all the uncertainty in farming at this time, and of the deep love and traditional appreciation of farmers for their land and the role they wish to play as <Col N="298" /> custodians of it.  That is important to us.  We should also assure farmers there is no intention on the part of any official or Minister to proceed without having enlisted their goodwill.  The Minister should let the consultation begin now.</P>

      <P>I am informed it has started but there is still a great deal of concern and the extent of the consultation that has taken place to date has not been adequate.  We must intensify our consultation and our listening process.  It is my aim that the directive should be incorporated into Irish law and implemented in such a manner that farmers and all other citizens can be proud of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to dwell for a few minutes on the three Cs, consultation, compromise and compensation, sought by farmers in the context of the regulations transposing the habitats directive into Irish law.  I will also emphasise once again the extent to which the Government and my Department have gone to ensure transparency and equity in these regulations.</P>
      <P>Regarding consultation sought by farming organisations, last night in the House we were accused of not consulting farmers and not being open.  That was categorically refuted by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, who detailed the extent of the consultation that has taken place and promised that further consultation would take place.</P>
      <P>When problems arose with farmers in the north Clare area full consultation took place.  The farming organisations, the farmers involved, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and officials from his Department, Deputies and other elected representatives from that area, officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and from REPS met.  Their concerns were noted and a compromise was reached. Consultation and compromise worked in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat taken aback by the ferocity of the attack made by Deputy de Valera on the Minister last night.  It was out of character for the Deputy to make that attack, at least since she came to County Clare.  Prior to that she was a loose cannon representing a Dublin constituency to such an extent that she brought about the downfall of one Taoiseach.  I do not know if she intends to bring about the downfall of this leader. She was very unfair to a Minister who, at all times, has tried to be accommodating in dealing with difficulties that arises in this area.  Deputies on the other side have expressed an understanding of those difficulties.  Attempts to whip up hysteria are not very becoming because the approach of consultation, compromise and compensation had been undertaken.  Even the tabling of this motion appears to represent a claim of a victory.  Arising out of meetings and <Col N="299" /> consultation, particularly in Galway, the Department decided to give full information on the matter by way of advertisements in newspapers.</P>
    <P>My Department has demonstrated its willingness to meet farmers.  Indeed, the Minister for Arts Culture and the Gaeltacht referred to the number of meetings with the leaders of the groups.  Since my appointment as Minister of State with special responsibilities for the west I have always met Deputies.  For example, I met Deputy Hughes at his request.  Given that most of these areas are designated in the west, farmers could have requested a meeting with me.  I met the leaders of the IFA on this matter and on other issues relating to the islands.  We have resolved some problems and are in the process of solving others. There is no lack of transparency on our side.</P>
    <P>I regret the hysteria that has been built up on this matter.  However, I was pleased that Deputy Michael Kitt acknowledged my commitment to the west during the period that I have been responsible for western development.  I live among and appreciate the concerns of farmers in the west and I, therefore, deplore references by Deputy de Valera to Cromwell in the context of the EU Habitats Directive.  Similarly, I fail to understand the inverse logic applied by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  She admitted that she was a member of a local authority which from time to time produces county development plans limiting the scope of development in areas, yet there was no protest in counties Mayo or Galway about the special areas designated in their respective county development plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the level of consultation and the commitment for its continuation.  It is worth reiterating the point made by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that without farmers, conservation cannot succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of compromise, Deputies are aware of our proposal announced last night to give farming interests a voice in examining objections to designations where these are based on scientific grounds.  The Government and my Department are committed to the greatest possible amount of transparency in the system, which this proposal will enhance.  However, we will not stop at that.  We will listen carefully to any concerns when the regulations come into effect and seek to respond to them in the best possible manner.  This contrasts with the directive issued on 19 December 1989 by EU Commissioner Mr. Flynn when he was a former <Col N="300" /> Minister which addressed a number of agricultural problems without any consultation. The First Schedule deals with agriculture, the use of uncultivated and semi-natural areas, waterways, management of agriculture, initial afforestation, land reclamation, poultry and pig rearing installations and sea water salmonisers. Given this, it is hollow to accuse this side of the House of lack of consultations.</P>
    <P>On the question of compensation I was pleased that Deputy de Valera recommended a cross departmental approach involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in seeking to resolve issues arising out of the directive.  This is what we have been doing and I am sure the Deputy will endorse our approach. Nobody in the House, or among the farming interests is naive enough to suggest that the issue of compensation is simple.  This is why we have pursued this approach while also involving farming representatives.  We are determined that the outcome will reflect an equitable and satisfactory resolution of the issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to outline the extent and nature of the consultations which my Department has undertaken with interested groups, especially farmers, on this directive.  The directive will be significant as regards farming and conservation interests.  In this respect we are engaged in a process that will blend nature, conservation and long-term sustainability of agriculture into the next century.  Against this backdrop individual farmers must and will play a key role.</P>
    <P>I must, however, express considerable concern and disquiet at the comments of some members of the Opposition on the content and tone of the motion in the name of Deputies de Valera and Lawlor.  These appear to be designed more to mislead and foment fear and anxiety among farmers than to recognise and endorse the considerable efforts of the Minister and my Department to put these regulations in place in a manner sensitive to the concerns of the various interests.</P>
    <P>In her attack on this side of the House, Deputy de Valera attempted to imply that there was no support for any initiative to relieve the plight of farmers in the west.  I was appointed Minister of State with special responsibility for western development as a result of meetings originally held by a core group of farmers in Loughrea. They considered that nobody represented them, that all the political parties had failed them and that the IFA and ICMSA did not represent their interests.  They were small farmers with small herds and small estates.  The matter has been studied since then.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, established a consultative group which examined the situation with the aid of EU money.  When the Western Development Partnership Board, which was established by Fianna Fáil, began to examine the problems of agriculture, conflicting interests displayed at <Col N="301" /> meetings resulted in a non too radical proposal by the board.  If this motion is designed to help the small farmers in the west and if there was genuine concern about them it would contain some expression about the way in which quotas have been leaked from the west to the south or to other areas, and the savage long-term loss to Connaught of liquid milk.  By contrast, the Government took action and ring-fenced quotas, despite opposition from some people still in the west.  We made our contribution to small farming.</P>
    <P>On the issue of additional quotas and equity, small farmers should get a disproportionate amount of aid for milk and through other headage payments.  However, the Opposition is not suggesting such measures.  Rather, it is trying to promote fear by implying that the Government is not doing its work.</P>

It is the Government's intention to look after farmers put at risk unnecessarily because of matters outside their control.</P>
      <P>This in contrast with Fianna Fáil's record in power.  It never provided for the payment of compensation to farmers in times of crisis.  The farming organisations should look at the record and see what efforts were made by Fianna Fáil in power to help in times of crisis.</P>

      <P>I was taken aback by the Minister's indignant response.  He seemed to imply that, in tabling the motion, we were not complying with normal criteria, in terms of what is acceptable.  He used the words &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;, &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; and &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;.  Does he not think he should have reported progress to the House?  He referred many times to meetings with the farming bodies and other interested groups. When will he give a lead and spell out his intentions so that they can respond?</P>
      <P>The directive was issued in June 1992 and the Minister has had two years in which to implement it.  We are heading into 1997 and the Minister is still talking about more meetings, the need to reach a compromise and the payment of compensation.  He should do the job he is supposed to do and dispel the confusion.  If farm leaders were adequately briefed, there would be no necessity to engage in a PR exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> The Minister said he consulted exhaustively with the various interested groups but there was no mention of county councils, the management and elected members of which will be given the task of implementing the regulations.  If guidelines were issued, the elected members would be in a position to speak in detail.</P>
    <P>The impression is being given that we are breaking new ground.  Deputy Ring and his colleagues pass through the Liffey Valley each time they travel to and from the west.  In 1984 I tabled a motion to have a special amenity area order introduced.  One was eventually signed in 1989 by Padraig Flynn when Minister for the Environment.  It was the first such order to be introduced, although it has its limitations.</P>
    <P>The Minister highlighted in great detail the problems that have been encountered in drawing up the regulations.  Is it not time he made decisions and, on the question of compensation, issued factual information?  As he said, there is a need for compromise.  The consultation phase is long over.  The time has come to take action.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are reviewing their development plans.  They need clear, concise and specific information as to what should be included.  People should know the implications. This is not just a rural issue, it has implications in every county.  We are at one on the need to protect our heritage and areas of scientific interest.</P>
    <P>In laying claim to various achievements the Minister omitted the words &ldquo;with all due modesty&rdquo; from his speech.  He should be prepared to accept constructive criticism.  We have a legitimate entitlement to table this motion to debate a matter which is being discussed at meetings throughout the country.  The motion calls on the Minister to provide clarification and resolve the compensation issue.</P>

      <P>Is é an rud atá raíte sa rún atá curtha ag Fianna Fáil faoi bhráid an Tí ná go bhfuil buairt orthu i measc rudaí eile go raibh i gceist na rialacháin maidir leis na ceantair SAC a thabhairt isteach gan iad a phlé i dTithe an Oireachtais nó i gceann de na coistí.  Tá rud amháin bunúsach agus is é sin gurb é seo amháin Oireachtas na tíre seo.  Is muide agus muide amháin ionadaithe tofa an phobail.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil bunús ag an Rialtas a rá go ndearna rialtais rompu agus rialtais ina raibh Fianna Fáil páirteach iontu rudaí a thabhairt isteach gan dul i gcomhairle leis an bpobal.</P>
      <P>Ach é sin ráite caithfear cuimhneamh go bhfuil sé ag tús chláir an Rialtais seo go mbeadh siad oscailteach, go mbeadh plé agus go ndéanfaí rudaí ar bhealaigh dhaonlathach.  Deir sé i gClar an Rialtais:</P>
      <P>The reform of our institutions at national and local level to provide service, accountability, transparency and freedom of information.  In doing so, we are committed to extending the opportunity for democratic participation by citizens in all aspects of public life.</P>

    <P>Tá mise tinn tuirseach de dhreamanna ar a bhfuil ionadaithe ó fheilméaraí iontu ag teacht chugam agus ag cur ceiste ormsa: &ldquo;Cad tá á dhéanamh agatsa faoi na SACs&rdquo;, agus gan a fhios agamsa go hoifigiúil cad iad na SACs mar níl an t-eolas ná an idirphlé á dhéanamh liomsa mar bhall tofa ar son an phobail.  Ag deireadh an lae tá siadsan freagrach dá mbaill.  Táimidne mar ionadaithe tofa freagrach don phobal uilig agus labhraimidne le chuile dhuine inár ndáilcheantar. Sin an rud atáimid ag iarraidh sa rún seo.  Táimid ag iarraidh go dtiocfar i gcomhairle linn agus go mbeimidne in Oireachtas Éireann ar an eolas faoin rud atá á bheartú do na daoine sá tír seo. Má tá éinne ag cur in aghaidh an phrionsabail sin tá siad ag cur in aghaidh an rud ar troideadh ar a shon le blianta fada.  An dara rud go gcaithfear a rá agus go gcaithfear a rá go soiléir ná go raibh <Col N="305" /> feilméaraí na tíre seo in mbun caomhnaithe leis na céadta bhlian agus gurbé an dream is mó a rinne dochar don nádúr sa tír seo ná an EU iad féin.  Sin an dream a rinne an scrios agus tá fhios ag an Aire é sin.  Rinne siad scrios leis an mbealach ar thug siad deontais isteach.  Ansin thug siad deontais fhoraoiseachta isteach agus rinne siad scrios.  Tuigeann chuile dhuine é sin.</P>
    <P>Roimhe sin bhí na feilméaraí ag déanamh na rudaí arbh cheart dóibh a dhéanamh.  Bhí siad ag tabhairt aire don talamh.  Bhí siad ag tabhairt na hoidhreachta ar aghaidh ó ghlún go glún.  Bhí sin a dhéanamh acu ar bhealach a bhí ar mhaithe leo féin, ar mhaithe leis an bhfeilméaracht agus leis na glúnta a bhí ag teacht in a ndiaidh.</P>
    <P>Tháinig na deontais agus rinneadh an scrios, ach in ionad an EU ag teacht agus a rá: &ldquo;tá brón orainn gur chuir muid amú sibh agus rinne muid scrios agus cad a dhéanfaimid faoi seo&rdquo; tháinig siad agus d'iompaigh siad thart agus chuir siad milleán ar na feilméaraí faoin rud go raibh siad féin ciontach as.  Is mór an náire é sin.</P>
    <P>Go bunúsach is í an fhadhb is mó a bhíonn SACs ag stracadh leí i gConamara ná go bhfuil an iomarca caorach ar na cnoic.  Tuigeann chuile dhuine é sin agus tuigeann siad cén fáth a bhfuil siad ar na cnoic.  Sin an t-aon bhealach atá ag na feilméaraí slí bheatha amach.  Tá réiteach an-shimplí ar an bhfadhb sin, ar ndóigh, agus is é sin ná 30 faoin gcéad breise a chur leis na deontais agus gan é a íoc ach ar 60 faoin gcéad den stoc.  Ní bheadh costas pingin ar an réiteach sin agus bheadh an feilméar chomh maith as agus a bhí riamh.  Ach ar nós an cheadúnas tiomána bhéadh an réiteach sin ró-éasca, ró-shimplí, róshaor do lucht an mhaorlathais a chaithfeadh é a scríobh síos i dtuairiscí móra páipéir chun a chruthú go bhfuil siad gníomhach i mbun ceiste.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agaim taréis an lae inniu go dtiocfaidh an tAire nuair a bheidh na Rialacháin seo faoi réir aige, os comhair an Tí seo nó os comhair ceann de na coistí Dála agus iad a phlé sula ndéanfar iad a achtú.  Mura ndéanfaidh an tAire é sin beidh sé ag séanadh bun-chearta an daonlathais ar an bpobal.</P>
    <P>There is much I wish to say about this subject but, unfortunately, my time is limited.  There is much talk about compromise and appeal boards <Col N="306" /> but before people are fooled, we should be clear about what is involved.  A regulation will be made declaring an area on SAC but on the basis of the proposals, a farmer may only appeal it on scientific grounds regardless of how much it interferes with his economic circumstances.  I presume the Minister has done his scientific homework and unless the farmer can come up with massive scientific information and employ experts to disprove the Minister's evidence, there is no appeal.</P>
    <P>We should also be clear about compensation. We have created the fact of life that most farmers depend on grants for forestry or farming to make a living from the land in the west.  This is how matters have been organised and the Minister and I know there will be no compensation for loss of entitlement to grants.  Most activities are now so organised that they are not viable without grants.  There is no need to pay compensation for the majority of the loss of income because most of it is sourced by grants.  Farmers who might wish to plant trees cannot claim compensation because it is not paid in that case.</P>
    <P>I understand much of the compensation will be paid through REPS, which will last for five years. What is the deal for farmers who decide to remain outside REPS until they receive their compensation?  Will they then be entitled to take part in REPS as free citizens like everybody outside SACs?  When the Minister finishes drafting the regulations, I ask him to afford the House the courtesy, which was promised in the Programme for Government, of bringing them to the House or a select committee for discussion before they are enacted.  This is a democratic request which would ensure all the issues are thrashed out.  Deputies are the only people who can claim to represent all the people in our constituencies and if that was done, it might be possible to allay the existing fears.</P>
    <P>As a TD for Galway West, it was not until yesterday that I received official notification from the Minister, the Department or the Government about SACs.  As a people's representative, I should not have to rely on organisations to give me second-hand information on proposals for my constituency.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of the Minister of State.  I observe that amendment No. 6 is related and I suggest we discuss amendments Nos. 1 and 6 together, by agreement, if that is satisfactory.  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5A.&mdash;Every rule made by the Board under section 5 and every regulation made by the Minister under section 7C shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the rule or regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the rule or regulation is laid before it, the rule or regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments address a point raised by Deputy Woods on laying rules made by the Adoption Board before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Adoption Acts do not currently contain any such requirement.  Rules made by the board should be laid before both Houses and be subject to annulment by negative resolution, as should any regulations made by the Minister under the Acts.  Accordingly, amendment No. 1 provides for laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas rules made by the board under the amended section 5 of the Adoption Act, 1952 as well as regulations to be made by the Minister under the new section 7C of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to require that any future regulations made by the Minister under section 9 (3) of the Adoption Act, 1991 are also laid before each House of the Oireachtas. <Col N="309" /> The power of the Minister to make regulations under that section relates to the proof of foreign adoptions.  I am advised this matter cannot be dealt with by way of a single amendment and two amendments are necessary because provision for making ministerial regulations is already contained in the 1991 Act.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is enacted the Minister will also have power to make regulations under the 1952 Act governing the care of children by registered adoption societies pending their placement for adoption.  As the 1952 Act predates the 1991 Act, separate provision must be made for laying regulations before both Houses under the two Acts.  These amendments more than meet the point made by Deputy Woods and they will ensure openness and transparency in the preparation of rules and regulations under the Adoption Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking my point on board because it is important that there be openness and transparency in this area.  Many Members of the House are concerned about the way in which the adoption laws are being implemented.  In our view they are too restrictive and relate to a past era, particularly when one considers the number of children available for adoption in Ireland compared to the number available abroad.  It is likely that in future children coming up for adoption will be from countries other than Ireland.  That is evident from the statistics given on the earlier Stages of the Bill.</P>
      <P>When we pass legislation concerning adoptions we must ensure that its objectives are implemented by the Adoption Board and by the Minister and his Department.  The interpretation of the legislation and carrying it through into regulations is a very important aspect of implementing the will of Members of this House. Our impression is and the court cases which have been held indicate that a very narrow interpretation has been taken of the views expressed here.  We want to facilitate people in adoption cases.  We want to be helpful, considerate and kind.  We realise the officials implementing the views expressed in the House and carried through in the legislation are bound by legislation as it is passed but far too often legislation is interpreted in a more restrictive way than was intended by the Oireachtas.  For this reason I am happy the Minister is responding to this need and ensuring the regulations and statutory instruments will be laid before the House where they may be annulled if such a resolution is passed by either House within the following 21 days without prejudicing the validity of anything previously done hereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on taking up this issue and on the detailed way in which he has followed it through in these two amendments.  It is the right thing to do.  It will be helpful and will ensure the House stays in touch with developments.  The House will be informed, will <Col N="310" /> know what is happening and will be able to express a contrary view if necessary.  We are very happy to support these two amendments.</P>

      <P>I recognise the necessity for flexibility but I also emphasise the importance of certainty and permanency.

      <P>In page 5, line 38, to delete &ldquo;his attitude towards&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;whether or not he objects to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is identical to an amendment Deputy Woods agreed to withdraw when this Bill was before the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  I indicated I had difficulty with the amendment because it would have a narrow focus and would not reflect cases where the father supports the mother's decision to have the child adopted.  However, I gave an undertaking to the committee that I would give further consideration to the matter.  Amendment No. 2 is the result of that consideration.  It satisfactorily addresses Deputy Woods' misgivings about the present wording of the paragraph in question as well as meeting my concern that any revision should be broad enough to comprehend non-objecting fathers.  The Deputy might therefore agree to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 26 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(b) the adoption has, for so long as it is in force, substantially transferred, under the law of the place where it was effected, to the adopters, the rights and duties of guardianship, or parental authority over the child,&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the substantive issue which we have discussed for quite some time in this House.  The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate parents in making foreign adoptions.  We have a problem, however.</P>
      <P>We are happy the Minister has in the body of the Bill dealt with the issues in relation to the adoption of Chinese children.  That is a very progressive step on the part of the Minister. However, legally adopted children living in Ireland will not be recognised here because the Government refuses to recognise what are termed ordinary adoptions made in a number of countries, including France, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Paraguay and Peru.  These adopted children of Irish couples are consequently prevented from having an Irish passport or from inheriting the family home, farm or property. They can be disadvantaged in applying for schooling and medical services.  These issues have been raised with us by parents on behalf of these children who are living here at this time.</P>
      <P>The Adoption (No. 2) Bill will continue this discrimination and discourage Irish couples who wish to adopt abroad by refusing to recognise these ordinary adoptions.  This is still a very serious problem for the families concerned and particularly for the children concerned.  We strongly favour the recognition of foreign adoptions on a basis that is both generous and realistic.  The Minister must be realistic and there must be a high degree of certainty in what is done.  Amendment No. 4 effectively proposes lowering the threshold.  It would allow for the recognition of these foreign adoptions and would put an end to this discrimination and facilitate both the children and their parents.</P>
      <P>We feel very strongly that this amendment should be made.  It would solve the outstanding problems and be widely welcomed by the children concerned and their adoptive parents. Amendment No. 5 is an alternative to amendment No. 4 and reads:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 26 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(b) the adoptees, under Foreign Simple Adoption Decrees shall have the same legal entitlements in effect as those arising from an adoption effected by an Irish Adoption Order up to and until the birth mother <Col N="312" /> exercises those rights, which have not been severed completely, in the appropriate Court of Law,&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have had a great deal of discussion with people who are concerned about this area, parents and their advisers and we do not mind which way the Government goes about it as long as it makes it possible for these adopted children to live here as Irish citizens.  The parents recognise there may be some weaknesses, but they want to be facilitated and are very realistic in their approach.  I know the Minister would want them to be realistic.  We do not mind whether the Minister takes amendment No. 4, or amendment No. 5 or puts forward his own amendment.  He has not yet put forward an amendment and that is disappointing and a little surprising.  There is still time.  The Minister might think again about the issue before the Bill goes to Seanad Éireann and consider the effect of what we are doing on these families.  Perhaps he would try to be a little more generous and flexible while maintaining certain basic and essential principles. There has been great difficulty in getting information about the detail of adoptions in some countries.  We are told that in some cases there is sufficient legal certainty to recognise adoptions here.  We could take action by recognising certain adoptions and by saying in what circumstances we will do so.</P>
    <P>We hoped the Minister would bring forward proposals to deal with this issue.  It may be that the Minister has not had time to do so and needs more information.  I understand he has been seeking further information.  I have a letter from the adoptive parents of the Paraguayan children who have been trying very hard to have the matter resolved.  One group sought assistance from our Embassy in Buenos Aires.  The preliminary result of our Ambassador's investigations of the question gives the lie to the custody order disparagement.  They are so radically at variance with the interpretation upon which the Minister bases his claim to be unable to extend recognition to simple adoptions as to raise fundamental questions about the reliability and the validity of information and advice which is given to the Minister.  My understanding is that the Minister is taking further advice, that he has initiated a process to try to get further advice in Paraguay and to turn every stone to try to resolve the issue. That might have suggested the Bill might be postponed to give the Minister and his officials an opportunity to fully investigate the matter.  I ask the Minister, when he has the extra information, to publish in full all the legal advice he has received from Irish sources and in relation to the accommodation of simple adoptions within an extended system of recognition.  Will he say what view he now takes of the adequacy of the legal advice on which he relied on Second and Committee Stages of the Bill, given the preliminary views of our Ambassador in Buenos Aires on the status of Paraguayan simple <Col N="313" /> adoption decrees?  Will the Minister also inform the House what action he has taken in response to the communication to him of the preliminary results of the Ambassador's investigations in Paraguay, because there is a suggestion that these adoptions could be recognised here?  In addition will the Minister provide an assessment of whether, in the light of the Ambassador's initial interpretation of the status of Paraguayan simple adoptions, they would now be recognised under section 10 of the Bill?  I accept that the Minister may not yet be in a position to fully confirm that and may need to take fuller advice on the issue. For that reason this amendment should have been postponed until the Minister had an opportunity to clarify these issues.  If the Minister feels the adoptions would not be recognised in the present circumstances, will he consider introducing an amendment which would clear up the outstanding issues here?</P>
    <P>We feel strongly that this question should be addressed and settled here and now.  It may be that the Paraguayan simple adoptions can be recognised here if there is sufficient certainty regarding the legal arrangements in Paraguay.  If that is the case, why should they not be included on the list of recognised adoptions?</P>
    <P>We are proposing an amendment on Report Stage which would overcome this problem.  We ask the Minister to consider tabling an amendment even at this late stage.  If he is not prepared to do this, will he again look at the question between now and the taking of the Bill in the Seanad to see if it is possible to give these children the recognition we want to give them? It may be that there is legal certainty about the adoptions and the Minister will have no difficulty. I understand the Minister is still taking advice in Paraguay, and for that I commend him.  However, we are pushing ahead when it would be preferable to have the matter resolved before finalising Report Stage.  If this cannot be done I ask the Minister to consider introducing an amendment in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed my amendment had been included among the amendments tabled by Deputy Woods but, as we have so little time, I will address the Deputy's amendment.  There is a difficulty regarding the recognition of foreign adoptions.  The amendments before us try to get around the practical difficulties encountered by the adoptive parents of these children.  We had a long discussion about this on Committee Stage when we heard that there were difficulties regarding succession rights, inheritance, taxation etc.  There are also practical difficulties that may not occur to people.  For example, a baby may not be able to travel with its adoptive parents because of technical and legal difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we tried to impress on the Minister &mdash; and he was not unwilling to listen &mdash; that we must try to find a way around such practical difficulties.  We are not talking about a huge number of cases.  It does not matter whether <Col N="314" /> we are talking only about one or two because the problems are very real to the people involved. They have adopted children within the law and now have a family and do not wish these children to be taken away from them.  I cannot conceive any way in which the Minister would want that to happen.  If the Minister is examining the situation we will not press these amendments but, if not, the least we can do on behalf of these people is to press the amendments before us.  It is terribly important that the plight of these people is recognised.</P>
    <P>It gives me no satisfaction to say I received the same correspondence as Deputy Woods from the parents of adopted Paraguayan children.  I was very disturbed by their interpretation of the Minister's attitude.  Will he answer the various questions they put to him and say what simple adoption actually means?  The Minister said he was advised an ordinary or simple adoption decree amounts to little more than a custody order.  The preliminary advice to us from our Ambassador in South America &mdash; admittedly it is a difficult and slow process to get this information &mdash; is that is not the case.  If that line can be pursued by the Minister this would alleviate the grave difficulties facing these people.  I will curtail my contribution on these two amendments to give the Minister an opportunity to reply and I hope it will be positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It was necessary for me to oppose two identical amendments put down by Deputy Woods when the Bill was before the select committee.  For the benefit of the House I will again set out the reasons it is not possible to recognise simple adoptions as full adoptions.  A statutory recognition system is confined to adoptions granted abroad which have a broadly similar legal effect to an Irish adoption in terms of the termination of the rights and duties of the birth parents and the creation of a new permanent legal parent-child relationship between the child and the adoptive parents.</P>
      <P>Since the effect of the recognition of foreign adoption is to accord it the same legal status as an Irish adoption order, it follows from this that the foreign adoption must have similar characteristics.  However, this is not the case where simple or ordinary adoptions are concerned.  Such an adoption does not sever the existing legal relationship between the child and the birth parents.  While parental authority passes to the adopters, the rights and duties derived from the blood relationship are not superseded. The child and the natural family thus maintain certain fundamental legal ties with one another.  I have been advised that it is not possible to recognise simple adoptions because to do so would be to accord the adoptions a legal status beyond that which they were ever intended to have under the laws of the countries where they were granted and beyond that which the birth parents would have given their consent to under those laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> I reiterate that in countries such as Paraguay where dual systems of simple and full adoption are operated, it is for the relevant adoption authority to decide which type of adoption decree is the appropriate one to make by reference to the provisions of its internal adoption laws.  Since those laws make a clear distinction between the two types of adoption decree that may be made in respect of a child, I have been advised we must respect that distinction and not seek to accord a simple adoption a legal status beyond that which it has under the law of the country where it was granted.</P>
    <P>Our adoption laws have evolved on the basis that they protect the interests of the child and respect the rights of the birth parents as set out in the Constitution.  In the case of inter-country adoptions, it is proper that our laws must give the same respect to the rights of birth parents abroad as they give to Irish parents.  It is not that long <Col N="316" /> ago since Irish children were being sent to the United States and elsewhere for adoption.  Recent revelations have brought home to us the anguish and distress suffered by some of the mothers of the children concerned.  We must learn from that unfortunate experience and ensure our laws do not undermine the remaining rights vested in birth parents abroad whose children are brought here on foot of simple adoptions.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General read a newspaper reference to Judge Lynch sitting on the Special Criminal Court at the end of October 1996.  No one brought the matter to his attention.</P>
      <P>On 29 October 1996 there was a court report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of proceedings in the Special Criminal Court on 28 October in which Judge Lynch was mentioned.  The Attorney General thinks it is likely that this was the newspaper report in which he saw the reference to Judge Lynch.  The Attorney General cannot say when he may have read the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that if the Attorney General read the report casually in the newspaper and it was not brought to his attention, then in all probability he read it the day the newspaper was published, 29 October?  Will he explain why three days elapsed before even a letter was apparently written, which took another four days to reach its destination? Will the Minister of State agree that if the Attorney General read the report on Tuesday, 29 October he would have been aware immediately of its significance as it told him that the worst calamity he had foreseen a month earlier had taken place?</P>

      <P>I outlined the Attorney General's position in my reply.  He read a newspaper reference to Judge Lynch sitting on the Special Criminal Court at the end of October 1996 and no one brought the matter to his attention.  I further stated that on 29 October there was a court report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of proceedings in the Special Criminal Court on 28 October in which Judge Lynch was mentioned.  The Attorney General thinks it is likely that this was the newspaper report in which he saw the reference to Judge Lynch.  He cannot say when he may have read the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Minister of State has given an evasive reply.  If the Attorney General, who is an intelligent and bright man, read in the newspaper that Judge Lynch was presiding in the Special Criminal Court and knew two months previously that he had been removed as a judge of that court then it must immediately have impacted on him that a disaster was at hand and that his worst fears had come to pass.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say that the Attorney General does not know when he read the report. Surely it is engraved in his memory when the disaster became apparent to him.  Anyone in his position would have lifted the phone and asked if the newspaper report was true and attempted to establish the facts.  Will the Minister of State agree it is totally unacceptable for him to say that the Attorney General does not recollect when this first came to his attention, bearing in mind that if he read the report on the day it was published he allowed three days to elapse before he wrote a letter?  He did not send that letter by courier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The consultation process carried out by the Commission and the two administrations has emphasised the need to combat social exclusion to achieve all the objectives of the Peace and Reconciliation Programme.  The Government has been at pains to ensure that, following consultation, schemes in the Border area receive the main part of their remit.  I believe the money will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware this issue must be voted on again by the budget committee and by the Parliament?  Given that a Labour member not only voted in favour of the £78 million being taken out of the programme but defended that decision on radio, what measures are the Government parties taking to ensure Irish MEPs from the Government side vote in favour of the money being restored?  The Fine Gael MEP did not participate in the budget committee. What steps are the Government parties taking to ensure that their members in the European Parliament vote in favour of restoring the money to the fund?</P>

      <P>The chairman of the budget committee of the European Parliament, Mr. Samland, is quoted as saying the Irish side did not push hard enough in this respect and as a result the committee slashed £78 million from next year's budget.  It was not Members from this side of the House who undermined confidence in the programme.  Members from the Government side did not use the EU Presidency to ensure this fund was not slashed.  Now that we are back on the right track and that the MEP from the Labour Party has been brought on line, what steps have been taken by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, to rap on the knuckles those involved and to ensure they do the right thing on behalf of the Border counties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <P>A major contributing factor to the perception about slowness of expenditure is the extent to which implementation of the various measures has been devolved to the intermediary funding bodies and the particular emphasis on actions to combat social exclusion.  Many of the initial submissions were not properly focused and guidance had to be given to address that problem. Members opposite are saying that Structural Funds allocated to build advance factories in Border areas should be used in that way.  As I pointed out at the outset, they are the people who negotiated the terms of this programme and when the application for Structural Funding was being made, the IDA, the body charged with responsibility for advance factories, did not make a requisition for funding for advance factories in Border areas.  Far from it, it pulled back from that area.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the intermediary bodies are funded by way of global grants on foot of legal agreements.  Yesterday, Deputy Bertie Ahern complained that legal agreements were not being sought before grants were made, but it is being sought.  The present forecast is that all the funding will be committed by the end of 1997 and I am confident that will happen.</P>

Is the Minister of State aware that ADM is responsible for allocating £18.7 million and that until 16 October 1996 only £1.57 million of that money had been allocated?  Could the Taoiseach, <Col N="324" /> the Tánaiste or the Government not advise ADM to make more progress with this money before it is lost for the spurious excuses which have already been made?</P>

      <P>Part of the agreement was reached at the insistence of the EU Commission which wanted bodies such as ADM to administer these programmes.  This is being done at the request of the Commission.  Other countries in addition to the EU supply money to this peace initiative, they also wanted reassurances which they got by giving bodies such as ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency the opportunity to tackle social exclusion, which is the aim of the programme.</P>

    <P>The Opposition Deputies want the application of Structural Funds to create an economic miracle for the Border area.  When the Deputy's party was making an application for Structural Funds on a national level there was no mention in the IDA programme of advance factories for the <Col N="325" /> Border area.  It arose only when somebody in Strabane, or another town north of the Border, slipped through the net and got an advance factory.  Suddenly, every public representative south of the Border started screaming for funds to build new factories.</P>
    <P>As I said on a previous occasion, every time I visit county councils in Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal or any other northern area, I never hear the whinging and complaints I hear from Border Deputies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>My appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for western development and rural renewal was clear recognition by the Government of the importance of rural renewal issues as an integral part of public policy.  It was also a direct response to the wishes of rural communities, particularly in the west, to continue to live among family and friends in vibrant and forward looking communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I am overseeing a number of important initiatives arising from the publication of the action plan for western development which has been prepared by the Western Development Partnership Board.  The partnership board proposes that the action plan will form the basis of strategic and coherent action for economic and <Col N="327" /> social development based on achieving population stability by the end of the decade, on a county by county basis, at 1991 census levels.  In response to the specific questions put down, the following is the position.</P>
    <P>In view of the need to ensure that any new structures fit with existing and proposed structures, particularly in relation to economic and social development at local level, the Government has decided to establish the Western Development Commission as a limited company rather than as a statutory body.  The proposed commission will replace the Western Development Partnership Board on expiry of its term of office on 31 December 1996.</P>
    <P>The commission's central function will be to complement and add value to the activities of the agencies that currently operate in the western region, particularly the local authorities, and to promote the economic and social development of the region through the various activities which it undertakes.  Detailed arrangements for the establishment of the commission, including its composition, terms of reference and specific functions, are at an advanced stage and the Government will announce these in due course.</P>
    <P>The Government considers there is a niche for long-term venture capital and equity for developing businesses in the western region, and that the establishment of such a fund will be central to achieving the goals of the action plan.  The Government will honour the commitment it has made, that it is prepared to make available up to £25 million to the fund over the next six years. The fund will be set up and managed on a professional and commercial basis and will draw on resources progressively from the Exchequer, the EU, the European Investment Bank and private depositors.  The putting in place of matching private sector funding will be a priority of the new commission, while the possibility of accessing appropriate EU funding is being explored by my Department.  As with the Western Development Commission, arrangements for the establishment of the Western Investment Fund are at an advanced stage, and I expect to be in a position to announce details of the fund, including its management and the composition of the capital to be made available, shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that a study on settlement patterns in rural areas which the National Economic and Social Council has been asked to undertake will provide an important perspective on population trends and their implications for rural communities.  The outcome of this study will inform the Government on future policies to be pursued to address problems of population imbalance, particularly in the west. I hope that the NESC report will be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed that I should coordinate discussions between the partnership <Col N="328" /> board and the relevant Departments and agencies on the various indicative proposals for sectoral development contained in the action plan.  A number of exploratory meetings to discuss the sectoral proposals have already taken place and further meetings are being arranged.  These meetings are important in assisting the partnership board to develop its indicative proposals and to identify the strategic priorities in the key sectors identified in the action plan which will be addressed by the Western Development Commission on its establishment. The discussion documents submitted by the Western Development Partnership Board have been an extremely valuable and informative input in assessing the current position regarding the many sectoral issues pertinent to the western region.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the agriculture and fisheries sectors for the western region, I have established a working group of officials from the relevant Departments with the objective of exploring how best agriculture and fisheries policies might be developed to support less intensive family farms and small scale marine enterprises.  The Western Development Partnership Board has been invited to prepare proposals in this regard, for consideration by the working group.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply.  I am glad we reached these important questions on western development, which have been on the Order Paper for some time.  I wish to ask the Minister of State three questions and my colleagues, representing western constituencies, also wish to ask him a number of questions.  Will the Minister request the committee examining these matters to consider closely CIE's proposals to close the freight line service in the west, which would be contrary to the spirit of the bishops' report on the west, <i>A Crusade for Survival</i>?  I dealt with this important matter when I was Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that this proposal is part and parcel of the Government's neglect of the west which is clear in so many policy areas?  I understand from what he said that forestry expansion and the location of some of the processing plants in the south east would create new freight services on the rail lines, but that does not appear to be happening.  Will the Minister of State agree that, as part of the overall plan for the west, there is a case for a rail link between cities such as Galway and Limerick and the town of Westport?  Will he indicate if CIE intends to close the new passenger rail service to Ennis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments about my detailed reply.  When he was Minister for Finance negotiating Structural Funds and how they should be allocated, he had an opportunity to provide aid for the western <Col N="329" /> corridor, for the road or the rail network but his Department failed to do that.  It has been left to us to work out a system with Iarnród Éireann to ensure that the line survives.  I note that most of the moneys under the Structural Funds are being allocated to the east.  Why is that the case?  Is it because Deputy Ahern was Minister for Finance when the Structural Funds were negotiated and is he claiming that as his achievement?</P>
      <P>Regarding the west and the provision of this rail line, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has given a categoric assurance that the rail line will remain open.  Mr. Waters, the general manager of Iarnród Éireann, gave me an assurance that while there was concern about the viability of the line he would do his best to ensure it remained open.  Since then we have received reassurance from the Minister in that regard and I am satisfied with that.  The former Government's planning did not indicate any degree of confidence in this line.  Expression of such confidence was necessary when we applied for Structural Funds.  Why were funds not allocated to aid people in rural areas, given that additional Cohesion Funding was given to aid peripheral areas?  Unfortunately, the western roads and western rail links were excluded.  We must press Iarnród Éireann that savings achieved by being able to utilise Structural Funds to upgrade the main lines must be reinvested in the western rail line.  That is what I am pursuing.</P>

      <P>In 1995 eight major investment projects attracted by the IDA located in the region from Donegal to Clare.  However, if Galway is taken out of the equation, only two of those projects were located in the region for which the Minister of State has responsibility. Why is that so?  Regarding the freight line service, the Minister of State is aware I attended a meeting in Gort on Friday, 8 November at which we heard about an undated letter &mdash; that appears to be a new feature of the Government &mdash; from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, but it did not give a commitment that the line will remain open.

In a reply given to Deputy Treacy, the Minister assured him that the line will remain open.

CIE claims the line is uneconomic, but we will consider how we can improve the viability of the line.  As a contribution to the economics of the west, I have no doubt that the line has a major role to play.</P>
      <P>On the issue of attracting industry into the area, most of the industry attracted to this country has located on the east coast because of the high profile given to that region.  I have urged communities in the west to look at the profile of their region.  Aid is available now which can be utilised through community effort to draw up a development plan and to highlight valuable locations.  I have attended meetings in the west to be told that the greatest amount of money for investment is in the nearest Bank of Ireland or AIB branch.  They wonder about the commitment to their town while they allow people like Deputy Ahern to utilise such money on the east coast or, as Deputy Ó Cuív said invest it in pension funds in Australia, New Zealand or elsewhere.  There is a BES scheme to establish advance factories in any part of the west.  If the anxiety for partnership exists in the west why has nobody taken it up?</P>

      <P>We do not have a great track record with regard to the development of venture capital.  NADCORP made plenty of long-term venture capital available nationally, yet only one or two projects utilised it.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, abolished NADCORP.  There is a difficulty in immediately identifying viable projects.  It takes time, which is why it is most important to establish a proper and constructive western commission that will seek these investment opportunities in a constructive manner.</P>

What action does he propose to take to improve the roads infrastructure, which is now in crisis?  Sligo town is in my constituency.

      <P>I met the chief executive of the National Roads Authority and we discussed the western region.  I am fully up to date and have made strong representations to the Minister for the Environment to ensure that if additional funds are needed they can be diverted for the completion of western roads.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to focus on western areas.  I did not agree with the system of radial roads going into Dublin.  An eastern and a western corridor is essential for the development of the economy of the west but the region must first develop itself. However, I have inherited the proposals before me.  I am doing my best to impress on those who take the view that economic return is the only criterion by which national roads can be developed.  Social exclusion should also be a criterion.</P>
      <P>When the previous Government, of which Deputy Joe Walsh was a member, sought EU Structural Funds, the criterion it established for road development was economic return.  This is how matters have developed.  Some of the road improvements, including the bypasses on the radial roads, have been magnificent.  The time taken to travel from the west to Dublin has improved enormously, which should be commercially good.</P>

      <P>The total value of bills in respect of legal costs from solicitors acting on behalf of married women who have initiated legal proceedings arising from the delay in according them equal treatment under the Equal Treatment Directive in cases in which costs have been paid to date is £4.4 million.  The amount paid in these cases following negotiations by the Chief State Solicitor and in some instances, on adjudication by the Taxing Master, which include two cases in which a further balancing payment may have to be made, is £2.308 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the delay in implementing the Directive, legal proceedings were initiated in 500 cases involving more than 16,000 plaintiffs and the entitlements of the majority of married women involved have been determined under the arrangements which I introduced in 1995 to give full effect to the High Court decision of 3 <Col N="332" /> February 1995.  Prior to that, however, settlements were made in a number of cases during the period 1991 to 1994 &mdash; the Deputy is aware I was not the Minister concerned &mdash; which were subject to conditions as to confidentiality and I have been advised that because of the terms upon which these cases were settled, I should not, without their consent, make known the names of the solicitors involved in these cases.  There are 12 such solicitors who received costs of £1.58 million covering 60 cases involving 2,900 plaintiffs.  There are 52 cases in which legal costs have been paid in which this legal difficulty does not arise, however, and following is a tabular statement detailing the amounts paid in respect of legal costs and the names of the solicitors involved in these cases, which involved varying numbers of plaintiffs.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to make known as much detail as I can in relation to the payment of legal costs in the interests of proper management of public funds and the protection of Exchequer interests. In this latter context details of all payments made to solicitors in respect of legal costs and the names of the solicitors involved, including those I am not at liberty to name, are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General in line with normal practice.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on a number of occasions in the public interest and to ensure accountability to the House in respect of taxpayer's money.  It is unacceptable that substantial amounts of such money amounting to £2.3 million, have been paid out.  However, we are now told we cannot ascertain who was allocated the sum of £1.5 million.  The Minister said his legal advice precludes him from giving the House the details of the names.  Is he in a position to publish this legal advice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not normal practice to provide the legal advice concerned.  The Computroller and Auditor General will have the opportunity to audit the expenditure in this case. It is not a question of the taxpayer or the administration being unaware of these solicitors. The Deputy was a part of the Government when these confidentiality clauses were sought and obtained.  They were agreed prior to my becoming Minister.  I objected to the fact that they were on a confidentiality basis when in Opposition.  Nevertheless, as Minister, I am obliged to comply with the legal advice I have received.</P>
      <P>I am in an invidious position regarding this matter.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will have the opportunity to audit in full the amounts paid and will know the identities of the solicitors concerned.  I have arranged for the solicitors concerned to be written to pointing to the position in which we find ourselves in this House and asking if they would be willing to waive the confidentiality clause.  I am strongly advised this can be done only with their consent, that I am not in a position to do so unilaterally.</P>

While the term &ldquo;openness, transparency and accountability&rdquo; has been butchered out of all recognition, we are entitled to receive this information.  On the amounts paid to individual solicitors &mdash; in one case £606,000 &mdash; has the Department carried out an audit to see if the taxpayer got value for money?</P>

      <P>The decision as to the amount to be paid is not made by the Department of Social Welfare, rather it is made, in most cases, by the Chief State Solicitor's office and, where the Chief State Solicitor's office or the solicitor concerned is not satisfied, by the Taxing Master. The bills presented to the Chief State Solicitor's office amounted to £4.4 million.  The amount agreed to be paid out was £2.308 million, giving a saving of more than £2 million.  Significant savings, therefore, have been made through careful monitoring by the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Taxing Master.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, whose office is responsible for ensuring all public expenditure is properly accounted for, will have full access to information on the amounts paid to solicitors, including those who decided to avail of the confidentiality clause, and the basis on which they were paid.  I am sure he will publish a report on the matter in due course.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the research, which was commissioned by the Department and is being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, will be finalised and published by the ESRI before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Also being completed by the ESRI is a report into poverty in the 1990s in Ireland.  This study utilises the 1994 Living in Ireland Survey to provide an updated picture of the extent of poverty in Ireland and who is affected.  Both reports from part of a substantial programme of research being carried out at the ESRI sponsored by the Department of Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has been made in recent budgets in bringing rates of payment up to the minimum identified by the Commission on Social <Col N="335" /> Welfare.  Increases in this year's budget brought all social welfare payments to the minimum of 92 per cent of the main rate, after compensating for inflation.  The widow's-widower's contributory pension reached the main rate when the budget increases were implemented in June.  The bulk of the remaining payments are now at least 95 per cent of the main rate.  As the Deputy will be aware, the rate for contributory old age pension stands at 110 per cent.</P>
    <P>Together with the national anti-poverty strategy, these ESRI studies and other key reports, such as that of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare, will contribute to informing public debate on the issue of poverty, while also providing a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current rates of social welfare entitlements and the standard of living of social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>In its programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> published at the end of 1994, the Government stated specifically that it would commission the ESRI to carry out a review.  On 22 February this year the Minister indicated that this review would be completed by mid-year.  We have now been informed that it will be completed by the end of the year.  Is the Minister taking the issue of poverty seriously?  We were given an indication of the extent of the problem last night on television and radio by the chairman of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who said the position was getting worse, not better, in spite of the country's good economic performance.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the ESRI in its review of the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare refer to a review of the calculations of the minimum adequate income rates, including equivalent scales, using the Commission on Social Welfare methodologies and other appropriate methodologies which may have been developed subsequently taking account of revised macro-economic and other <Col N="336" /> sources, including the ESRI's household income survey, 1994.  It was asked to compare these calculations with current social welfare weekly payment rates and Commission on Social Welfare rates updated in line with trends in the CPI and net earnings in the period since the publication of the commission's report.  The evaluation should take into account secondary benefits, widely defined, in the context of defining adequacy.  It was asked to evaluate the extent to which adoption of the newly calculated rates would improve the effectiveness of social welfare payments in reducing income inequality compared with current rates and CSW rates updated by the CPI.  It was asked to carry out an analysis of the likely impact of implementing the newly calculated rates, taking account of secondary benefits, on incentives to work and to discuss the wider context of promoting employment opportunities and economic efficiency.  It was asked to consider the appropriate method of updating payment rates in the future.  The cost of this research is £42,000.  I expect the ESRI's report will be available shortly.</P>

      <P>Where a pension book is returned to the Department, together with relevant documentation concerning the death of a pensioner, payment of pension due is normally issued to the appropriate person within one week of receipt in the Department.  New systems and procedures were recently put in place to ensure this speed of response.  In all, 6,000 cases are dealt with each year and the system is operating satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Where books are returned without any supporting documentation, inquiries must be made to establish the reason for the return of the books and in these cases payments, where due, are made as quickly as possible after the necessary information is received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the surviving spouse of a deceased pensioner has an automatic entitlement to a contributory widow's or widower's pension, the new entitlement is normally issued within six weeks in respect of which the payments after death are made.  Pension books are usually <Col N="337" /> returned to the Department's offices in Sligo or Longford, either directly or through the local post office.  People can contact their local social welfare office if they wish where the staff will advise on the documentation needed and do all they can to ensure the speedy issue of payments due.</P>
    <P>Local access in this way is positively encouraged.  To facilitate the transaction of business at local level, continuing development of local offices is planned to ensure that people have improved access to services, better privacy facilities, better information and speedy attention to their needs.  At the same time, ways of improving access and transacting business by telephone are under consideration.</P>

I ask the Minister to consider if the books can be issued from local social welfare offices.  I have experience of this matter and there is a longer gap than two weeks in the return of books.  Once the documentation has been sent to the Department, a book should be immediately returned through the local social welfare office.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was published last week.  Arising from the findings contained in the report, the Government has decided to prepare a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has also been authorised to establish a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monitoring committee will comprise organisations representing people with disabilities, their families and carers and service providers.  In addition, social partners and Departments, including my Department, will be represented on the committee.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform will also establish an interdepartmental task force to prepare the Government's plan of action.  When this has been agreed I will be in a position to indicate the steps which my Department will take to implement the <Col N="338" /> recommendations for which my Department has responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss. M. Wallace Miss. M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss. M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's attitude to the commission's recommendation regarding a non means tested allowance to cover the costs of disability?  This suggestion has been discussed for some time.  People with disabilities have difficulty taking up jobs because they lose their allowances based on means tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission made a number of interesting recommendations, some of which relate to the work of my Department. There is an anxiety on the part of some people that matters dealt with by other Departments should be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  I take that as a vote of confidence in the operation of my Department and the caring attitude of its staff.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the commission's report which specifically relate to my Department refer to the establishment of a non means tested payment to compensate for loss of income due to an incapacity for full-time work or to work to full potential, to be known as a disability pension.  I understand the intention is to amalgamate the invalidity pension and the disability allowance in one pension payment.  My Department will consider the matter in the context of the development of the system generally.  The report also proposes the establishment of a graduated payment to meet the additional costs associated with disability.  This matter also needs to be addressed and my Department will consider it.</P>
      <P>All the issues must be examined in the context of available resources and the services provided by other Departments and what they may do in terms of responding to the matters relating to them.  This is why the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will establish an interdepartmental task force to prepare the Government's plan of action.  The matters must be agreed by Government in a co-ordinated manner so the services sought and delivered by all Departments do not counteract each other or act as a disincentive.  It is important to await the action plan which will be prepared by the interdepartmental task force.  At that point I will be in a much better position to advise the Deputy regarding the steps my Department will take in relation to the commission's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The same position applied to various commission reports.  For example, a monitoring committee determined what each Department had done to implement the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women.  I am anxious to establish whether the Department of Social Welfare has read the recommendations which specifically relate to it and its intentions in that regard.  The proposal for a cost of disability allowance has been around for some time and it has been backed by the Commission on the Status of <Col N="339" /> People with Disabilities.  We have been told for the past two years that we must await the commission's report before decisions are taken on such issues.  However, the commission has reported and made strong recommendations.  We should not wait for a monitoring committee to determine the position.</P>
      <P>Another strong recommendation in the commission's report relates to the Department of Social Welfare's payment of £30 million a year to CIÉ for the free travel scheme.  However, the buses continue to be inaccessible to people with disabilities.  On 20 June 1995 the Minister stated that he would review this issue.  On 25 September he again said he would review it as consultations were still ongoing.  Has any progress been made? The Commission made a strong recommendation regarding the accessibility of buses and said it wanted progress by 1 January.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the report only recently became available. However, the Government has already decided to establish a monitoring committee and an interdepartmental task force to ensure a co-ordinated and coherent response to the report.  It is unreasonable of the Deputy to expect instant solutions to problems which have existed for generations.  The Government is determined to ensure the best services possible are made available to people to cope with disabilities of various types.</P>
      <P>The transport issue is a separate question.  A number of parliamentary questions on today's Order Paper relate to that matter and I will deal with it when the questions are reached.</P>

      <P>The monitoring committee the Minister mentioned should monitor the progress in each Department regarding the implementation of the 400 recommendations in the commission's report.  I hope the Minister is not suggesting that we must await the outcome of the monitoring committee because it should deal with the progress in the Department of Social Welfare regarding the recommendations which apply to it.  Specific proposals in the commission's report relate to the Department of Social Welfare, including the cost of disability allowance and accessibility of buses.  The Minister's Department should deal with those matters now so the monitoring committee can report on its progress.  This is the purpose of a monitoring committee.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that two groups will be established.  The interdepartmental task force will prepare the Government's plan of action.  Departments are examining the report and will respond to it.  The task force will prepare a Government plan of action based on what each Department considers can be done.  On that basis the monitoring committee will be established to monitor progress. <Col N="340" /> on the action plan.  The monitoring committee to oversee implementation of the commission's recommendations will comprise organisations representing people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers.  In addition, social partners and Government Departments, including my Department, will be represented on it.  A partnership approach will be adopted in terms of this report and there is no need for confrontation on these matters.</P>
      <P>The commission identified a number of important recommendations about what needs to be done in this area and the Government is determined to deal with those matters.  We moved very quickly on the decision to establish a monitoring committee and a task force to prepare an action plan and progress is being made.  I understand the Deputy's impatience.  We are all impatient to ensure these issues are dealt with and the Government will quickly deal with them.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, which exist to improve the level of co-operation and exchange of information between the different Government agencies in the fight against social welfare fraud; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in recent replies to parliamentary questions, an intensified programme of control measures has been introduced to tackle fraud and abuse of the social welfare system by claimants and employers.  This programme has involved the assignment of additional resources, review of guidelines, intensification of interviewing of claimants, and of inspections of employers, a claim review exercise of all unemployed claimants, including reverification of their addresses, an extensive publicity campaign and a range of other activities.</P>
      <P>I am conscious, however, that my Department cannot successfully tackle abuses of its services without the co-operation of the public, employers and of course all other relevant Government Departments and agencies.  There has always been a high level of co-operation between my Department and other Government Departments and agencies in tackling social welfare fraud and abuse.  Information is exchanged and acted upon on an ongoing basis with a range of organisations, including the Revenue Commissioners, FÁS, An Post, health boards, third level colleges and other Government Departments.</P>
      <P>A joint investigation unit of inspectors from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners operates, using combined resources and expertise on a nationwide basis to tackle social welfare and tax fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the new package of measures, meetings have taken place at central, regional and local level between FÁS and social welfare <Col N="341" /> officials to step up and agree local co-operation in relation to recruitment for specific FÁS projects and for follow-up contact of people on the live register who have not recently registered with FÁS.  This has resulted in specific local initiatives with further activities planned for the future.  Further improvements and enhancements in the exchange of computerised data and the extension of shared information are also being planned.</P>
    <P>The question of improving and enhancing the level of co-operation with the various Departments and agencies in the context of the control of social welfare fraud is being investigated and will be kept under continuous review.  I am determined to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to seek out and counteract fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>Given that this matter has been reviewed and that there has been monitoring since the CSO survey, what is the Minister's best estimate of the level of social welfare fraud?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is constant controversy and debate about that matter.  The only information I have relates to a survey carried out some years ago specifically on fraud, which found that the level of criminal fraud as distinct from abuse in terms of overpayments and so on was in the region of 2 per cent.  It identified a possible level of fraud of about 7 per cent, but it could not be certain that was an accurate figure. It is difficult to be precise on this matter.  Since we intensified our efforts in regard to fraud and abuse almost 20,000 people have voluntarily signed off the live register, which resulted in considerable savings for the Department of Social Welfare.  No system in Europe has eliminated fraud and abuse completely, but it is my intention to ensure it is kept to the absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disquieting that the Department does not have at least an estimate of the level of social welfare fraud.  The Minister told the select committee some time ago that, leaving aside the difficulty with addresses and other matters, he believed that the figure for those signing while working was close to 11 per cent.  Are the measures being monitored accurately?  The fact that 20,000 people signed off the live register in a relatively short period suggests there is rampant fraud.  The Minister should be able to indicate with a fair degree of accuracy the level of fraud.</P>

      <P>We should stick to the facts rather than guesswork.  The only additional information I can give the Deputy on this matter relates to the savings made for 1995 and to end October 1996 under the various headings.  On unemployment payments there was a saving in 1995 of £48.7 million while up to October this year it was £48 million; on illness payments the <Col N="342" /> saving in 1995 was £25.2 million while up to October this year it was £20.6 million; on pensions the saving for 1995 was £29.7 million while up to October this year it was £33.1 million; on child benefit the saving in 1995 was £2.4 million while up to October 1996 it was £2.7 million; on recovery of PAYE and PRSI the saving for 1995 was £16 million while up to October 1996 it was £11.8 million; on pre-retirement allowance and FIS the saving in 1995 was £2.5 million while up to October 1996 it was £2.7 million.  Total savings in 1995 amounted to £124.5 million while up to October this year total savings amounted to £119.1 million.</P>

      <P>I have no option but to ask another supplementary because this is obfuscation and I will not get accurate information on this matter.  Has the report of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs been brought to the Minister's attention? That is a damning report in terms of the Minister's incompetence.  It stated that there must have been serious shortcomings in operational procedures in the Department.  It also stated that the anti-fraud measures introduced by the Department of Social Welfare should be independently monitored &mdash; in other words, it did not trust the Department to monitor them properly &mdash; and that they should be reported twice yearly to the relevant committee of the House, possibly by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Has the Minister responded to the chairman of the committee on that matter?</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy would like me to respond angrily to the points he is making but I do not intend to.  The report to which the Deputy referred has been brought to my attention.  I have asked the Department to prepare a response on my behalf and that will be done in due course.  I have been Minister for Social Welfare since December 1994, slightly less than two years.  The Deputy's party was responsible for the Department of Social Welfare for many years and it is only since I became Minister that the issue of fraud is being dealt with in a serious way.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree his Department has limited financial resources to deal with the problem of fraud and that these scarce resources should be put to best effect?  Will he agree also that rather than subjecting farmers with less than five livestock units to means tests, they should be exempted from means testing if they can prove they have less than five livestock units, and any resources saved directed at detecting fraud in the system?  Will the Minister further agree that extending eligibility for community employment schemes would free up resources for social welfare officers, thereby achieving two results?  First, it would make employment available to people who want to <Col N="343" /> work and, second, it would help to identify more accurately those who are working and drawing the dole at the same time.  That would be better than going around the country counting chickens and cows owned by pensioners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 32, 42, 47, 55, 57, 59, 65, 69 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for the transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from health boards to the Department were <Col N="345" /> completed successfully and with effect from 2 October 1996, the scheme, which is now known as disability allowance, is the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Regulations made under powers given in the Social Welfare Act, 1996 provided for the introduction of the new scheme of disability allowance.  The Act and regulations define the circumstances in which a person is regarded as being eligible for entitlement to the allowance and provide for a number of important improvements in the means test for the allowance.  Additional benefits which people were previously entitled to will continue to be payable and the health and welfare services previously provided by health boards will also be available to them.</P>
    <P>Recipients of the allowance may earn up to £35.20 per week from employment of a rehabilitative nature without any reduction in their payment.  Where a person earns more than £35.20 the allowance is reduced on a pound for pound basis in respect of any earnings in excess of that amount.  Persons engaged in rehabilitative employment who retain all or part of their allowance also retain their additional benefits.</P>
    <P>The transfer was a very complex process which required the integration into one system of the eight different administrative and computer systems operated by the health boards.  As part of the arrangements for the transfer, an information programme was undertaken to ensure that all persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance and other interested parties were kept informed of the process and the new arrangements.  This programme was effective in ensuring that the transfer took place with the minimum inconvenience to existing recipients.</P>
    <P>There has been a higher than expected volume of new applications in the early weeks of the scheme.  Additional resources are being applied by the Department to obviate any backlogs or delays that might otherwise arise.  For people requiring advice or information there is an information booklet available on the scheme. Any person with a specific query or difficulty can contact their local Social Welfare office or the disability allowance section in the Department's headquarters office in Longford.</P>
    <P>A total of 45 staff have been permanently assigned to the administration of the scheme.  Of these 36 have been assigned to the scheme headquarters in Longford and nine to the medical control section in Dublin.  The staff complement will be reviewed in the light of experience of operating the scheme over the coming months.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were raised both by individuals and organisations representing people with disabilities during the course of the transfer discussions.  Among these issues were the question of payment of the allowance to persons in the care of institutions on either a full-time or part-time basis and the provision of alternative methods of payment to the standard post office payable order books.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> I have improved the arrangements for persons in the care of institutions.  Previously in such cases an allowance could only be paid for a maximum of eight weeks in any 12-month period.  Under the new regulations such persons will continue to receive disability allowance for up to 13 weeks where they are resident in such institutions.  The allowance is not payable in respect of part of a week where a person is normally resident in an institution but I am reviewing the position in this regard in the light of the increasing tendency for such people to come home at weekends.</P>
    <P>Payments made under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme by the health boards were, in some board areas, made by cheque and in others by books of payable orders. Payment to recipients of disability allowance is made by personalised payable orders cashable at post offices.  A person may appoint an agent on his or her behalf to cash the payment if they are unable do so.  I intend to provide a wider range of payment options to recipients of the allowance. The option of payment by electronic fund transfer to accounts in banks and other financial institutions will be offered at an early date</P>
    <P>The recently published report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities also contained a number of recommendations in relation to payments for people with disabilities and I will be examining these in the context of reviewing the development of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the transfer of the disability allowance scheme to my Department was achieved with the minimum of disruption to existing customers and that the new arrangements will provide a streamlined and efficient service to people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.

      <P>My information is that the majority of health board disabled person's maintenance allowance clients had their payments transferred to the Department without hitch and they are now being paid by personalised payment order through the post office of their choice.  There were an estimated 200 to 300 cases out of a claim load of approximately 32,000 where problems arose in the transfer process.  The primary reasons for these were that payments were not transferred to the post office nominated by the client &mdash; in some cases clients changed their choice of post office a matter of days before the transfer; clients disputed the amount being paid or, in cases where no payment was received, that resulted from non-receipt of data from the health boards, human error and books going astray in the post.  By and large, however, 96 per <Col N="347" /> cent or 97 per cent of books were issued in good time and order.  We regret any inconvenience caused to people as a result of any delay but my understanding is that all those entitled to books on transfer from the health boards have now received them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex area.  The information I have here is that where recipients are engaged in employment of a rehabilitative nature an income disregard of £35.20 per week is applied.  This means that recipients may earn up to £35.20 per week from rehabilitative employment without any reduction in their disability allowance payment.  In approved cases, earnings up to this amount will not lead to a reduction in the allowance payable. Clients can earn more than this amount and still qualify for a reduced allowance.  The maximum that can be earned in these circumstances at current rates is £99.70 per week.  Clients engaged in rehabilitative work who retain all or part of their disability allowance also retain their additional entitlements such as free travel.  Most clients involved in rehabilitative employment will have used the services of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain the logic behind the fact that under lone parent's allowance a client can earn £6,000 per year with a taper of 50 per cent from January 1997 whereas the disabled person's maintenance allowance limit is £35.20 per week?  This means that where <Col N="348" /> a client earns over £35.20, every pound he or she earns just gives a pound back to the Department. What is the logic in creating more anomalies and making the system more complicated?  Will the Minister also explain whether a person who is engaged in training or education without payment is entitled to disabled person's maintenance allowance?  For example, is an 18 year old who is engaged in part or full-time training or education and seriously disabled entitled to disability allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question about logic, our system of social welfare has envolved over a 50 year period &mdash; we are marking the 50th anniversary of the Department next year &mdash; so anomalies will inevitably develop.  People develop schemes to serve needs at particular times.  In many cases it is not always possible to match them exactly to previously existing schemes, particularly as we seek to introduce all schemes in a way which does not result in financial loss to those already on existing schemes who are transferred to the new schemes.</P>
      <P>In transferring the disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards the Department of Social Welfare is operating a scheme for which it had no previous responsibility for its administration or development, what the disregards and payment rights were and so on.  In taking on that scheme the Department had to match the administrative and computer systems of eight different health boards and centralise them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The task was to take on board the scheme in a way which ensured that no one would be at a disadvantage when it became the responsibility of my Department.  When the scheme came on stream we had to ensure that <Col N="349" /> people got their cheques on time.  As we know, of the 32,000 recipients there were up to 300 delays and that is unfortunate.  I know the Deputy is impatient for me to answer his question but I am explaining that it was necessary for us to concentrate in the first instance on ensuring a smooth transfer of the existing scheme to my Department so that nobody would be without their cheque when the scheme was operated by my Department.  That was the first priority and we have done that successfully.</P>
      <P>In transferring the scheme it was necessary to make some changes to it to ensure that people did not lose out.  If we had applied the normal unemployment means test to disabled person's maintenance allowance, for instance, single people living at home with parents or other members of their family would have lost out because people means tested on disabled person's maintenance allowance when it was administered by the health boards did not have such matters taken into account to the same extent as under unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked why there is a difference between the lone parent's allowance scheme which will be introduced in January 1997 and the current disability allowance scheme.  A new scheme will be introduced in January 1997.  We are introducing a one parent family payment which is aimed at encouraging lone parents to take up employment by allowing them to keep a portion of their lone parent's allowance up to a certain earnings ceiling.  In time I hope to be able to develop all the means tested schemes to allow people to take up employment where it is possible for them to do so.  I hope to be able to do the same in relation to the disability allowance scheme.  However, I am afraid the Deputy will have to have a little more patience, given that we have only managed to transfer the scheme to my Department in the last month.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned electronic funds transfers in his reply.  Is he aware of the concerns of people who live on their own in rural areas who have to travel to post offices to get their cheque and cash it and then travel home, and the dangers involved in these journeys?  We know how many people were attacked, beaten and in some cases murdered last winter.  Would it not be sensible to bring this electronic fund transfer into effect at the earliest possible date, if only to allay the fears of people living on their own in rural areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a completely separate matter.  We are dealing with the question of the disability payments scheme.  I have already made it clear that we will provide an electronic fund transfer facility for people on that scheme as quickly as possible.  Electronic fund transfer is already available to other categories of people in receipt of social welfare payments and this facility is being extended as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that this scheme was executed with the minimum of disruption.  How many people are awaiting back payments as a result of the transfer?  There are two on my list going back to February who are quite concerned that back payments have not been made.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned that anomalies exist within the scheme.  Would he agree that, in introducing the one parent family payment scheme in January, he has introduced two further anomalies?  Does that not discriminate against married women who go out to work side by side with single parents, and is the Minister not also discriminating in terms of the application of this disability scheme?  Further, the Minister has transferred the function of payment, but the method of assessment has been retained by the health boards.  Is the Department making any contribution to health boards towards the cost of the medical staff and others who make assessments?</P>

      <P>I mentioned it in the context of the question Deputy Ó Cuív asked.  If the Deputy wants me to deal in detail with that question.  I will be more than happy to do so if he tables a question.</P>
      <P>On the question of the backlog, as part of the transfer of the disability allowance scheme, it was agreed with the health boards that new claims received by them after 1 September 1996 would not be processed but would be transferred or referred to the Department of Social Welfare. There were two reasons for this.  The health boards would not be in a position to process these claims and put them into payment by 2 October 1996, and the non-processing of new claims during September would give the boards an opportunity to concentrate on completing as many cases as possible which were on hand at the time and reduce the number of such cases being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare on 2 October.</P>
      <P>The extent of cases transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, however, has been significant.  The number of new applications from 1 September 1996 to 1 October 1996 was 385.  The number of new applications from 2 October 1996 to date was 1,481.  That is where the backlog referred to by the Deputy has arisen, not in the transfer of existing claims to my Department but in dealing with new claims which came at a time when they were not anticipated.  We did not anticipate the significant increase which there has been in the number of applications for disability allowance.  We are working as quickly as possible to clear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> In relation to the question of the health boards continuing to administer the scheme, that is not the case.  My Department carries out the means assessment and also the medical assessment.  As I indicated in my reply earlier today, we have allocated 36 staff to the headquarters office in Longford to deal with this scheme and nine medical staff in the Dublin medical area to deal with the medical assessments.  Decisions in these cases are made by the deciding officers of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Deputies who agreed to have the order changed.  I wish to raise the matter of the closure or the changeover of St. Mary's post-primary school in Buttevant.  Buttevant is a small town in north Cork, better known as Cill na Mullach.  As a small rural town it has suffered much in unemployment over the years and has not recovered from the closure of its small industry.  A famous person who came from that area was Mr. Noel Whelan who was secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach.  This area which is in the Awbeg Valley is well known for its history, its writings and Spencer, who wrote <i>The Faery Queen</i>.  The first steeplechase in the world which was a significant and historic event was run between Buttevant and Doneraile.  This small rural town depends on agriculture and a rural environment.</P>
      <P>The Sisters of Mercy have played a major role in post-primary education in Buttevant for a long number of years dating back to 1879.  There are approximately 140 pupils in that school.  The anxiety of the parents must be taken into account in any changeover.  Many parents have contacted me not because of the closure or the change but the upsetting effect it will have on students who are in their final year in that post-primary school. The school has between 20 and 25 dedicated teachers.  The number of pupils there has increased because of the closure of the Sacred Heart College &mdash; now a community college &mdash; a number of years ago.</P>
      <P>The post primary school in any town is the flagship of education which is so necessary in a rural town.  Let us look at what will happen if the proposed change takes place.  Mallow to the south, Doneraile to the east, Kanturk to the west and Charleville to the north will have to provide extra places.  I understand that despite a downturn in the population many of those schools will be overcrowded should the change take place.</P>
      <P>The people of Buttevant are proud of their history, their past and their education.  It also has the famous horse fair, Cahirmee.  In recent times a plaque was unveiled to Ms Ann Bunworth who was a famous harpist.  That gives a great culture and background to the town of Buttevant and surrounding areas.  Ms Bunworth was a relative of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  I want to be even-handed and to pay tribute to someone who made a worthwhile contribution to the area.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Bradford.</P>

      <P>I protest at the greater centralisation which will follow the closure or any change in respect of this school.  Taking a facility from an area that has had it for such a long time is unkind and cannot be tolerated.  Will the Minister put in place the necessary measures to ensure continuity of the facility in Buttevant?</P>
      <P>The Mercy Order has been to the forefront in education both primary and post-primary.  It has served the country well and helped many people who were in need of education and who could ill afford it to rise to the highest levels.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accede to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, for raising the matter on the Adjournment and for sharing his time with me.  I am interested to hear the Minister's reply.  Unfortunately, a story which is doing the rounds in the Buttevant area suggests that somehow the Department is responsible for this decision.  It is important that the matter be clarified.  I would be the first to commend the Sisters of Mercy for the work they have done not only in education in the town but also in providing a fine facility for the elderly in recent times.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that with the declining school numbers the Mercy Order has taken a decision to close the school.  That is a regrettable decision and I hope it can be reconsidered.  If it is reconsidered, commitments will have to be given locally that the vast majority of pupils from the area will utilise that school.  I hope the Minister will be able to give an assurance to the school authorities and to the parents that should a decision be made to keep the school in operation any building, reconstruction or refurbishment work required within the school will be considered sympathetically by the Department. This is a crucial issue for a small town.  If a town the size of Buttevant loses its secondary school it literally loses its soul.  We must do everything possible from a departmental perspective to ensure a decision is made by the Mercy Order to keep the school open and allow the people of Buttevant to have their children educated at a second level school in the town.</P>

      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this matter since it affords me an opportunity to clarify the position on the provision of post-primary education for pupils in the Buttevant area.</P>
      <P>The post-primary school in Buttevant, St. Mary's, is privately-owned, run by a religious order of nuns.  In the first instance any decision in relation to its future, including a decision to close, is a matter for its management authorities. My Department's responsibility is to ensure that, if the school closes, adequate alternative arrangements are put in place for the pupils of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally there were two post-primary schools in Buttevant.  However, with effect from the 1985-86 <Col N="356" /> school year, the lay secondary school for boys, Coláite Chroí Naofa, closed down, its teachers and pupils being absorbed into St. Mary's secondary school.  My Department approved that rationalisation measure.  I must acknowledge that the sister in St. Mary's were very co-operative in that respect.</P>
    <P>In recent years the school has been under pressure to enrol pupils from surrounding post-primary centres, such as Charleville to the north, Kanturk to the west and Doneraile to the east.  In particular, the development of a single coeducational secondary school in Doneraile in 1992 appears to have had a significant impact on St. Mary's Consequently, the Buttevant school has been attracting less than 50 per cent of the potential enrolment in its catchment area and has a total current enrolment of 150 pupils.</P>
    <P>While the future viability of schools of this size is in question, particularly in the light of declining demographic trends, only this week did the planning section of my Department become aware of the possible closure of the Buttevant school, formal notification to that effect having been received today.  It is understood from this communication from the school authorities that what is intended is the phasing out of the school over a number of years, beginning next September, when there will be no intake of first year pupils.  Existing pupils will be allowed complete their current cycle in the school.</P>
    <P>My Department accepts that the closure of a school can cause inconvenience for pupils, teachers and parents in the area involved.  In the light of today's communication my Department will be in touch with the school authorities in the matter and will identify the necessary steps to be taken to ensure that alternative arrangements are made for the post-primary education of the pupils from the area.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies may be assured that my Department will make every effort to ensure continuity of educational provision for post-primary pupils from the Buttevant area.</P>

      <P>I am greatful for the opportunity of raising this matter, especially on behalf of those many commuters to and from Dublin city who have found that Dublin traffic has been allowed degenerate into an unprecedented state of chaos. Journeys that took only 20 minutes last year now take up to one hour.  For months past commuters in the Dublin area have faced daily battles in the course of their journeys to and from work, spending less time with their families, leaving home earlier in the morning and returning later in the evening.  Businesses' turnover has been badly affected by delays in their deliveries and their sales people having encountered additional difficulties because of traffic delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent surge in car sales has added to the volume of traffic on Dublin streets.  The car scrappage scheme launched by the Minister for <Col N="357" /> Finance some 18 months ago has also been acknowledged as a major contributor to these increased car sales.  Under this scheme owners of ten-year-old cars were given a Government grant of £1,000 towards the cost of a new car.  While the number of cars has not increased as a direct result of that scheme, it has played a major part in increasing the volume of traffic on the streets.  It goes without saying that a brand new car, carrying a car loan of perhaps £10,000, will be driven more frequently than would any ten-year-old banger.  The Minister for the Environment has conceded that the number of cars on Dublin streets has already reached the levels predicted for the year 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government should have foreseen this inevitable consequence of its scrappage scheme and had practical, effective measures in places to counter the increased volume of traffic.  No such plans were put in place.  Only last weekend did the Government makes any comment on the matters when it transpired that the Taoiseach had experienced at first hand the capital's gridlocked streets, having been struck in a traffic jam for over one and a half hours earlier in the week. Following this he immediately ordered a traffic management plan.  Had he come down to earth from his helicopter a little sooner he might have implemented a coherent, practical traffic management plan rather than engaging in this Knee-jerk reaction, called operation free-flow, involving taking in excess of 100 gardaí from regular duties.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic that a Government committed to tackling crime will draft in Garda assistance to cope with the capital's traffic crisis. What happens to operation Dóchas set up to counter drug-related crime?  Where will that leave the Garda in their day to day crime-fighting duties?  Will those gardaí be pulled from operation free-flow as soon as there is another criminal atrocity?  What will be the position of Dublin commuters then?</P>
    <P>Irish motorists pay £1.5 billion annually to the Exchequer comprised of VAT, vehicle registration tax and excise duty on petrol and deserve far better treatment from the Government than has been meted out to them to date.  They have paid very dearly for the privilege of owning a car and, at the very least, should be guaranteed a more strategic approach to traffic management in the capital.  Dublin motorists specifically require an end to gridlock which is achievable only if traffic regulations and parking restrictions are strictly enforced.  That is not the case at present.  As we are well aware, some drivers cause congestion by abandoning their vehicles illegally in the city centre, delivery trucks park in single lane traffic bringing the traffic behind them to a halt and buses cause delays.</P>
    <P>Why could we not implement the system which operates very efficiently in some continental countries whereby passengers purchase their bus tickets in local shops?  There should be no necessity for passengers to purchase tickets on <Col N="358" /> boarding a bus.  If the formers approach was adopted not alone would it speed up the passage of buses through the city but it would also reduce the risk of attacks on their drivers since they would carry no money on board.</P>
    <P>Other measures, such as the rapid implementation of all the quality bus corridors promised by the Dublin Transportation Initiative, clearer signposting, lane markings and the greater development of parking areas outside the city centre would go a long way to smoothing Dublin's traffic flow.  I will not even ask to what extent the construction of Luas will add to the gridlock.  The answer is perfectly clear and does not bear thinking about.  We have had sufficient Government Knee-jerk reactions.  There must be an immediate comprehensive, practical plan developed for all Dublin motorists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative report outlined a new approach to traffic in Dublin city, including some major investment schemes now at advanced planning stages.  The report also stressed the need for the development of traffic management measures.</P>
      <P>In his speech last week at the launch of the 1996 Christmas road safety campaign the Minister for the Environment, referring to the major challenge now posed by traffic congestion in Dublin, said that those traffic management measures now require greater attention and emphasis.  For those reasons the Minister requested the Dublin Transportation Office some weeks ago to devise a series of initiatives aimed at improving traffic flow in the city in the short-term and easing the current unacceptable levels of congestion.</P>
      <P>Dublin's current traffic difficulties must be viewed against a background of strong, rapid economic growth.  Over the past five years our economy has grown by an average 5 per cent per annum, resulting in people being better off financially.  It is an internationally accepted fact that there is a direct correlation between the standards of living and car ownership.  There has been a significant increase in the number of new car purchases in Dublin and its neighbouring counties since 1991.  Car ownership in the greater Dublin area now stands at 322 cars per 1,000 of the population, an increases of 32.9 per cent since 1991.</P>
      <P>The growth in trade through Dublin Port plays a major role in the traffic congestion in and around the city.  In 1991 it was estimated that port traffic would increases from 7.7 millions tonnes per annum to 9.2 million tonnes per annum by 2001. Last year port traffic was estimated at 12 million tonnes and this is expected to increase to 17 million tonnes by the year 2000.  In traffic movements terms, there were 417,000 heavy goods vehicle movements in and out of the port in 1995 and this is expected to increase to 715,000 movements by the year 2000.  The vast bulk of these movements is along the quays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The growth in passenger movements at Dublin Airport is astonishing.  Passenger movements this year are expected to exceed nine million compared with eight million in 1995 and 5.3 million in 1991, a growth of 70 per cent since 1991.  The car trips generated by these movements also contribute to the congestion.</P>
    <P>The DTI strategy launched in August 1995 seeks to provide a coherent and integrated policy framework for the development of transportation in the greater Dublin area.  This policy is not demand-led; rather it seeks to manage demand through a range of measures designed to maximise mobility and accessibility.  The predictions in the DTI final report, on which the strategy is founded, were based on the best economic indicators available during the study. However, as a result of the accelerated growth in the economy since 1991 the traffic flows predicted for 2001 have already been reached, well ahead of the main infrastructural projects such as the C-Ring, port tunnel and LRT which are set to bring about major traffic relief.</P>
    <P>The current unacceptable levels of congestion formed the background for the Minister's recent request to the DTO.  This has been the subject of intensive work since then by all the agencies concerned.  The agencies involved in the preparation of measures and plans to deal with traffic congestion include the DTO, Dublin Corporation, Dublin Bus and the Garda Síochána.  The Taoiseach has also taken a personal interest in the matter and has met the key players in an effort to ease congestion in the city during the hectic weeks leading up to Christmas.  Some measures have already been put in place.  These include the extension of hours of operation of bus lanes, the removal from use of parking meters at several locations around the city and the extension of the hours of operation of the Dublin Corporation traffic control centre. The Minister will announce next week full details of the pre-Christmas traffic management strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this very important matter which is of concern to hundreds of people in County Roscommon, particularly middle aged, older and ill people.</P>
      <P>Six months ago the Western Health Board requested the Department of Health to provide the necessary facilities for an extra 25 beds at Roscommon County Hospital.  However, to date the health board has not received a reply from the Department.  This is a gross discourtesy to the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in the hospital is caused by overcrowding which is so great that the Western Health Board's health and safety officer was invited to visit the hospital to see the problem at first hand.  After an inspection he decided to put a cap on the number of beds in each ward.  This brought some respite to the hard pressed nurses <Col N="360" /> and patients but it brought very little cheer to people who were refused admittance and people who were admitted but had to spend one or two nights on trolleys in a corridor.  Last Monday five patients spent the night on trolleys in the casualty department, which is not the best treatment for them.</P>
    <P>In recent years the people of County Roscommon have become accustomed to an excellent health service.  The medical and surgical treatment provided by the hospital in first class. In some respects we could be regarded as the authors of our own doom in that the good name built up by the hospital has led to an increase in the number of patients seeking admittance.</P>
    <P>Nurses are fighting a tough battle and I wish them the best of luck.  When this problem is resolved I ask the Minister to make the problem of overcrowding in Roscommon County Hospital a priority as patients are entitled to proper facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Foxe for raising this very important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position on behalf of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been aware for some time of the difficulties of overcrowding in Roscommon County Hospital and the Department had discussions earlier in the year with the management of the Western Health Board regarding the position in acute hospitals generally in the west.  The board has stated that it is taking the necessary steps to alleviate the current pressure on beds in the hospital.  These measures include the setting of an acceptable limit on the number of beds in medical wards at a given time which cannot be exceeded.  A review of admission and discharge policies in the hospital is also under way.  I commend the hospital authorities for their efforts to date which have resulted in a much reduced average length of stay for patients.  The hospital management is also reviewing communications with general practitioners with a view to moderating the demands on hospital services.  I am confident that this pragmatic approach to relieving the overcrowding at the hospital will lead to improved conditions for the Patients and staff.  The Department will monitor the situation closely.</P>
      <P>The proposal for extra bed space from the Western Health Board is being considered by the Department.  However, the provision of additional beds in any current or future capital development will have to be agreed in the context of a board-wide strategy for the provision of acute hospital services in the region.  The Department has to be satisfied that there is absolutely no alternative before it can consider approving the provision of additional acute beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During his visit to Roscommon County Hospital last June, the Minister announced details of a comprehensive capital and revenue funding package which will alleviate the pressure on acute hospital services in the Western Health <Col N="361" /> Board area.  He also expressed his desire that Roscommon County Hospital would be considered for some element of relief given the step up in the hospital's activities in recent years. I am pleased that the hospital received a substantial element of these additional moneys to address its revenue funding difficulties which had arisen in part from taking on additional nursing staff.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Minister's commitment to the continued development of services in Roscommon County Hospital for the benefit of patients in that area.  The Minister recently approved the additional post of consultant surgeon at the hospital and it is expected that this investment will help to address the current demands on the hospital while at the same time giving this service a high profile among the community.  The other investments made by the Minister in Roscommon County Hospital include the provision of a capital grant last year of £117,000 for the purchase of vital equipment for the coronary care unit.  I understand that this funding has enabled the hospital to purchase much needed additional equipment.</P>
    <P>The investments in Roscommon County Hospital which I have outlined are aimed at its full integration in the delivery of health services in the area.  In light of the pragmatic approach being taken by the Western Health Board to deal with the current overcrowding in the hospital, I look forward to a favourable outcome.  I am confident this approach, with the substantial investments being made by the Department, will ensure the long-term future of Roscommon County Hospital as a vital and flexible part of the acute hospital service in the west.</P>

Such a projected growth in the population throws up an enormous challenge to world powers and those inhabiting the world to produce more food to support that population.  A clear and practical plan is required to ensure food security for that number of people. A process of education and development and a necessary strategy to produce more where needed is required.  This will require the undoubted commitment and support of the developed world.</P>

      <Col N="362" /> I appeal to the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, whom I am pleased has come into the House to reply to this debate, to elicit the support and commitment of the great world powers at the world trade conference in Singapore and to ensure a coherent plan is put in place to provide food security well into the next century.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Tourism and Trade for taking this issue on the Adjournment.  The number of Ministers involved in food security is amazing.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and Forestry also have responsibility in this area.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments on food security at the World Food Summit.  I did not know the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, was involved in food security, or in any security, although he recently explained on radio how he secured the safety of pupils when he was a teacher by disposing of rats using a shotgun. From what I learned this morning on the Order of Business, he may soon introduce statutory instruments on landmines and explosives.</P>

      <P>Tourism and Trade is an important ministry.  It obviously deals with the trade and export of such devices which I hope will never be again used, particularly in conflicts throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recommendations of the Irish Aid Advisory Committee.  Its members want us to increase aid in food security related areas and to participate more often in international fora to address issues, such as debt burden, structural adjustment programmes and aspects of the GATT Agreement and EU subsidies, which affect the livelihoods of the poor throughout the world.  We must place more emphasis on assisting developing countries to have the ability to feed themselves and, in this regard, there should be more flexibility in the NGO co-financing scheme. There has always been dialogue between those involved in our aid programme and NGOs but there should be more co-ordination in that area.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Kirk was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food he was involved with the Irish Aid Advisory Committee. For that reason I am pleased to support his comments tonight.  Many of my constituents have asked me to raise this matter.  I hope the Minister for Tourism and Trade will raise the matter at the world trade conference and that he can give us a positive response.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to respond to the matter raised by Deputies Kirk and Kitt.  This matter was a central theme of the World Food Summit which concluded on 17 November last and was attended by the Taoiseach.  The summit addressed all aspects of the issue of eradicating <Col N="363" /> hunger and creating world food security.  At the summit it was acknowledge that food security is a complex and multifaceted concept.</P>
      <P>The summit acknowledged the importance of trade policy, the main business of the World Trade Organisation, to the achievement of food security.  The declaration approved by the summit states:</P>
      <P>Trade is a key element in achieving world food security.  Trade generates effective utilisation of resources and stimulates economic growth which is critical to improving food security.  Trade allows food consumption to exceed food production, helps to reduce production and consumption fluctuations and relieves part of the burden of stock holding.  It has a major bearing on access to food through its positive effect on economic growth, income and employment.  Appropriate domestic economic and social policies will better ensure that all, including the poor, will benefit from economic growth.  Appropriate trade policies promote the objectives of sustainable growth and food security.  It is essential that all members of the World Trade Organisation respect and fulfil the totality of the undertakings of the Uruguay Round.  For this purpose it will be necessary to refrain from unilateral measures not in accordance with WTO obligations.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round Agreement established a new international trade framework that offers opportunity to developed and developing countries to benefit from appropriate trade policies and self-reliance strategies.  The progressive implementation of the Uruguay Round as a whole will generate increasing opportunities for trade expansion and economic growth to the benefit of all participants.  Therefore, adaptation to the provisions of the various agreements during the implementation period must be ensured.  Some least-developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience short-term negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basis foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions, including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs.  The Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food-importing Developing Countries, Marrakesh 1994, shall be fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Trade Organisation is not merely a talking shop, it has a series of rules and regulations to which countries sign up.  An important point of that quotation is that unilateral measures taken by individual countries are against the spirit and fundamental concept of the WTO.  The World Food Summit declaration neatly encapsulates the issues relevant to food <Col N="364" /> security which need to be addressed by the WTO Singapore meeting.  Full and faithful implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements in all their aspects was a key issue identified by the food summit.  A critical examination of implementation to date of the Uruguay Round agreements will be a central focus of the Singapore meeting, one to which the EU attaches great importance.  The EU has put great effort into implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements and will seek a reaffirmation at Singapore of the importance that its example is followed by all WTO members.  As the Deputies may be aware, Europe's case is being handled by me, as President of the Council of Ministers for Trade, and Commissioner Leon Brittan on behalf of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The WTO agreements, the implementation of which will be reviewed at the ministerial conference, contain a number of concessions to developing countries in general &mdash; for example they are subject to less stringent liberalisation timetables than other WTO members &mdash; and special provisions for the least developed countries.  The latter are contained in two decisions adopted at the end of the Uruguay Round declaring that least developed countries need only undertake WTO commitments to the extent of their ability and promising increased technical assistance and food aid.  We have had a number of meetings recently about this matter.</P>
    <P>Through the decision on measures concerning the possible negative effects of the reform programme on least developed and net food importing developing countries adopted at the end of the Uruguay Round, Ministers agreed to establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure the implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round on trade in agriculture does not adversely affect the availability of food aid at a level which is sufficient to continue to provide assistance in meeting the food needs of developing countries, especially least developed and net food importing developing countries.</P>
    <P>The report of the Committee on Agriculture to the ministerial conference recommends that action be initiated within the framework of the food aid convention, with a view to the establishment of food aid commitments sufficient to meet the needs of developing and net food importing developing countries during the Uruguay Round reform process.  The aim would be to cover a wider range of donors and donable foodstuffs than currently covered by the food aid convention, to develop guidelines so that an increasing proportion of food aid is provided in full grant form and-or on appropriate concessional terms and to improve the effectiveness and positive impact of food aid.  The EU fully supports approval of these recommendations by the WTO conference.</P>
    <P>The EU also supports the adoption at the ministerial conference of a plan of action for least developed countries which should have a <Col N="365" /> beneficial effect in relation to food security.  The plan calls for a wide-ranging effort in favour of the least developed countries, including improved market access and increased technical assistance. The EU, which already provides almost full duty free access for the exports of the least developed countries, will examine how it can best respond through practical measures to the plan of action.</P>
    <P>Although food security goes well beyond the <Col N="366" /> issues of trade on which the WTO conference will focus, I am happy to report to both Deputies and the House that the importance Ireland and its EU partners attach to the issue will be given full recognition in Singapore.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 3 December 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme, A Government of Renewal contains a commitment to tackle disincentives and eliminate obstacles to people taking up employment opportunities, in particular, atypical employment opportunities such as part-time, seasonal or casual work.  In line with this commitment, I included a provision in this year's Social Welfare Act which is designed to simplify the system of assessment of earnings from employment for unemployment assistance purposes and thereby improve the incentive for unemployed people to take up casual and part-time work opportunities.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements, which come into force this week, an unemployed person who works up to three days a week may, subject to the level of his or her earnings, qualify for the full rate of unemployment assistance for that week, including payment in respect of the days in the week on which the person worked.  The improved arrangements provide that earnings will be assessed at 60 per cent.  In addition, persons without children will be allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings will be assessed at 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>The current arrangements, which are now being replaced, provide that payment is only made in respect of the days in the week on which the person is unemployed, less one sixth of their weekly means for each day of unemployment. Claimants are allowed to earn up to £15 above the appropriate daily rate of unemployment assistance before being assessed with means. However, no payment is made in respect of days of employment, irrespective of the level of daily earnings.</P>
      <P>By abolishing the disincentives associated with the current system, the improved measures will ensure that claimants have an incentive to work at all levels of earnings even where the level of pay is less than the rate of unemployment assistance.  For example, a married person with two children who works for three days in a week and earns £60 will be better off by £28.70 under the new arrangements which will also make it easier for people to see clearly for themselves just how much better off they will be if they take up part-time or casual employment as opposed to claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvements which I am introducing also fully address one of the principal difficulties associated with the operation of the current <Col N="368" /> unemployment assistance system which was identified by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems in its recently published final report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, a statement setting out the nature and extent of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland has already been prepared and published as part of the national anti-poverty strategy, as has an evaluation of submissions from the voluntary and community sector, the social partners and other interested bodies and individuals.  Regional seminars to discuss the submissions received have also taken place.  Progress to date reflects the major degree of consultation which has taken place.</P>
      <P>The key issues and policy areas which must be tackled if the strategy is to be a success have also been identified for action.  These are: educational disadvantage; unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment; income adequacy; regenerating disadvantaged areas with concentrations of poverty; tackling poverty in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Subgroups have been established for each of these key themes which include not only Government Departments but also national representative organisations of the voluntary and community sector as well as the social partners. Each key theme group has also held a consultation seminar to ensure that as wide a range of views as possible has been taken into account.</P>
      <P>The groups, which have been meeting over the last few months, are now in the process of finalising their reports and it is intended that they will report back to the interdepartmental committee very soon.  When this has been done, policy areas will be identified which cut across Departments and strategic responses will be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to note that individual Government Departments have also begun the process of examining and reviewing their own policies and operations from an anti-poverty perspective.  In this regard, my Department is involved in a major review of all its activities, the majority of which last year involved expenditure of over £4 billion and impact on poverty.  These <Col N="369" /> reviews are due to be completed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The type of institutional mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the issue of reducing poverty and social exclusion is firmly on the agenda of all Government Departments and agencies and that there is appropriate co-ordination across and between Departments in this area has also been discussed.</P>
    <P>A review is being carried out to identify what institutional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that the issue of social exclusion remains a high priority.  My Department has engaged a consultant to aid in this process and he has recently reported.</P>
    <P>A one day consultation seminar to gather views on this issue was recently held in Cork.  The finalisation of the overview statement will take place this year particularly in light of new Economic and Social Research Institute statistics relating to the extent and nature of poverty due to be available before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is intended that a report to the UN will be made before the end of the year setting out progress to date and a strategy for the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Haughey's question regarding the talks under way concerning a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> it is important to stress that the talks are ongoing and remain confidential.</P>
    <P>However, I have observed the broad range of support which has to date been indicated among the various social partners for the continued development of the strategy.  This is something I would wish to encourage.  While the talks are still under way and while nothing has been finalised, the next national programme could play an important part in underpinning the development of the strategy in its objective in tackling poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1993 the National Pensions Board in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> set out the aim that there should be a national pension system which would provide pension benefits which would maintain a <Col N="370" /> reasonable relationship with previous income levels, so that established standards of living could be maintained.</P>
      <P>Following that report a number of seminars and conferences have been held to consider the effect of the ageing population on pensions in the future.  I would like to stress that there is no danger to anyone's pension entitlement. However, this is an issue which we cannot afford to ignore, therefore it will be firmly put on the agenda so that all the options are explored and the necessary decisions taken and implemented so that the retirement years of people in the future are safeguarded and secured.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the National Pensions Board was that a survey of occupational pension schemes should be carried out to establish their coverage and adequacy.  The last major survey related to 1985 and it was essential that up to date information should be available which would be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions were being formulated.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Department of Social Welfare and the Pensions Board jointly commissioned a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute.  This report entitled <i>Occupational and Personal Pension Coverage 1995</i> was published recently.</P>
      <P>The report shows that pension coverage is roughly the same now as it was over ten years ago.  The overall coverage for those at work stands at 46 per cent while, as the Deputy points out, the coverage rate for employees has fallen from 54.4 per cent in 1985 to 52 per cent in 1995.</P>
      <P>Having considered carefully the findings of the report, the Department in conjunction with the Pensions Board is sponsoring a national pensions initiative.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the initiative is to facilitate a national debate on how to work towards a national pension system consistent with the aim of providing pension benefits which maintain a reasonable relationship with previous income levels so that established standards of living can be maintained.</P>
      <P>This initiative will be a two stage process.  Stage one involves the production of a consultation document which will form the basis for general discussion among all interested parties, the social partners and the general public.  This document will set out the information and data currently available on pensions coverage in Ireland and the key issues that now need to be addressed.  These issues will include coverage, the delivery of this coverage, its efficiency and fiscal and economic implications.  The document will also describe the alternative models of pension provision that exist in other relevant countries.</P>
      <P>The consultation document will be available early in January.  Responses to it will then be invited with a deadline for receipt of these likely to be the end of March 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stage two of the initiative will then involve: processing and analysis of the responses to the <Col N="371" /> consultation document, reviewing critically selected pension models from other countries, relating these to Ireland and developing options in the Irish context, and preparation of a report including the formulation of recommendations on the actions that need to be taken to achieve a national pension system in line with the aim of the National Pensions Board as articulated in its final report.  The target date for the completion of this stage is next summer.</P>
    <P>This is a very important time for pensions policy.  We need to look comprehensively and very carefully, over a relatively short timeframe, at the present position.  We then need to make decisions and, most importantly, to carry those decisions through so that we face up to and deal with the medium and long-term issues to ensure that the living standards of future generations of pensioners are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>This national pensions policy initiative is the first step to achieving this.</P>

      <P>Up until 1995 social welfare local offices <Col N="372" /> carried substantial amounts of cash to make unemployment payments.  These payments are now made at post offices and as a result a significant potential hazard to social welfare staff has been removed and the same level of security as previously required is no longer necessary at the Department's offices.</P>
      <P>However, I am conscious of the need to ensure the safety of staff at all offices of the Department and, consequently, security systems which provide for the personal protection of staff are installed or maintained, as required.

      <P>Social welfare payments are also made through a number of social welfare branch offices which are operated on a contract basis.  These payments are still made in cash.  The security of these offices is the responsibility of the branch managers.</P>

      <P>The lack of integration between the various social services of an income related nature administered by Government Departments and State agencies has been a matter of concern for some time.  This lack of integration results in duplication of effort by those agencies involved in administering income support schemes, for example, each agency carries out its own means test.  This has been highlighted on a number of occasions by the Committee of Public Accounts and various commentators.  Complaints have also been received from people regarding the number of times they have to provide the same information to different State agencies in order to receive their entitlements.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Government approved the publication of the report of an interdepartmental committee on the development of an integrated social services system ISSS.  This report sets out a framework for the development of an integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of publicly funded income support services.  The basic objective is to introduce greater coherence to the provision of these services.  The development of the approach is being progressed within the Civil Service-wide strategic management initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Issues in relation to data protection were highlighted in the ISSS report.  These issues included the use and disclosure of revenue and <Col N="373" /> social insurance, RSI, numbers and the control on the matching of data.</P>
    <P>I met the Data Protection Commissioner and officials from his office and my Department with a view to progressing the proposals in the report and identifying those areas that might cause concern to him with reference to the exchange of information between the Department of Social Welfare and other Departments.  Discussions are currently taking place at interdepartmental level and between the Data Protection Commissioner's officials and officials of my Department with a view to progressing the matter as quickly as possible and, in particular, identifying the extent to which legislation is necessary towards this end. As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, in the context of the ISSS report, it is envisaged to extend the use of the social services card currently in use by my Department across the public service to provide a better and more efficient service.  The extension of the use of the social services card may entail the inclusion of a photograph on the card.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the requirements and obligations set out under the Data Protection Act to protect the privacy interests of individuals when information about them is processed.  My Department conforms to the requirements set out in the Act and any proposals arising from the development of an integrated social services system will have regard to these requirements.</P>
    <P>Any amendment of the Data Protection Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  However, other options such as the possibility of making some degree of progress by amending other existing legislation and administrative procedures are being examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 48 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The findings of the second part of the independent MRBI survey, which reflect the attitudes and perceptions of the general public towards the Department of Social Welfare and the services it provides, were published in full by the Minister of State at my Department on 11 November 1996.  The first part, which covered the attitudes and perceptions of people receiving social welfare payments, was published at the end of May 1996.  In addition, I am arranging to have the findings of both the customer and the general public stages of this survey produced in booklet format which I will make available.</P>
      <P>The feedback from these surveys is of particular relevance in the development of the strategic management initiative within my Department, in particular in relation to three key strategic action areas, namely, customer service, control of abuse and value for money.</P>
      <P>The findings indicate there is a significant degree of difficulty for those trying to find their way around the various schemes which are administered both by this Department and other statutory bodies.</P>
      <P>As 81 per cent of the general public prefer to make a personal visit or phone the Department when seeking information, we must now review, through our systems and procedures, how we can respond to the need for a more personalised approach to information dissemination.  In this regard I am establishing an internal Information Dissemination Working Group which will address how best we can deliver the right information to the right person in a timely and suitable fashion.</P>
      <P>The security and protection of the social welfare system is an integral part of our business and through our control of abuse programme, we aim to achieve greater strategic and operational control of the system.  In this regard a comprehensive additional programme of measures to tackle abuses of the unemployment payment schemes has recently been introduced.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, however, to continue to raise the level of public awareness and to seek to engage other Government agencies, but also the private sector and the wider community in tackling abuse of the system, whatever form it may take.</P>
      <P>In line with the ethos of my Department of delivering an open, fair and caring service I am committed to continually seeking to improve the quality of our services whilst also ensuring that our systems and procedures minimise the risk of fraud and abuse.</P>

      <P>To qualify for disability benefit a person must be unfit for work due to illness and must also satisfy the relevant PRSI contribution conditions.  Persons who are on waiting lists for medical treatment can qualify for disability benefit on the same basis as applies to applicants generally, i.e. they must be medically certified as unfit for work and satisfy the relevant PRSI contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>As the issue of whether a person is on a waiting list for medical treatment does not affect a person's entitlement to disability benefit, no separate statistics are kept on this category of recipient.  Accordingly, it is not possible to give an estimate of the costs involved in paying disability benefit to such persons.</P>
      <P>It should be noted, however, that very many people who are awaiting medical treatment are not unfit for work or are not eligible for disability benefit, for example, children or elderly people.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a commitment to reduce waiting lists for a range of surgical procedures by continuing the waiting list initiative over the lifetime of the Government.  Under the waiting list initiative, which was introduced in 1993, a sum of £50 million has been allocated to date towards reducing waiting lists.  This includes a sum of £12 million which has been allocated this year.  This expenditure, which is in addition to the normal financial allocation for hospitals, has resulted in a 25 per cent reduction in the numbers awaiting medical treatment since the initiative was introduced.  The Government is committed to continuing to seek further improvements in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary employment and training schemes operated under the auspices of my Department are the back-to-work allowance scheme (BTWAS) and the second chance education schemes.  The BTWAS has proved to be extremely successful in providing a major incentive to the long-term unemployed and to lone parents to re-enter the active labour force either in employment or in self-employment.  I was pleased to announce recently that a further 2,000 places are being provided under the scheme, bringing the total number of places up to 17,000.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme the unemployed and lone parents can retain up to three-quarters of their weekly entitlement and a range of their secondary benefits for three years.  This helps to provide a vital financial cushion during the early years of employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>The recent report published by the Employment Equality Agency entitled <i>Pathways to Employment for Women Returning to Paid Work</i> acknowledges that the specific objectives of the scheme justify a focus on persons in receipt of social welfare payments.  While the report suggests it is arguable that the scheme should be extended to include adult dependants, it does not advance any compelling arguments in support of this view.  The EEA report also proposes that the second chance education schemes operated by my Department be extended to the adult dependants of persons in receipt of relevant social welfare payments and to deserted wives and survivors in financial need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major priority for the Government at the moment is to improve access for disadvantaged <Col N="377" /> people to employment or to activities that will increase their opportunities to secure employment.  The range of measures which we have introduced this year &mdash; including, for example, substantial PRSI reductions, the retention of child dependant allowances for the long-term unemployed who are taking up unemployment, the increase in the number of places available under the back-to-work allowance scheme, and improvements in the family income supplement &mdash; demonstrate the seriousness of the Government's intentions in this area.</P>
    <P>In designing measures which will have a tangible and lasting effect on the problem of long-term unemployment, there is clearly a need to optimise the deployment of the available resources.  In this context, it is appropriate that the schemes operated by my Department should continue to be targeted at the people who are wholly or mainly dependent on long-term welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has introduced a range of coordinated measures, specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed, which are designed to provide the necessary supports and incentives to enable them to re-enter the active labour force and thus to share fully in the benefits of our economic growth.  In this year alone, I have introduced a series of pro-employment reforms of the social welfare system which are aimed at making it easier both for employers to create new jobs and for the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, to avail of employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures include an increase in the PRSI-free allowance from £50 per week to £80 per week with reductions in the employer PRSI rates from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent in the case of the lower incentive rate and from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent in the case of the main rate; an increase of £10 in the income limits applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, which means that most current recipients are getting an increase of £6 a week; the continued payment of increases for dependent children for up to 13 weeks to people in receipt of such increases at the full rate who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks; the reform of unemployment assistance which is designed to simplify the arrangements for claiming unemployment assistance and to make it more <Col N="378" /> attractive for recipients to take up part-time or casual work opportunities; an increase of 5,000 in the number of back to work allowances from 10,000 to 15,000 places during 1996.  In view of the success of this scheme, the Government recently approved a further increase of 2,000 in the number of allowances bringing the total up to 17,000; a further substantial increase in the monthly rates of child benefit.  By channelling resources to child benefit, which is a universal payment, as opposed to child dependant allowances which are lost on taking up employment, the disincentive effects of the latter payments are greatly lessened; the introduction of a new one-parent family payment from January 1997.  This new payment will merge the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit and is designed to make employment a more feasible option for lone parents; improvements in the third level allowance scheme through the provision of a £100 book grant and through the granting of a payment equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit to students currently on reduced rates of payment of the allowance; the Department of Enterprise and Employment, and the Department of Education also have a range of programmes to assist the unemployed to gain access to employment.</P>
    <P>The problem of long-term unemployment requires the sustained application of effective measures by a number of Departments and State agencies.  The Government has demonstrated its total commitment to tackling this deep-rooted problem and I assure the Deputy that I will continue my programme of social welfare reform which is aimed at removing any existing disincentives to employment and ensuring that the system operates effectively in terms of providing both income support and the support necessary for people to re-enter the active labour force.</P>

      <P>To qualify for old age contributory pension, the person concerned must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people, self-employed or otherwise.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records, the person concerned became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988.  He was then aged 57.  As a result, he will not qualify for old age contributory pension under the current legislation when he reaches pension age of 66 years in 1997.  The Department will formally assess his eligibility for either a contributory or a non-contributory old age pension about three months before his 66th birthday in late 1997.  If he does not qualify for either type of pension, he can apply for a refund of the old age contributory pension element of his PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board, in its final report <i>Developing the National Pension System</i>, put forward a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions.  These include proposals for a wider scale of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to a lower average number of contributions over an insurer's lifetime.  However, it also recommended that the minimum number of paid social insurance contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from the current level of 156 (three years) to 520 (ten years) contributions.  This report and its many recommendations are being studied within my Department at present.  I intend to bring forward proposals in due course on the issues addressed by the National Pensions Board, particularly relating to the question of <i>pro rata</i> pensions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement (FIS) is currently available to employees on low earnings with children.  This year I introduced a significant number of improvements to FIS, including an increase of £10 in the weekly income limits used to determine entitlement, thereby ensuring that most recipients received an increase of £6 per week.  Other improvements in FIS introduced this year include a reduction, from six to three months, in the minimum period which the employment is expected to last; a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in order to qualify for FIS, from 20 hours per week to 38 hours per fortnight; the extension of FIS to jobsharers and increasing the rate of FIS payable on the birth of a child, rather than awaiting the annual review of entitlement.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance (UA) appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim UA.  The rate of UA payable depends on the person's means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under another improvement, which I introduced this year, child dependant increases now continue to be paid for a period of 13 weeks to people who have been in receipt of an unemployment payment for 12 months or more, if they take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks.  This improvement overcomes one of the difficulties encountered by some families during the transition from <Col N="381" /> unemployment to work, as it will take some weeks for a person to establish entitlement to FIS following the termination of a claim for an unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the extension of FIS to self-employed people with children would cost in the region of £30 million in a full year.  This cost is in addition to the existing expenditure involved in providing unemployment assistance to self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances.  In view of the very significant additional costs involved, the question of extending FIS to self-employed people could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks of each year.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, the scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  Under that scheme a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill-health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement.  An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the local community welfare officer.</P>
      <P>Any extension to the duration of the national fuel scheme would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context. It is estimated that to extend the scheme for one month would cost £7 million.</P>
      <P>In the five year period from 1989 to 1995 expenditure on the national fuel scheme increased by almost 65 per cent.  This year a sum of £44 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme has commenced to ensure it is operating effectively and equitably. Independent consultants have been engaged to carry out the review and the adequacy of the current period of the scheme will be examined in this context.

      <P>While I am anxious to ensure people with disabilities are enabled to avail fully of the free travel scheme, I have been advised that it is very difficult to modify existing public transport vehicles to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities, and particularly those who use wheelchairs.  At the very least, boarding ramps and extra hand rails would be required on each vehicle along with specially reserved spaces on board.</P>
      <P>Rather than attempt to adapt existing buses, it is the view of CIE, for example, that it would be more appropriate to purchase new vehicles specially designed for passengers with disabilities. Clearly, the costs involved would be substantial but it is my view that the needs of people with disabilities cannot continue to be ignored.</P>
      <P>The recently published report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities makes a number of recommendations in the area of mobility and access to transport.  It recommends, for instance, that every CIE, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus depot should have at least one accessible bus by June 1997.  It further recommends that the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications should subsidise the additional costs of such vehicles.  In this regard my Department will be consulting with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications regarding the issue of accessible transport generally.</P>
      <P>My Department's free travel scheme is expected to cost a total of £32.88 million this year, of which private operators will receive a sum of £1.25 million.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built-up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas. This was later extended to Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by almost 65 per cent in the last five years from £26 million in 1989 to £42.8 million in 1995.  This year a sum of £44 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the scheme.  This includes an amount for the increase in the income <Col N="384" /> limits from £10 to £15 which I announced in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Increasing the level of the allowance would have significant cost implications.  The estimated annual cost for every £1 increase in the fuel allowance would be an additional £7.12 million. A corresponding increase in the rate of the smokeless fuel allowance would cost an additional £2.34 million.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme has commenced to ensure it is operating effectively and equitably. Independent consultants have been engaged to carry out the review and the adequacy of current rates of payment will be examined in this context. The consultants are due to report to my Department in December.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the research which was commissioned by the Department and is being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, will be finalised and published by the ESRI before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Also being completed by the ESRI is a report into poverty in the 1990s in Ireland.  This study utilises the 1994 Living in Ireland Survey to provide an updated picture of the extent of poverty in Ireland and who is affected.  Both reports form part of a substantial programme of research being carried out at the ESRI sponsored by the Department of Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>Together with the national anti-poverty strategy, these studies and other key reports, such as that of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare, will contribute to informing public debate on the issue of poverty, while also providing a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current rates of social welfare entitlements and the standard of living of social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>With regard to levels of payments, in 1985, the Commission on Social Welfare estimated that the minimum adequate income required by a single adult was £50 per week.  This was termed the &ldquo;main rate&rdquo; and is equivalent to £68.10 in 1996 terms.</P>
      <P>At that time, the only social welfare schemes that provided rates of payment at or above the main rate were old age contributory pension, retirement pension and some occupational injury schemes.  All other payments were between 64 per cent and 93 per cent of the main rate.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in recent budgets in bringing rates of payment up to the minimum identified by the Commission. Increases in this year's budget brought all social welfare payments to the minimum of 92 per cent of the main rate after compensating for inflation. The widow's-widower's contributory pension reached the main rate when the budget increases were implemented in June.  The bulk of the remaining payments are now at least 95 per cent of the main rate.</P>
      <P>The appropriate levels at which payments will be set in 1997 will be considered in the budget context.</P>

      <P>I first refer the Deputy to the replies I <Col N="386" /> gave to Questions Nos. 66 and 96 on 16 October 1996.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, the proposed Poverty IV Programme, which requires unanimity, has been blocked by two other member states.  This remains the position.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the Deputy may already be aware, the European Commission, in view of the continuing failure to agree a multi-annual programme at Council, had taken the step of setting up schemes to support, by way of once-off grants, anti-poverty projects throughout the Union.  Now, following a reference to the European Court by one member state, the Commission's competence to do so, in the absence of the authorisation of the Council, has been stopped, at least for the time being.</P>
      <P>In the face of these impediments to the Union's undertaking anti-poverty action under the legal bases in the current Treaty, I had secured the agreement of my colleagues in Government to the advancement by Ireland of a proposal within the Intergovernmental Conference, IGC, to include within the new Treaty a specific provision which would improve the Union's competence to engage in such programmes.  I have made it a principal aim of my Presidency to promote our proposal both among fellow member states and among interest groups.  To this end I have had, over recent months, bilateral meetings with several of my ministerial colleagues, including the German, Finnish, Greek and Spanish Ministers.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have used all opportunities open to me to promote our proposal publicly.  Last month, for instance, I urged support for this approach at two major events at the European Parliament.  The first of these, on 17 October, was a meeting organised by the European Anti-Poverty Network at the Parliament and attended by both interest groups and members of parliament.  On 23 October, I addressed a plenary session of the Parliament which went on to adopt a resolution fully supportive of my plea for action within the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Flynn attended both events and outlined the related proposal of the Commission for the incorporation into the body of the revised Treaty of the Social Chapter currently annexed by way of a Protocol to the Treaty plus its amendment to include an improved basis for action against exclusion.  This would have a similar aim and effect to our proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the Council of Ministers, I have taken the view that there is no point at this time in seeking to discuss directly the existing Poverty VI Programme proposal.  However, I have been leading a broadly-based discussion on the major challenges facing social protection systems throughout Europe, in response to the Commission's communication of last October entitled <i>The Future of Social Protection.</i> Discussion to date has concentrated largely on the issue of what social protection systems should be doing to contribute to the fight against unemployment.  To this end I expect to secure the <Col N="387" /> Council's agreement at our meeting of 2 December to a resolution urging member states to ensure their systems are properly focused on this aim, including the particular need to address the problem of re-integrating the most marginalised groups among the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Thus I am confident that before the end of our Presidency I will have succeeded in securing agreement among my colleagues to the principle that our social protection systems should do more to facilitate reintegration of the socially excluded into the world of work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have. Different methods of assessment are applied in the various social assistance schemes.  For example, in the case of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, the first £400 is assessed at 5 per cent and capital in excess of this amount is assessed at 10 per cent.  For old age pension purposes, an initial disregard of £200 is allowed, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are about 430,000 people in receipt of a social assistance payment.  In view of the large number of recipients involved, it would not be feasible, from an administrative point of view, to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a significant number of recipients as rates fluctuate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1996, I made known that I was taking the opportunity of the introduction of the new one-parent family payment and the new disability allowance to commence the process of standardising the provisions for the assessment of capital across all the various social assistance payments.  Under the new provisions, the first £2,000 of capital will be disregarded, the next <Col N="388" /> £20,000 will be assessed at 7.5 per cent and capital in excess of £22,000, if any, will be assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The extension of these provisions to other social assistance payments will be done progressively over a period of time in view of the significant administrative implications involved. The means of all social assistance recipients with capital will have to be reviewed on the introduction of any changes in this area.</P>
    <P>The substantial £2,000 initial disregard under the new arrangements will significantly reduce the effective interest rate for most recipients and will mean that claimants are not effectively assessed at 7.5 per cent until their level of capital approaches £25,000.  The cost of extending these arrangements to other social assistance payments is in the region of £9.5 million in a full year.</P>

For example, last year the weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse was increased to £150 a week and the scheme was further improved with the inclusion of carers who look after the recipients of occupational pensions.  In this year's budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance was increased by £5 to £67.50, which is an 8 per cent increase on last year's rate.</P>
      <P>In addition, new regulations have been introduced which change the basis of assessment of means of carers for the purpose of determining entitlement to rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  As a result of these changes, carers who are receiving rent or mortgage interest supplements from the health boards can now benefit by as much as £29 a week.  The new regulations also mean that some applicants who previously failed to qualify on the basis of their means are now in a position to qualify for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further development of the carer's allowance is currently being examined in the context of a review of the allowance which is being carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health, having regard to general health care provision in <Col N="389" /> the home for elderly and disabled people requiring care.  In this regard, all aspects of the current operation of the carer's allowance are being considered in the light of our experience to date.  The findings contained in the recently published reports of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, <i>A Long-term Support Framework for Female Carers of Older People</i> and <i>People with Disabilities: 1996-2011,</i> and the <i>Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities</i> are also being taken into account in this review.  Proposals arising from the review would have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to prioritise any particular aspects of the report of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems recently published listing various suggestions which should be addressed over the next two to three years.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22171/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received the final report of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems early this summer.  The report sets out comprehensively the poverty traps and work disincentives in the current tax and social welfare systems, reviews a number of possible approaches to reform and sets out priorities for future development of the system.  I welcome the group's report.  In charting options for future reforms, the report provides a significant and unique contribution to public debate in the area of poverty traps and work disincentives.</P>
      <P>The two key priorities identified by the group are reform of child income support and tax reform.  I fully accept that these are priorities for action over the next few years.  In relation to income support for children, it is now widely recognised that some aspects of the State's income support for children contribute to poverty traps and disincentives to work.  Reform of this is essential.  As the working group's report points out, as well as the incentives arguments, there are strong social reasons for giving priority to tackling unemployment among families with children, in order to break the cycle of unemployment and poverty being passed down from one generation to the next.</P>
      <P>The Government programme already commits us to reform in this area, and we have already taken steps to reduce the disincentive effects associated with the current structure of child income support.  We have gradually improved child benefit while reducing the relative importance of child dependant allowances.  Child benefit has been increased by 45 per cent since the Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report makes it clear that reform of child income support must continue.  The group did not <Col N="390" /> reach agreement on what form this should take, but puts forward a number of different ways in which the overall system of child income support could be improved from the point of view of incentives.  The Government will look at these options very carefully in order to develop the best strategy for continuing reform in this area.</P>
    <P>The second priority identified by the group is the need to pay particular attention to the taxation of people on low incomes.  The expert group's report recommends that policies for taxation of the low paid should be directed towards limiting and eventually abolishing the exemption limits, by increasing personal allowances at a faster rate than the exemption limits.  The Government has already made considerable progress on reducing the tax burden. Over the last two budgets, the personal tax allowance for a married couple has increased by £600; the general exemption limit for a married couple has also been increased by £600 over the last two years.  Progress has also been made on widening the tax bands.</P>

      <P>In line with previous years, this year's Christmas bonus will be paid to people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments including those receiving old age, retirement, widow's, widower's, invalidity pensions, lone parent's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, carer's allowance, disability allowance, formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance, as well as FÁS and CERT trainees.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments, such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment aassistance at the short-term rate, are not eligible for the Christmas bonus.  I have no plans at present to enable recipients of short-term payments to qualify.  Any extension of the Christmas bonus along those lines would have substantial cost implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>This year's Christmas bonus will cost a total of £41.7 million.  As in previous years, it will amount to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments and there will be a minimum payment of £20.  It will be paid during the first week of December and will benefit almost 800,000 recipients and their 500,000 dependants, that is, a total of 1.3 million beneficiaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The appropriate level of social insurance contribution rates is that which maximises employment creation and retention while maintaining and improving pensions and benefits for workers who have made social insurance contributions during their working lives.  This is a judgment to be made in the light of changing economic and social circumstances.  In Ireland the level of social insurance contributions, including employer's PRSI, is low by international standards.</P>
      <P>The position is reviewed each year in a budgetary context.  Regard is had to the amount of finance needed to maintain and where possible improve the old age contributory pension, the retirement pension, the widow's pension and the other contributory pensions and benefits. Specifically in relation to employer's PRSI contributions, regard is also had to the extent to which low rates of employer's PRSI might assist employers to create additional jobs and maintain existing jobs.</P>
      <P>I do not see scope for overall reductions in the total amount of social insurance contributions because of the need to protect the position of the 405,000 people who are paid weekly pensions and benefits based on social insurance contributions which they have made during their working lives. However, changes in the structure of contribution rates are possible in order to meet specific requirements which arise from time to time, including the need to maintain and improve competitiveness and the overall employment environment.  Significant reductions in employer's social insurance contribution rates have been introduced in the last three budgets at a recurring cost of £162 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employer's PRSI exemption scheme ensures that employer's social insurance is not a barrier to job creation where an increase in the company's workforce can be achieved by hiring first time workers or unemployed people.  Almost 10,000 applications have been received from over 7,000 employers since this scheme commenced in <Col N="392" /> April 1995 and over 7,800 approvals have been issued to date.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the important role played by PRSI in Irish life, to both employees and employers, and of the changing social and economic environment in which it operates, I have recently launched a discussion document, Social Insurance in Ireland, to stimulate a public debate on all issues relating to this topic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Social insurance is payable on maintenance payments where there is a legally enforceable agreement between the former spouses unless the individuals concerned are entitled to, and opt for, joint assessment for income purposes.  Where social insurance is payable, the former spouses' individual incomes, whether from employment, maintenance payments or other sources, are not regarded in aggregate as &ldquo;the same moneys&rdquo;.  In particular, maintenance payments are not regarded merely as a transfer from one individual to another such as is the case with a married or cohabiting couple who have not separated.  In these circumstances, each individual's income becomes an entirely separate entity for social insurance purposes.</P>
      <P>Where the couple is separated but the marriage has not been dissolved or annulled and both continue to live in the State, the individuals concerned may opt for joint assessment for income tax purposes i.e. as if they were still living together.  In these cases, maintenance payments are disregarded for the purposes of PRSI, income tax and levies even if paid under a legally enforceable maintenance agreement.</P>
      <P>This option was extended in the Family Law Act, 1995, to couples who have a foreign divorce where neither has remarried.  A provision in the Divorce Bill, which shortly will be enacted, will extend similar treatment to people who, in the future, obtain divorces in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Maintenance payments that are not legally enforceable have no significance for PRSI, income tax of levies.  In effect, they are treated as a transfer similar to income sharing between a cohabiting couple.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this year, I set up a special task force to examine issues relating to the security of older people living alone or with other <Col N="393" /> elderly relatives.  One of the primary recommendations of this group concerned the need to provide elderly people with specific information and advice on how to improve personal security both inside and outside their homes.  On foot of this, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice and the Garda, undertook an information campaign which involved mailing information packs to more than 320,000 homes throughout the country.  This was supported by the provision of a free-phone helpline to enable people seek further information or clarify any matters of concern to them.</P>
      <P>The information pack included a number of useful and informative leaflets prepared by the Garda and dealing with general security matters. It also included a detailed breakdown of the amount of savings or capital a person can have without impacting on his or her pension entitlements.  As you know, contributory pensions are based on the person's PRSI record and are therefore not affected by capital, savings or income from other sources.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of a non-contributory pension must satisfy a means test but savings or capital up to a certain level can be disregarded.  The information pack is intended to inform people of the amounts they can hold without affecting their pension entitlements and to enable them to consider options for placing money in financial institutions.</P>
      <P>I have also written to a number of the main financial institutions requesting that they take a more pro-active role in advising older people of the various savings and investment options available to them and I look forward to a positive response from them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child dependent allowances are payable in <Col N="394" /> respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget I continued the policy direction which I initiated last year with regard to financial support for children.  Following on from the increases given last year, child benefit was increased by £2 per child per month from September.  This has brought the monthly payment to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  Taking the last two years together, a 45 per cent increase has been provided in respect of the first two children and a 36 per cent increase for other children.</P>
    <P>Child benefit remains one of our most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes as it is not taxable, is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc.  Therefore, it cannot act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    <P>I will be considering further improvements in the system of child income support in the context of formulating proposals for next year's budget. In this regard, I will be taking account of the findings of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems in relation to the provision of child income support, which are contained in the recently published final report.</P>

      <P>The primary services available from my Department to people with disabilities, and their families, are invalidity pension, disability allowance, occupational injuries scheme and the carer's allowance.  Invalidity pension is available to people suffering from a long-term illness or incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disability allowance scheme replaced the disabled person's maintenance allowance formerly administered through the health boards. Responsibility for this area was transferred to my Department in October 1996 and the new disability allowance included a number of improvements which broadened the scope of the scheme.  The means test arrangements were amended to increase both the amount of capital <Col N="395" /> and a spouse's earnings which can be disregarded when assessing entitlement to this allowance. Other improvements included extending the period of payment for people admitted to hospitals and a continuation of child dependant payments up to age 22 for those who remain in full-time education.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance provides a weekly payment to people looking after an elderly or incapacitated relative on a full-time basis. Improvements to this scheme in 1996 included an 8 per cent increase in payment rates, increasing the amount of the spouse's earnings disregard to £150 per week and abolition of the clawback rule for rent and mortgage supplements.  The occupational injuries scheme provides a payment to people who are injured in the course of their work or contract an occupational disease.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities who satisfy the statutory conditions may also qualify for additional benefits such as free electricity or gas allowances, free TV licence and telephone rental and also free travel, including a compansion pass for public transport where necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years my Department has introduced a facility for the payment of a wide range of social welfare entitlements by electronic funds transfer to personal accounts at banks and other financial institutions including An Post.  This facility is not available to recipients of the following social welfare schemes &mdash; old age contributory and non-contributory, survivor's-orphan's, retirement and invalidity pensions; long-term disability, death and child benefits; back-to-work and disability allowances.  At present, over 102,000 customers <Col N="397" /> have exercised this option.  As a next step in this process, the facility is being extended early in the new year to people receiving non-contributory survivor's pensions.  It is intended to extend the facility of payment by electronic funds transfer further to encompass all social welfare customers.</P>
    <P>These developments are taking place within the context of the overall aim of ensuring that the most modern and the widest range of payment methods are available to social welfare customers.

      <P>Under existing legislative provisions, payment of arrears on foot of late claims, other than in the case of child benefit, are generally limited to six months.  As I have indicated in replies to earlier parliamentary questions, any relaxation in the current arrangements would have substantial cost implications and would have to be considered, therefore, in the light of other priorities.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that social welfare beneficiaries receive their full entitlements.  To that end, my Department is continuously examining options for improved targeting of information which will ensure that people are aware in time of their entitlements.  However, it must be emphasised that people generally have an obligation to acquaint themselves of their entitlements.  It would be unreasonable to expect the Department of Social Welfare to be responsible for people who fail for various reasons to make a claim.</P>

    <P>The permanent staff of the Department of Social Welfare provides such material on social welfare matters.  I am also fortunate to have the expertise of the Department manifested in major social policy documents and initiatives such as the <Col N="398" /> report of the Expert Working Group on the intergration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems, the discussion document on social insurance, the national anti-poverty strategy, the Commission on the Family and other social policy documents.</P>
    <P>The non-permanent members of staff, whose appointments are strictly temporary and are linked to my current term of office as Minister for Social Welfare, may provide documents and draft speech material on matters I consider appropriate to facilitate me in carrying out the role of a Minister in Government.</P>

      <P>Arising from the findings in the report, the Government has decided to prepare a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has also been authorised to establish a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the commission's recommendations.  The monitoring committee will comprise organisations representing people with disabilities, their families and carers and service providers.  In addition, social partners and Government Departments, including my own Department, will be represented on the monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform will also be establishing an interdepartmental task force to prepare the Government's plan of action. When this has been agreed I will be in a position to indicate the steps which my Department will take to implement those recommendations for which my Department has responsibility.</P>

      <P>As you will be aware, on foot of the report of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development, new mechanisms have been established in order to deal with the development of access and related infrastructural work on the offshore islands, which was identified as a priority issue and towards which the Government made available an additional £1 million this year.  Island access projects are selected and prioritised by the islands committees of the relevant local authorities.  These projects are than assessed by the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee and recommendations regarding funding subsequently made.  Funding in respect of each priority access project is allocated to the relevant local authorities in accordance with normal Government accounting requirements.</P>
      <P>To date in 1996, £157,250 has been made available to Donegal County Council for the development of access services.  Details of projects which have received funding to date are listed in the following schedule.  As Deputies will see from the schedule, works to be undertaken by Donegal County Council include pier works at Inisbofin and Inisfree, minor works at Leabgarrow, Arranmore, repairs to the quay wall at Burtonport and a feasibility study on pier works at Magheraroarty.</P>
      <P>I understand that while the development of Aphort Pier has been included in the long-term programme of works received from Donegal County Council, it is not a priority for 1996.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs the Government's and the EU's response to the declaration issued by the Hague International Court of Justice on 8 July 1996, which stated that the use or threat of nuclear weapons is illegal and that all States have a legal obligation to undertake nuclear disarmament; and the steps, if any, the Government has taken in its capacity as EU President to enforce the findings of the Court.</Quest>

      <P>The advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on 8 July 1996 ruled on the casting vote of the President of the Court that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principals and rules of humanitarian law.  However, the Court could not conclude definitely whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake.</P>
      <P>An important aspect of the opinion was that the Court unanimously concluded that there exists an obligation on nuclear weapons states to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.</P>
      <P>I believe that the examination by the Court of the question of the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons has provided compelling arguments for further and deeper consideration of the moral and legal framework on which the possible use of nuclear weapons has been premised in the postwar period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community had its first opportunity to consider the implications of this advisory opinion at the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York earlier this month.  Ireland voted in favour of the <Col N="402" /> resolution tabled there, joining Sweden and New Zealand as the only three Western countries to do so.  The resolution was carried with 94 countries voting in favour, 22 countries voting against and 29 countries abstaining.  European Union countries voted as follows: Sweden and Ireland voted in favour, Austria, Denmark and Finland abstained, and the other ten countries all voted against.</P>
    <P>Ireland voted in favour of this resolution in order to underline our view that the present moment, in the wake of the court's opinion, offers a particular opportunity for a new signal of resolve to pursue the goal of complete nuclear disarmament and our firm intention to support all efforts in good faith to that end.</P>
    <P>The resolution was not however a perfect one as is shown by the number of countries abstaining and voting against.  The particular means of pursuing negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons, contained in operative paragraph 4 of the resolution &mdash; viz. multilateral negotiations in 1997 leading to an early conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention prohibiting the development, production, testing, deployment, stockpiling, transfer, threat or use of nuclear weapons and providing for their elimination &mdash; are not the sole possible means of achieving this end and the vote showed that they do not command the agreement of all delegations.  In our view, what is needed is a firm call on the international community to consider further the fundamental and challenging questions which the advisory opinion poses.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs the Government's and the EU's response to reports of clashes between Belarusian police and protesters on 17 November 1996 during a demonstration involving several thousand protesters against the referendum to extend President Alexander Lukashenko's term in office which will be held next week.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22841/96]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland, together with partners in the European Union, is deeply concerned at developments in Belarus with regard to the constitutional referendum.  The demonstration in Minsk on 17 November reflected the ongoing dispute in this context between supporters of the President and the Parliament with regard to the respective roles of each.  The controversial referendum proposes to give the Presidency substantially greater powers at the expense of the Parliament and the Constitutional Court, as well as extending the President's term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns of the Government and the European Union regarding the referendum have been made known to the Belarussian authorities on a number of occasions.  I raised these concerns in a meeting, on 24 September, with the Foreign <Col N="403" /> Minister of Belarus at the United Nations General Assembly.  They were also conveyed by the Troika of EU Ambassadors in Minsk on 14 October following discussion of the situation by EU Foreign Ministers at the Special European Council in Dublin on 5 October.</P>
    <P>On 18 October, a Declaration was issued by the European Union calling on all parties to reach a solution which fully respected the prerogatives of Parliament and the Constitutional Court and democratic principles.  On 30 October, the matter was raised again in contacts with the Ambassador of Belarus to Ireland, H E Mr. Shchasny.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have, in my capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, written to President Lukashenko expressing the Union's deep concern at the increasing divisions in Belarus over the referendum, the irregularities in the preparations for, and conduct of, the referendum and concerns about its constitutionality.  The letter also called on Belarus to respect its OSCE commitments and internationally accepted constitutional principals. It made clear the Union's interest in political and economic reform in Belarus and its willingness to assist in that process.</P>
    <P>In spite of these approaches, and efforts also by the Russian Government and Parliament to promote a compromise settlement, the referendum went ahead on 24 November.  The proposals for constitutional change were carried. The President has stated that he will consider the result binding notwithstanding the decision of the Constitutional Court on 4 November that if the referendum went ahead it should be consultative in nature only.</P>
    <P>Most recently, the matter was discussed at the General Affairs Council on 25 November.  The Council issued a Declaration reiterating the Union's serious concern at the situation, and expressed the Union's deep regret that President Lukashenko had stated his intention to declare the result of the referendum binding.  The Union urged President Lukashenko, in the strongest terms, to obey the ruling of the Constitutional Court that the referendum should be of a consultative nature only.</P>
    <P>The Government and the European Union remain seriously concerned at the developments in Belarus and are continuing to monitor the situation, with a view to any further appropriate action.</P>

      <P>The Romanian presidential election was held over two rounds on 3 November and 17 <Col N="404" /> November 1996.  Following the first round, the two leading candidates, incumbent President Iliescu, and his main challenger, Emil Constantinescu, of the Democratic Convention Party, went forward to a second round.  In that second round, Mr. Constantinescu defeated Mr. Iliescu, taking more than 54 per cent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of the election by international observers, co-ordinated by the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights took place on the invitation of the Romanian authorities.  The reports of the international observers have been positive and all are in agreement that the will of the people has been respected.</P>
      <P>President Constantinescu will be inaugurated on 1 December 1996.  The European Union looks forward to working closely with him in the future, and to assisting Romania in the difficult process of political and economic reform.</P>

      <P>The Commission's positive opinion on Cyprus's application for membership of the European Union was issued in July 1993.  In March 1995 the Council committed the Union to open accession negotiations with Cyprus six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, and in the light of its results.  The European Councils at Madrid and Florence confirmed and reiterated this commitment.  The Council remains committed to finding a solution to the division of the island of Cyprus based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation.  It hopes that accession negotiations will help to promote such a solution.</P>
      <P>The Commission's opinion on Turkey's application, delivered in December 1989, while raising questions of a political and economic nature, stressed the fundamental Community interest in intensifying relations with Turkey.  The entry into force of the final phase of EU-Turkey Customs Union on 31 December 1995, the signing in July last of a Free Trade Agreement on products covered by the ECSC Treaty, and Turkey's membership of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership established by the Barcelona Declaration, have all helped the development of EU-Turkey relations.</P>

      <P>On 22 October the chairman of the Provisional Election Commission which was established by the OSCE, Ambassador Robert Frowick, announced that the Commission had taken a unanimous decision to postpose the municipal elections previously scheduled to take place on 23-24 November.  The decision was taken because of continuing political problems in municipalities across Bosnia and Hercegovina and because the parties had indicated that they needed additional time to prepare for the elections.</P>
      <P>The Mission will concentrate on continuing to provide assistance for the preparation and conduct of municipal elections which are now to take place in 1997.  As Presidency, Ireland has stated that the European Union expects that these elections will take place throughout Bosnia and Hercegovina under OSCE supervision, and calls upon the parties to agree to this without delay; considers that problems which arose during the September elections, for example in drawing up voters' lists and in refugee voting, must be addressed in the context of preparations for the municipal elections, and stresses that the primary responsibility to ensure free and fair elections rests with the parties themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the progress achieved to date by <Col N="407" /> the OSCE Mission in Bosnia and Hercegovina, the Mission successfully prepared for and supervised the national, entity and cantonal elections which took place on 14 September 1996. In addition to activities concerned with elections, including the promotion of independent media, the OSCE Mission has also completed much valuable work in the areas of human rights monitoring and in facilitating the monitoring of arms control and confidence and security-building arrangements.  The European Union has paid tribute to the Head of Mission and to all Mission personnel for their work throughout 1996.</P>

      <P>The Euro-Mediterranean Committee for the Barcelona Process which has met on four occasions, most recently on 19 November, has played an important role in taking stock and evaluating the follow-up to the Barcelona process and all its components.

    <P>Positive results have been achieved in the political and security partnership.  There have been five meetings of the senior officials responsible for the implementation of the political and-or security component of the partnership, the latest of which took place on 20 November.  A draft action plan has been formulated which outlines initiatives in a number of areas, including the enhancement of stability and the reinforcement of democratic institutions, confidence and security building measures, human rights and the fight against organised crime and other transnational security themes. Under the Irish Presidency of the European Union, agreement has been reached on the implementation of a number of concrete confidence and building measures.  The positive and constructive contributions made by <Col N="408" /> Mediterranean partners to discussions on these issues has been very welcome.  Despite a difficult political context in the region in recent months, notably in relations between Israel and her Arab neighbours, the political dialogue envisaged by the Barcelona Declaration has developed and matured.</P>
    <P>On the partnership in social, cultural and human affairs, activities to date in this area have paved the way for the implementation of programmes of common interest to increase contacts between the two sides.  An important and successful initiative was the Experts Meeting on Cultural Heritage held in September which has led to the development of a series of joint projects in this area.</P>
    <P>As regards the economic and financial partnership, considerable progress has been achieved towards the objective, agreed at Barcelona, of establishing an area of shared prosperity.  The meeting of Industry Ministers which took place earlier this year was an important contribution to the process of sustainable and balanced economic development. The positive results of this initiative will be complemented by a Conference on Private Investment, currently in preparation and which will take place in London early next year.  The various sectoral thematic activities which have taken place to date have played an important role in establishing a regional dialogue on matters of common interest with a view to the exchange of information, expertise, know-how and technology.  They have also facilitated the establishment of networks among officials and among non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>An essential component of the economic and financial partnership envisaged in the Barcelona Declaration is the creation, by the target date of 2010, of a free trade area for the Mediterranean region.  To date, the EU and its Member States have signed Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with Tunisia, Israel and Morocco and negotiations on similar agreements with Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon are under way.  A negotiating mandate for an agreement with Algeria was approved by Council on 10 June.  A Co-operation Council with Syria was held <i>en marge</i> of the June General Affairs Council.  On 1 October Council approved the text of a draft negotiating mandate for a Euro-Mediterranean Interim Agreement on Trade and Co-operation with the Palestinian Authority.</P>
    <P>The adoption on 23 July of the MEDA Regulation &mdash; the financial instrument for economic co-operation with the Mediterranean partners &mdash; represents a significant step forward in the development of Euro-Mediterranean relations.  The way is now clear for the release of funds totalling more than 2.6 billion ECU allocated for financial co-operation with Mediterranean partner countries.  The funding of indicative projects under the MEDA programme is an important and tangible expression of the European Union's commitment to the <Col N="409" /> achievement of the shared objectives contained in the Barcelona Declaration.</P>

      <P>The Amnesty International report on the human rights situation in Algeria has highlighted the abuse of human rights in Algeria by both Government forces and armed militant groups.</P>
      <P>The political and security situation in Algeria has long been of grave concern to the Government and to our partners in the European Union.  The Union has repeatedly called on all sides to the conflict to cease all acts of violence in order to allow for peaceful dialogue and reconciliation.  While acknowledging that it is for the people of Algeria themselves to resolve the current conflict on the basis of reconciliation, the Union has pointed out that respect for human rights is an obligation on all political forces and individuals in Algeria, and has indicated its support for initiatives aimed at encouraging dialogue between those who reject terrorism and violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most recently, at the Third Commmttee of the UN General Assembly in New York, the Irish Presidency, in a statement on behalf of the European Union, drew attention to developments in Algeria.  The Union condemned all acts of violence whatever the source, and renewed its call for the full respect for human rights.  It made particular condemnation of repeated terrorist attacks, including murder and sexual violence, against the civilian population. The statement reiterated the Union's hope that stability and peace, a peaceful dialogue and free and fair elections will prevail in Algeria as the <Col N="410" /> result of the democratic process begun with the Presidential elections held in November 1995.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Mediterranean partnership between the EU and the 12 Mediterranean states, including Algeria, established by the Barcelona Declaration in November 1995, involves a commitment by its signatories to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to guarantee the effective legitimate exercise of such rights and freedoms.  The Union in the context of this strengthened association with Algeria has stressed the need to make the ongoing political process in that country as inclusive as possible.  It has also emphasised the importance of maintaining respect for human rights, even in times of terrorist threats to security.</P>
    <P>A referendum on constitutional change is to be held in Algeria on November 28.  The new draft constitution states that the Government derives its authority from the people and for the first time guarantees the right to set up opposition parties. It prohibits religion, language, race or gender being used as the platform for a political party. The Algerian Government is committed to holding general elections in early 1997, to be followed by local elections.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as Presidency of the EU, will continue in future contacts to raise the issue of human rights with the Algerian Government and will encourage it to continue to work towards developing the democratic process in the country.</P>

    <P>The United Kingdom Government has indicated that the question of whether the UK will participate from 1 January 1999 will be decided closer to that date.  It is not clear what &ldquo;further anomalies&rdquo; the Deputy has in mind.  I should however mention that a particular focus for the ESRI study on the <i>Economic Implications for Ireland of European Monetary Union</i> which I commissioned earlier this year was an examination of the possible effects where the UK at least initially stayed outside the euro zone.  The conclusion of that study was that, on balance, membership of European Monetary Union, even <Col N="411" /> were the UK not to join, would be beneficial for Ireland.</P>

      <P>Irish residents are taxed here on their world-wide income wherever it arises.  The principle of world-wide taxation on the basis of residence is a fundamental principle in our taxation system. Irish residents who are cross-Border workers are therefore liable for Irish tax on their income accruing in Northern Ireland.  Under the 1976 Ireland/UK Double Taxation Agreement, cross-Border workers are given credit on their tax liability in the country of residence for tax paid in the country of work, regardless of the rates of taxation in operation in the country of work.</P>
      <P>Last year, as the Deputy is well aware, I established an interdepartmental committee to thoroughly investigate the issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers.  The committee found that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purpose of Irish income tax is fair and reasonable <i>vis-à-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers. Consequently, the committee felt that there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that the health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are, of course, entitled to a broad range of health services including in-patient public hospital services subject only to modest statutory charges and outpatient services free of charges.  They are also entitled to a refund of expenditure (including that of dependants) over £90 per calendar quarter on prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of medical card eligibility is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.</P>
      <P>The provision referred to by the Deputy arose from initiatives announced in the 1996 budget which were specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed.  Arrangements have been put in place by the chief executive officers of the health boards to enable persons who have been unemployed for at least twelve months to retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment.  The chief executive officers have agreed to review at the end of the year the arrangements in place in relation to the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that in assessing medical card eligibility single parents with dependants and widowed persons with dependants are <Col N="413" /> treated under the same guidelines as a married couple with dependants.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): In 1992, in an effort to assist the development of speech and language therapy services, my Department arranged for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, at Trinity College Dublin, commencing in the 1992-93 academic year.  This allowed the total student body to increase in phases from 80 students in 1993 to 104 students in 1995-96.  The increased level of graduate output resulting from this development has assisted in improving speech and language therapy services in recent years, with the recruitment of 28 additional therapists in the last three years.  Notwithstanding these improvements, it is clear the service requires further development.  This issue will be given careful consideration in the context of the report of the review group on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities which has examined speech and language therapy services amongst its review of health services generally for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have placed particular emphasis on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools <Col N="422" /> referred to by the Deputy will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which dates in some cases from 1893, are well advanced.  The size of the Bill has necessarily required detailed attention on the part of both my Department and the Attorney General's office.  I am pleased to say that a first draft of the Bill, involving almost 200 sections, has been received from the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
      <P>Discussions to finalise the text of the Bill are taking place with the parliamentary draftsman at present.  After finalisation Government approval to publish the Bill will be sought.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from a number of sources, including the local residents associations, regarding planting in this area.  As part of the planting grant application assessment process undertaken by my Department considerations such as ecological and archaeological importance are addressed.  In this case my Department liaised with a number of competent agencies regarding the site.  These included, from an archaeological perspective, the National Monuments Service of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, from an ecological perspective, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the same Department and, from a landscape perspective, Cork County Council, and account was taken of their advice.</P>
