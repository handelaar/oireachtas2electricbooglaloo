      <P>It is proposed to take No. 5 &mdash; motion concerning Consumer Information (Consumer Credit) (Revocation) Order, 1996; No. 13 &mdash; Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 1996 &mdash; Second Stage <i>(resumed)</i> and Remaining Stages; No. 16 &mdash; statements on Delivering a Better Government &mdash; A Programme of Change for the Irish Civil Service <i>(resumed):</i> No. 36 &mdash; motion concerning Health Insurance Regulations, 1996; and No. 14 &mdash; Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995 &mdash; Report and Final Stages.  Nos. 36 and 14 shall be taken at the conclusion of the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 20 and the order shall resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 5 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 36 shall be brought to a conclusion within two hours and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of the main spokesperson for the Fianna Fáil Party, of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) <Col N="1838" /> Members may share time; and (iv) the main spokesperson for the Fianna Fáil Party shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes; the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 14, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Health; Private Members' Business shall be No. 24 &mdash; motion re Defence Forces <i>(resumed)</i> and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>There are four matters to put to the House.  Is the proposal that Item No. 5 shall be decided without debate satisfactory and agreed? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Item No. 36 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with item No. 14 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Private Members' Business this evening satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised the crisis in the beef industry arising from BSE and related matters yesterday the Taoiseach's initial reaction was that Members on this side of the House were manufacturing an issue.  I thank him for having changed his view overnight and allowing a debate on the subject tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More importantly, as the incoming President of the European Council, what action does the Taoiseach consider necessary &mdash; within the Troika or directly on his part, to avoid a potential disaster at the Florence Summit?  I have no doubt the British Prime Minister's remarks will be discussed in every Parliament of the European Union today, as he made serious threats which have enormous implications for the Irish Presidency, namely that the conclusions of the Florence Summit will be vetoed, which would be detrimental to our <Col N="1839" /> Presidency and which we utterly condemn. He said he will disrupt every Council, economic and monetary union and the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate on the subject this morning; it is not in order.  I understand that a debate has been arranged on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be very glad to discuss that issue because of statements made in recent days which greatly affect the price of Irish beef in the marketplace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern, let us not debate the issue now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the remarks and statements of the British Prime Minister &mdash; which would be detrimental to the Irish Presidency, the operations of the European Council and various Council meetings in the weeks ahead &mdash; what action does the Taoiseach consider he should take to prevent this disruption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to determine that the matters referred to by the Deputy are appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's Question Time on 24 April I put a question to him in relation to the collapse of the Duncan extradition case when he told me that he knew with certainty that no fault lay with the Attorney General's Office.  I take it, if the Taoiseach knew with certainty that no fault lay with the Attorney General's Office, he was aware of all the facts of that case.  Yet he went on to tell the House he had no <Col N="1840" /> reason to believe there was any fault on the Irish side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy Harney, it is not in order to raise the matter now.  If the Deputy feels she is entitled to elaboration on this matter, she may raise it in many other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you told me on 24 April, A Cheann Comhairle, when you accused me of queue jumping&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did, I was quite in order in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach transferred my question.  This is no ordinary matter; extradition is a sensitive issue in Anglo-Irish relations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy Harney, if you are dissatisfied with the Taoiseach's reply or that of a Minister in this House, Members have a remedy.  It can be raised again and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to raise it again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I could indicate to the Deputy how she can raise it &mdash; indeed she knows that anyway &mdash; but it is not in order to do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken more than six weeks to establish that the fault did not lie with the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy Harney, I must ask you to desist from any further reference to this matter. If it is to be raised it must be done in accordance with the procedures of this House and in no other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why did the Taoiseach fuel the view in this House on 24 April that the fault lay with the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the <Col N="1841" /> Deputy can table further questions, raise the matter in the ordinary way or by substantive motion in Private Members' time.  There are many ways of raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of public interest and the Taoiseach should say why he told the House what he did on 24 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

That she subsequently did and, as a result of that investigation, she made a subsequent statement which indicated that there had been an omission on the part of the Garda Síochána on the Irish side.</P>

As far as anything I said is concerned, and in so far as the Office of the Attorney General is concerned, I will answer all questions on that matter next Tuesday.

Will the Taoiseach agree to take questions today?  There are very serious questions which should be answered as quickly as possible because of the issues involved.  The Taoiseach holds his position because his predecessor failed to be accountable to the House in matters to do with extradition and answering Dáil questions.  Because of the serious issues involved, because it has taken nearly six weeks for the facts to emerge and given the answers he gave in the House on 24 April, we need to know when the Taoiseach found out, who handled the case and so on.  We should be told this afternoon. Will the Taoiseach take questions today?</P>

      <P>What I am willing to do, if this can be agreed today in the House, is waive the requirement that all questions for next Tuesday be tabled by 12 noon, for the purpose of tabling questions on this matter.  In so far as those questions relate to my responsibilities which include anything I have said, the Attorney General's office and its administrative role in this function, I will answer them extensively next Tuesday. That is the best way to proceed.  I do not think that a debate in which one has set-piece speeches is the way to get <Col N="1867" /> information.  A question and answer session is probably better.  We will have half an hour at Taoiseach's Question Time next Tuesday which can be extended, if necessary, to ensure Deputies exhaust the subject.  That is acceptable to me.</P>

      <P>The live register is an administrative count of applicants for unemployment assistance, claimants of unemployment benefit and other registrants, including persons signing for social welfare credits. The number on the live register in County Meath was 3,855 in December 1994; 3,830 in April 1995; and 4,133 in April 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that there is increasing unemployment in County Meath.  The figure for April in each of the years 1993 to 1996 were as follows: 1993, 4,839; 1994, 4,334; 1995, 3,830 and 1996, 4,133.  There were 706 more people on the live register in April 1993 than in April 1996, and there is no need to remind the Deputy who was in power and who was Minister for Finance in 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Meath was not by-passed. For example, in 1995 ten projects were approved by the IDA for Meath, giving a total of 1,179 jobs.  One of our success stories has been the county enterprise boards and between 1993 and 1996 Meath County Enterprise Board approved £647,515 for projects &mdash; in 1995 a sum of £348,925 was approved.  Between 1993 and 1996 a total of 146 projects were approved, giving a job potential of 237 full time jobs and 32 part time jobs.  The live register figure for April 1996 was 700 less than for April 1993 when the Deputy was Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House on this matter because the Minister of State has been sent in to defend the position.  The reality is that there have been several hundred fewer people working in Meath since this Government took office.  The policies in that county have been an abject failure. Despite the fact that 40,000 jobs were created in the last year that I was Minister for Finance, Meath failed to benefit from any of them.  I wish the county enterprise board well.  There is a huge number of applications before the board which has insufficient funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group has undertaken a number of studies to date.  Apart from <Col N="1874" /> a study of the former Department of Industry and Commerce and work on the need to introduce administrative budgets, the work carried out by the group has been primarily in the defence area.  In 1991, the EAG examined the organisation of the Department of Defence and, following on this study, a number of changes were introduced including the delegation of greater financial responsibility to the military authorities.  A further study by the EAG in 1992 focused on internal military administration and sought means by which efficiencies could be implemented within the military structure.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the Government decided that a radical overhaul of the Defence Forces should be undertaken under the aegis of the EAG, based on a revised statement of roles for the PDF.</P>
      <P>The EAG commissioned Price Waterhouse to carry out a comprehensive review of the operations of the Defence Forces and the group then made proposals to Government for change.  The Government accepted the broad thrust of the EAG recommendations and decided that an implementation group should be set up under the aegis of the EAG to draw up a detailed and fully costed three year plan for the first phase of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  This plan was approved by Government and details were announced in March of 1996.  The implementation plan covers the first three year phase of the implementation of the change process and is being implemented on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The plan recommended, among other things, that further in-depth studies should be carried out on the Air Corps and Naval Service.  The EAG is currently in the process of selecting management consultants to carry out these studies.  It is expected that the selection process will be completed very shortly and the reviews will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>It appears the administrative budget system which was very <Col N="1875" /> much part of the EAG's initial work has been changed by the Minister for Finance &mdash; I am not sure if he has changed the name only or the system.  Perhaps the Minister will give some information on the system.  The subject matter of the changes in the defence area are before the House and I will leave that to my colleague, Deputy Smith, who put down a Private Members' motion on the issue this week.  One of the functions of the Efficiency Audit Group when it commenced operation many years ago was that in the examination of areas of the State in terms of staffing it would identify areas with excessive requirements and recommend where those people could be redeployed.  Has that body suggested any area where staff could be redeployed and has its recommendations been implemented in the State structure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's first point about administrative budgets, my Department does not have details on how effective they have been, but overall they are deemed to be a success.  It is no secret that their one drawback in terms of numbers employed in each Department is that they allowed for numbers in the Civil Service to increase more quickly than the Government expected at the time.  Generally we must give more autonomy to Departments, and administrative budgets are considered to be very effective.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wants more detailed information on the specifics, Department by Department, he should put down a question to the Minister for Finance who is in a better position to provide such information.  What was the Deputy's second point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>A study on that has not been completed by the EAG, apart <Col N="1876" /> from the study on the former Department of Industry and Commerce, the recommendations in relation to administrative budgets and a major body of work on the Defence Forces.  The EAG is examining efficiency and effectiveness in the area of non-national roads and county councils.  The Department of the Environment has requested that a study be undertaken on the efficiency and effectiveness of council operations on non-national roads.  The terms of reference are being finalised and it is hoped to conclude the study by the end of this year.  Apart from what I have mentioned, a major study has not been completed, but if the Deputy wishes to table a specific question on that matter or if he wants a specific response I can arrange for it to be forwarded to him.</P>

      <P>It is bad policy if the Efficiency Audit Group is trying to undertake a specific task while the document, Delivering Better Government, which is the Strategic Management Initiative, is before the House and at the end of December last the Minister for Finance announced a new embargo on staffing in the Civil Service. That embargo has now been altered but it is meaningless until we get further details; I will table a separate question to the Minister to find out what he intends to do in that regard.  Administrative budgets seem to have been sidetracked. In trying to manage the Civil Service we seem to be going nowhere in a hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point about the Efficiency Audit Group in relation to the SMI and the document, Delivering Better Government, the question of the most appropriate structure and method of operation of the Efficiency Audit Group within the overall framework of the Strategic Management Initiative is currently being reviewed, particularly in light of the structures for implementation proposed in Delivering Better Government, and decisions will be made on this shortly.  The Minister for Finance announced changes in what has <Col N="1877" /> become known as the embargo &mdash; although there never was an embargo. Positions had to go to Government for ratification as they could not be automatically ratified &mdash; because of the framework now provided in Delivering Better Government to deal with these issues.  Nobody can deny that the so-called embargo was always accepted as an unscientific and crude weapon.  Procedures are now in place to deal with these matters so that fire brigade action is needed &mdash; the reason for the embargo.  The EAG, numbers in the public service and other such issues are all part of Delivering Better Government and later today, time permitting, we will embark on a discussion of that document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trespassing somewhat but I can give a brief reply.  I have given some consideration to that matter. This morning I met some members of a large strategic group on customer services. The NSAI delivered a paper on its position in the public sector, what it has done to date and its recommendations for the future.  We are cross-fertilising with the NSAI, the private sector and various others to ensure we get it right in relation to customer relations focus and standards generally. Delivering Better Government, announced by the Taoiseach on 2 May, is the overall framework and details are coming through daily in this regard. This afternoon I will attend a meeting with officials on the detail roll-out for the next 12 months.  It will take up to <Col N="1878" /> five years to get all the pieces in place but there is a serious political commitment to it.  There is political commitment on all sides to get the renewal of the public sector right because it is in all our interests that we deliver on this.  We are doing that with the civil and public service and all parties who have gone on the record both in this House and at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on this matter.  The Deputy will recall it was the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who launched the SMI two years ago last March.  This is not a political issue.  It is in all our interests as public servants.  We are elected public servants; civil servants are appointed.  We are here to deliver a service and I hope in the years ahead we deliver a quality service that is more customer focused.  If there is not a press release or a glossy brochure every day the Deputies opposite should not assume action is not being taken in this area.  I assure the Deputy that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, an <Col N="1879" /> action plan to provide a strategic focus for the economic and social development of the west was launched last week in Athenry by the Western Development Partnership Board.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed the action plan and announced a number of important initiatives which I will co-ordinate and which will greatly contribute to the Government's continuing commitment to the development of the west.</P>
      <P>The Government responded to the key recommendation of the plan by announcing the establishment of a Western Investment Fund.  This fund will provide long-term venture capital for developing businesses in the west which are not currently attracting funding from commercial or State agencies.</P>
      <P>A number of other important initiatives have also been agreed by the Government in response to the wide-ranging recommendations of the action plan including the establishment of the Western Development Commission to replace the Western Development Partnership Board when it completes its term of office at the end of the year; the undertaking by the National Economic and Social Council of a study of settlement patterns in the interests of more balanced population distribution; and the establishment of a working group of officials for relevant Departments to develop proposals for more effective agricultural and fisheries policies to support low-intensity family farms and small scale marine enterprises.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the action plan for the development of the west will be the subject of statements in the House shortly and a comprehensive statement of the Government's positive response to the plan will be given at that time. This will also give the Deputy an opportunity to go into the matter in further detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report. Will the Minister of State agree there are contradictions in presenting this report in a week when there is talk of <Col N="1880" /> closing more than 70 dole offices in rural areas and more than 22 ESB offices?  How does that fit in with the action plan?  I know the Minister of State is doing his best to bring forward plans to stem the depopulation of the west but to do that he needs resources and he has outlined to me in recent months that he does not have the necessary resources.  Will the Minister of State clarify the areas the Government is proposing to fund over and above what it funded before the plan was launched?  What amount of money is available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy gave us a prologue about dole offices and ESB offices closing in the west and in other areas.  It is not true that dole or ESB offices are closing.  There was an agreement between ESB management and unions in regard to certain offices in the west. Because of that union agreement the ESB decided to proceed with this initiative which was part of the overall package.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Deputy's concerns about the closure of these offices, private people in the areas affected will provide a commercial outlet for electrical goods.  The quality of the service by the ESB in future will measure up to that provided before the offices closed.</P>
      <P>As far as the western development fund is concerned, the Government decided to invest £25 million, as asked for in the plan.  This will aggregate to approximately £100 million when the European Union, European Investment Bank and private funds are taken into account.  If this money is matched, there will be a total capital investment of £200 million in the west.  This funding will be for developing businesses which do not currently attract funding from commercial or State agencies.  It will be the commission's job to police this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to spend an additional £200 million indicates its earnestness to halt population decline and is an effort to give particular opportunities to people in the west who have suffered the greatest population <Col N="1881" /> decline of all.  The tone of the Deputy's question seems to indicate that he very much regrets that such an investment will be made.</P>

Is the Minister of State saying that in addition to the amount in the subheads in the final Estimates on yesterday's Order Paper, which was printed prior to the launch of the western development fund last week, the Government is providing an extra £100 million and is hoping there will be a matching fund or is it taking money from these various subheads, putting it into a plan with a glossy cover and presenting it as something new?  It is either one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not listening because I already explained how the western development fund will be allocated.  The Government made a commitment to give £25 million over six years and that amount is expected to be matched by the European Union, the EIB and private sources.  If one adds matching funds in the west, there will be a total sum of £200 million over six years.  It is intended to set up the commission on 1 January 1996, whereupon I expect the Government to provide in the Estimates its share of the money.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the position, that the Government will spend only £4 million out of the promised £200 million on the plan this year.  Is that £4 million additional to the amount in the Book of Estimates, which was printed in its final form yesterday, or is it part of the same money?</P>

      <P>This money will be available on 1 January 1997; it does not <Col N="1882" /> relate to 1996.  This money will be in next year's Book of Estimates.  The aim of this plan is to provide additional capital to the west.  I have been criticised for this but I am happy that substantial funds have been allocated and that the Government agreed with the thrust of the plan.</P>

As there are approximately 420 United States companies operating in this country, 16 of them along the Border counties, is the Minister aware of a current Private Members' Bill before the US Congress which if passed &mdash; this is of vital concern to the Minister &mdash; would allow tax incentives for American companies to set up in Northern Ireland?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Western Development Partnership Board produced what I understand was a ten-year plan but the Minister is speaking about an investment of £25 million over six years, the equivalent of £4.1 million per year which is less than £5 per head of population in the west.  I welcome any investment in the west but it is much less than is being spent in the east.  Will the Minister give an indication of what will happen over the ten-year period and the possibility of the funding being increased?  I am disappointed that the funding will be as low as £25 million spread over six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been at pains to answer this question.  The action plan was drawn up by the Western Development Partnership Board, which I inherited as Minister of State.  This board was selected by the previous Government.  The only two appointments in which I had any influence were the two who came from County Clare, Olivia Loughnane and Eamon Kelly. All the other members had been selected by the outgoing Government.  The action plan proposed an investment fund along the lines I have mentioned. The board asked the Government to invest £25 million and the Government has agreed to make that sum available. It also indicated the other sources, the EIB, the EU and private sources.  When the Western Development Partnership Board committee this plan to paper it had already established that there were some private sources.  It had already been to the United States and had examined private sources.  This £100 million will be made available over the six years.  The entire fund when matched by the £100 million will amount to £200 million.  This is a reasonable start and is much more than was available last year.</P>

I will be working with the Commission to ensure that as much as possible of the plan is implemented in the short time available to me.  I am concerned also about a private members' Bill, mentioned by Deputy McDaid, in the United States Legislature.  If the Bill were brought forward by the President or the majority in the Senate I would be concerned. However, I am concerned that such proposals exist and I will be glad to make inquiries through the Minister for Tourism and Trade about the expectation for this legislation and whether there is a need to lobby.  I am pleased the Deputy brought the matter to my attention.</P>

      <P>When is it anticipated that NESC will commence a study on resettlement patterns and how long is it envisaged that study will take?  Will the Minister of State indicate the type of business projects which will be drawing down either £4.1 million, £25 million, £100 million or £200 million?  As a Deputy from the west I would sincerely like to get a hold on what money will be available in 1997.  If there are such projects pending the people who will be employed would dearly like to know the amount of money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The brief to NESC is to commence as quickly as possible.  I am glad the Deputy asked that question as it shows he is <i>au fait</i> with the plan and has read it.  Settlement and resettlement is a big issue.  This is mainly being championed by a private company, Rural Resettlement Ireland, which was set up in County Clare.  I would like to see more resettlement taking place in the west.  I understand that Rural Resettlement Ireland has approximately 4,000 applications from Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation areas for <Col N="1886" /> migration to the west.  The real problem is that Rural Resettlement Ireland does not have the facilities to place all those who are eager to resettle.  It is important that the resettlement patterns be studied. As outlined in the NESC report, there are strong towns in the west and in particular counties, but there are also weak and marginal towns which are being swamped by progress in the major centres.  The Government is anxious that the resettlement study commence without delay.  When I have a firm date I will come back to the Deputy and give him an outline of what is intended.</P>
      <P>In regard to the funds available, the guidelines will be similar to those for NADCORP when it was in business. There are some investments which can be for short-term gains.  It is not envisaged that money would be left in profitable ventures.  The aim would be to turn around profitable ventures, dispose of the asset and invest in another so that it would become a rolling fund.  The Western Development Partnership Board deserves support in this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the report and the positive response to it by the Government.  Will the Minister of State say whether this investment fund will try to attract money from ordinary people in the west who may have some money put aside?  Will he persuade his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, to change the rules in relation to means testing of capital so that this money will become available &mdash; something for which I have fought for 20 years &mdash; for reinvestment in the west and not lie under mattresses and other places?  Will the Minister of State agree that regardless of how many action plans there are, we need a change in the criteria under which investment in infrastructure is assessed?  So long as investment in infrastructure, particularly at EU level, is assessed on the number of beneficiaries per unit cost, the west will always get the thin edge of the wedge on development money.  We have seen this happen <Col N="1887" /> in relation to roads, water and sewerage money.</P>

That appears to contradict the Minister of State's proposals.  In his plan for the west, does he propose to make the island of Ireland a local call area for telephone charges?  Trunk calls and faxes are a heavy cost burden for individuals and small businesses in the west.  Why should they subsidise the 01 area in Dublin?</P>

    <P>The decision to close ESB shops in local towns is part of a national strategy agreed between the ESB and the <Col N="1890" /> unions.

The call-out service is the only service that may be affected. I understand from the ESB that the existing engineering services will not be affected.  While I am not responsible for the ESB, I am concerned about the provision of services.

      <P>Being frequently reminded of the marked increase in the numbers of people at work since Fianna Fáil turned our economy around in 1987, is the Minister aware that, over the first year in office of this Government, that happy position is not applicable in Donegal as figures released by IDA-Ireland and Forbairt show a net loss of nine jobs in the region?  Furthermore, is he aware that yesterday the Chairman of the International Fund for Ireland specifically named Donegal as an area of high unemployment?  What does the Government intend to do about that?</P>

      <P>The question before us is essentially a statistical one and we may not delve into policy matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures bear out the fact that employment or unemployment in Donegal &mdash; whichever description one wants to use &mdash; is static, some 12,000 throughout the county with minor variations.  Indeed the relevant figures for the different employment exchanges in Ballybofey, Ballyshannon, Buncrana, Donegal, Donegal Control Office, Dunfanaghy, Dungloe, Killybegs and Letterkenny are uniform.  Therefore, while the position has not improved substantially, it certainly has not deteriorated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> Indeed when the Deputy's party Chief Whip answered similar questions previously, it was generally accepted there were distortions between the actual unemployment figures and those shown on the live register.  It is accepted that the live register is not an accurate gauge of the true level of unemployment, reflecting those in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, those who sign on for three days or more per week but also reflects &mdash; and this is where the distortion occurs &mdash; a FÁS scheme applicant who must also sign on as must an applicant for half the spouse's benefit.  In addition, the circumstances surrounding the equality provisions of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, have caused further distortions.</P>
    <P>While the disparity in the figures is in the region of 80,000, that is not peculiar to this country but confirms to experience generally throughout the European Union.  Somebody came to my clinic recently who had received an order for £87,000 to buy furniture for a bar in Manchester, advertised on a local radio station, but was unable to find the requisite three skilled or semi-skilled carpenters.  He then approached his local employment exchange where he was unable to obtain the necessary details, because they are confidential. He then approached his local FÁS office, where he was unable to recruit <Col N="1893" /> the requisite three carpenters, as there were none on the register in Castlebar. Therefore, there is some distortion in regard to the accuracy of the live register; it is not an accurate gauge of unemployment. While not trying to make excuses for the figures in Donegal, it is accepted throughout the European Union that the only accurate gauge of employment and unemployment figures are the April returns of the Labour Force Survey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting what the Minister of State said, when one observes the figures furnished by IDA-Ireland and Forbairt, one realises they too are constrained by investors wishing to locate in specific regions.  I hear them comment continuously that investors want to invest in areas with a large population, close to ports, with a young workforce and so on.  Can the Minister impress on IDA-Ireland that Donegal is close to our fourth largest city, where there is a university and a regional technical college, from which several hundreds of well educated young people emerge annually?  It is close to the seaports of Larne and Belfast and airports; yet IDA-Ireland or Forbairt do not appear to target anything in that direction, indeed their statistics appear to be based on circumstances prevailing on the east coast because of the facilities available there?  Can the Minister impress on IDA-Ireland that other regions of the country have high levels of educational facilities and infrastructure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more than prepared to convey the Deputy's remarks to IDA-Ireland but we might anticipate that that agency might well counter mine and the Deputy's observations by highlighting the fact that one of our largest clothing industries &mdash; Fruit of the Loom &mdash; is located in Donegal and that Omega shirts is beside it. Indeed, throughout the length and breadth of the county, there is substantial evidence of semi-State activity in <Col N="1894" /> attracting foreign, very successful overseas industries.  Therefore, as an industrial base, it has proven its attraction.</P>
      <P>I opened a new radio station in Donegal town recently when, having spoken to people right across the political spectrum, particularly those at local authority level, I had the impression there is marked confidence in Donegal, whose county enterprise board has been very successful to date in the matter of job creation in the small, neglected sector and forging its niche in that region.</P>
      <P>County Donegal also has the largest community school in Carndonagh and a fine, growing regional technical college in Letterkenny.  Therefore, my overall impression is that Donegal does not lack much either industrially or educationally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the establishment of country enterprise boards was a brilliant idea, how does the Minister of State expect £1.1 million worth of projects last year and 27 valid projects this year to be funded through a quarterly allocation of £90,000?  While, according to the Minister of State, unemployment in the county may be static at present, places like Inishowen, must rely on industries such as Fruit of the Loom.  Other regions focus on fewer numbers of large industries, so that we need help in the case of small industries not being replaced.  Will the Minister of State ensure greater allocation of funds to the county enterprise board and talk to his colleague in the Department of the Marine to advocate greater allocation of resources which would have massive implications for our unemployment figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly convey Deputy Keaveney's comments to the <Col N="1895" /> appropriate people.  As she knows, the Foyle Fisheries Bill, at an advanced stage of preparation, will be introduced shortly.  Indeed one of Donegal's successes has been its county enterprise board, based on whose results, the case for additional funding is self-evident.  In addition Donegal will be one of the major beneficiaries of the plan announced last week by the Taoiseach, elaborated on by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey today, falling very much within the scope of the £200 million to emanate from four sources &mdash; the European Union, the Government, European Investment Bank and private investors.  If one takes the cumulative effect of all the agencies, plus the plans coming on stream, one can predict a bright future for Donegal.  I hope the Deputy will not lose her seat next time round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on most topics published by the Central Statistics Office is already available on a regional basis.  The principal area in which it is now planned to develop regional statistics is in the compilation of overall economic accounts.  The ESRI has carried out a study into the methodology and compilation of these accounts in respect of the year 1991 and this is at present being examined in the CSO.  It is planned to publish the first set of regional accounts for 1991 later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having raised this matter in November last, the Minister will be aware that I am endeavouring to establish how soon figures will be available to submit a case for a European Union <Col N="1896" /> funding for particular regions.  He indicated to me on that occasion that such work was in hand.  Therefore, I am disappointed that the information relates to 1991 because I thought it would have been more up-to-date.  Can the Minister of State fill me in on more recent figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there has been a delay as the basic problem was to devise the correct methodology, which is now in place.  We already have the 1991 figures, the 1992 figures are coming on stream and the 1993 figures are ready for publication.  When the system has been honed, refined and its efficacy proven, the relevant information will be available much more speedily.</P>
      <P>Regional accounts will never come on stream as quickly as national ones because in the case of the former one is working to a different set of criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it too soon for the Minister of State to predict whether there is good news for particular regions in regard to eligibility for European funding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy, for the sake of my constituents, I am very conscious that while we bask in our greatly improved economic growth, at 81 per cent, the fact that the 75 per cent threshold is in place is a cause for anxiety and very much exercising the minds of those at present involved in negotiations.</P>
      <P>It has been raised at European Union level both in the Parliament and in discussions with the Commission.  We hope it will be successfully resolved.  I have no idea at this stage what the outcome will be.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State lauded the merits of the CSO labour force survey and I should like to know if he has any plans for having the survey carried out more frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as the Deputy is <Col N="1897" /> aware the labour force survey is compiled during the months of April and May and published annually.  The Government is considering introducing quarterly labour force surveys, but no decision has been taken.  As the rest of Europe has moved in that direction, obviously there is a considerable expectation that we likewise will do so.  From the point of view of underlining accuracy and underpinning the distortions in the figures, it is desirable that we move in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12 and 37 together.  The position is the same as that indicated by the Minister during the Adjournment Debate about the future of social welfare branch offices on 17 April 1996 and again in reply to written questions on 30 April 1996, namely that no decision has yet been taken with regard to the future of the branch offices and any such decision will be fully discussed with the branch managers under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which covers <Col N="1898" /> them.  A meeting at official level has been arranged with the Branch Managers' Association for Monday, 27 May 1996 to discuss these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has arisen because the Minister for Social Welfare, announced he was reviewing the future of branch offices.  It is cold comfort to branch managers to be told that the matter will be discussed with them under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Will the Minister of State confirm the guarantee given by his colleague, Deputy Sheehan, at the Cork County Council meeting on Monday that no social welfare branch offices will be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The review to which the Deputy referred has been in progress for several years and was active during the period in which he and his colleagues were responsible for policy. From the end of the 1980s the Department has been engaged in a programme of fundamental change in the way it delivers services to the public and in that regard a number of branch offices were closed while some were continued on the basis of new contracts.  Given that all contracts will not terminate at the same time and all managers will not retire at the same time, it was the established policy, which is under constant review, that each case would be examined on its merits.  That is what the Minister said in replies to questions in this House, copies of which I have with me and, if necessary, I will read them into the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic the Minister of State is following his colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for the west who has been making statements about retaining communities in the west.  Will the Minister of State accept that in rural towns, particularly in coastal areas, the dole office or the social welfare branch office is very important to the town as many people travel to town to sign on.  As a result a considerable sum of money circulates in <Col N="1899" /> the town and its hinterland.  Has the Minister given consideration to upgrading local offices to make them more comfortable and accessible and a source of more information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, consideration is given to upgrading the standard of accommodation and improving the quality of service which the Department provides to its customers, the general public.  This has been ongoing for several years.  In the past five to six years a total of four offices were closed in accordance with the policy.  In some cases they were replaced by modern offices but in others they were not.  The review is continuing and no decision has been made.  Obviously, no decision will be made until all the necessary negotiations which should take place in such cases have been conducted.</P>
      <P>The pivotal role of the branch office manager and his staff is recognised throughout the country.  The suggestion that a decision has been made is most misleading and unfair to branch managers and their staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to the new disability allowance, which will replace the existing disabled person's maintenance allowance from October next, is that the person is, by reason of a specified disability, substantially handicapped in undertaking employment of a <Col N="1901" /> kind which, if the person was not suffering from that disability, would be suited to his or her age, experience and qualifications.</P>
      <P>A specified disability will be defined in regulations to mean an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect, which has continued or may reasonably by expected to continue for a period of one year.</P>
      <P>These provisions are the same as those currently applied in the case of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the large number of people with disabilities strongly object to the use of the phrase &ldquo;substantially handicapped&rdquo; which they consider to be a throwback to old thinking completely ignoring the movement to recognise and remove unnecessary handicaps faced by people with disabilities?  Will he undertake to remove this description?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to remind the Deputy that there was not any objection to such a description in relation to the disabled person's maintenance allowance previously.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the difficulty was in qualifying assessment of means and degree of disability under two headings.  Often the means test was a bigger bone of contention.  The Deputy's point had not previously been brought to my attention and I will take it into account.  However, the change in description sought by the Deputy can militate against some applicants as easily as it can help others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should give an undertaking to remove the description because it is a matter of concern to people with disabilities. They strongly object to it and have communicated their objections to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will the disability allowance section of the Social Welfare Act come <Col N="1902" /> into effect and what statutory instruments does the Minister intend to introduce?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped it will be implemented later in the year, possibly in October, I will communicate with the Deputy about the regulations as I do not have the information to hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister fulfil his undertaking of a few months ago meet the relevant groups with regard to the statutory instruments by which the scheme will be run?  I would like to see the consultation process promised by the Minister being implemented.</P>
      <P>What have been the practical changes in the daily administration of the scheme since it was transferred from the Department of Health?  What differences do they make for a person applying today for a disabled person's maintenance allowance or for a person receiving the allowance?  What future changes are likely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main changes will be that the same regime will apply throughout the country, which is not the case at present as each of the eight health boards has its own scheme.  The schemes are similar to some extent but there are variations.  In one area a person might qualify for disabled person's maintenance allowance while he might not in another.  Under the new regulations the same scheme will apply throughout the country and people will be equally entitled to benefit.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty in meeting concerned groups.  The Minister and I have done so regularly to discuss difficulties which have arisen.  When there are changes in a scheme it is understandable that the people directly affected might feel the necessity to discuss the changes with the Minister or me.  There is no difficulty about that; it would be regarded as reasonable.</P>

      <P>The difference will be that the same scheme will apply throughout the country.  I expect the qualifications required under the new regulations will be at least as amenable as the previous ones.  Previously there were differences between health boards and, although a scheme in one health board area might coincide to a large extent with a scheme operated in another area, the two schemes might not be identical.  Another benefit is that central administration of a scheme will obviously be more efficient from the point of view of recipients and certainly more efficient and cost effective from the point of view of administration.</P>

      <P>This is a typical example of the effect of the tax system. To secure take home pay of £160 per week a worker must earn £232.  The gap is £72 which, for a single earner in that factory, is more than the worker will collect in social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument has been adequately debated in the House.  While everybody will agree it is more cost effective to retain people in employment, it does not always occur.  This is one such unfortunate circumstance.  An estimated 820 employees are affected by the Packard Electric closure.  Some 309 <Col N="1904" /> employees are on temporary lay-off and 511 are due to be laid off in July.  The estimated average unemployment benefit at June 1996 rates will be £68. Assuming that all Packard Electric workers claim UB, the weekly cost is estimated as follows: existing lay-offs of 309 &mdash; £21,000 per week and £1.1 million per year; forthcoming lay-offs of 511 &mdash; £35,000 per week or £1.8 million per year; the total potential cost of 820 employees is £56,000 per week or £2.9 million per year.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong and misleading to suggest that taxation was the only problem.  There were ongoing problems.  I will outline to the House the sequence of events leading to the closure. They were previously outlined on 30 April by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, in response to a Private Notice Question from Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>On 23 June 1995, 400 workers were laid off at Packard Electric.  This was in accordance with an agreement made between the company and the unions. The agreement provided that:</P>
      <P>The company will advise the unions by 15 March 1996</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  of business prospects for 1996.  If prospects are such that a majority of those laid off will be reengaged over the first half of 1996, no redundancies will take effect <Col N="1905" /> until 1 June in accordance with previous practice.</P>
    <P>(b)  If business prospects, however, as of 15 March indicate that a majority will continue on lay-off over the first half of 1996, a phased redundancy programme will be on offer from 15 April for those on lay-off for whom a return to work date has not yet been determined.</P>
    <P>(c)  In the case of either (a) or (b) above the period of lay-off will be included in reckonable service for redundancy calculation and minimum notice calculation purposes.</P>
    <P>On 14 March 1996, Mr. Ferreira wrote to the employees to reiterate: &ldquo;we are all committed to increasing the competitiveness of the Tallaght plant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 2 April the company advised the Department of Enterprise and Employment that, because of difficulties in obtaining final details of its future business, it would not be in a position to inform the workforce of the proposed redundancy programme by 15 April 1996.  In response to a request by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the company met the unions on 12 April and indicated that it expected to be in a position at the end of May to make an announcement about the redundancy programme and its plans for the future of the plant.</P>
    <P>On 19 April Mr. Battenberg, President of Delphi and Vice-President of GM, in response to a call from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, arranged a meeting with the Minister and the Taoiseach to discuss the Packard plant. On 29 April Mr. Battenberg informed the Minister and the Taoiseach that the company had reluctantly concluded the plant did not have a viable future and it was intended to phase out the operation by the end of July next.</P>

      <P>In relation to my Department, the document in question calls on the Government to combat the growing problem of child and family poverty.  The universal child benefit payment is one of the most important State supports for children and for families. More than one million children and almost half a million families benefit from it.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements were introduced in the monthly rates of child benefit in 1995 and again in 1996.  The new rates from September 1996 will be £29 for each of the first two children and £34 for the third and subsequent children. Over the two years involved, a 45 per cent increase has been provided in respect of the first two children and a 36 per cent increase for other children.  In addition, since last year child benefit is payable up to age 19 for those in full-time education.  Further improvements have been made in the family income supplement for families at work on low pay and in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  A new grant of £500 has been introduced for twins at birth, at age four and at age 12.</P>
      <P>Last October, the Minister established the Commission on the Family to examine the needs and priorities of families in the rapidly changing social and economic environment.  The commission will recommend to the Government how families can best be facilitated in the support and development of individual members, it will make an interim report to Government by October 1996 and a final report by June 1997.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the Barnardo's document will, of course, be borne in mind in the context of further improvements in child income support being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The NESF report, Opinion No. 3, sets out the forum's views on the measures aimed at tackling the problem of long-term unemployment which were announced by the Government in the budget earlier this year.</P>
      <P>In general terms, the report welcomes the broad thrust of the decisions taken by the Government in this area in that they represent an important step towards the development of a coherent and integrated approach to tackling long-term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the report acknowledges the significant advances which have been made in a number of areas, including the extension of the thresholds governing qualification for family income supplement; the proposed revision in the <Col N="1908" /> manner in which earnings from employment will be assessed for unemployment assistance purposes; the increased number of places to be made available on the back to work allowance scheme; and the decision to allow for the retention of child dependant allowances for the first 13 weeks of employment by the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The report also supports my intention to further refine and develop the prowork innovations introduced in the budget in the light of the recommendations contained in the final report of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems which will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>The report expresses reservations about some specific aspects of the measures announced in the budget and believes they will not, of themselves, be sufficient to achieve significant reductions in the number of long-term unemployed.  The Government is, nonetheless, aware that the problem of long-term unemployment is not one capable of being resolved overnight and is, accordingly, fully committed to the further development of opportunities for the long-term unemployed to share in the benefits of our economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there are now more long-term unemployed than when the Government came to office, will the Minister accept the critical conclusions in the report?  For example, it states that the measures will require a greater push and direction at political level &mdash; obviously this is not being done &mdash; that the economy is performing well, that a unique opportunity is being lost and that the Government should embark on a more decisive programme. What specific measures are the Government taking to reduce the number of long-term unemployed?</P>

      <P>The Government fully recognises the importance of tackling the problem of long-term unemployment and the report welcomes the broad thrust of the measures taken by us in the area of social welfare reform, the refocusing on community employment, the development of wholetime job options, etc.  The NESF believes that further radical measures are required to reduce the unacceptably high level of long-term unemployment, and the Government also accepts this.  The Government and the Minister fully appreciate the magnitude of this problem which did not arise over the past 18 months but which has existed for a considerable period.  This unacceptable problem is not in the interests of the economy and the Government introduced a number of measures specifically aimed at reducing the number of long-term unemployed.  The schemes to which I referred are designed to deal with this serious social and economic problem.</P>

      <P>The subjects of these questions are within the functional responsibility of the Irish and British police forces and fall within the departmental remit of the Minister for Justice. It is not my function to be apprised of and accountable for the detailed operations of every Department of State.</P>
      <P>Apart from media reports late last night, I first became aware that the reason for the failure on 13 April of the extradition application for Mr. Duncan definitively lay with the Irish authorities this morning when I received a copy of a Garda report on the matter dated 21 May.  Lawyers for the State withdrew the application for extradition on 13 April after they discovered that the Garda Síochána had presented to the court an endorsed photocopy of the warrant rather than, as required, the original.</P>
      <P>At that stage neither of the lawyers nor any representatives of the Executive knew how it had happened that a photocopy rather than the original had been presented in court, nor were they in a position to know.  No submission was made by or on behalf of the State as to where the blame lay, nor did Government spokesmen inform the media that the fault for the extradition lay on the British side.  That suggestion was made in open court by the solicitor for Mr. Duncan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the court case the Government spokesperson on duty that weekend was contacted by a number of media representatives and asked if the Government would be commenting on the outcome of the case.  He advised them that, in accordance with normal practice, the Government would not be making any statement on the case.  Subsequently, he was again contacted by media representatives who told him that British sources were suggesting that responsibility for the failure of the <Col N="1913" /> extradition application lay with the Attorney General's Office in Dublin. He contacted the Attorney General who briefed him on the role of the Attorney General's Office in processing extradition warrants.  The press spokesman then conveyed this information to the media, strongly refuting any suggestion of a failure on the part of the Attorney General's Office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I was not contacted by the Government spokesperson on that evening as it was regarded at that stage as a routine inquiry to which he was able to respond adequately on the basis of the information made available to him by the Attorney General.  The full facts of the case only became available yesterday when the Minister for Justice received the report, to which I referred earlier, of the Garda inquiries into the case.  The Minister conveyed these findings to the House at the earliest possible opportunity through a written reply to a parliamentary question and a public statement issued last night.</P>
    <P>Observations reported to have been made by the District Court judge suggested fault on the part of the British authorities.  No submissions to that effect were, however, made to the judge by the lawyer for the State.  During the course of the proceedings in court on 13 April, it was noticed that the warrant produced by the Garda in court was a copy and not an original.  We do not have available a transcript of the proceedings in the District Court, but I can say that the lawyer for the State did not suggest to the court that the document which arrived from England was flawed. That suggestion was first made by the solicitor for Mr. Duncan and was the subject of a subsequent observation by the District Court judge.</P>
    <P>The question first addressed to me on this matter was transferred to the Minister for Justice because, as Deputies are aware, I am not answerable in the House for matters involving the Garda Síochána.  These matters are within the remit of the Minister for Justice.  The conduct of extradition proceedings <Col N="1914" /> necessarily involves the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána.  These different responsibilities have been specified in statutes passed by the House.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor anybody acting on my behalf blamed the British authorities or anybody else for the failure.  The Minister for Justice ordered a full inquiry into the events which led to the difficulties. The results of this inquiry became available on 21 May and were made available to the House the same day.  I remind the House that Mr. Duncan is in custody, facing a serious charge under the Offences Against the State Acts, and I caution Members against saying anything which would prejudice either the prosecution of Mr. Duncan or his entitlement to a fair trial.</P>

      <P>In chapter six of the guidelines the Taoiseach produced soon after he took office regarding the Office of the Attorney General, he stated that all important and sensitive cases, including extradition cases and cases involving minors, should be brought to the immediate personal attention of the Attorney General.  Did that happen in this case?  If so, and the Attorney General dealt with the file, was it not obvious to him that the warrant was a copy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I substantially answered that question this morning when, as the Deputy will recollect, I made the point that the practice in regard to extradition cases is that the original warrant is passed from one police force to the other.  A copy, not the original, is furnished to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice for their information and the exercise of their responsibilities.  The Attorney General received a copy and on the basis of the material contained in it there was no problem with the details concerned with the extradition from his <Col N="1916" /> perspective and in respect of his responsibilities.  The only difficulty was that the court was not presented with the original document.  While there were plenty of copies available, the original was not.  It was, as we now know, provided by the British police to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>It appears from the report presented to the Minister for Justice yesterday that while the Garda Síochána kept the copies they mislaid the original, probably, in the process of making copies.  It appears that, where previously it might have been easy to distinguish a copy from the original, the copying facility is so good they made a number of copies and destroyed the original in the process with the result that when the matter was examined in court it was discovered that what they were presenting was not the original, but a copy.</P>
      <P>That is not something the Attorney General for whom I am answerable in the House would have known about as he did not have custody of the original at any time.  That was a matter for the Garda Síochána; he, simply, had access to a copy to satisfy himself of the validity of other matters affecting the extradition from his perspective.</P>

      <P>The facts of the matter were given to the House by the Minister for Justice in a written reply to Deputy O'Donnell.  Unfortunately, it appears that the original document furnished to the Garda Síochána and no one else was destroyed in their custody because it was thought to be a copy.  All that was retained were copies.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any conception of the role of the Attorney General that he is supposed to be present overseeing clerical operations in the Garda Síochána office to ensure a proper distinction is made between copies and originals. That is a matter for Garda management, not the Attorney General.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in response to the original question, it was during the course of the proceedings in court on 13 April that it was noticed that the warrant produced by the garda was a copy and not an original.  That was not discovered or discoverable before then. I do not have a transcript of the proceedings of the District Court on that occasion so I cannot be definitive but I <Col N="1922" /> understand the lawyer for the State, contrary to the report which the Deputy quoted, did not suggest the document which arrived from England was flawed. That suggestion was first made in the court not by the lawyer for the State as Deputy Woods' quotation suggests, but by the solicitor for Mr. Duncan.  The flaw &mdash; I do not believe that is the proper word &mdash; or the difficulty was not that there was anything wrong in terms of the legal information contained in the document but that instead of being the original document, it was simply a copy.</P>
      <P>As I explained to Deputy Burke, the originals do not go to the Attorney General's office but to the Garda Síochána and stay with it until they are presented to the court.  The function of the Attorney General in the matter is to look at the content as distinct from the originality of the documents.  He did so competently and he was not in any way to blame for the fact that those responsible for the custody of the original document were not able to present it to the court.  That was not a matter for the Attorney General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that when a warrant is handed to the Garda authorities by an English police officer it stays in the custody of the Garda Síochána pending instructions as to whether it should be endorsed by the Commissioner and that while it is awaiting such endorsement, the day the document was received is noted on it? It must have been apparent from the Monday following this débâcle in the District Court that they could not find the original document on which they had originally written down the date it had been received and that from that <Col N="1923" /> day on, it was clear the original documents handed over by the British police to the Irish police were not available.</P>
      <P>This House was entitled to be told by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice that the originals handed to the Irish police had gone missing and that the blame lay on this side of the Irish Sea.  Is that not what happened?  We have gone through six weeks of obfuscation and blame shifting when the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice could have told the House on the Monday following this case that the original document handed to the Irish police could not be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, one cannot say definitively that something cannot be found until one has looked exhaustively for it.  When it was discovered that the original was not what had been presented to the court, a thorough search for the original was instituted by the Garda Síochána.  It was only after that thorough search and after other possible causes of the problem had been exhausted that the Garda Síochána presented its report.</P>
      <P>Given that individuals are involved, including members of the Garda Síochána, it is important that before a definitive report on the matter, which could reflect on individuals and how they did their work, would be presented to the House that the Garda Síochána would be thorough in its inquiries.  It is as a result of its anxiety to be thorough in its inquiries that it did not complete its report and present it to the Minister for Justice until yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication of Deputy Michael McDowell's question is that before the report had been completed by the Garda Síochána and before we had satisfied ourselves that there was no other possible explanation other than that the document was irrevocably lost a preliminary report should have been given.  From a political point of view, making preliminary leaps to judgment about matters may be satisfactory, certainly for those in Opposition, but when <Col N="1924" /> the Garda Síochána is carrying out an important investigation concerning its internal procedures and the adequacy of the application of those procedures by its members, it is important that it be thorough.  Because the investigation was thorough, it was not completed until yesterday.  Therefore, the Minister for Justice could not report on it to the Dáil until then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said he thinks he had a conversation with the Minister for Justice, that it was a casual conversation and that he cannot remember when it took place, but that is not good enough.  This is an important issue. I am aware that people are laughing, but if the Taoiseach's predecessor had stood up and said that, I know what he would have said.  I ask the Taoiseach to recall when he had the conversation with the Minister about this matter.  Did the Attorney General tell the Taoiseach before 24 April that the fault was on the Irish side?  Did anybody from the Attorney General's office, or anywhere else, contact the Taoiseach after 13 April to say &ldquo;I think we got the original document&rdquo;?  Did the Taoiseach believe until this morning that the fault lay with the British authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recollect, any more than any other human being does, exactly when casual conversations take place.  The matter was under investigation at that time.  The investigation was not concluded and I was not called upon to make a judgment on the matter until it was concluded.  Anything the Minister for Justice might have said to me would have been related to the possibility that contrary to public comment at the time, not from the Government but from others, including the judge in the case, that the fault lay on the British side, that might not be the case.  That was said to me, but it was not a matter upon which I was called to make a record or take action because the matter was under investigation.  I knew that when the investigation was completed, and not before then, a statement would be made to the House, as was done, giving the full position.  I repeat, as I said previously to Deputy McDowell, that it would be inappropriate for the Minister for Justice to make a preliminary statement pointing the finger in one direction or the other if <Col N="1927" /> she was aware that a definitive inquiry was being undertaken and was not yet complete.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of this side of the House, this procedure has been totally unsatisfactory and the answers given by the Taoiseach have raised many questions.  The so-called casual conversation the Taoiseach had with the Minister for Justice related to an issue that was anything but casual in view of the fact that British officials were asked to resign as a result and that it deals with the liberty of an Irish citizen. The Taoiseach said that no suggestion came from the Attorney General's representative in the court that there was something wrong with the documentation received from the British authorities, but, according to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, that is incorrect.  When and by whom were the British authorities informed initially of the net issue, not the full facts of the final report, when it came to the attention of the Irish authorities, that it was an Irish mistake?</P>

      <P>I am answering the Deputy's colleague and perhaps he will restrain himself to allow me to do so.  In preparing my reply to questions tabled in the last hour or two I have not had access in that short time to a transcript of the proceedings of the District Court, but the information I have received from the people responsible is that the lawyer for the State did not suggest to the court that the document which arrived from England was flawed.  That was not her suggestion, contrary to the report that appears in the paper.  I am advised that that suggestion was first made by the solicitor for Mr. Duncan and was the subject subsequently of an observation from the district justice. That is the best information I can get and to some degree it differs from the information contained in the newspaper article.  I am making no reflection on the professionalism of the people who prepared that newspaper article.  I am simply giving the best available information in so far as I have it in the time I have been able to assemble it on that point.</P>
      <P>It was not possible for the Garda authorities, who were the custodians of the original warrant, to say definitively whether they had received a copy rather than the original warrant, whether they had received the original warrant and mislaid it or whether they had received the original warrant, mislaid it and it had been destroyed.  It was not possible for the Garda authorities conducting the investigation to answer those three questions without going into the matter with great care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That careful investigation was concluded only yesterday and the report from the Garda authorities, which I have here and which runs to a number of pages, was only made available to me and the Minister for Justice on 21 May. It was made available to the House in response to a parliamentary question <Col N="1929" /> from Deputy O'Donnell on that date.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Defence Forces: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Michael Smith on 21 May 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for:</P>
    <P>&mdash;its failure to articulate a vision and a strategic plan for the Defence Forces, to disclose its intention to close certain Army barracks, for its lack of transparency concerning proposed barrack closures and to provide adequate personnel for the Air Corps and the Naval forces;</P>
    <P>&mdash;creating uncertainty about future retirements;</P>
    <P>&mdash;downgrading of the FCÁ and Slua Muirí; and,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2020" />&mdash;its reluctance to enter into meaningful consultations with representatives of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann,</P>
    <P>&mdash;commends the Government for its continuing support for the process of reforming the Defence Forces;</P>
    <P>&mdash;supports the Government's policy of implementing the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group in a planned and phased manner; and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputies Smith and Power.  This has been a dreadful day in the House, but it was not of our making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have become experts on talks, talks about locations, talks about representations and talks about elections to elect talkers. However, the Minister persistently refuses to enter into meaningful negotiations with representatives of the Defence Forces.  Why can he not do what everyone else does? Surely he does not want to wait until the Defence Forces elect their own Deputies.  The days of not talking to the people ended more than 70 years ago when Dáil Éireann was constituted.  We <Col N="2021" /> do not want &ldquo;Trimble style&rdquo; negotiations, but proper 20th century sensible discussions with sensible people. The Minister probably does not know what to say because, as Deputy Smith stated, he should have a plan, even in draft form, so that we could help him avoid the embarrassment of being in charge of an Army and Naval Service without a strategy.  The Barrett brigade could do with a more energetic daddy, but not a dad's army.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service, the headquarters of which is located in my constituency, carries out vital Irish and European fishery protection duties and it must be given the necessary sophisticated equipment and resources.  Our sailors depend on the Minister to get funding from Brussels and Merrion Street.  Co-operation and liaison between the Naval Service, Customs and the Garda must be expanded and improved and the Minister in charge should lead the way. Those services play a vital role in dealing with the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy is in decay and has not undergone maintenance work for a number of years.  In the past there were 14 civilian employees in that camp, but I understand the number has now been halved, although we were glibly told its structure or status would not be changed.  Billets are in bad repair and some have been knocked down.  I understand some upgrading has taken place at Kilworth camp, which is on the Dublin-Cork road between Mitchelstown and Fermoy.  Apart from the Curragh Camp, Kilworth Camp is the most influential in the country.  What are the Minister's plans for it?  Does he propose to further downgrade the Fitzgerald Camp and transfer services to the Kilworth camp, better known as the Liam Lynch camp?</P>
    <P>There has been talk of promotion and capping.  If a corporal has not reached the grade of sergeant by the age of 50 he will have to leave the Army, but a sergeant can continue to work until the age of 60.  This will mean corporals will refuse to take stripes.  Government promises are misleading members of the <Col N="2022" /> Defence Forces.  We will have a five year soldier cycle, similar to the British system who have a much different structure and population from us.  Fermoy is an old soldiering town with status and dignity, but there is great uncertainty there at present which I want the Minister to address.  If I cannot be given a decision on the matter I hope the Member from the Cobh area is informed.  He is a good messenger boy for the constituency. He is much more effective than a carrier pigeon.  A package of £13 million was agreed in the budget for the Defence Forces, but that has been frozen.  When a package is put in place it usually means redundancies.  I know soldiers who, through illness or otherwise, were made redundant from the Defence Forces after the package was announced, but they did not get their rightful payments.  This would not happen in any other walk of life.</P>

I can give the names and status of the persons involved.  I have made representations on their behalf, but the matter may have to be pursued in another way.</P>
      <P>We hear every day about the generosity of the Government side, but that is all cosmetics and euphemism.  Members opposite promise to hand out everything, but there is nothing to hand out.  I am talking about people who have been pushed out of the Army without their rightful redundancy payments and they are not getting any sympathy from the Government.  I am not aware of any other organisation or business in the private sector that would tolerate not receiving its rightful payment; no doubt they would be on strike, placing pickets and the like.  This has been happening and I want it ended.</P>

      <P>I fully understand the degree of dependency of a community in any area where an Army barracks has been located for many years.  Having said that, a great deal needs to be done to improve the level of representation and consultative structures available to members of the Defence Forces, without which they have very little option but to put their case to Members of this House in a fairly clandestine fashion. Deputies, with a few exceptions will have had very little first-hand experience of the Defence Forces and must pass on second-hand information without any in-depth understanding of the matter.  I speak with knowledge of experiences of certain members of the Defence Forces in my constituency who have returned from the Lebanon, having served this country abroad at great personal risk.  Not alone do they not receive the requisite attention on their return but, having left the forces for whatever reason, they have no help or counselling made available to them.  The case I have in mind is that of a member of the Defence Forces who sustained quite a serious injury.  It is crucial that help be made available.  It is very shortsighted, unfair and does not indicate a very caring attitude on the part of Government or the Defence Forces if, once a member leaves, he or she is forgotten and their experiences are no longer considered to be of any consequence. For obvious reasons, I am reluctant to mention names but it is important that the principle of what I say be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make these comments fully recognising that military operations in the Lebanon or elsewhere are subject to a degree of confidentiality.  Even though at times it must have been very difficult <Col N="2024" /> for members of the Defence Forces to restrain themselves, I have always found they respected such secrecy.</P>
    <P>Help and counselling are the least we should provide for members of the Defence Forces who have served our country well, at great personal risk, often incurring serious injury in the course of their duties.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt do gach éinne sna Fórsaí Cosanta. Tá coinníollacha níos fearr ag na hoifigigh ná mar atá ag an gnáth shaighdiúir. Níl sé cothrom ná ceart go mbeadh liúntaisí i bhfad níos fearr ag na hoifigigh ná mar atá ag an gnáth dhuine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the interests of three-party harmony, the bedrock of this Government.</P>
      <P>While it is appropriate that we should have an opportunity to debate this matter, I have to say that the motion before us is politically inspired.  I am pleased to support the amendment in the name of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks members of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security had a wide-ranging, historic exchange of views with representatives of the Defence Forces&mdash;PDFORRA, RACO and REDFORRA.  It was the first time in the history of the State such an opportunity was afforded members of the Defence Forces and their representatives to appear before a committee of this House and exchange views with its members.  I venture to say this was not something intended in the letter or spirit of the defence legislation enacted in the 1990s.  I know that Deputy Michael Smith and others <Col N="2025" /> opposite also benefited from the valuable position papers furnished.</P>
    <P>Within the context of the Government's commitment to reform and overall plan for our Defence Forces difficult decisions must not be shirked.  Having listened to Deputies opposite one would think that unlimited resources were available from the public purse for allocation to the Department of Defence. Last week the Minister for Defence presented his departmental Estimates, involving a gross sum of £393 million, to that same Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  I happened to mention that sum to a large gathering of people in my constituency who were shocked that our annual defence spending was of that order, a huge sum in any language.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe talks about barracks and billets and others talk about additional spending.  Perhaps they would indicate from what other budgetary allocations they wish to funnel such funding into the Department of Defence.  This plan is not about cutbacks or about barrack closures but rather about a fundamental reappraisal of our Defence Forces which all Members must admit has been ignored for generations.  This reform is long overdue.  If our armed forces are to meet the challenges of the 1990s and beyond in an efficient, effective and economic manner, this fundamental review must take place.</P>
    <P>The unchanged structure and organisation of our Defence Forces have given rise to present problems.  The Government's ten-year proposals represent a major programme of change, introduced on a phased basis, at a realistic pace.</P>
    <P>Those who resist such change, a policy I heard enunciated by Members last evening and again tonight, must ask themselves what are the consequences of maintaining the status quo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody resisted the change.  The Deputy should not make up the story as he goes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is both unacceptable <Col N="2026" /> and intolerable that, of the huge budget of £393 million, 80 per cent is absorbed by pay alone.  That 80:20 ratio denies the armed forces the type of funding Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and others might like.  In certain circumstances it denies them the most modern, efficient automated equipment, of the highest technological advances, even the type of updated accommodation Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and others would like.  This hinders the provision of the vital tools of their trade.  Great improvements can be carried out if that ratio is reduced to 70:30 or even beyond and the military authorities recognise the importance of tackling change and dealing with the problems.  There has been a great deal of talk about the age profile and the age imbalance.  Scare mongering about hidden agendas, sinister activities, secret deals and withholding information add little to the serious programme of reform that is under way.</P>
      <P>This plan represents a positive development on public service reform and combines a reduction in the overall manpower of the Defence Forces with a more streamlined organisation, having increased operational capabilities.  What will the result be?  As the Minister said on numerous occasions the result will be that more troops will be available for operational duties and fewer administrative layers, with fewer personnel tied up in the administrative tasks they are engaged in.  This plan tackles the problem of the age profile which has been long identified as requiring immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age profile is a serious problem and should be treated as such.  Physical fitness is a fundamental requirement in every army.  Those of us who are growing older may not wish to admit that physical fitness and age are inseparable and that age in therefore crucial to the operation of a top class defence force. In Ireland the average age of a private is 33, which is much higher than the European or US average.  The Government is operating a two-pronged approach to the age problem in an effort to make the necessary overall <Col N="2027" /> adjustment.  A voluntary early retirement scheme has been introduced together with a programme of planned recruitment of younger personnel during the period of the plan.  That point must be emphasised again in spite of the fact that Opposition Members call for no compulsory redundancies or forced retirement of any kind.  I see no other point in the Deputies opposite making this point other than for cheap political gain and misrepresentation of a type we will hear again between now and 8.30 p.m.  Unless the age hump is addressed, morale throughout the Defence Forces will be totally and utterly shattered.</P>
    <P>The impression has been conveyed that this entire approach is taking place behind closed doors and nothing could be further from the truth; witness the historic meeting of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security with members of the representative association for a three day period.  The implementation of any changes in the structure and organisation of the force will only be carried out after a process of consultation with the representative bodies.  The Minister placed this on record last night.  How many times does he have to do that in order to convince Members?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Due to the time limitation I will confine most of my remarks to the Naval Service where I served in the past.  I support the overall thrust of the Government's approach to the Defence Forces.  Our role and commitment to international affairs is expanding and in the light of the recently published White Paper on Foreign Policy, it will continue to do so.  It is correct that the Government and the Minister review the capacity of the Defence Forces to fulfil the role required of them by Government to meet our international obligations. I welcome the Minister's commitment to a plan that is not simply a cost cutting exercise.  There is no question of barracks closures.  While the expanded role of the Army is likely to come from our increasing international commitments, almost the opposite applies to the Naval Service.  The extension of our exclusive fishery limits to 200 miles requires the Naval Service to expand to protect this important zone. Despite additional EU support, the obligations on us are increasing.  Similarly the fight against the importation of drugs has had implications for the Naval Service.  It has always been my belief that the Naval Service has a significant role to play in this regard.  The importation and use of drugs, particularly in our major cities is one of the biggest scourages facing society and requires to be tackled urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Government's commitment to commissioning extra reports in addition to the efficiency audit group (EAG) commissioned to deal separately with the Naval Service and the Air <Col N="2029" /> Corps.  I am confident that the Government's response to these reports will be considered as their response to the EAG report.  While I recognise improvements have been made in the Naval Service in recent years, there is a need for more progress.  Immense credit is due to the Naval Service for the way they responded to the increase in duties allocated to them.  There is still considerable scope for further improvements to the Naval Service fleet.  We must always ensure that the Naval Service is properly equipped to carry out its duties in the extended fishing zone.</P>
    <P>Conditions for members of the Naval Service have not kept pace with other developments.  I am aware that the dining facilities are still the same as when I was there more than 20 years ago.  The rating dining room was designed to accommodate the then 300 members of the Naval Service but there are now more than 1,000.  Accommodation on the Haulbowline Island Naval base is in need of refurbishment.</P>
    <P>I reject the suggestion in the Opposition motion that the Government intends downgrading the FCÁ and An Slua Muirí, both of which are a valuable support to the Defence Forces and their contribution is widely appreciated by the Government and community at large.  I would like them to be given a greater role, for instance I would like to see An Slua Muirí being given responsibilty for the protection of the <i>Lusitania</i>, the subject of a recent heritage order, which is close to my constituency.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment to the motion.  The Government is seeking to modernise the Defence Forces.  The voluntary retirement scheme is proving popular with members and should go some way to alleviate the age profile difficulties.  I call on the Minister to continue contact with the representative association to ensure the implementation of this package to the benefit of the public at large and all involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too very much regret that Deputy Ned O'Keeffe has left the Chamber.  This is not the first time he <Col N="2030" /> has used hit and run tactics in the House.  His contribution was mischievous as he made no useful suggestions to resolve the problem.  It is a scandal that this motion was tabled because we should have consensus on all sides of the House on what should be done in the Defence Forces.  As Deputy Flanagan said there is no hidden agenda as far as the Government is concerned. There is nothing sinister or ulterior in trying to reorganise the Defence Forces. The Minister would be lacking in his duty if he did not tackle the problem. Coming here with a Bismarckian attitude encouraging gunboat diplomacy in industrial relations in the Defence Forces is no good.  The ongoing megaphone diplomacy between the Minister and PDFORRA is not conducive to good relations in the Army.  Let us endeavour to work out a logical approach to the Defence Forces.  My party and I appreciate very much the contribution of the three strands of the Defence Forces, the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service to the integrity of the State and to defending our State in the past 27 years.  We have had some fragile moments because of some paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland spilling over into the South.</P>
      <P>My party appreciates the contribution of the three strands of our Defence Forces&mdash;the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps&mdash;to the integrity and defence of our State.  There have been some fragile times with paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland spilling into the South.  We appreciate all ranks in the Defence Forces and we will defend them to the bitter end.  We are not here to engage in snide, sly remarks about anybody but to make a positive contribution to helping the Minister to reorganise the Army in a practical, efficient way and to equip our Defence Forces for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an imbalance in the age structure of the Defence Forces.  That is not a condemnation or criticism of anybody; it is a statement of fact.  Our country was garrisoned by the British through many centuries and for 800 <Col N="2031" /> years in the case of Limerick.  Just because something happened 800 years ago does not mean that one must ignore it and not address the problem in today's circumstances.  We now live in a different world.  We are part of the European Union and our troops have contributed bravely to UN forces.  To do that they must be efficient and well equipped.  They have been that way in the past and we are proud of them, but we cannot live on past glories.</P>
    <P>The Minister must forge a practical solution to the problem that confronts him and he is attempting to do that. Nobody is being forced out of the Defence Forces.  Listening to Deputy O'Keeffe one would think a gun was being put to people's heads to force them to go.  On the contrary, I am sad that so many good members of our Defence Forces will leave.  It is a shame because they had good careers ahead of them and I am sorry we cannot avail of their talents in the Forces for the benefit of our country.</P>
    <P>Change should not just apply to the role of our Defence Forces abroad and with UN forces.  We must also remove the high walls around many of the barracks throughout the country.  The Army and the other forces must play more of a community role in our society.  It is not good enough to have our Army simply guarding and moving money.  There must also be a community orientation in the projects in which the Army is involved.  Its personnel have great talents and skills and they should be utilised more widely than is the case at present.  Let us not have a too inflexible approach to the role of the Defence Forces.  There is much talent in all ranks which is not being used properly to benefit society.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not stop with the present changes.  They are not radical enough as far as I am concerned.  The Minister should go further and encourage the Army to have a community role and help in breaking down other barriers in society.  The Minister will have the full support of my party in that <Col N="2032" /> regard.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Ferris.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Kathleen Lynch is also sharing that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  I have a vested interest in this subject in that my late older brother was a full-time soldier and lost his life while serving in the Army after contracting a disease.  I have had an interest in the Army since my childhood.  I also have a vested interest in this subject because one of the top barracks, Kickham Barracks, is located in Clonmel in my constituency. Every Oireachtas Member who has served the South Tipperary constituency, including the Ceann Comhairle, has admired the role played by the Army barracks and its personnel in the town, and particularly the economic benefit which the barracks has brought to it.</P>
      <P>In all the meetings I had with the Minister, Deputy Barrett, the question of the closure of Clonmel or any other barracks was not raised by him.  It was raised by Members of the Oireachtas because it was a cause of concern and we were reassured on many occasions that the closure of barracks was not on the Minister's agenda.  I had no problem when the former Taoiseach decided to conduct the efficiency audit.  I also have no problem with the main Opposition party politicising this debate because that is its job.  However, I object to the spokesperson of PDFORRA politicising this debate.  It has been demoralising for serving members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a voluntary early retirement scheme.  Nobody who does not want to retire will be forced to do so.  If retirement only was envisaged one could claim that the number of troops will be reduced.  However, the Government has also implemented a recruitment scheme which will benefit the Army and address the problem of its age profile.  Many more people have opted for retirement than will be able to benefit from it this <Col N="2033" /> year and criticism of the scheme is invalidated by the number of soldiers who have opted for it.</P>
    <P>Over this period of revamping the Army&mdash;which the Army wants as much as we do&mdash;the question of equipping the Army properly will also be dealt with to allow the Army to take up its new role as peacekeepers, particularly if it participates as peacekeepers in the European Union.  Colleagues such as Deputy Penrose, Senator Jack Wall and Deputy Bell have confirmed our party's commitment to the programme of modernisation.  The Minister will have our full support.  He is trying to meet all the organisations involved and we commend him for that.  I also commend the Minister for publishing the booklet which sets out clearly, for every serving member of the Army regardless of rank, what is available, why it should be availed of and what benefits, if any, will result from availing of it.  That is the way to deal with our Defence Forces, of whom we are immensely proud.  The Minister's amendment to this motion will have the support of the majority of Members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Minister's amendment to the motion.  Members of the Defence Forces rely on the forces for their livelihoods and entire towns rely on barracks because of the economic development and social life that has grown around them.  The Defence Forces have never operated in an aggressive capacity outside the State; they have always operated as peacekeepers.  War has become extremely advanced technologically so <Col N="2034" /> we need an Army capable of the same type of response to fulfil its peacekeeping duties.  The review taking place should secure that capacity.</P>
    <P>The Department has informed me that 1,032 members of the Defence Forces have applied for redundancy but that only 450 to 500 can be accommodated. Personnel in the Army obviously recognise that there are people within the Defence Forces who are no longer able for that employment or who see opportunities outside the forces which they can avail of with their redundancy pay.  I wish them well in that regard.  The Minister must take some other issues on board.  The recommendations of PDFORRA about the structure of promotion would be enormously helpful and make the matter clearer for everybody. There are issues regarding severance pay and redundancy packages which also must be taken on board. That will involve negotiation.</P>
    <P>This process is a partnership we cannot ignore and it will have many participants. I believe the Government and the Minister will take on board the issues being raised not only by Members of this House but also by PDFORRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important motion tabled by Deputies Michael Smith and Sean Power.  It embraces all of the issues of concern to members of the Defence Forces and articulates a vision for their future.  The commitment by Deputy Smith that on its return to Government Fianna Fáil would bring forward at an early date a White Paper on defence policy is welcome and important.  A Government statement outlining a long-term strategic plan for the Defence Forces is long overdue.  The key role of the Defence Forces has been underestimated for many years.  Their duties <Col N="2035" /> cover a wide range of activities from service abroad to mercy missions at home. All too often the diversity and importance of those activities is not fully appreciated by the public at large.</P>
      <P>There is a sound Army tradition in my constituency, as can be seen from the generations of families in County Cavan who have given, and continue to give loyal and dedicated service to the State.  Recently I spoke to young soldiers who had served in the Lebanon. The difficulties they encountered abroad did not weaken their commitment to their duties at home or lessen their desire to travel abroad again on peacekeeping duties should the opportunity arise.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy who represents a Border constituency with two major barracks, Dún Ui Neill and Monaghan barracks, I appreciate the work done by Army personnel. I am speaking for my constituents when I emphasise that their work, particularly since 1969, has been much appreciated and was most beneficial in dealing with the difficulties in my area. Many of my young constituents actively seek enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force which has a high standing within the community.  Young people who have spoken to me about their desire to join the Army regard it as a challenging career.  The quality of these young people from a character and academic point of view is very high.</P>
      <P>We are not only proud of the work done by the Defence Forces at home but we are also conscious of the great service they have given abroad on many United Nations missions.  The work done abroad by soldiers is not always given the recognition it deserves and generally speaking people do not know the number of soldiers who serve abroad or the extent of missions.  A better presentation of that element of the work of the Defence Forces would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Army's participation in peacekeeping duties demonstrates our commitment to the United Nations and to the establishment and maintenance of <Col N="2036" /> peace throughout the world.  At home, the Defence Forces have wide ranging duties such as the provision of assistance in emergencies and industrial disputes, fishery protection and life saving missions. No doubt this work will continue. There must be an ongoing campaign of recruitment to the Defence Forces to ensure that its age profile is not too high.  Constant recruitment and a proper retirement system would help mobility and promotional outlets.  Indeed, the very nature of the work requires the constant recruitment of personnel.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government in 1988 made the very wise decision to place the contract for the construction of a new Army barracks in Cavan town which was later named Dún Ui Neill after Eoghan Rua O Neill, one of the dominant figures in our history.  The up-to-date and proper facilities provided in this new barracks have been of tremendous assistance to the Defence Forces in fulfilling their duties in the Border area. It is also an excellent headquarters for the 29th Battalion.  The construction of the barracks was a positive development as it replaced the old military barracks which dated from the 17th century.  That investment clearly demonstrated Fianna Fáil's commitment to the provision of proper facilities for Army personnel.</P>
    <P>Proper and continuous communications between the Minister, the Department and senior management of the Defence Forces must be an integral part of the decision-making process. There is an onus on the Minister to ensure that there is meaningful consultation with the representatives of the Defence Forces.  Between 1969 and the autumn of 1994 members of the Defence Forces on Border duty worked long and difficult hours to prevent injury to persons and damage to property. The cessation of violence in the North in August 1994 brought an end to the need for such patrols, which hopefully will not be required to work on Border duty again.</P>
    <P>The presence of the Defence Forces is of enormous, social and economic value to those towns in which they are <Col N="2037" /> located.  The barracks in the towns of Cavan and Monaghan are of crucial importance.  They play a positive role in the local communities and I look forward to their continued presence in those centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say the Government does not intend to close Army barracks. I accept this statement.  It would be politically unwise for any Minister to close Army barracks in the run-up to a general election given the social and electoral ramifications of such a decision. However, the Minister must accept that barracks will have to be closed if 1,000 jobs are shed.  By shedding the jobs, the onus for closing the barracks is taken away from the Minister and the Government and given back to the Army High Command, thereby distancing the Minister and the Government from the decision and laying the blame fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the officers concerned.  If the Minister can get away with that, it is a nice one.  I have no doubt but that the Minister and his Department have pinpointed the barracks they believe should be closed.  The shedding of 1,000 jobs will inevitably lead to the closure of barracks.</P>

      <P>The Minister is keeping these people on a string and they do not know their status or how much time they have left in the Army. He is being very unfair to them.  The Army personnel and their families know <Col N="2038" /> the Government's policy is to close barracks by stealth.  I am afraid this is what will happen to the Leo Murphy barracks in Ballincollig.  This barracks, which employs 180 people, is the largest employer in my town and there is tremendous interaction between the personnel working in it and the local community.  We are proud of these Army personnel, many of whom have excelled in military duties at home and abroad.  If this barracks is closed an integral part of the community will be taken away.</P>
      <P>On the cap on promotions, previously members could continue their service in the Defence Forces but in future this will be dependent on manpower service. The Minister and his Department are the only ones who know what this means.  However, I am glad the Minister seems to be willing to negotiate on that issue.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the five year contract soldier, we seem to be at cross purposes on the meaning of consultation and negotiation.</P>

      <P>The Minister has concentrated on the consultation board. He says he will consult them, but what does that mean?  It means personnel coming to talk to the Minister and having a cup of coffee at the table with him, but the Minister doing exactly as he intended.  Regarding the five-year contract soldiers, the Minister should move away from consultation and towards the negotiation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding voluntary retirement and category C, people who have developed disabilities, medical and otherwise, are being told they have no likelihood of continuing in the Army.  A humane <Col N="2039" /> approach was taken in the past and a certain percentage of people, who were not fit for active Army duty, were used in other ways.  In the public sector, it is accepted that 3 per cent of employment opportunities should be available to disabled people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to comment on the subject of defence expenditure in the Irish context because there is not a clearly stated defence policy in the normal sense.  Our defence policy was originally defined as the defence of the State against external aggression.  This wording was changed in 1993 to read: &ldquo;... to defend the State against armed aggression.  This being a contingency plan, preparations for its implementation will depend on ongoing Government assessment of threats&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The substitution of the word &ldquo;armed&rdquo; for &ldquo;external&rdquo; appears to indicate that the main function envisaged for the Defence Forces is dealing with civil war. In general, our stated defence policy lacks clarity and precision.  For example, there is no clearly identifiable armed aggressor against whom we might need to defend ourselves and, accordingly, it is difficult to assess the capability of the Defence Forces to repel any external attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is militarily neutral.  For most <Col N="2040" /> countries neutrality is an expensive policy option.  Without access to the economies of scale and the benefits of co-operation that membership of an alliance brings, neutral states must invest heavily in their defence structures. This is why countries such as Sweden and Switzerland are heavy spenders on defence and have also built up substantial military industrial bases.</P>
    <P>As a landlocked state, Switzerland has invested heavily in tanks and other mechanised equipment.  One of the primary aims of its defence policy is to repel any land-borne invasion of its national territory from whatever quarter. In practice, the Swiss operate a policy of deterrence.  Any intending aggressor knows that trespassing on Swiss territory would be so costly in military terms that it would not be worth the candle.</P>
    <P>In contrast, our defence budget is small.  We spent a little over 1 per cent of gross domestic product on defence; the amount will be approximately £450 million in 1996.  As an island nation, it might be expected that if the Swiss have tanks, we have ships.  Yet the Naval Service is small and amounts to no more than a coastguard operation primary concerned with drug interdiction, fisheries protection and sea rescue.  I doubt the capacity of the Naval Service to repel a sea-borne invasion.</P>
    <P>We owe our naval capacity, such as it is, in large measure to the European Union, which has funded much of our fisheries protection fleet.  We have had no military ship building capability since the 1970s when the last vessel was launched from the Cork dockyard.  In contrast, the Swedes are world leaders in naval technology, building their own submarines and warships.  They are at the cutting edge of naval military technology and have developed ships which, in common with the US stealth bomber, are invisible to radar.</P>
    <P>The Army is small and about to get smaller.  The Naval Service lacks military punch and our military air capability is modest.  Outside observers would conclude that we do not take our <Col N="2041" /> defence responsibilities seriously.  At the very least it is apparent that we do not devote anything like the same resources to defence as other small European neutrals. It is fair to point out that our defence policy has been based on the presumption that there are virtually no circumstances in which Ireland would ever be singled out for individual attack. If aggression occurred, it would most likely be directed against the West in general or the European Union.  In either case Ireland would be able to shelter under somebody else's security umbrella, but without explicitly committing itself to any military alliance.  The issue of the lack of a clearly defined role for the Defence Forces must be confronted before the current review is implemented.</P>
    <P>We cannot redesign and restructure the Defence Forces unless we know precisely what is expected of them.  If their major role is assisting the civil power, effectively preventing civil war, we need a type of lightly armed paramilitary police force which does not require a great deal of heavy equipment.  However, if their major role is defending the country against external aggression, an entirely different structure for the Defence Forces is appropriate, with much heavier spending on equipment and munitions. Equally, if it is envisaged that Ireland will participate, either partially or fully, in some type of international military alliance, an entirely different approach to the management of the Defence Forces is required.</P>
    <P>A proper public debate on this issue is necessary.  Unless we have a clear policy on defence, we cannot have a clear policy on the Defence Forces.  It is vital to have a clear mission statement for all branches of the Defence Forces.  Without clarification in this area it is difficult to make proper judgments on the proposals set out in the Defence Forces review.  For example, questions have been raised as to whether the reduced strength of the forces envisaged in the review would be sufficient to defend the country against external aggression or <Col N="2042" /> capable of enforcing our policy of military neutrality.  Further questions have been raised as to whether sufficient attention has been paid in the review to the need for armoured vehicles and similar equipment in the forces.</P>
    <P>There has never been a comprehensive debate about defence in this country. It is timely to hold such a discussion before embarking on such a major restructuring of the Defence Forces.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Davern.</P>

      <P>Some people in the Departments of Defence and Finance have made several attempts over the years to impose cutbacks in or abolish the Equitation School.  The school has done a marvellous job not just for the Army but for the country.  I make this point to the Minister, Deputy Barrett, because his late father in law broke his back at Clonakilty show many years ago and he and his family have a deep interest in show jumping and equitation. I ask the Minister of State to note that the country is proud of the school.  It has been a great standard bearer for Irish horses over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I served in the FCÁ for many years but the first time I appreciated the importance of the Army to the defence of the Constitution was in the early 1970s when the House was besieged by up to 12,000 protesters during the internment of a certain individual in the Mater Hospital who was on hunger strike.  This necessitated the placing of armed members of the Defence Forces <Col N="2043" /> in full battle dress on guard duty in the precincts of the House.  I was frightened for democracy that night.</P>
    <P>It is grossly dishonest to suggest there is no intention of closing any barracks. Nobody should be fooled by this.  No one in this House should tell my constituents that the Minister says he has no such intention.  He will not close any barracks, but if personnel at Kickham Barracks, Clonmel who form part of the Twelfth Battalion &mdash; I am thinking in particular of younger and middle-aged personnel &mdash; decide not avail of the redundancy package on special offer, will they have to uproot their families to move to Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick or will they be allowed remain on as part of a skeleton staff due to the lack of recruitment?  This will result in its closure.</P>

I want to ensure that there will be a military presence in Clonmel long after the Government has left office.  It has given false promises in respect of every barracks in the country.  If there is a review, there will have to be barrack closures. The members of the Defence Forces deserve to know which barracks will be closed.  Where they may have to live will have a bearing on their decision either to leave or remain in the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's statement that there are two phases in the implementation of the Efficiency Audit Group's recommendations. Phase one comprises mainly the non-contentious proposals, although there are some contentious ones.  We do not yet know what will happen in phase two so far as barrack closures and the policy on the Reserve are concerned.  I do not want to go over ground which has been trodden already.  I would prefer to concentrate on two specific elements of the motion, the failure to provide adequate personnel for the Naval Service and the downgrading of the FCÁ and An Slua Mhuirí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often been said that we have never had a White Paper on defence policy.  One of the problems with the programme of the Efficiency Audit Group is that it is a sort of White Paper commissioned by a private consultancy arrangement.  There is no great sense in crying over spilled milk, but the fact remains that a clear statement of principles would be a good point of departure for a thoroughgoing reform of the Defence Forces.  I agree with what Deputy Clohessy had to say in that <Col N="2046" /> regard.  In the absence of a White Paper we have to proceed with the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group as they stand.</P>
    <P>In most small European states reserve forces have a large part to play.  In this State, however, they are the Cinderella of the Defence Forces.  This is clear from the Minister's statement in which he indicated that the question of the future of the FCÁ and An Slua Murí will be considered as part of the second phase.  Real economies and savings could be effected through a proper development of the Reserve.  Given the vast expenditure of public resources on FÁS, I see no harm in devoting public resources, albeit on a relatively modest scale, to the FCÁ and An Slua Muirí which inculcate basic military, civil and maritime values in the younger population.</P>
    <P>Morale among members of the FCÁ is low because of the lack of adequate training facilities and the amount of time devoted to training.  One cannot develop a reserve force on the basis of one or two weeks annual training.  It takes a number of months to complete even the most elementary FÁS course nowadays.  It would better to have a smaller Reserve if its members were properly trained.  Within the framework of the Defence Forces there is adequate scope for the development of the Reserve both on the combat side, in terms of providing Reserve units which can be called up for guard and security duty in an emergency, and on the logistical side, in terms of having trained service units capable of being mobilised in an emergency.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that An Slua Muirí has remained undisturbed without a vessel since the ending of the Emergency in 1945.  This branch of the Defence Forces is in need of attention. That leads me to the question of adequate personnel for the Naval Service. While the CASA aircraft have harvested a vast range of intelligence information about activities off our coast, the resources available to the Naval Service, in terms of personnel and equipment, <Col N="2047" /> are inadequate to enable it discharge its many responsibilities arising from this operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the question of the recorganisation of the Defence Forces.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of the many positive and helpful contributions made to the debate by Opposition Deputies so far.  The future of the Defence Forces is an important issue and one which may not have always received the attention which it deserves.</P>
      <P>We all share a common objective.  Significantly, the record of this debate will show that all Deputies in their contributions recognise the need for change. There is a consensus about the range of problems facing us in dealing with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces. We wish to see these problems dealt with in a positive way so that the Defence Forces can develop to meet the challenges which its redefined set of roles and functions present.</P>
      <P>Where we differ with Members of the Opposition is in their contention that the Government is not following a strategic plan in its approach to the reorganisation process.  This is the most comprehensive and structured approach to a process of reorganisation that has ever been undertaken by a Government in relation to the Defence Forces.  The implementation plan was drawn up following the most extensive process of consultation which ever took place in the Defence Forces.  It is the outcome of a comprehensive examination by the efficiency audit group of the organisation, and the functions it has to fulfil. In doing this the efficiency audit group were fully involved with the selection of these military experts and worked closely with them in the formulation of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first phase of a plan with a crystal clear strategy set out for the reform of the Defence Forces.  The eventual shape and make-up of the <Col N="2048" /> organisation will take approximately ten years to achieve.  The Government has made the process clear and transparent by the manner in which it made these reports widely available to all interested parties on their completion.  It is disingenuous of the Opposition to suggest that the strategy of our approach lacks vision just because it is based on a strategy with which they may not necessarily agree.</P>
    <P>The Opposition knows full well that the problems which now face the Defence Forces did not materialise out of thin air in the past year.  The difficulties facing the Defence Forces, which all sides of the House have recognised and alluded to in this debate up to now, such as the rising age profile, the multi-layer system of administration, the imbalance between pay and non-pay spending and so forth, have all grown over a long period. During much of that period the Deputies opposite were in Government.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made repeatedly in the course of this debate that the plans for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces are merely a tool for the pruning of Defence expenditure by this Government and that the voluntary early retirement scheme is a vehicle by which we will dramatically reduce numbers and push members of the Defence Forces out of the organisation.  This is untrue and mischievous.</P>
    <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme is part of a carefully structured plan to address the age profile problem which all Deputies who have contributed to this debate acknowledge is one of the priority areas which needs urgent attention.  The Minister for Defence, in his address to the Select Committee on Security and Legislation on the 1996 Defence Estimates, clearly signalled his intention to balance the approach to the age profile question.  We will do this by embarking on the first round of the general service recruitment part of the reorganisation plan towards the end of this year.  The favourable response to the early retirement scheme is a firm indication that the Government has got the figures right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> Attempts to denigrate the reform process by reference to the review of the Defence Forces as a cost-cutting exercise are unhelpful in the extreme.  It has already been made clear that what is envisaged is a refocusing of resources and not an economy drive.  There appears to be no disagreement about the need to adjust the ratio of pay to non-pay expenditure in the Defence Vote.  The aim is for something closer to a 70-30 split rather than the current 80-20. The present imbalance did not occur today or yesterday and it will take the full lifespan of the process for us to achieve our objective.</P>

      <P>The consultation process with PDFORRA and RACO could not have been more intense or hands on.  They were involved at all stages of the process.  As I said, this has been the most intensive consultation process ever.  The complaint by RACO that it could not attend a particular session had nothing to do with the Minister; it was part and parcel of the regime which was agreed and the structures and regulations which bind members of the Defence Forces.  No decision has been made by this Government to close Army barracks, to do anything other than enhance the Army School of Equitation or to tamper with the Army bands of which we are proud.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Smith, for sharing his time with me.  On behalf of our party, he put forward a very cogent case which we all appreciate.  I wish to speak on a purely local issue and I make no apologies for doing so.  I come from a constituency which has a long and proud record of looking after the needs of Army <Col N="2050" /> members and their families.  What this Government is doing is like playing a game of chess.  It is cynical and manipulative in the way it views the forces and the barracks; soldiers are not pawns but are being treated as such.  Each day we read in the newspapers about threatened closures of barracks and about the transfer of personnel.  I remind the House, the Ministers responsible for the Defence Forces and Defence chiefs that people should not be treated in this fashion.  This is a cynical exercise.  A report in a newspaper a week or ten days ago stated that there was a clear recognition that the Western Command would be moved from Athlone.  I would like to give notice to the Army and the Government that the day they try to do so will be a sorry one for them.  The defence put up by Custume in 1691 will be nothing compared to what the people of Athlone will do if the Government decides to move from the town. However, it will not do so and that is cowardice at its worst.  The Government will say it is the next stage of the plan, but beneath the surface, like piranha fish, lie the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report.  The Government wants to put flesh on the bones of the recommendations, which means the closure of barracks, the decimation of brigades and the rationalisation of many of the institutions connected to the Army.</P>
      <P>I also speak for Mullingar, which has a proud record in the Defence Forces, and for Longford, which is no longer in my constituency.  I have close friends in that county.  If the Minister, the Government or Defence chiefs believe the midlands will be a pushover, they have much to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all bask in the adulation and praise which the Army receives when it acts as a peacekeeping force in many countries.  We are also proud of the socio-economic contribution made by Army barracks and personnel and the life they bring to many towns and counties. Yet behind the scenes the Government intends to act without any in-depth consultation with the forces.  The <Col N="2051" /> climate of 1989 will be replicated in every Army town when we go to the polls in 1997.  On behalf of my constituents, I would say to the Minister, hands off the midlands as regards the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I would like to thank Deputies who contributed, particularly Deputies in my party and the Progressive Democrats, in support of this motion.</P>
      <P>I want to take to task some Deputies on the Government benches who accused us of being politically motivated in putting forward this motion.  Debate on the Defence Forces has probably taken up less time in this House than debate on any other group in society, despite the fact that they engender in us a sense of pride since their performance is unequalled and unmatched.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan alluded to a group of people in Laois who were shocked at the cost of the Defence Forces, but did he tell them about Border duties and peace-keeping activities in various parts of the world such as southern Lebanon, the Congo and the United Nations, which raise morale in this country?  Did he tell them about Defence Forces work in fisheries surveillance and drug interdiction, their security operations and aid to the Garda and the many other emergency services they provide?  I am sure he did not.  In a simple cost cutting exercise, he referred, to the total costs, shocked the community and embraced the policy of making cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is not engaged in a cost-cutting exercise he should tell the House at an early stage that any savings made will be ploughed back into the Defence Vote to deal with the accommodation, infrastructure and equipment that is desperately needed.  That would be one way of ensuring credibility.  A great number of people, including some Deputies on the Government side, have <Col N="2052" /> indicated their lack of interest in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There is little point in talking about dealing with the age profile in the Army unless there is constant recruitment. Last year the former Minister for Defence told the House in reply to parliamentary questions that a number of people would be recruited to the Army in the latter half of 1995, but that did not happen.  It was further indicated that there would be recruitment this year, and now we are told that as few as 200 people will be recruited, for whom no provision is made in the Estimate.  The likelihood is that those people will not be recruited until 1997.  Can this House treat seriously a Government that tells us it is anxious to deal with the age profile in the Army when it did not fulfil the promise it made to the House last year?  On return to office Fianna Fáil will have a recruitment drive every year. We will consign to the past the stop-go policies which were part and parcel of recruitment heretofore and which led to the present age profile difficulties.</P>
    <P>On barracks closures, last night I indicated it would be far better if an overall strategic plan was introduced.  In our first year in office Fianna Fáil is determined to introduce a White Paper which will spell out what we expect the Defence Forces to do into the next century. It is not good enough to say there will not be closure of Army barracks in the first phase of the implementation plan, when the dogs in the streets know the staffing arrangements for the future as planned in the restructuring programme, will make it impossible from a practical point of view to maintain the existing number of barracks.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are entitled to be told the truth about their future.  It is impossible to maintain morale among people who live in uncertainty.  The Defence Forces are highly trained and motivated to do tasks which in some cases they may not be asked to perform for some time, but they must be in a <Col N="2053" /> state of readiness at all times.  It is unacceptable that their domestic circumstances and the educational provision for their families depend on a plan such as that proposed.  We want to see a much more focused and targeted plan.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that will have to be dealt with much more efficiently is career development.  In negotiations with the representatives more emphasis must be placed on career development and opportunities for promotion.  I welcome the Minister's statement on short-term commissions for officers, but similar problems arise with enlisted personnel and they will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Greater resources must be provided for the Naval Service.  There is much greater appreciation not only by coastal communities but by the public as a whole, of our maritime resources.  We are plagued with the problem of raking of the seas.  As Deputy Lenihan said, intelligence is much greater now and we are aware of the extent of the problem. We must provide additional resources for the Naval Service to protect our fisheries resource which is so necessary for coastal communities.  We should not allow the ranking of billions of pounds worth of fish each year.  That money is desperately needed here to support communities.  On our return to office we will ensure that the necessary resources are provided, and we will not shock local communities by outlining why we want to do that.  Everybody is aware that the potential of the Naval Service can be developed only by providing adequate resources.  We are not interested in politicising this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coughlan and I have pursued this miscarriage of justice case for a considerable time &mdash; Deputy Coughlan has been pursuing it for a much longer time than myself. However, I have been involved in many miscarriages of justice cases, such as the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Annie Maguire case.  The case of Patrick McLaughlin, a then 25 year old Derryman, is probably one of the most heinous miscarriages of justice in the litany conducted throughout what might be described as a now discredited British Justice system in the context of the type of cases we seek to expose. Both myself and Deputy Coughlan visited Patrick McLaughlin in Maghaberry on one occasion.  Next Tuesday, we seek to speak to a sub-committee of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier and subsequently, with its permission, we would like to address the tier about this tragic miscarriage of justice.</P>
      <P>We sought an interview with the British Home Secretary but he, in his wisdom, decided that he did not have time to see us.  However, we will not leave it at that.  Not only myself and Deputy Coughlan but people of the reputation of John Hume, Bishop Edward Daly, the Tánaiste and others are pursuing this case.  They are convinced they are witnessing and evidencing one of the most serious miscarriages of justice in a long history of such miscarriages, particularly since 1976.</P>
      <P>The judge in the case was, to say the very least, lacking balance.  He gave 11 hours in summing up to the prosecution and only two hours to the defence.  The verdict was reached by a majority; two jurors wept.  In directing the jury to find a verdict, the judge used the now discredited Waldeim direction, which asks the jury to come to a verdict on the basis that time would be wasted and money would be lost.  That direction, of course, has now gone.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the Government to pursue this case as a matter of extreme urgency.  If it does not do it, we will.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me to speak.  I have been working on this case for a number of years and have met Patrick McLaughlin and his family, one of whom &mdash; his sister &mdash; lives in County Donegal.  The only crime this man ever committed was to be young, naive, vulnerable, drunk and Irish and that is no reason for getting a life sentence.  He has suffered as a consequence of having to serve his sentence, especially when he is innocent, and it is hard to appreciate how he feels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were successful in having him transferred but this has only been a temporary measure.  If he had obtained a <Col N="2059" /> permanent transfer he would now have been released.  As with anyone who is innocent he wants to prove it.  We have impressed on the Home Secretary the need to reinvestigate the case.  New evidence was made available to Scotland Yard but the case has not progressed further.  I was disappointed the Home Office and Home Secretary did not see fit to meet us.  I hope the British-Irish Parliamentary Body will be able to facilitate us to advance the case and that we will impress upon the elected members from the British Parliament the need to have this case reviewed and to allow this man express his innocence.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible travesty for a young man who has lost his wife because of this and who could lose his family, his dignity and everything he had when he first went to England.  I urge the Minister to reiterate our concern and to impress on the Home Secretary the need to have the case reopened to facilitate a further appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to commend the Deputies for their compassionate and humanitarian interest in this and other cases.  I am aware of the case of Patrick McLaughlin to whom the Deputy refers. Mr. McLaughlan was convicted in 1986 of conspiracy to cause explosions in Chelsea barracks in 1985 and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  He appealed this conviction but it was upheld in May 1988.  Mr. McLaughlin has continued to maintain his innocence. An organisation was established, the Friends of Patrick McLaughlin, to campaign on his behalf.  His case has been raised in this House on a number of occasions.  Mr. McLaughlin's efforts to establish his innocence has received the support of a wide range of eminent people and it continues to generate significant media interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Mr. McLaughlin's <Col N="2060" /> legal representatives continue to work tirelessly on his behalf to establish grounds for a reconsideration by the British authorities of his conviction, as the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated previously.</P>
    <P>The Department has been active on his case for a number of years.  His case has been followed closely since his arrest in December 1985.  An official from the Embassy in London attended Mr. McLaughlin's unsuccessful appeal in 1988.  While serving his sentence in Britain, Mr. Laughlin was also visited by an Embassy official and a number of issues of a consular nature were consequently raised by the Embassy with the Home Office.</P>
    <P>In addition to his efforts to establish his innocence, Mr. McLaughlin also applied for a transfer from Britain to a prison in Northern Ireland nearer his home.  As a result of these representations, he was transferred in September 1994.  However, this transfer was classified as temporary and subject therefore to review.  Thus far, his transfer has been consistently renewed and Mr. McLaughlin remains in Maghaberry. Representations have been made to have his transfer made permanent.  I understand, however, that Mr. McLaughlin's transfer remains temporary.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently indicated to the British authorities its wish that all transfers to Northern Ireland, including that of Mr. McLaughlin, be made permanent.  We welcome those transfers which have been classified permanent and would hope that this be granted in Mr. McLaughlin's case.  I understand that if and when his transfer is made permanent, his case will be eligible for consideration by the Northern Ireland Life Sentence Review Board.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste informed Deputies in this House on 1 February 1996, the Embassy in London has further contact with the British Home Office regarding <Col N="2061" /> applications for compassionate parole by Mr. McLaughlin.  This matter was also raised recently with the British authorities through the Secretariat.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's conviction that the handling of prisons issues is an important factor in the broader contexct of advancing confidence and trust.  Prison issues and confidence matters generally will continue to be fully discussed by the Government with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  It is a priority issue in our contacts with the British authorities through the Secretariat in Belfast and our Embassy in London.</P>
    <P>If there has been a miscarriage of justice, the Government believes that that should be redressed and redressed as quickly as possible.  Should Mr. McLaughlin and his legal representatives establish grounds for a reconsideration by the British authorities, we trust that it and any subsequent referral to the Court of Appeal will proceed in an expeditious manner.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies the Department will continue to monitor developments in this case closely.  We are aware of the concerns expressed by the prisoner's family and the distressing humanitarian situations which he experienced in relation to illness and death of relatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise an extremely urgent matter relating to the treatment of cancer patients at University Hospital, Cork.  The staff are risking their health by handling radioactive material while treating cancer patients. This issue is a source of concern not only to staff and patients but to everyone connected with the hospital and must be addressed immediately by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 12 people including radiotherapists, nurses and hall porters <Col N="2062" /> are unnecessarily exposed to radiation because of the non-availability of a remote after loading machine in the hospital.  The threat to staff is extremely serious and has been declared unacceptable by a leading radiotherapy consultant in the hospital.  The method employed results in a forceps being used to place radioactive material in cancer patients.  While the radiation levels are not particularly high, radiation has a cumulative quality and builds up in the body over the years.  A safe involvement is imperative for staff working in the hospital.  In allowing this method of treatment continue, the Minister and the Southern Health Board may be in breach of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The Minister is unfair to University Hospital, Cork and its staff in not providing a remote after loading machine and a suite to go with it.  There are two of these machines in Dublin hospitals. Why is there not equity in the delivery of health services in other parts of the country, particularly at University Hospital, Cork?  I understand the machine costs approximately £400,000. A voluntary group has raised significant funds to help to provide this machine and the suite.  Why is it that the Southern Health Board or the Minister has not taken up this option to secure the safety of its staff and patients?</P>
    <P>Patients are at risk.  We need positive action.  We need a comprehensive cancer treatment unit which would consist of a second linear accelerator, the immediate appointment of a medical oncologist and a suite for the after loading machine.  I draw the Minister's attention to the comment of a health board spokesperson who said that the exposure to radiation was unsatisfactory and the form of manual treatment was not ideal.  I also refer the Minister to a spokesperson for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, a monitoring body, who said he was concerned that staff at University Hospital, Cork, were still being exposed to radiation. While this is not a political issue it is a <Col N="2063" /> serious health matter that must be addressed immediately.  I know the Minister is concerned about patients and staff and that he wants to deliver an efficient, effective and safe health service. Therefore, I ask him to ensure this deficiency is rectified in the University Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have been aware for some time of the questions being raised in relation to Cork University Hospital's cancer treatment unit and officials of my Department have been in close liaison with the Southern Health Board on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that the hospital is operating under licence from the Radiation Protection Institute of Ireland in respect of its cancer treatment, which involves the use of radiation. The board has confirmed that, in so far as staff are exposed in any way to radiation, it is satisfied that the levels are within the parameters as prescribed by the Radiation Protection Institute of Ireland and by EU legislation.  In this regard, staff working in the area are required to wear badges which measure radiation levels to ensure that they are within the prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>During 1994, a submission was made to the Department of Health for the establishment of a high dose remote afterloading suite, and for a dedicated chemotherapy day unit.  Since then, the Department's hospital planning office has been working closely with the Southern Health Board to ensure that, in drawing up its proposals, the necessary technical and radiological requirements are being complied with.</P>
      <P>There is unanimous agreement among clinicians at Cork University Hospital that the development of a high dose remote afterloading is essential. This view is supported by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased, therefore, to be in a <Col N="2064" /> position recently to give the go ahead for the establishment of a design team to develop the brief for this project.  It is acknowledged by everyone concerned that this development will take some time to complete.  In the interim, in the interest of staff safety, my Department has agreed to make funding available for the purchase of an isolator, which will provide a safer environment for the reconstitution of drugs.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the voluntary group, ACT, for its hard work in raising substantial funds towards the cost of this important development.  I understand that to date it has raised in excess of £1 million towards the cost involved.  As Minister for Health, I welcome this type of co-operation between voluntary groups and the public sector in the delivery of health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise relates to the provision of water and sewerage facilities in dwellings which do not have such facilities at present.  While they can be provided under the housing aid for the elderly scheme, an allocation of £4 million is rather small when spread throughout the country.  Grants for the disabled covers such works but the county council essential repairs service does not.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that in 1996 some houses do not have basic water and sewerage facilities.  While most council houses have such facilities many old age pensioners in private houses do not. Will the Department provide grants for the installation of such facilities?  The reconstruction grant, which was approximately £1,000 per household, was abolished a few years ago.  The housing aid for the elderly scheme is operated by the health boards and work is carried out by FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the best value for money scheme that has operated in my constituency in my political career.  In 1994 the North Eastern Health Board <Col N="2065" /> received £312,000 for counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath and 736 jobs were completed.  In 1995 it received £303,000 and 844 jobs, which consisted of draught proofing, fitting windows and doors, replacing slates, painting and so on, were carried out.  Due to a backlog of other work, it is difficult for the health board to devote sufficient funding for the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  In 1994 the allocation for the Cavan-Monaghan community care area was £123,000 and 241 jobs were completed, at an average cost of £500 per job.  Running water was provided in 21 houses, toilet facilities in 33 and baths and showers in 21.  Surely that is value for money.  In 1995, 208 jobs were completed with a water supply provided in 16 houses, toilet facilities in 22 and baths and showers in 24.</P>
    <P>A different system is operated in County Meath.  In 1994, 372 jobs were completed in County Louth at an average cost of £300 per job.  Water facilities were provided in seven houses, toilet facilities in 31 and septic tanks in the case of 12.  Some group water schemes have provided cheap water connections for old people with scarce resources. Fibreglass septic tanks are easier to install than the older models.</P>
    <P>If additional resources were allocated to the housing aid for the elderly scheme these facilities could be provided. I am not raising this matter merely because I am in Opposition: I raised it on many occasions when my party was in power and I have strong feelings about it.  Under the programme, A Government of Renewal, all local authority housing must be administered by the local authority.  A survey should be carried out to determine the number of houses requiring such facilities and the necessary resources should be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter <Col N="2066" /> and I know his concern is genuine.  Substantial progress has been made in improving the condition and facilities available in the housing stock over recent years.  In relation to water and sanitary facilities in particular the 1990 survey of the housing stock showed that between 1980 and 1990 the proportion of dwellings without an internal water supply fell from 4.3 per cent to 2.3 per cent, dwellings without an internal WC fell from 16 per cent to 6.4 per cent and dwellings without a fixed bath or shower fell from 19.5 per cent to 8 per cent.  The position with regard to basic sanitary facilities in the housing stock has further improved significantly in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of private dwellings have been improved under the range of measures which are currently available to improve substandard housing, including the provision of adequate bathroom and toilet facilities. In addition, some 4,500 local authority dwellings have been provided with bathroom facilities under the remedial works programme and the bathrooms sub-programme.  The loss of older and substandard dwellings to the housing stock through the normal rate of obsolescence has also meant that the number of dwellings without water or sewerage facilities has reduced significantly since the 1990 survey of the housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The range of measures currently available to assist the provision of water and sewerage facilities includes group water scheme grants, the disabled person grants scheme, local authority house improvement loans, the scheme for improvement works in lieu of rehousing, the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly, and income tax relief on the interest payable on borrowings for the purpose of improving the principal residence.  Some of the measures I have just mentioned, such as income tax relief on borrowings, are available generally.  Others are specifically designed to assist particular needs, <Col N="2067" /> such as persons with a disability.  Other cater for the needs of persons who cannot afford to have necessary works of improvement carried out.  All can assist the provision of adequate water and sanitary facilities in houses which lack them.  There is, therefore, a range of assistance available to persons who wish to bring their dwellings up to a reasonable standard, particularly in the case of elderly or disabled persons.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that a grant scheme such as the Deputy suggests would help to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, I must also remain conscious of the potential cost.  The Government's priorities in the housing area, as set out in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> are to expand the local authority and other social housing programmes and to upgrade deficient local authority dwellings. As the available resources will, accordingly, be concentrated on these programmes, I have no proposals at this stage to introduce a house improvement grants scheme for water and sewerage facilities or generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister herself did not see fit to come into the House because this matter does not correctly fall within the remit of the Minister for State, Deputy Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The art education annex of the National College of Art and Design is due to be moved back to Thomas Street from Leinster Lane next year when phase three of the development has been completed.  In the meantime, the premises in Leinster Lane are required by the Office of Public Works.  Accordingly, the current student population of approximately 100 will be moved out to the Carysfort complex from 30 September 1996 until next year.  This move will adversely affect final year students, most especially because of the distance they will have to travel to avail of <Col N="2068" /> library and other facilities which do not exist in Carysfort.</P>
    <P>There are three main points I want to put to the Minister.  Access to essential library facilities will be severely affected, resulting not only in increased academic pressure but also calling into question the quality of their qualifications and, ultimately, their ability to teach other students.  These are the comments of the students themselves. They say also that access to college facilities, such as the student's union, college doctor and counsellor will also be severely depleted.  The essential nature of these facilities for the development of proper representation of students has been well documented.</P>
    <P>The students state that access to a range of artistic facilities and simulti forms an integral part of their core education and that their artistic development will also be affected.  In other words, this transfer in their final year will have an enormously damaging effect.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister to ask the Office of Public Works to defer the begining of work in Leinster Lane until the college campus in Thomas Steet is completed in October 1997.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Minister's Department has side-kicked this to the Higher Education Authority.  The proposal that students and staff of the faculty of education be transferred from 30 June next to agreed accommodation in UCD until such time as the buildings in Thomas Street have been completed was put to them only on 10 May.</P>
    <P>The students wrote seeking a meeting with the Minister, to which she replied by letter dated 30 April that, due to previous commitments, she would be unable to meet them over the next few weeks.  Since the education conferences are now over, I ask the Minister to meet a couple of student representatives. These are not hysterical or screaming students but fine young people of whom we should be very proud who will bring much cultural education to our people. <Col N="2069" /> We need people like them with confidence in themselves, who can be confident that their qualifications in their final year will not be looked down on by those who will know they did not have the same facilities as other students in their final year.  I would be very happy if the Minister of State would confirm that his colleague, the Minister for Education, would meet a couple of students and listen to them put their case, which they did very eloquently when I met them.</P>
    <P>The excuse was being advanced that a crèche was needed by Dáil Deputies, about which members of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights are very annoyed.  I spoke to their chairperson, Deputy Mary Wallace, who confirmed that there had not been even one request by any Member of the Dáil for such crèche facilities, that there may have been such requests by staff members, and pointing out that the crèche referred to forms a very small part of the overall complex.  It appears somebody, in a rather snide manner, decided they would get away with this work and, at the same time, blacken the names of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to convey my request to the Minister to meet a couple of these students.  Ten or 15 minutes is all that would be required.  It would mean a lot to them and convince them they had a Minister for Education who cared about them and their future. I should prefer that she would defer the work proposed by the Office of Public Works who apparently are demanding this site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Briscoe for raising this matter and I am glad of the opportunity to advise the House of the up-to-date position regarding the National College of Art and Design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, it was decided in 1983 that NCAD, which had <Col N="2070" /> been located in Kildare Street since 1815, would be transferred to a newly-acquired property known as the Cooperage at Thomas Street and that the transfer would be undertaken in a number of phases.  To date two phases of development have been completed.  The third phase, which would allow the remainder of the property at Leinster Lane to be fully vacated, was deferred by the Government in late 1987 even though the project had reached an advanced stage of planning.</P>
    <P>To my regret, in all that time, nothing whatsoever was done to advance the project.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, recognising the unsuitability of the property and the urgent need to rehouse the college's staff and students currently located at Leinster Lane, set aside £4 million under the 1994-1999 Third Level European Regional Development Fund Programme for the phase III development. This will allow NCAD's existing staff and students to be accommodated on the main campus at Thomas Street.</P>
    <P>Planning permission has now been granted for the project and it is envisaged that construction work will commence later in 1996 and be completed, at the earliest, in the latter part of 1997.</P>
    <P>To expedite matters the Department has already given the go-ahead to preliminary site works, including an archaeological dig and piling.  The office of Public Works, the owner of the site at Leinster Lane, has plans for its development which includes the provision of additional library and new créche facilities for Dáil Éireann.  To allow this development to commence at the earliest possible date consultations have been taking place between the Higher Education Authority, the governing body of NCAD, my Department and the Department of Finance.  The Deputy will note that my Department has not washed its hands of the matter and passed it to HEA.  A number of options <Col N="2071" /> have been investigated and considered by the governing body of NCAD and the HEA.  These include the use of space in UCD's Graduate Business School in Blackrock to accommodate the education course staff and students.</P>
    <P>All options are at present being considered by this Department but I want to assure the Deputy and, more partic <Col N="2072" /> ularly, the staff and students at present located at Leinster Lane that no decision has been taken to date and that consultations are continuing between this Department, the Department of Finance and Office of Public Works on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 May 1996.</P>

      <P>Maximum rent levels are determined by the health boards in light of local knowledge and taking into account such factors as current accommodation costs in the area.  Accommodation costs are based on information on average rents charged in the area received from local auctioneers and letting agents.  The maximum rent levels on which rent supplements are based are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 January 1996, health boards are currently setting maximum rent levels for various classes of people in line with the requirements of regulations which the Minister made last year namely Statutory Instrument No. 382 of <Col N="1931" /> 1995.  The information available at this time in respect of such rent levels, for the various classes of persons, are <Col N="1932" /> shown in the following tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions, family income supplement is payable to low paid workers with children, whose weekly earnings are below specified income limits.  A significant number of improvements to FIS were provided for in the 1996 budget, including an increase of £10 in the weekly income limits used to determine entitlement, thereby ensuring that most recipients will receive an increase of £6 per week. The new income limits as provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, range from £195 for families with one child, up to £334 for families with eight or more children.  Other improvements in FIS announced in this years budget include a reduction, from six to three months, in the minimum period which the employment is expected to last; a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in order to qualify for FIS, from 20 to 19 hours per week; the extension of FIS to jobsharers; and increasing the rate of FIS payable on the birth of a child rather than awaiting the annual review of entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provides for a related improvement, which will allow people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more to retain entitlement to increases for children payable at the full rate, for a period of up to 13 weeks on taking up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks.  This improvement will alleviate the difficulties encountered by <Col N="1936" /> some families during the period between the termination of their unemployment payment and the award of FIS.  This is designed to complement the support provided by FIS for low paid workers and medical card retension.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which FIS could be further enhanced, would be to assess earnings on a net basis, rather than on gross basis, as at present.  Proposals in this area are currently being examined by my Department.  The policy and cost implications of extending FIS to single people are also being considered.  Implementation of any proposals arising from this examination would have to be considered in the light of available resources and other demands for improvements in social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provides for the introduction of a number of other pro-employment measures which are designed to facilitate unemployed people in seeking and taking up new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>This Act provides for a reform of unemployment assistance, including revised provisions for the assessment of earnings from employment.  This will make it easier for people to calculate how much better off they will be if they take up part-time or casual employment. In addition, under the new one-parent family payment, which will be payable to people with earnings up to £12,000 per year, the first £6,000 of earnings plus half the earnings in excess of this amount, will be disregarded in the assessment of means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the students' summer jobs scheme is to provide income support for the less well-off third level students who are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance and are unable to obtain summer work.  Taking account of the upward trend in the number of students participating in the scheme since its inception, this year priority is being given to enabling the maximum number of eligible students, who have no other means of support, to take part within the allocation for the 1996 scheme which is £10.2 million.  The main focus of the scheme this year is to provide places for students who are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance. Students who still have a legal right to claim unemployment assistance during the summer period&mdash;such as mature students and those who have completed their courses&mdash;are not deprived of income support and, therefore, are not eligible for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was decided to discontinue the special additional allowance of £1 per hour to students whose parents are dependent on social welfare payments in this year's scheme for a number of reasons as follows:&mdash; (i) a survey indicated that most students who participated in the scheme showed that 86 per cent expressed satisfaction with the basic rate of payment i.e. £3.00 per hour; (ii) some students felt that it was unfair to have two rates of pay applying to the same work; (iii) many took up the option of engaging in other part-time work which is allowed under the <Col N="1938" /> scheme.  Many of the students completed their hours over a six-week period and this represents a payment of £100 net per week which I am satisfied represents a very generous tax free payment, and (iv) because of the upward trend in the numbers availing of the scheme, the discontinuance of the allowance will allow the maximum number of eligible students to take part.</P>
    <P>Leaving certificate students have been previously precluded from the scheme.  It is not my intention to include them in this year's scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 102 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has taken a number of important initiatives to address income adequacy.  First, child benefit was raised by 45 per cent over the last two budgets as it is clear that households with children face a relatively higher risk of poverty compared to many other groups in society.  Second, the Government has approved the development of a national anti-poverty <Col N="1942" /> strategy which is to be put in place by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>Third, the Government has commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to review the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The review is under way and will put forward new rates in the light of improvements in social welfare and other changes since the report of the commission was published.  It will provide an objective basis for assessing the adequacy or otherwise of social welfare entitlements.  The review, along with other reviews of the social welfare systems, such as that of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare, will form the basis for the formulation of proposals for improvements in the social welfare system in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the maintenance and development of the social insurance system as a key part of its strategy for providing social welfare payments in the decades ahead.</P>
    <P>There is no widely agreed definition of the &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo;, even though the term is in widespread use.  Living conditions vary from country to country at any one time and living patterns in any given country change over a period.  For this reason, a standard of living which is considered adequate in one place or at one time could be considered inadequate at another time or in a different place.</P>
    <P>There is widespread acceptance of the view that poverty should be seen in terms of the standard of living of the society in question.  As a consequence, relative poverty lines have been put forward as a useful indicator of the extent of poverty in any given society at any point in time.  However, they are more precisely an indicator of inequality rather than poverty.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute has undertaken a considerable amount of technical research and analysis in this area.  Results based on 1987 data show that approximately 31 per cent of households have an income at or <Col N="1943" /> below 60 per cent of mean household income, approximately 15 per cent of households have an income at or below 50 per cent of mean household income while approximately 5 per cent of households have an income at or below 40 per cent of mean household income. Results relating to 1994 income data will be available later this year.  The usefulness of these analyses is not the percentages themselves, which depend on the lines one chooses, but rather the description of the groups at relatively greatest risk of poverty, and the changes over time as policies must be aimed at these groups.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure that social welfare beneficiaries receive their full entitlements.  To that end, ways of ensuring full and timely take-up of payments to which people are legally entitled are continually under examination in my Department.</P>
      <P>All persons receiving social welfare benefits on the basis of PRSI contributions are notified of their potential entitlement to retirement or old age (contributory) pension some three months before the pension becomes due at age 65 or 66 years, respectively.  Adult dependants aged 66 or over of recipients of old age (non-contributory) pensions were notified of their potential entitlement to an old age pension in their own right in August 1995.  It is intended to notify persons in this category on a more regular basis and in advance of their reaching age 66 in future.  These initiatives help to avoid late claims from people in these categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience to date shows that <Col N="1946" /> this direct targeting of the people concerned is very effective.  My Department is examining ways of improving this type of targeting and of extending it to categories which are not benefiting either directly or indirectly under the social welfare system.  The main effort is through the dissemination of information made available generally and extensively by the Department by way of booklets, leaflets, talks at pre-retirement courses, interviews on radio and occasionally on TV.</P>
    <P>Information leaflets and booklets relating to each scheme are available from any of the network of 58 social welfare local offices around the country. Local offices are in a position to provide detailed information on the full range of services available.</P>
    <P>The national social services board and the independent voluntary sector also provide a very valuable service to the public in this regard.  They complement and enhance the information services provided at local and community level.  The transfer last year of responsibility for the National Social Services Board to the Department of Social Welfare recognises this and was part of an ongoing process aimed at improving information services to the public.</P>

      <P>It will be a priority for the Minister for Social Welfare, and myself, during the Irish Presidency of the European Union to take all possible steps to advance the objectives which are set out in Article 2 of the Treaty of European Union concerning high levels of employment, social protection and social cohesion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> The major current strand to EU activity in my area of responsibility is the debate launched by the European Commission last October on &ldquo;The Future of Social Protection&rdquo;.  The purpose of this debate is to address, in a spirit of co-operative reflection, the common challenges facing all member states in this area.</P>
    <P>It will be a principal aim to advance this debate in a positive framework and with due regard to the Treaty objectives I referred to above.  To this end, the Minister will host, in Dublin Castle on 10-11 July 1996, an informal Council meeting of Ministers for Social Security, which will focus on the issue which Ministers agreed at the Social Affairs Council on 29 March was the greatest challenge facing us&mdash;the need to ensure that social protection systems contribute positively to the fight against unemployment.</P>
    <P>My Department will also host two conferences which will address further issues in this debate.  The first, entitled &ldquo;Social Security: Beyond Equal Treatment&rdquo;, will take place on 10-12 October 1996.  This conference is being co-hosted with the EU Commission with input from the social security sub-group of the EU Network of Experts on the Implementation of the Equality Directives.  It will be a forum for discussion among key policy makers and national experts within the EU on how to ensure that our systems are capable of addressing the particular needs of women.</P>
    <P>The second conference, &ldquo;New Directions in Social Welfare&rdquo;, will be held on 14-16 November 1996 and is being co-hosted with the European Foundation of the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  The objective is to focus on new policies and approaches towards social protection, either recently implemented or under consideration, in member states.  The issues of unemployment and social exclusion will be to the fore in this conference. Drawing on all the strands of this debate, I intend proposing to my European colleagues that, at the Social <Col N="1948" /> Affairs Council in early December, we take stock of the issues which have arisen and aim to draw conclusions and principles which we could each bring to bear in the work of developing our systems at national level.  Again, I will be seeking to lay particular stress on the need to address unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>In addition to leading this debate on the future of social protection, I hope to be in a position to advance a number of legislative instruments within the Social Affairs Council relating to improving the social security rights of migrant workers and to the ongoing implementation of Equal Treatment in Social Security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental task force was set up to assist the Department of Social Welfare in drafting material for the White Paper on voluntary activity.  The original intention was that the task force would report back by the end of October 1992.  This deadline proved unrealistic, having regard to the work involved and the need for further consultations with the voluntary and community sector.  The task force first met in June 1992 and completed its work in July 1993.  The work of drafting the <Col N="1949" /> actual text for a White Paper then commenced in the Department of Social Welfare and a draft had been prepared by December 1994.</P>
    <P>As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 5 and 22 on 22 February 1996, the intention was to seek Government approval to have the White Paper published by the end of 1995.  It was not possible to do so due to the introduction of a number of new policy initiatives which in themselves had the potential for a substantial impact on the relationship between the voluntary and community sectors and statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>The essential difficulty has been that much has been happening in the community and voluntary sector and related areas which are likely to have an impact on the draft White Paper.  These include the reform of the Department of Social Welfare's grant schemes for voluntary organisations, implementation of the programme for local urban and rural development and perhaps most importantly of all the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  I might also mention in this context the Taoiseach's recent announcement of the establishment of a Western Development Commission to promote coherent action for economic and social development by public bodies, social partners and community-based groups throughout the western region.</P>
    <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) is designed to fundamentally change the way in which Government tackles the issues of poverty and social exclusion and has involved a widespread consultation process with the voluntary sector.  The strategy, after an essential lead in period of consultation, is now entering its most critical stages of policy development.  Not taking the NAPS process into account in the White Paper would have meant that it would have been out of date even prior to its publication.</P>
    <P>These developments necessitated a detailed re-drafting of the text of the draft White Paper which is nearing completion. Both my officials and I have had numerous meetings regarding these <Col N="1950" /> issues both internally within the Department and also with the voluntary sector over the last year in relation to the forthcoming White Paper.  I hope to be able to make an announcement in relation to the White Paper in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare attended the European Social Forum in Brussels last March, and received a copy of the Comite des Sages' report, &ldquo;For a Europe of Civic and Social Rights&rdquo; which was presented there.</P>
      <P>The committee set out to conduct a very fundamental inquiry into the part that social matters and social rights should play in the next stage of European development.  Their conclusion can be summarised in the following extract from the report's introduction:</P>
      <P>Europe will be a Europe for all it's citizens, or it will be nothing.  It will not tackle the challenges now facing it &mdash;competitiveness, the demographic situation, enlargement and globalisation&mdash;if it does not strengthen it's &mdash;SIC&mdash; social dimension and demonstrate it's ability to ensure that fundamental social rights are respected and applied.</P>
      <P>This is a vision with which I wholeheartedly agree.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to make recommendations, some of which lie outside my Department's area of responsibility. I am aware that copies of the report have been received by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State for Labour Affairs.</P>
      <P>In relation to social welfare, the report makes recommendations about a number of the crucial strategic issues which we, and our fellow member states, must address&mdash;for example, the need to make our social welfare system an effective force for competitiveness and social cohesion; and the need to facilitate greater flexibility in reconciling work and family responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major element in my Department's Presidency will be to advance the debate among member states on a communication issued by the Commission last October on &ldquo;The Future of Social Protection&rdquo;.  Ireland will, during our Presidency, be leading a &ldquo;co-operative reflection&rdquo; among the member states on <Col N="1952" /> the leading issues facing our social protection systems.  We will be devoting an Informal Social Affairs Council meeting on 10-11 July to one of the principal concerns to be addressed there&mdash;the challenge of ensuring that social protection is a positive force in the fight against unemployment.  We will also be hosting two conferences on aspects of this debate, one in October on social protection systems and the particular needs of women, the second in November on new approaches to social protection which are being implemented or under consideration in the various member states.  Finally, at the formal Social Affairs Council in December, we will be inviting fellow Ministers to draw conclusions on the debate to date.</P>
    <P>The report of the Comite Des Sages is very relevant to this reflection and I would envisage that we will be drawing heavily on it when leading this process. We are, incidentially, hoping to have one of the committee members address the November Conference.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to point out that the committee's report specifically recommended that the Union be involved in &ldquo;a co-ordinating and experimental role in terms of combating social exclusion&rdquo;.  Deputies will be familiar with the Minister's often expressed support for such a role.  This again is something that we would hope to advance, in the context of the debate on &ldquo;The Future of Social Protection&rdquo; during our Presidency.</P>

      <Quest>the rates of PRSI that apply for the year 1996; and the income thresholds that apply to each rate.</Quest>

      <P>The standard class A rate of PRSI, which applies to the vast majority of workers, varies according to weekly earnings.  Employees earning below £30 per week are normally insured for occupational injuries benefits only.  The employee does not pay any contribution and the employer pays 0.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Where weekly earnings are between £30 and £250, the employer pays a reduced rate of 8.5 per cent.  Where weekly earnings exceed £250, the employer's share is 12 per cent. Employees pay 5.5 per cent on earnings above the PRSI-free allowance of £80 per week.  The annual income ceiling for PRSI purposes is currently £22,300 for employees and £26,500 for employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> The employee with earnings over £188 is liable to pay additional levies of 2.25 per cent&mdash;health contribution-employment and training levy&mdash;on all earnings, with no upper income ceiling. These levies do not apply to medical card holders, recipients of a social welfare widow's-widower's pension, deserted wife's benefit-allowance or lone parent's allowance.</P>
    <P>Full information on current PRSI rates is contained in an information leaflet published by my Department in March of this year.  I have arranged to have a copy of the leaflet forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Section 179 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as substituted by Paragraph 3 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement, including rent and mortgage interest supplements, to a person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>A housing review group was set up in September 1994 to examine rent and mortgage interest supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This group recommended in its report, which was presented to the Minister in December 1995, that &ldquo;an integrated approach to the assessment of housing need and the allocation of housing resources should be adopted within a single legislative framework&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of this housing review group report, an interdepartmental committee under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, and with representatives from <Col N="1955" /> the Departments of Health, Social Welfare, and Finance, was established.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this committee is to make recommendations to Government as to how the proposal in the programme for Government, A Government of Renewal, which contains a commitment that &ldquo;all forms of social housing assistance will be administered by the local authority&rdquo; can be carried out.</P>
    <P>The work of the committee is to examine the main issues arising from the proposed transfer of the administration of rent and mortgage supplementation to the local authorities.  This committee will report to Government in due course.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, set out his views on this issue in a written reply on 22 February last.  In summary, the position is as follows.</P>
      <P>A key objective of the Government is to make the social welfare system more &ldquo;work-friendly&rdquo; in the sense that it not only provides an adequate minimum income for people without other adequate means of support, but enables such people to take up any employment opportunities which may arise for them. In line with this objective, we have made a number of changes in order to make it more attractive for unemployed people to take up work, and for employers to create new jobs.  For example, in this year's budget we reduced the rate of employers' PRSI, making it chepaer for employers to take on new workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this context that the Minister called on IBEC and other employers' organisations to begin to consider how, in the light of other pro-employment <Col N="1957" /> changes in the tax and welfare areas, the problem of low pay can best be addressed.  Considerable progress could be made within the current legislative arrangements, by building on the rudimentary system of &ldquo;sectoral minimum wages&rdquo;, as represented by the legallybinding joint labour committee rates in a number of industries and the registered employment agreement provisions of the industrial relations legislation, which altogether cover around 150,000 workers.  Low pay is not a problem in all sectors, and so there is no need to address all sectors immediately.</P>

      <P>Designation of towns and areas for tax incentives normally come under the urban renewal scheme.  The present urban renewal scheme was introduced on 1 August 1994 and will operate for a three year period.  The scheme applies to 35 cities and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Late last year my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy McManus, announced a comprehensive review of the entire urban renewal scheme to assess the experience gained over the past ten years.  At that time, she said that until the outcome of this review was assessed no new areas or <Col N="1964" /> towns would be designated.  I understand that as part of this review a team of consultants has been appointed to evaluate the whole urban renewal experience and is expected to complete its work during the summer.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget I announced a new scheme of relief for traditional seaside resorts.  This pilot scheme came into effect last July for a three year period. The scheme is in operation in 15 seaside resorts.  As I have said in the past, until this pilot scheme is firmly established and evaluated it would seem inappropriate to consider its extension to any further areas.  Moreover, I do not intend extending this scheme to any inland areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to remind the House that there are more than 50 areas in cities, towns and seaside resorts designated either under the urban renewal scheme or the pilot scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  To introduce additional designated areas under either of these two schemes or to introduce a completely new scheme could greatly dilute the benefits of the existing schemes.  Consequently, there are no plans to extend designated status to any additional areas such as those proposed in the Deputy's question.</P>

The majority of therapists are involved in the provision of services to children.  Clients are seen in a number of different settings including health centres, special schools, child psychiatry clinics, pre-schools, special speech and language units attached to schools, as well as child and family clinics.</P>

The overall planning advice role of the National Monuments Service will also be based on this policy.  In cases where it is considered that unsuitable planning permission has been granted, powers under the National Monuments Acts will be invoked at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Royal Canal corridor study which was formally launched by me in January 1996.  The Royal Canal is navigable from the first <Col N="1971" /> lock at North Strand Road, Dublin to Mullingar.  The waterways service of my Department has reached agreement in principle with CIE-Iarnród Eireann about the removal of the last remaining obstacle to navigation to the River Liffey, a railway line over the canal at Newcomen junction, and its replacement with a lifting bridge.</P>
      <P>The waterways service is maintaining the Royal Canal in the corridor area as resources permit and is actively working with local authorities and the private sector to improve the canal corridor. One of the recommendations of the corridor study was the appointment of a project manager, who would report to a steering committee in my Department, to co-ordinate the work of the various agencies and implement the findings of the corridor study report.  I am currently examining this recommendation and I hope to be in a position to make appropriate arrangements soon.</P>

      <P>The current statutory regime under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988, places a universal requirement on all persons in possession of a television set to hold a current television licence. The revenue generated from the sale of television licences is paid, net of collection cost, to RTE for the general purposes of broadcasting.</P>

      <P>Vice-principals in first-level schools are required to be in attendance for a period of not less than five hours and 40 minutes per day.  Secular instruction comprises four hours and ten minutes of this time.  In order to ensure that schools are operating in accordance with the rules for national schools, schools are frequently visited by the school inspectors who verify that the school timetable is being observed in accordance with the rules.</P>
      <P>In second-level schools, the minimum number of hours that vice-principals should teach depends on the enrolment or the points rating of the school.  The number of hours should normally be of the order indicated in the following tables.  The allocation of teaching hours is, in the first instance, a matter for the management authority of the individual school.  My Department examines the timetables submitted by each school and in which is outlined the allocation of classes and the number of hours taught by each teacher.  The attendance of teachers in accordance with the timetable is monitored in the course of school inspections by my Department.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The current staffing at the school referred to by the Deputy consists of a principal, nine assistants, a concessionary teacher on account of the disadvantaged status of the school and a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>This staffing will not be retained for the 1996-97 school year as the enrolment of the school has declined from 281 pupils in September 1994 to 259 pupils in September 1995.  The ninth assistant's post will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question has been given the option of having her name placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment, which will not take place before 1 September 1996.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the visiting teacher service which was expanded in 1992 to cover additional categories of special needs children attending ordinary primary schools.  Under this expansion arrangement, an additional eight visiting teachers were allocated to the service, bringing the total number of teachers in the service to 38.</P>
      <P>Two of these additional teachers were allocated to the Dublin area, one to the north side of the city and one to the south side.  Both of these teachers were charged with adopting a particular focus on the needs of Down's syndrome children attending school on an integrated basis in their areas.</P>
      <P>I understand that the teacher appointed to the south side of the city supports 13 special needs children and that the contact time for each child is between one and two hours per week. Corresponding details relating to the teacher on the north side of the city are not readily available.  However, I will arrange to forward this information to the Deputy as soon as possible.  It will of course be appreciated that contact times can vary depending on the case-load of individual teachers and the evolving needs of particular children.  Teachers in the visiting teacher service are employed by my Department on a permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the visiting teacher service is reviewed on a regular basis by my Department's primary inspectorate. Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached a high priority to improving the quality and level of support services available to children with special educational needs, including those who are integrated in mainstream schools.  Substantial progress has been achieved in this area. Measures which I have introduced include: the appointment of an <Col N="1986" /> additional 241 remedial teachers at primary level bringing the total now in place nationwide to 1,188 and the appointment of an additional 29 resource teachers in ordinary primary schools bringing the total number of resource teachers to 36.</P>
    <P>The remedial and resources teachers are a key support service for pupils with special needs who have been integrated into ordinary schools.</P>
    <P>The measures set out in the White Paper in relation to special needs pupils are intended to refine and develop the current range of responses.  A key objective will be to ensure that all children with special education needs will have access to the necessary range of support services in their own areas.  This includes the support of special needs children in mainstream schools.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years I have met with a wide variety of organisations which represent people with disabilities, including the Down's Syndrome Association of Ireland and the Donegal Down's Syndrome Association.  I have also held a number of meetings, both formal and informal, with organisations which, <i>inter alia</i>, include people with disabilities.  Therefore, it is not possible to give an absolute number of organisations or meetings.</P>

      <Quest>the provisions, if any, she has made to provide secondary educational facilities to islanders from Inishbofin Island under the remote boarding grant scheme, in view of the fact that there is no girls' boarding school accepting pupils for first year in the County of Galway that are in the free secondary school education scheme and whose boarding fees are less that £1,750; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the free post-primary education scheme, provision exists for a scheme of grants towards boarding or lodging costs in respect of pupils whose homes are outside the range of transport services to a second level school providing suitable free post-primary education.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the grant, an applicant must be a recognised pupil in a second level school in which the boarding fee charged to parents does not exceed £1,750 per pupil per annum from the commencement of the school year 1995-96.</P>
      <P>Where it is not feasible for a pupil to attend a boarding school, or where the boarding fee charged to parents exceeds £1,750, a pupil may receive a grant towards the cost of lodging while attending a day school participating in the free post-primary education scheme.</P>
      <P>As the boarding fee at Kylemore Abbey school exceeds £1,750, a pupil attending the school as a boarder would not qualify for assistance.  However, if a pupil from Inishbofin wishes to attend the school as a day pupil, a grant towards the cost of lodgings may be payable under the scheme.</P>

      <Col N="1991" /> In the period from April 1993 to October 1995, the number of persons on the live register in the 25 to 34 age group fell from 87,550 to 78,959, a 10 per cent reduction.  While my Department does not have schemes or programmes directed exclusively at the 25 to 34 year age group, it has taken a proactive and work supportive approach in assisting unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, to reenter the active labour market.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget, a number of measures designed to facilitate the transition from unemployment to employment were announced.  These included: improvements in the family income supplement; a revision of the manner in which earnings from employment will be assessed for unemployment assistance purposes; a substantial increase in the number of places on the back to work allowance scheme from 10,000 to 15,000; the retention of child dependant allowances for the first 13 weeks of employment by the long-term, unemployed; an increase of £30 in the PRSI-free allowance for full rate PRSI contributors from £50 to £80 per week; and significant reductions in the rates of employer's PRSI.</P>

The question of improving or enhancing the range of additional benefits available, including extending them to recipients not covered at present, are matters for consideration in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme administered by my Department is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and to certain disabled <Col N="1993" /> people under the age of 66.  The scheme has been improved and expanded progressively in recent years.  Last year, a major extension took place with the introduction of free cross-Border travel allowing passholders from the Republic of Ireland to travel free to Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa.</i> In addition, the free travel companion pass was further extended to passholders being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance. From July next, the free travel companion pass is being extended to blind and visually impaired children.  This measure will be of particular benefit to children attending special schools and who have to commute on a daily or weekly basis by allowing them have a person of their choice travel free with them on their journey.</P>
      <P>Any proposals for the future expansion of the free travel scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance was extended last year to include carers looking after people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a pension other than a social welfare pension e.g. those getting an occupational pension. Arising from this measure, about 1,000 new carers were brought into the scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of further extending the scheme to include people caring for those aged under 66 years who are retired on illness grounds would have cost implications which would have to be examined in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Intellectual Property Unit of my Department recently carried out a comprehensive review of copyright legislation in Ireland.  The unit is currently involved in the drafting of heads of a very substantial Bill in this extremely difficult and technical area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new legislation will be very substantial, as this area has not been addressed in over 30 years and as legal and technological changes since then have greatly impacted on this issue.  I intend to bring forward this legislation as soon as possible but the Deputy will appreciate that given the difficulties and technical issues involved, the importance of the legal rights provided for and the nature of our international obligations, this process must not be rushed. The Deputy can be assured that there will be no delay in processing the legislation. Steady progress is being made in this regard and that I will make every effort to expedite it.  It is intended that this legislation will, <i>inter alia</i>, ensure the appropriate protection of music in schools and elsewhere, while respecting the rights of authors and users of copyright material and remaining consistent <Col N="1997" /> with Ireland's obligations in the copyright and related rights arenas.</P>
    <P>In respect of the controversy to which the Deputy refers, the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology has met directly with IMRO and substantial progress was made towards creating the environment for an acceptable resolution.</P>

      <P>These directives require that prepacked foods must be labelled with the name of the food; the list of ingredients; the net quantity; the date of minimum durability or &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date; any special storage instructions; the name and address of packer, manufacturer etc.; the country or origin, only if its absence is likely to mislead consumers; the instructions for use, where necessary; the alcoholic strength over 1.2 per cent; and the indication of irradiation or treatment with ionising rediation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to inform consumers of the content of the food they eat.  The regulations are enforced rigorously by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Union law would not allow the Minister to prescribe food labelling <Col N="1998" /> requirements, including the unilateral designation of country of origin in all cases, as it would constitute a technical barrier to trade and contravene our obligations under EU Treaties.</P>

      <Quest>whether the liberalisation of the energy supply market will allow suppliers of nuclear-generated electricity to serve the Irish market; if so, whether such a facility will compromise the Irish argument against Sellafield; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy that nuclear power should not be used for the production of electricity in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is likely that a common position on the draft Electricity Directive will be reached at an Energy Council in June, before the end of the Italian Presidency. Under the draft Directive, Ireland will retain the right to determine the fuel used in any generating station which is established in Ireland.  This empowers the Government to refuse approval for the use of nuclear fuel in any Irish power station.  It remains firm Government policy that the ESB may not purchase nuclear generated electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions for third party access to networks, large customers will be entitled, if the necessary interconnection capacity exists, to contract directly with generators abroad for electricity. However, access to nuclear generated electricity is not possible at present as Ireland is not connected to Scotland, England or Wales.  There are plans, however, for an interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland which, at least in theory, would open the option for large Irish consumers to make contracts with nuclear generators <Col N="2006" /> in the UK or mainland Europe.  We will continue to seek to ensure that the Directive allows us to refuse access to our market for nuclear generated electricity.</P>
    <P>In view of the clear Government policy and very strong Irish public opinion against nuclear power it seems extremely unlikely that any large company would contract directly with nuclear power stations.  Even if they did, there would be no question of importing radioactive material.</P>
    <P>The Government remains firmly committed to an anti-nuclear policy and the theoretical ability of large electricity consumers to contract abroad for electricity has no bearing on Ireland's arguments against Sellafield, which are concerned with the danger to Ireland posed by the possibility of an accident at the plant and environmental concerns regarding emissions from the plant into the Irish Sea.</P>

    <P>The Department of the Marine is currently finalising consideration of the <Col N="2009" /> projects recommended by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).  A large number of applications was received by BIM in respect of this round under the PESCA Initiative.  The proposals cover a range of activities which reflect the application and use to which PESCA can be put to assist fishing communities and to encourage diversification.  These projects required detailed evaluation.  A number of the applications were ineligible, others require further development and some have been withdrawn. However, the process is now near completion and I expect that a significant number of projects will be approved.</P>
