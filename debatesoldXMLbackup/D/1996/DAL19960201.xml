      <P>In view of the important meetings in which the Tánaiste is involved and the statements made by some of the Unionist leaders this morning, can the Taoiseach confirm that the Government remains totally committed and interested in moving towards all party talks before the end of this month and is totally opposed to an elected body?</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  Much time was devoted to this subject yesterday and I cannot allow a repeat of it on this morning's Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat what I stated yesterday.  I did not raise this question yesterday.  The Taoiseach may wish to take this opportunity to ensure the total support of this House for the Mitchell report.  As the Tánaiste is meeting the British Government today, it should be seen that we are totally opposed to an elected body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On two occasions this week, the Minister of Justice expressed her concern that the Judiciary does not impose consecutive sentences for crimes committed by a person while on bail.  Is it the Government's intention to amend the 1984 Act with a view to giving clear legislative direction to the Judiciary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will bring forward a general criminal law Bill and any suggestions a Member wishes to make on it can be made at that stage. However, in regard to specific legislation other than that which has been promised, the Deputy would be better advised to put down a specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will make our points known when the Bill is published. The Minister has expressed her concerns and I am anxious that they be taken on board in any legislative programme the Government will publish. Can the Taoiseach assure me that the Government will, in the forthcoming proposals on crime, ensure the Judiciary is given clear legislative direction so there is no misunderstanding in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made many worth-while comments.  She is the Minister for Justice and a member of <Col N="2075" /> the Government.  The public wants to see the Government dealing with these problems in a satisfactory manner.  We cannot do that if we do not change the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has in train the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which we expect will be available in the first half of this year, and a criminal law Bill which will abolish the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and also make changes in regard to distinctions in different types of service in prison.  I expect that legislation to be available in February.</P>
      <P>When a matter is being dealt with, as opposed to the general topic of a Bill, the best course for the Deputy to adopt would be to table a parliamentary question. I cannot be expected to give a section by section interpretation of the contents of a Bill that has not yet been approved by Cabinet in its final form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach update the House on the progress made with the child abuse register?  This proposal was made after the Kilkenny incest case and the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, was successfully introducing it.  I understand some constitutional, legal and administrative matters that may be holding it back, but it is a matter of urgency.  Can the Taoiseach update the House on its current standing?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions concerning child abuse are covered in the <Col N="2076" /> Child Care Act which has been enacted. I am sure the Deputy is aware there are differing views about a child abuse register.  There is a fear among a number of professionals that they might not be able to consult, advise and assist people if the content of such consultations had to be recorded in accordance with a rigid code.  There is also strong belief that we need to have this information.  I am not able, however, to resolve that matter this morning, nor am I able to give the Deputy any further information.  I suggest that he table a question to the Minister for Health, who will give him the most up-to-date indication of Government thinking on this extremely contentious and difficult matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are transparent differences in the Government on reforming our bail laws.  The Refugee Bill, 1995, which deals with asylum seekers is currently before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  This ground-breaking legislation has the overwhelming support of all parties in the House.  A problem has arisen, however, over the use of the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; as a way of undermining possibly all the benefits of the legislation. The select committee has adjourned to allow the Government to consider the matter and replace this <Col N="2077" /> term with &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.  Has the Minister for Justice raised the matter with her Cabinet colleagues as the legislation cannot progress any further until this is done?  This and related amendments has the support of all Members of the select committee.  In that context it is a further test of the effectiveness of the committee system.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;thereby putting at a disadvantage other Members of the committee who may not wish to express their views in the House and would prefer to do their business at the committee. The select committee is due to meet again next week.  I have no doubt that the Deputy will be able to put these questions at the committee, as is appropriate in the case of business referred to it by the House.  If we were to review work in train in committees daily on the Order of Business, we would undermine the committee system.  I am sure that is not the Deputy's intention.</P>

      <P>I expect the electricity Bill to be available in the second half of the year.  It is being worked on at present.  In commenting on redundancy payments it is important that one should not include paid pension contributions and refunds of any such contributions in any description of a hand-out because they are not.</P>

      <P>The Government proposed to separate the executive functions of Ministers, secretaries and officials under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  In its policy document last February it stated it would deal with this as a matter of urgency. Has the matter been taken off the long-term list?  What reform proposals is the Government considering in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is being considered in the context of the strategic management initiative which, as the Deputy knows, involves a clearer definition of the respective roles of Ministers, secretaries and officials.  That initiative is being advanced on the basis of consultation with a view to getting the agreement of all the relevant partners. Obviously, it is not possible to draft precise legislation to give effect to an agreed approach until the approach is agreed.

      <P>Based on what the Minister of State said in her reply to the committee on this issue which the Taoiseach and I attended, may I take it we are now dealing with a five to seven year plan and that the legislation has been taken off the agenda?  Will there not be any reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's assumption is incorrect.  We are trying to agree on a structure that will work. The Ministers and Secretaries Act has not been amended substantially since 1924.  We want to implement a workable structure that will distribute responsibilities between Ministers, secretaries and officials.  There are many difficulties to overcome in terms of overlap between, for example, policy and administration.  A definite line of distinction cannot be drawn between policy and administration in respect of <Col N="2083" /> every matter in each Department.  There are many difficult and grey areas with which we must deal.  In drafting an approach that will work we want to talk to all those working the system so that the general legislative principles drawn up for the respective roles of Ministers, secretaries and officials are delineated on the basis of the best available experience. We want to implement a policy that will work in every Department of State and that will require a lengthy consultative process.  The best way to reach agreement on such delineation of roles is to have practical consultations with all concerned, rather than introduce general legislation and work out the details later.</P>

      <P>There were great expectations about this budget.  The economy was doing so well that substantive cuts for taxpayers were expected but, unfortunately, that did not happen. The general reaction to the budget has been negative.  Commentators point to the negligible benefits passed on to the taxpayer.  Much of the detail of the budget was leaked in advance and there was a deliberate effort by the three parties to put their respective slants on it. This is no way to treat the most important annual statement from the Minister for Finance who is charged with the management of our finances. We can all recall when the budget was a serious matter and was treated as such by everybody both inside and outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, presented his first Budget Statement which had little to recommend it.  I thought we could look <Col N="2085" /> forward to a much improved budget this year, but the most significant change in this year's performance is that no member of Cabinet was forced to resign as a result of it.  Apart from that, we received a repeat prescription of the Minister's medicine.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, is a member of a Government which came to power at the end of 1994. The rainbow coalition was formed without a mandate from the people, but it was aptly named.  I am sure the term &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; was used to convey some new, colourful, bright and shiny image to the people.  However, it should be noted that a rainbow is simply a reflection of light.  It does not have any substance, it is merely an optical illusion.  In layman's terms, it is a trick of the light and those who operate under the banner of the rainbow Government have proved, for a second year in succession, to be trick of the loop men.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made much of his concessions to the low paid and unemployed.  He trumpeted the increase in child benefit and the introduction of subsidies.  In reality, once again he failed large numbers of people.  There is little or nothing for those most in need.  This is a discredited Government which has failed to live up to its public spending targets.  As a result it can afford to give very little to those to whom it promised most.  To be able to improve living standards the State must live within its means, but that is not the case with this Government.</P>
    <P>The leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was Minister for Finance until the end of 1994 and left a healthy surplus to his successor.  The current budget deficit had been wiped out for the first time in a quarter of a century, since the days of the late George Colley. Less than 14 months after that historic achievement, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, aided and abetted by the Taoiseach's Cabinet, has put us firmly back on the road to financial chaos. Most analysts agree that the increase in current public spending for 1996 will be approximately 6.2 per cent, despite all <Col N="2086" /> the efforts to cover that.  If we took into account the Minister's creative accounting exercises regarding the hepatitis C payments and the arrangements made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, the figure would probably be closer to 7 per cent. This cannot be good news to anyone. Everything must be paid for when the reckoning is called and our national debt now stands at £30 billion.  There are many who regard the national debt as something which does not affect them in their everyday lives.  This is far from the truth.  The interest payments must be made from the Exchequer and this means the Minister has less to spend on people, and especially on people who look to the Exchequer for increases in their allowances.  It is small wonder that these people should look forward to increases in the budget.  In 1995 pensioners were treated to a miserable 2.5 per cent increase in the Minister's first budget.  I spoke on their behalf condemning this miserable increase as paltry. This year it was increased by 0.5 per cent to 3 per cent.  That is still not sufficient. We should have increased that figure by at least another 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>One anomaly in the social welfare system is the fact that widows and widowers are not entitled to social welfare benefits such as electricity allowances, television licence, free travel, etc. and I have called on consecutive Ministers for Social Welfare to have them included. In the improved economic climate I thought they would have been considered on this occasion.  Those on survivor's contributory pensions or invalidity pensions received approximately £2 extra a week.  They will benefit by £56 during 1996, which is not very much. How could the Minister possibly give less than £56 to those he insulted so grossly last year, especially when his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, needed over £0.5 million to meet advance overtime payments in his Department prior to Christmas?  One wonders why the vast sums of money being spent on public relations, advisers <Col N="2087" /> and programme managers in the Departments could not be put to better use and given to those who need it most. The reported average figure paid out by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to ease tension in his Department amounted to £500 per head.  I am sure those who get their £56 social welfare increases this year will be happy to know that their sacrifice has given peace of mind to one Cabinet Minister.</P>
    <P>A rainbow is caused by light passing through water droplets.  The water is transparent, but the workings of the rainbow Government would appear to be other than that.  I spoke earlier of illusions and tricks of the light.  This budget claims to help the low-paid and the long-term unemployed in particular. I can remember a time when there was only one way to describe people who could not find a job and that was as unemployed.  We did not categorise them.  We just knew that to our shame, too many people were unemployed. Now the spin doctors tell us that we have short-term unemployed.  The Minister tells us he has plans to make life easier for them.  We seem to have forgotten that the long-term unemployed. when they first signed on the live register, had no idea that they would one day fill the Minister's statistical records in that capacity.  All most of them knew was that they needed to get back to work as quickly as possible.  They needed jobs and they needed incentives to get to work.  They see no hope in the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>The combined PRSI and PAYE reductions for lower income groups average £88 per annum for a single person and £129 per annum for the married. The average PAYE worker, that includes all those lucky enough to have a job, will contribute an extra £6 a week to Exchequer funding in 1996.  This is £300 plus a year.  Given the reductions mentioned earlier, it does not take a mathematical wizard to work out that even those who benefit from the reductions will still lose out to the tune of at least £170 this year alone.  I am told <Col N="2088" /> that total additional taxes to be paid on average this year will be £14 a week or £720 a year.  This certainly does not seem like an incentive to anyone to get back to work.</P>
    <P>There is not much comfort either in those figures for people already at work. They are becoming tired of bearing an unfair share of the burden and are making their dissatisfaction known.  Last year the Minister announced tax cuts of £111 in his budget and he collected £196 million more than he announced for this year.  This year he is setting out again to pull the wool over the eyes of the taxpayer. I have news for him.  This great Labour PR machine is grinding to a halt &mdash; people will not be fooled any longer. The Minister will have to do more than announce subsidies of £80 for recruitment if he wishes to end unemployment. He will certainly have to back up his announcement with a sum greater than £1 million.  If the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, funds 5,000 offers of recruitment among the business community he would need £10.5 million to keep the newly employed on the payroll until Christmas.  The Minister has provided less than 10 per cent of this amount, but he talks about transparency.  What is really transparent is this Government's pathetic attempt to persuade the people that it is capable of management.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note the reaction of SIPTU, one of the strongest trade unions in the country, to the budget. Their opinion of this feeble effort is damning, to say the least.  Their national executive, which issued the weekend condemnation, is responsible to a very large membership.  The Minister too is accountable to a great number of people and the time has long since arrived to seriously consider his position.</P>
    <P>The Government is charged with the overall management of the economy. The main focus at budget time is usually on such items as social welfare payments, income tax and increases in excise duties, and these are of great interest to large numbers of people. <Col N="2089" /> They are also the items which are highlighted most effectively in the presentation of a budget statement.  We should not forget that many items in the budget presentation are overlooked at least at first sight.  In this budget, for example, we have heard no mention of reductions in mortgage interest and insurance relief, the increases in the cost of electricity and the proposed increase in the cost of a television licence, but they will offset any increase or tax reliefs granted in the budget.</P>
    <P>Many problems exist in Ireland which are crying out for attention.  There are certain areas where the immediate injection of additional funds is necessary. Crime has the nation in a grip of terror.  Citizens are in fear and dread of their lives.  They are not safe on the streets and they are not safe in their own houses.  Urgent action is needed to restore public confidence in the rule of law, but the figures provided by the Minister to this House show that the provisions of the 1996 White Paper for the Garda Síochána and for the courts have been adjusted downwards, showing reductions of £0.25 million in the case of the Garda Síochána and £0.5 million in the case of the courts, this at a time when additional resources are badly needed in these areas &mdash;&ldquo;miscellaneous minor adjustments&rdquo; is the term used to explain these figures.  At the same time £3 million is set aside as a contribution towards providing security for cash transporters.  Like others in this House, I often wonder why the companies that own the large amounts of cash being transported cannot contribute towards the cost of transport, particularly in the light of the profits shown by these companies.</P>
    <P>What price does this Government place on the security of our citizens? Precious little, it appears.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Justice yesterday of her package to combat crime.  However, it is high time we put a police presence back into every parish and village in rural Ireland.  Any person from a rural constituency would agree with that.  I was a member of a county <Col N="2090" /> council in the early 1980s.  My Garda division was selected, with the Westport division, for a pilot project involving the introduction of the small green machine on the wall.  People were to report crimes to the Garda by speaking into this machine and they could be heard in a central office.  Members of the county council from all parties unanimously agreed that this would be a failure.  We had meetings with the Garda Commissioner and the chief superintendent responsible and expressed our view to them.  They gave us statistical information indicating that this project would be a success.  What every councillor said on that occasion 15 years ago has turned out to be true although the Garda thought we knew nothing about crime and law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The scheme was extended to the entire country.  This resulted in practically all gardaí in rural Garda stations being removed and we have seen the consequences.  There is a serious lack of confidence because of the non-presence of gardaí in some areas.  There is no continuity of Garda personnel.  In my Garda division there has been a change of superintendent almost a couple of times a year.  This does not help in the fight against crime and criminals are well aware of this.  This issue should be taken on board as there is general agreement in the House on it.  There is a cost involved but can anyone put a cost on the present level of crime?  In light of recent sad events throughout the country, the announcements of the Minister for Justice will not make people sleep more soundly in their beds.</P>
    <P>It was announced in the budget that there would be £800 relief for the purchase of alarm systems by the elderly. This is one of the biggest con jobs I have seen for a long time.  I compare it with the relief granted against service charges.  There would be general agreement in the House that this will not work.  Some 95 per cent of pensioners who live in rural areas will not be able to avail of this relief and I call on the Minister for Finance to change it in the Finance Bill and provide a direct grant. <Col N="2091" /> There are plenty of examples the Minister could consider.  In County Kilkenny a scheme has been in operation for many years and this could be used as a pilot project.  Health boards should be involved in this because they have knowledge of problems through community welfare officers.  I strongly advocate that this be taken on board.  It would be a small gesture to people that the Government and the House are concerned about their needs.</P>
    <P>In common with most Deputies in daily contact with their constituents, the biggest problem brought to my attention is the poor condition of county roads.  The amount allocated by the Minister for the Environment for county roads in my constituency in 1995 was not nearly adequate to carry out repairs or improvements.  I see, to my dismay, that revised figures for that Department for 1996 show a decrease of £200,000.  This means that allocations to local authorities this year will not meet the amounts required by them.</P>
    <P>No provision has been made for flood relief.  Every single area of the south-east was devastated by floods this year. The residents of these and many other areas who suffered from the effects of recent flooding will be disappointed with the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment have not been well served by this budget, they are not alone.  There are other Cinderellas in the ranks of the Departments which regulate the daily lives of many thousands of citizens.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have been revised downwards by £250,000. This is explained by a reduction in the grant to An Bord Bia.  I would have thought that in a county in which farming plays such a vital role the route to providing new jobs would be to utilise the food processing industry to its full potential.  We produce some of the finest food in the world and we should increase its processing to gain added value for ourselves.  Surely An Bord Bia <Col N="2092" /> has a central role to play in setting standards and creating markets.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to do everything in his power at EU level to restore export refunds to their former levels.  I condemn the shortage of money for REPS.  The Department seems to be run by public relations rather than strong firm action.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the first budget of the Minister for Finance last year and I am outraged at this one.  I am an Opposition Deputy but I also speak as a tax-paying citizen.  Many share my view on this catalogue of waste and lost opportunities.  I will illustrate my point with a personal anecdote.  Last weekend I attended a function in Kilkenny which was organised to raise funds for two well known charities, one of which was Rehab.  The local Rehab organisation received greater <i>per capita</i> benefit from this event than it is likely to get under the budget proposals.  It is a sad state of affairs when people who, through no fault of their own, need our help are ignored by the Government which supposedly hails them as equals.  Once again it was left to the decency of the ordinary citizen to ensure some measure of fair play.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare spends annually four times the total amount spent on agriculture and business combined. The £23,000 spent by the Minister for Social Welfare on promotional diaries would have been welcomed and well used by many voluntary organisations.  The five advisers recently appointed to his Department will each benefit from the budget at a much higher rate than the £56 paid to social welfare recipients.  These jobs were advertised only in the Democratic Left's magazine.  This begs a question about the transparency of the Government.  It also proves that Labour is not the only party involved in nepotism, which is very much alive on the left.</P>
    <P>The rainbow is shining brightly at the moment and the colours are not coming apart as can be judged from what is happening here.  The fact that the unfortunate people who live under the rainbow <Col N="2093" /> are dejected and bewildered is of no importance to the leprechauns at the end of it.  They are far too busy counting their personal pots of gold to see and recognise, or, unfortunately, to care about the state of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance on this budget, which underpins the coherent strategy which the Government pursued on an ongoing basis and which has led to the emergence of Ireland as one of the most healthy economies in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised at the criticism which has emanated from the Opposition. Fianna Fáil has distinguished itself in Opposition mainly as a result of its ineptness.  Inflation and interest rates are at a historic low.  Mortgage rates are at their lowest level for 20 years.  If mortgage rates were 12 per cent, as they were in January 1991 when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition was in power, the cost of a £50,000 mortgage would be £2,000 per annum or £38 per week more than it is today.  This is a real benefit to the taxpayer and outweighs any tax relief which could be contemplated.  Inflation was 2.5 per cent in 1995 whereas the EU average for the past five years was 4.1 per cent.  The healthy economic state of affairs, almost unimaginable a decade ago, is due mainly to the exemplary management of the nation's finances by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  When it was announced that he was to become the first Labour Minister for Finance, some people said this was a regressive step which would halt any hope of economic growth.  However, the Minister has proved himself to be not only a good Minister for Finance but one of the best, much to the dismay and embarrassment of his original detractors.  The Minister's performance has been indicative of the Labour Party's whole performance in Government.  It should be noted that the only trail of consistency throughout the emergence of Ireland's economic <Col N="2094" /> buoyancy is the presence of the Labour Party in Government since 1992.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of this budget is to tackle the most pressing social issue in Ireland today &mdash; long-term unemployment. This problem has affected society for far too long.  The Labour Party is committed to ensuring that the problem of long-term unemployment is addressed in a coherent and practical way.  That is the approach needed and the one this Government intends to pursue.</P>
    <P>A recruitment subsidy of £80 per week, which will be paid to an employer who recruits a person unemployed for at least three years, is not only novel but practical.  It will provide a real incentive for employers to take on additional staff.  In addition to this subsidy, an extra 1,000 places have been provided on the vocational training opportunities scheme, while spending on community employment has also been increased with the introduction of a pilot wholetime job option scheme with 1,000 places.  The Minister also introduced measures to reward people at work.  The principal provision in this area is the increase in the PRSI allowance from £50 to £80 per week.</P>
    <P>From a cursory examination of this limited number of budgetary provisions it is possible to discern that this Government is motivated by social justice.  It does not agree with the policies of the Opposition which would reward only a wealthy few.  The Government is committed to ensuring that everybody will benefit from the fruits of economic growth.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable to the Labour Party, however, simply to ensure that the unemployed are content with receiving their weekly social welfare payments. Social welfare is a short-term solution. Unemployment can only be effectively tackled by creating new jobs and the Government is committed to ensuring that those new jobs are created.  An illustration of that commitment is the creation of 45,000 new jobs last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> My constituency has suffered considerably in recent years because of unemployment, a plight the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition did little or nothing to alleviate.  That Coalition Government oversaw the sale of Cork Dockyard in June 1990.  At the time of the sale, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, predicted that 450 jobs would be created by 1995. To date, those jobs have not materialised. The new owners were unable to create more than a handful of jobs despite Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's declaration at the time that the sale of the dockyard would recreate the economies of towns like Cobh and Midleton &mdash; he was slightly wrong in that regard.  If that is Fianna Fáil idea of sound economic management, I hope it is a long time before they are in charge of the Department of Finance.  As the old saying goes, with friends like that, who needs enemies?</P>
    <P>Irish Steel, on the other hand, is an illustration of this Government's real commitment to the people of east Cork. Last week, the new chief executive of Irish Steel predicted the plant would be making a profit by early next year.  This is testimony to the efforts of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.  Their successful intervention ensured the survival of the plant.  Their efforts were borne out of genuine concern for the people of east Cork and they should be commended in that regard.  Unlike Cork Dockyard, Irish Steel has a future, as do the people still employed there.  Without doubt that future was secured in no small way by the workers whose dedication and commitment during the past year will shortly bear fruit.  That dedication and commitment would have been in vain had Fianna Fáil been dealing with the problem.  It would have been as remiss in dealing with Irish Steel as it was in its dealings with Cork Dockyard, a major State asset which it sold for little or no return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> Another aspect of the budget I particularly welcome is the provision of £13 million which will facilitate a voluntary early retirement package for members of the Defence Forces.  That will have a real impact on the east Cork region in general and my own town of Cobh in particular due to the presence of the naval base at Haulbowline.  The early retirement package will enable the Naval Service to recruit young people which will be good not only for the Naval Service but for east Cork.  This announcement will allay any fears people may have regarding the closure of Army barracks.  It was always the intention of the Government to restructure the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Government knows a major State asset when it sees one.  As the Minister pointed out in his Budget Statement, the objective of this budget is to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.  Only a Labour Party Minister for Finance would be so bold to attempt such a strategy and succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was greatly interested in Deputy Aylward's contribution.  He did not address the issue of the budget but seemed to have a fixation about rainbows and how they are formed. While it was interesting and indeed amusing to hear his description of a rainbow, a man of his age should have enough common sense to know that &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; is only a word.  A Government must be judged on its performance, not whether it is part of a rainbow coalition, and I hope when Deputy Aylward next makes a contribution in the House it will be more substantial.  He gave a one-sided view which was very prejudiced and that is not good enough because we owe it to ourselves and to the people who elect us to debate the measures in the budget in an intelligent, analytical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to read recently all the hype about the Ireland-Scotland rugby match.  It was only when I saw the performance of the Irish team that I realised I should have had more sense <Col N="2097" /> than to believe anything I read in the papers.  That is equally the case in relation to the budget about which there were many leaks to the media, but that is inevitable in the world in which we live.  We cannot stop the press speculating on the contents of a budget and in fact the media knew most of the contents of this budget even before it was delivered.  There was no element of surprise when the budget was announced, only an atmosphere of anti-climax. Leaks cannot be avoided, particularly when three parties are in Government. Each party will claim to have made a contribution to the worthwhile aspects of the budget and as long as the Minister is not blamed for any of its less favourable aspects, I will be happy.</P>
    <P>The reality about this budget is that we must abide by the guidelines laid down by Maastricht.  Those guidelines enable us to work within that framework which is a worthwhile one.  A budget is a financial statement of the intention of a Government to carry out certain policies and programmes in the course of the coming year.  It could be described as the Government's philosophy and this budget was formed by the philosophy of three parties.  As far as the Labour Party is concerned, it had the right philosophy.</P>
    <P>The budget encourages industrial development and job creation.  For too long Members of this House, representatives of the trade union movement, the Church and other bodies paid lip service to the long-term unemployed and lower-paid workers.  No positive action was taken to tackle those problems. This is the first serious and realistic attempt to enshrine in a budget a policy deliberately aimed at helping the long-term unemployed and those on low pay.  Nobody begrudges the long-term unemployed and low-paid workers their rights in this matter.  We have spoken about this problem since the foundation of the State but this is the only serious attempt I have seen to tackle these issues.</P>
    <P>I too read SIPTU's reported critical comments on the budget, to which <Col N="2098" /> Deputy Aylward alluded.  I am still involved in the trade union movement and I take what the movement says seriously.  SIPTU was especially critical of the Government policy to give £80 per week to employers who take on a long-term unemployed person for three years or more.  I analysed their criticisms but the reality is that the Government had to discriminate in favour of the long-term unemployed to make a dent in the numbers who have been unemployed for more than three years.  If it was left to market forces, young school leavers would get preference over the long-term unemployed.  To give the long-term unemployed some chance, action had to be taken in their favour, which I support.  If employers want to put up matching finance, well and good but this would take from the attractiveness of the scheme.  I hope employers will not be unscrupulous enough to use this scheme only for their own advantage. It will have to be monitored by FAS.  I hope the trade union movement will monitor it as well and I think it is more realistic to ensure the scheme is operated properly than to decry it.</P>
    <P>Under the budget provisions, 18,000 workers will be taken out of the tax net. This is a first step and I hope the reform of our income tax code will continue. We have a right to be angry about the suffering caused by poverty and Members must use their position to alleviate it.</P>
    <P>We cannot think of crime in isolation from society.  Part of our present difficulties with crime is that we see it as separate from ourselves, but it is not.  It is part of society and we must have a societal based answer to it.</P>
    <P>In spite of Government effort, our rate of unemployment is still the second highest in Europe.  That is not a happy position, the problem will not solve itself and we need to identify solutions to it.  The budget is good in that it is attempting to reduce the number of unemployed and to face reality.  It is hard for an unemployed person to get on a FÁS course, in fact public representatives have to telephone and write <Col N="2099" /> on the person's behalf to get him or her on a course, which should be a right.  A great deal of effort is needed to get the person who is able and willing to work on a FÁS course, never mind a job. Most people get their jobs through personal contacts and I hope we can move away from that and have jobs awarded on merit.  We have tried to achieve that throughout our history but have failed. There are still too many low paid jobs with consequent exploitation of vulnerable people.  Everyone who works honestly and fairly is entitled to a living wage.  Finally income support supplements the income of low paid workers.  A person who works is entitled to be paid for his or her labour and it is a breach of justice that this does not always happen.</P>
    <P>The unemployed and those living in marginalised areas have little chance of leading a full, well rounded cultural life. Their lives are impoverished in more ways than just financial poverty and the budget must attempt to tackle this issue. For too long adult education has been the Cinderella of education although it can help to redress much of the cultural and economic inequality in society.  Not enough funding is given to adult education but if used properly such education can be a lifeline back to mainstream society for those who are marginalised.  It can give people the opportunity to contribute and take part in the wider community.  A start has been made on education in this budget and for the first time we have free third level education.  This is a tremendous boost for those who are caught in the trap where their income was greater than the qualifying income level for third level grants.  That has not been highlighted during Members' contributions on the budget.</P>
    <P>A start has also been made on tax reform, which must be continued. Fianna Fáil Deputies concentrated, in particular, on crime as if it had dawned in Ireland today and had not been a problem in the past.  The reality is that violent crime has been growing for the <Col N="2100" /> past 26 years or more and is parallel to the violence in Northern Ireland and the availability of guns.  The availability of guns worries me and this is an area that the gardaí must target and go after. Drugs and guns must be removed at source because they are far too easily available.  The Garda Síochána must identify where they are coming from and stop it at source.  It is too late when they are circulating among criminals. We must face up to crime honestly and have a positive policy in tackling it. There are no simple or easy answers and all sections of society must contribute to the solution of the problem. Above all, the Government must give leadership in tackling crime and reassure people that it is determined to stamp out crime.  This week the Government has taken the first step to tackle it. For too long we allowed things to drift in the belief that the problem would solve itself.  Above all the Government must give leadership and show that it is concerned about the people.  We must try as best we can to create a genuine infrastructure whereby people can lead decent lives.  That is what party politics is about.  Ideology should serve people, not the other way round.  For too long in all parties we bowed to ideology but that is the wrong attitude.  We have to be flexible to solve problems and build a society in which people can live decent and crime free lives.  I hope the budget will be a step in that direction.  I look forward to this Government's next budget which should continue to address tax reform of the PAYE sector. They may think they have been forgotten about in this budget but I assure them that all parties, and especially the Minister for Finance, is concerned about tax reform.  I am confident that if we are in Government for another 12 months we can deliver a very good tax reform package and I look forward to that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Morley.  One might wonder if we are trying to fill time by discussing the budget two weeks after it has been <Col N="2101" /> introduced.  However, I see it as an opportunity to give our points of view on the budget as it affects the needs of those we represent.</P>
      <P>In assessing the budget we must look at the background to it.  The economy was in a healthy position and the Minister for Finance could have brought in a balanced budget.  When the figures are assessed at the end of 1996 it will be seen that while he brought in a budget with a deficit of £80 million there will be a surplus of £200,000.  The Minister will be able to give that money away in the 1997 budget, in the run up to an election.  That may be good political thinking but it is not how the public like the Government to operate.</P>
      <P>Those who are deprived and in need of help must be protected by the State irrespective of whatever Government is in power.  The job scheme which was introduced is ridiculous and those who take up such employment will be worse off than if they remained in receipt of social welfare.  Regrettable though it is, that is a fact.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment stated yesterday that job starts can apply in respect of both new additional jobs and the filling of vacancies. Employers will let people go in order to avail of the scheme.  The number of jobs proposed under the scheme is 1,000.  We are talking about one in 250 of the long-term unemployed being offered employment.  That is a fact no matter what gloss is put on it.  There was much gloss put on the budget before it was introduced in the House.  Anyone who read the newspapers in the weeks prior to budget day could have written the Budget Statement and could have read what was contained in the budget on the day preceding its publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be impossible to get a ticket for the Public Gallery on budget day.  Now everything in the budget is announced days beforehand.  I do not blame Ministers for doing that as <Col N="2102" /> they wish to achieve what they can for their Departments.  The Minister for Social Welfare proved he could get everything he wanted and extracted a large amount of money from the Minister for Finance for worthless schemes which will not benefit the majority of people.  It would have been better had that money been used to reduce taxation. The lower tax band should be reduced to 20 per cent.  Those paying 48 per cent are entitled to have the matter examined.  It is now more productive for some workers to go sick at certain times of the year and claim social welfare for that period.  That matter must be addressed.</P>
      <P>The budget does not do anything for those I represent.  The Government has neglected rural Ireland.  The population is dwindling in these areas.  Much could be done to alleviate the plight of old people, particularly in the context of the present crime wave.  For example, in assessing means for social welfare pensions, the first £5,000 invested by old people should be exempted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they will be charged 10 per cent tax on it.  I constantly make representations on behalf of people whose means assessments have been increased as a result of their having enough money in the bank to pay for their funeral.  Perhaps the Minister will introduce such a proposal in the social welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Old people living alone often live in fear.  Some Garda stations in rural areas are threatened with closure.  The local garda was a source of strength and comfort to them but the fact that gardaí do not live in the areas they police is not in the best interests of these communities. It should be mandatory for gardaí to live within a 30-mile radius of where they are stationed on a permanent basis. When members are promoted they are often stationed outside their home area and if they own a house they may be <Col N="2103" /> reluctant to reside in the new area.  Perhaps it would be better for Garda morale if this trend was reversed and local gardaí promoted in their own areas where possible.</P>
    <P>Door-to-door salespersons and those who sell goods from the back of vans should be licensed.  This would eliminate &ldquo;spotter&rdquo; vans identifying those who are vulnerable to attack.  The Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Justice should examine this matter.  If such a proposal were mandatory it would help increase the tax take.</P>
    <P>The budget does not address social problems but rather throws money into schemes which will not achieve anything. The budget does not address the drugs problem, neither does it help those who are liable to end up as criminals. It does not do anything for education. We need extra remedial teachers and in some cases teaching on a one-to-one basis in order to ensure people are properly educated and do not become social delinquents and criminals, thus causing the State extra expense.</P>
    <P>I come from an area which has suffered from 25 years of violence north of the Border.  The peace initiative taken by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, in conjunction with the Tánaiste and the Labour Party, is going through a rocky period.  Nothing has been done in 18 months to rebalance resources in that area.  Infrastructure was badly affected as a result of the violence and there is no money of note for its improvement.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for the Environment said yesterday, he has allocated £14 million for two water and sewerage schemes in his constituency.  A sum of £8 million is provided for one project in the Tánaiste's home town while £14 million is provided for the Taoiseach's constituency.  The counties in the west however have received very little &mdash; a paltry £150,000 for a minor improvement to a sewerage scheme in Carrick-on-Shannon. Without proper distribution of resources by the Government to all areas, there will be further decline <Col N="2104" /> in the rural population.  Smaller towns will decline while larger urban areas will increase, adding to social problems which result from bad planning and organisation.  People in rural areas are unable to sustain themselves, even with the help of their neighbours and friends.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position of a person living and working north of the Border <i>vis-á-vis</i> that of a person south of the Border.  As Deputy McGahon said, there is a difference of £12 to £15 in the weekly income of persons working in similar jobs north and south of the Border. As regards incentives for industrial development, grant assistance available for investment in Northern Ireland, together with the tax regime, makes it totally unattractive for people to invest on the southern side of the Border.  That imbalance will have to be redressed. There must be positive discrimination for Border areas so that communities will survive.  Communities north of the Border are much more productive and better able to cope because of the resources available to them.  If this matter is not addressed immediately people living just south of the Border will move to Northern Ireland, resulting in a further decline in population.</P>
    <P>Money from the Delors package and other incentives are available, but how much use has been made of them? Much money has been given to voluntary groups, and I have no problem with that, but money should have been allocated for infrastructure improvement and to provide facilities to create permanent jobs rather than relying on the Combat Poverty Agency, ADM and others to provide piecemeal jobs.  Those organisations are well intentioned, do their best and ensure money is wisely spent, but in the long-term money spent by such agencies will not keep people in jobs.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural scene, considering there is no measure in the budget to restore the 50 per cent reduction in export refunds it is important that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry makes a determined effort to improve the position of farmers.  It is <Col N="2105" /> regrettable that sufficient money has not been made available to pay applicants under the REP scheme.  The Minister admitted in the House on Tuesday that he is depending on money from the TB scheme and other schemes to pay grants.  Last year he suspended the CFP scheme and I suppose he will suspend the REP scheme this year if further money is not available.  That would be a retrograde step not in the interests of rural Ireland.  The scheme was established to improve the environment as well as farming standards and it was welcomed by everybody.  That the first £2,000 is exempt in terms of social welfare is welcome, but the Minister should have gone further in that regard.  Only 25 per cent of that money is taken from national resources.  I know the Minister of State Deputy Durkan, would not begrudge that money to people who need it.  The scheme leads to on-farm investment, which gives a return in terms of tax and PRSI, and it is therefore more or less self-financing.</P>
    <P>Wearing my hat as spokesperson for Fianna Fáil on forestry, I appeal to the Minister to introduce a proper scheme of inspection of forest plantations so that people will not find, as happened recently, that four or five years after plantation grant applications are rejected because of improper maintenance. A scheme for yearly inspection should be implemented.  That would avoid serious problems, particularly for people who depend on forestry premiums for their livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ellis, for sharing his time with me and allowing me to make a short contribution to the budget debate, which is nearing an end.  From listening to much of the debate last week and reading reports on it, the word used most often to describe this budget is &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; and that word was used in the context of another opportunity missed by the Government to seriously tackle tax and PRSI reform.  The disappointment was greater since it was stated last year that the steps taken at <Col N="2106" /> that time were just a beginning.  The people expected more on this occasion but once again there was just a token gesture.  The increases in PRSI allowance, the reduction in employers' PRSI and the widening of the tax bands simply tinker with the system and fall far short of reform.  The Government totally ignored the universal call for tax and PRSI reform.  It has miserably failed to introduce meaningful measures to tackle that issue.</P>
      <P>Even if we must be content with piecemeal changes in the tax system I cannot understand why the Government does not, in the short-term at least, take into consideration the position of many small firms, particularly in the clothing and food sectors, who find survival in the marketplace very difficult because of high tax and PRSI and the strength of the punt.  One would expect a significant and meaningful gesture towards those companies to give them confidence in the future and hope of alleviation of their difficulties.  Some of those industries &mdash; many mushroom and clothing industries, are in my constituency &mdash; are small producers for whom redundancy is averted only by short time working.  There is a constant war in terms of competitiveness and the outcome is uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the price of petrol will more than cancel the miserable improvement in PRSI.  In response to my parliamentary question tabled to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry last week asking if he proposed to assist mushroom growers overcome currency difficulties in view of the closure of some mushroom units said, on Tuesday 30 January that &ldquo;the appropriate response of the currency situation is to improve competitiveness&rdquo;.  Increasing the price of petrol is not helpful in that regard.  I am disappointed with the negative tone of the Minister's reply and that neither he nor the Government is prepared to aid that industry or others affected by the present currency situation, although EU regulations provide <Col N="2107" /> that they could do so if they had the will to act.</P>
    <P>I, like my party colleague who spoke previously, represent a rural constituency. My main criticism of the budget is that its provisions will not greatly benefit agriculture.  There is nothing in it to boost rural development or employment although rural Ireland is a blackspot in terms of employment opportunities. I do not believe that the £80 subsidy to employers for recruitment of the long-term unemployed will have any impact on rural Ireland as it does not have the required industry or potential employers to benefit from that provision. The regulations governing that scheme have yet to be published.  I hope it will be successful, but I foresee it giving rise to many difficulties.  I hope it will not result in a new employer securing a competitive advantage over an established one, the displacement of established employees by newly recruited ones, the encouragement of certain employers to pay lower wages or employees being unsettled if newly recruited ones get a better deal, such as being allowed retain medical cards for three years after taking up employment. In addition to the fringe benefits conferred by a medical card, such newly recruited staff would probably be paid an equal rate of salary as that paid to their established work colleagues.</P>
    <P>My party colleague mentioned the plight of farmers who stand to lose £60 to £70 headage payment per animal as a result of the withdrawal of the beef export subsidy.  This position can be allowed continue only for a short time. I am aware the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is addressing the problem and I hope his efforts will be successful in the near future, but at this stage I urge him to double his efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>Fear of the violent and mobile new age criminal is prevalent in rural Ireland.  We have heard and read dreadful stories about old people being battered, robbed and murdered in their homes by brutal thugs who should be <Col N="2108" /> behind bars but are free as a result of not having been detected or because they are out on bail or early release.  It is unfair to blame the Minister for Justice for the current position which has developed over a number of years. However, it is reasonable to expect that the Minister and the Government should address this problem immediately and effectively.  She has put forward proposals to Government this week but much more is needed.  Reform of the bail laws which should be undertaken as a matter of urgency is still outstanding.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the proposal for new prisons.  More prison places are required.  The 150 places originally intended to be located in Castlerea Prison should be provided as soon as possible. Failure to do so will send out the wrong message to the criminal and the community.  I welcome the changes the Minister made regarding Garda structures and the appointment of extra judges.</P>
    <P>The provision of tax relief of £800 for the elderly towards the installation of security devices such as burglar alarms is a joke.  One would be inclined to accuse the Minister of cynicism in this regard but for the sad and serious plight of the elderly who are fearful of becoming victims of crime.  As cynicism is not a trait in the Minister's make-up, I accept that the provision was an unfortunate lapse.  As a measure of the Government's concern for the plight of the elderly, the Minister should substitute that proposal with a substantial grant to enable the elderly install suitable security appliances.</P>
    <P>It has been said during the debate that there is nothing in the budget for tourism.  I wish to congratulate a county colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, who is doing an excellent job.  I remind him that all Government sources and reports indicate that tourism is one of our main hopes for development and employment in the west.  However, many people find it impossible to get grants to <Col N="2109" /> provide basic accommodation for tourists in County Mayo while the experts advise we would need to increase our bed night accommodation by 50 per cent to cater for the projected number of tourists who are likely to visit the county by the end of the millennium. The Structural and Cohesion Funds appear to have been directed mainly towards areas already well established in this field.  They have assisted in providing those areas with ever more sophisticated tourist products while the more underdeveloped areas of the west are unable to secure assistance to provide basic necessities required for this industry.  It is little wonder that a recent report by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation states that recent research carried out on behalf of the confederation indicated that tourism is growing faster in the eastern region than in the west and, therefore, the benefits of tourism growth are not being spread equitably.  The report also states that the Government must decide if sufficient infrastructure is in place to cope with further expansion.  That poses the question of how the industry can attract more business into areas with great tourism potential, such as County Mayo and the west, which remain underdeveloped. This cannot be achieved without greater European and Government assistance.  Judging from the provisions in the budget, such assistance is not likely to be forthcoming.  The increase in the price of petrol will further disadvantage tourism in the west.  It will make it more expensive for tourists to travel there and it will also have a negative impact on industries located there.</P>
    <P>An IBEC report presented yesterday states that transport expenses are 25 per cent to 30 per cent higher in the west and north-west than in the rest of the country.  That is ascribed to road conditions and distance from ports.  The Government should heed the findings of that report and take immediate steps to remove the obvious obstacles to a fair sharing by the west and the north-west in the country's growing prosperity.  I <Col N="2110" /> appeal particularly to my county colleagues, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Higgins, to ensure that the Government takes note of those findings. I am sure those Ministers could count on support from the Minister present, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has just left the Chamber.  I am sure those Ministers have not forgotten their roots even though that may no longer be their main concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the 1996 budget.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare, I am acutely conscious of the challenge we face in addressing what can often appear to be conflicting demands.  On the one hand, the Government must ensure that public spending is contained and that an environment which will allow for sustained economic growth and increased competitiveness is nurtured and developed.  On the other hand, the Government must also ensure that the problems associated with persistent high unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, changing family structures, poverty and social exclusion are tackled in a meaningful and effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must continue to improve and maintain the position of the 800,000 people and their 700,000 dependants who depend on social welfare while at the same time ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to support the further growth of industry and employment.  In striking the correct balance, it must be borne in mind that every 1 per cent increase in social welfare costs almost £1 million per week, while at the same time a reduction of 1 per cent in basic tax rates could reduce <Col N="2111" /> the amount of money available by almost £80 million pounds per year.</P>
    <P>I believe this budget goes a long way towards reconciling the conflicting demands of ensuring the continuing development of both our economy and our social services.  It strikes a fair balance in terms of social and economic objectives.  It supports the most vulnerable sectors of society while at the same time creating an environment in which real and lasting jobs can continue to be created.</P>
    <P>Above all, it is a budget for employment. A package aimed at further reducing the level of PRSI for both employers and employees effectively represents an investment of over £120 million in employment in a full year. Other incentives encourage and support the long-term unemployed to return to work, either directly or through a number of innovative and effective education, work experience and training programmes.</P>
    <P>The income of social welfare recipients will be improved and protected through a general increase of 3 per cent across the board, with a minimum of £2 per week on all payments.  In addition, special emphasis has once again been placed on the need for greater family support.  For example: child benefit has been increased by a further £2 per child. In fact, the child benefit rate has been increased by 45 per cent since this Government took office.  The monthly payments will increase to £29 for the first two children and £34 per month for the third and subsequent child.  This means that, for example, a family with four children will now receive almost £30 per week in child benefit; a grant for twins &mdash; currently £200 at birth &mdash; will be increased to £500 and will be repeated when they reach the ages of four and 12; back-to-school clothing and footwear payments increase to £43 for primary school children and £58 for second level; those looking after incapacitated or elderly family members will <Col N="2112" /> get an increase of 8 per cent in their carer's allowance and the family income supplement goes up by £6 per week.</P>
    <P>The budget is unique in that it specifically sets out to tackle the issue of long-term unemployment in a cohesive and focused manner.  It contains a series of interlinked measures, ranging from employer subsidies to PRSI reforms which will have a real effect on the lives of many of those who are at present effectively excluded from the labour market.</P>
    <P>Substantial concessions are being made in relation to PRSI contributions for employees and employers.  The employee PRSI allowance is being increased by 60 per cent this year and employees on full rate PRSI will not pay PRSI on the first £80 per week.</P>
    <P>There was considerable debate about payroll costs and their effects on competitiveness and job creation.  While many commentators were not comparing like with like in relation to the social security structures and costs in other countries, nevertheless there is a clear need to move further to maintain and increase the level of employment here. The welcome news for employers in this budget is that the PRSI rates are being lowered &mdash; to 8.5 per cent in the case of the lower rate and to 12 per cent in the higher rate.  At the same time, the threshold at which the higher rate falls due will be increased by £1,000 to £13,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The total of these PRSI reforms amounts to almost £121 million in a full year and represents a fundamental strategic shift in the structure of employee PRSI.  It demonstrates in the clearest way the Government's commitment to stimulating new employment and rewarding the enterprise of employers and employees who are producing wealth and contributing to State finances.</P>
    <P>The income thresholds governing entitlement to family income supplement are being increased by £10 a week at each point, ensuring that most recipients will gain an extra £6 per week.  Additional changes to the family <Col N="2113" /> income supplement scheme will render it more accessible and responsive to the ness of those who avail of its provisions. That is particularly important in view of the oft-repeated claim that it was less remunerative to go to work than to remain on the live register.  Therefore, this provision is in line with Government policy of focusing specifically on the need to encourage people to return to the workforce and render it remunerative for them to do so.</P>
    <P>A crucial change is being effected in the arrangements governing the payment of unemployment assistance which are being simplified with the express purpose of ensuring that people can avail of opportunities to take up part-time or casual employment safe in the knowledge that, in so doing, they will be better off than at present.</P>
    <P>Payment of the child dependant allowance, which previously would have been lost when a qualified parent took up employment, will continue to be paid for a period of 13 weeks to people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more.</P>
    <P>The extension of the back-to-work allowance will mean that an additional 5,000 unemployed people will be able to retain social welfare payments while returning to work or setting up self-employment projects.  This income cushion is vitally important, particularly where they have families to support, during the critical start-up period of any new enterprise.  This scheme has already provided employment opportunities for over 10,000 people.  This year additional funding is also being provided to assist participants engaging in self-employment ventures with business technical advice and training.</P>
    <P>The extension of the VTOS scheme will give a further 1,000 unemployed people the opportunity to return to education and enhance their skills, or acquire new skills needed in the increasingly competitive jobs market of today. Over 8,000 unemployed people will engage in full-time education at second and third level in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Under a new pilot scheme, an <Col N="2114" /> additional 1,000 full-time places will be reserved in community employment for people over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for more than three years.  Twenty-five per cent of the part-time places on community employment will be reserved for those over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for more than three years.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of work trials is being introduced which will aim to place 5,000 job-seekers &mdash; who have been unemployed for at least six months &mdash; with employers who have prospective vacancies or who are in a position to offer worthwhile work experience.</P>
    <P>This is another positive measure, aimed at encouraging people back to the workforce, putting them in a position in which they can train within a work environment to improve their capabilities in the course of that training and thereafter.</P>
    <P>A youth progression programme is being introduced which will focus on tackling the problem of long-term unemployment at source by providing a range of services to 18 and 19 years olds in danger of drifting into long-term unemployment, another important provision in that it will focus on a vulnerable group who, at a critical stage in their early working lives, may well be at a crossroads.  Therefore, it is most important that their efforts are guided in the proper direction and that they are assisted in every way possible, which is the object of this exercise.</P>
    <P>This package of measures is the clearest possible demonstration of the determination and willingness of the Government to provide opportunities for the long-term unemployed to achieve their full potential and participate in society with dignity.  It is well known that most job vacancies tend to be filled by people moving from another job or by those who have been out of work for a short time only.  Length of time out of work is a major factor for job seekers.  Thus, there is need to take supportive action to enable the long-term unemployed to compete on an even footing.  The new employers' subsidy will encourage and <Col N="2115" /> support them to recruit people who have not worked for three years or more.  It is not true that such schemes are vulnerable to large scale abuse as it is quite easy to ensure that such abuse does not take place.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this budget contains a number of provisions I have been advocating personally for some time.  As in the case of all budgetary preparations, one endeavours to be as comprehensive as possible in addressing the needs all Members will have identified over many years.  However, that cannot be done simultaneously, but it involves many steps, which, combined, will eventually have the effect of addressing the identified problems.  Suffice it to say that, in any given budget, while one will not see all the provisions one would like &mdash; whether in Government or Opposition &mdash; it is not an indication that those problems will not be addressed at some future date.</P>
    <P>The extension of the free travel companion pass, which will come into effect from July next, to blind and visually impaired children will be of enormous help to those children and their parents and of particular benefit to children attending special schools who must commute daily or weekly.  Henceforth, they will be allowed a person of their choice to travel free with them on their journeys.  Apart from the financial savings involved, this pass will greatly ease the concern of parents of blind or visually impaired children who will have the comfort of knowing that their children do not have to travel alone.</P>
    <P>I also heartily welcome the amendment of the free telephone rental scheme.  At present, one of the conditions for receipt of the allowance requires that the pensioner be living alone or with certain excepted persons, including children under 15 years of age. That age limit is now being extended to 18 years of age, an improvement which will bring an additional 3,800 pensioners into the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> Obviously, a great number of new measures and reforms have been introduced in this budget, and as I have special responsibility for customer services, I am anxious to ensure that members of the public will be in a position to fully understand the social welfare implications of the budget, particularly as it affects their own personal situations.</P>
    <P>To this end, a freefone budget inquiry service was made available last week which enabled anyone calling to inquire about budget provisions to be connected, free of charge, to the Departments' information services.  This service proved to be exceptionally successful and was widely availed of again this year.</P>
    <P>Budget factsheets have also been distributed to the Department's local and branch offices and to the community information services.  My Department is increasingly conscious of the need to provide accurate and timely information to the public and to make access to that information as convenient as possible. We now have a strong programme for action in this area which includes: making one-stop-shops a reality, expanding new payment facilities and easier more convenient signing arrangements; a concerted drive to simplify social welfare supports and information about them; improved access to services through upgrading public offices, better signposting and more privacy; better information about entitlements in individual circumstances, and greater involvement and consultation for customers in matter concerning the delivery of services. The commitment to more efficient delivery of information and services is indicative of a welfare system which is increasingly responsive to the changing needs of Irish society.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest, and some amusement, to the contributions by some colleagues on the Opposition benches to this debate.  It is in the nature of Opposition, indeed a duty of Opposition, to criticise the Government of the day and its policies. However, this year, a number of speakers, being singularly unable to find any <Col N="2117" /> substantial flaw or fault with this budget, resorted to the tactic of trying to identify imaginary weakness and divisions in the Government's approach.</P>
    <P>Let me put this red herring back where it belongs once and for all.  This budget was a team effort by a strong and united Government, with the three parties working in unison to ensure that the social and economic affairs of this country continue to be managed in a responsible, constructive and effective manner.</P>
    <P>The 1996 budget consolidates the improvements contained in the first budget brought in by this Government last year and introduces some innovative measures.  This Government will continue to work hard to ensure that the economy continues to flourish and that all strands of Irish society share in that success.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate I have been amused, concerned and appalled but I congratulate the Opposition on managing their show in a way which grabbed maximum attention and should surely qualify for an Oscar or, if not, the next best thing.  In almost every category, in the fictional section, it has done extremely well from one area to another.  Before the Minister delivered his budget speech, Members of the Opposition spoke out.  Newspaper headlines stated the Minister for Finance has £200 million to spend on tax cuts; De Rossa has the country ruined with huge payouts and taxpayers are bending under the burden.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa is able to defend himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem was he spoke before the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and likewise the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  It is alleged that all these sources had an inside track.  If that is the case why were so many wrong?  Last year my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, was wrongly criticised by the Opposition for being cold, heartless and uncaring because he had only increased <Col N="2118" /> social welfare payments by 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent and inflation would be 3 per cent.  The Opposition claimed this was a callous Minister who had no regard for the needs of the poor and was restricting them to a nominal increase.</P>
      <P>The budget last year, like the budget this year, was based on sound economic indicators which predicted the likely interest rate and economic growth.  Lo and behold by the year's end the Minister had been correct in his projections. I did not hear anybody from the Opposition say they were sorry, that what had been said about the Minister was wrong that they were wrong and were only being alarmist.  Last year, according to the Opposition, he did not spend enough.</P>
      <P>This year, despite all the flag waving and all the predictions of dire consequences the Minister for Social Welfare sought a requirement in accordance with that which he felt &mdash; and I agree &mdash; was needed to ensure that the people who were dependent on payments from social welfare received a payment commensurate with their needs and to match inflation.  This year we had a 3 per cent increase but we did not hear anything about the problems because the Opposition has changed.  It reckons too much money is being spent on social welfare but it has not identified areas where there might be cuts.  It is amazing that the Opposition for some unknown reason regards the difference between 2.5 per cent or 2.8 per cent and 3 per cent as huge.  Opposition parties are very accurate in their calculations but the amount of money involved in a 1 per cent increase is between £49 million and £50 million.  A 1 per cent increase or decrease in social welfare represents a sum of roughtly £1 million per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Opposition reconcile its response to last year's budget with its predictions for this year?  The debt reckoning of the Opposition, when in Government, exceeded all previous expectations, nonetheless I fail to understand how two percentage points would have involved a huge degree of <Col N="2119" /> soul searching among those on the opposite benches.  I am sure it did not.</P>
    <P>Oppositions should be constructively critical of Government &mdash; this relates to the Oscars to which I referred &mdash; but they should also be helpful in their criticism. One must ask how did the Opposition perform in the past 12 months. When the economy is going well it does not make life easy for an Opposition.</P>
    <P>My imagination was stretched somewhat over a year ago after a robbery. The Minister for Justice, as in such cases, gave the usual explanation. Despite the fact that this was approximately three to four weeks after the new Government had taken office I was amazed at the alacrity with which Opposition Deputies seized on the opportunity to virtually accuse the Minister of organising the hoist &mdash; that is all they were short of doing &mdash; when for the previous seven years they had been directly in control of that Department and had not done anything to reorganise the resources in that area and take serious action against criminals.  They gave no indication that they had anything to do with the management of the economy over the past seven years but rather made blatant political attacks which had no basis in fact.  I am not surprised that the public is cynical about such attacks &mdash; it has seen similar ones and knows they are merely trying to deflect attention from themselves.  Those Deputies should remember that times have changed.</P>
    <P>We should consider the best way forward for an economy which is going well.  It is generally recognised that our economy is doing well for a variety of internal and external reasons.  It has been suggested that the Government should have introduced massive tax cuts in the budget.  Everyone is in favour of paying less tax but it should be remembered that a 1 per cent decrease costs £77 million.  Such a decrease is not a massive reduction and it is better to have gradual reductions over a period of time.  I am not an economist but I regard myself as a poor man's observer <Col N="2120" /> of various economies and thus far I have failed to identify an economy where a process of massive tax reductions has proven successful.  In some jurisdictions, particularly ones close to us, that process has been disastrous and the results are there for everyone to see.  If we want to be competitive we must do our utmost to bring about a gradual reduction in taxation over a period of time.  We should not exaggerate the extent to which this is likely to happen in a single year.  I wish to point out to those who claim there could have been massive reductions in taxation that certain reductions were correctly introduced this year.</P>
    <P>The ability of Fianna Fáil to adapt to all situations never ceases to amaze me. At times it is not possible to define accurately the way it does this but it confuses the public and very often ends up confusing its members, who sometimes remind me of a group of armadillos at a cross-roads where some are going in one direction and others are going in a different direction in an effort to cater for every situation as it occurs. They want to ensure that they will have no responsibility for any of the damage their actions or words might cause but at the same time they want to give the impression to the public that they are friendly and helpful at all times.</P>

      <P>Yesterday Deputy Willie O'Dea used the word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; at least 15 times in his contribution.  I fail <Col N="2121" /> to understand the relationship between the budget and fraud but I think the Deputy was suggesting to the public that the budget was a fraud in some way. Otherwise he was straying from the budget debate.  I thought he was referring to illegal activities outside the House and not to a matter being debated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only conclude that some genius at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench suggested that the word &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; should be used in a budget speech as the public would read it with great interest and it would keep them entertained for a long time.</P>
      <P>He also referred to the &ldquo;unMidas&rdquo; touch and a 14-month delay in implementing some Government programmes. It takes a Government a while to find its feet when it comes into office.  However, the Opposition do not intend to give this Government any honeymoon period.  Deputy O'Dea referred to a 14-month delay but he should remember that his colleagues were in Government for one of those months.  It is sad that this type of selfdelusion has taken over the Opposition benches to such an incredible extent.  I hope it does not continue and that the Opposition will come to recognise the reality after our period of good government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years it has been traditional for Deputies of all parties to put forward their ideas on what should be included in the budget.  This is a welcome development as people who have a genuine and sincere interest in their job have put forward good ideas.  It is also an interesting and reassuring aspect of democracy which should be taken on board at all times.  Traditionally Governments have tended not to listen to the points made by Opposition Deputies but when Minister go back to their offices they look at constructive proposals to see to what extent they can <Col N="2122" /> be accommodated.  Every Minister has a duty to look at the problems highlighted during genuine budget contributions and I hope this will remain the case.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare. The Opposition must have been very disappointed to realise that there was no row in Government about the budget which is generally regarded as good and which will stand the test of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general acceptance that unemployment is the most pressing economic problem facing the country.  That acceptance is reinforced by the daily evidence of crime and lawlessness which can be attributed in large part to the social exclusion resulting from mass unemployment. It appears, however, there is much less acceptance of the link between taxation and unemployment. The Minister for Enterprise and Employment seems convinced of the relationship between the two but he has had a hard time in getting this message across to his colleagues.</P>
      <P>No degree in economics is needed to know that high levels of personal taxation act as a disincentive to work, which is our major problem.  Yet, this budget under a smokescreen of minimalist changes to our dreadful taxation regime, sets out to increase income tax by £260 million.  The Government believes it can profitably use the extra revenue to create jobs.  It is time we recognised a high spending, high taxation Government is more likely to destroy jobs than to create them.  A typical single worker on a relatively modest wage of £250 per week faces a marginal tax rate of 56 per cent, including PRSI and levies while his Northern Ireland counterpart faces a marginal rate of 34 per cent.  This is an enormous differential to maintain on a small island housing two open economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When differing levels of employers' PRSI and social insurance are taken into account, the cost of employing a <Col N="2123" /> person in the Republic of Ireland is substantially higher than in Northern Ireland or Britain.  If we do not move to close this gap, the implications for employment here are ominous, especially at a time when the substained weakness of sterling is putting our exporters under considerable pressure.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise the changing political landscape in Britain.  Both major British parties are effectively committed to a low tax regime for personal incomes.  Indeed, in the run-up to the British general election, there could be further substantial cuts in its income tax rates, making life even more difficult for the trading sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>The budget should have addressed this issue head on.  Instead, we had a series of penny-pinching changes to personal taxation, none of which is likely to have a significant bearing on the economics of employment.  These changes are so small as to be cosmetic.  In weekly terms, they are little more than pence and when account is taken of reductions in mortgage interest and VHI reliefs, it is clear that few taxpayers will be better off as a result of the budget, most will be worse off, even if they do not yet realise it.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, despite the so-called tax cuts, the Minister is budgeting for a further increase in income tax revenues in the order of £260 million; we can do without tax cuts like that.  The Minister may argue that these extra taxes will be paid by new workers coming into the tax net.  However, with the vast majority of new jobs in our economy being of a part-time nature, this seems highly unlikely.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had managed to hold growth in public spending in 1996 in line with forecast inflation, he would have needed to raise £350 million less in tax revenue.  That money would have enabled him to make major progress towards reform of our personal taxation system.  He could have reduced the basic rate of income tax to 23 per cent, halved the rate of employees' PRSI and cut employers' PRSI by one-third.  Instead, <Col N="2124" /> the Minister's high spending colleagues around the Cabinet table made a preemptive strike on the funds that would have been available for tax reform.  One commentator said that by the time the Minister got to the cupboard, it was bare.</P>
    <P>Our national debt now stands at more than £30 billion or almost £30,000 per householders and we are adding to that total at a rate of £1 billion a year.  This is a remarkable achievement when one considers that tax buoyancy has pushed Government revenues to record levels, the current budget was balanced as recently as 13 months ago and huge transfers from the European Union are available to fund capital investment projects by the State.</P>
    <P>The debt burden is continuing to grow because this Government has no coherent policy for the management of our public finances.  We are currently running a current budget deficit at a time of record economic growth, albeit the pace of that growth is exaggerated by the official statistics, continue to pump hundreds of millions of pounds into State companies, failing to recognise that the international trend is for Governments to withdraw from a direct ownership role in the economy, and refuse to embrace privatisation as a legitimate and valuable policy option and one which would contribute hugely to reducing our debt burden.</P>
    <P>The Government is now apparently about to enter into a half-baked arrangement to sell a minority stake in Telecom Éireann to a foreign company. No explanation has been given as to why the company could not be fully privatised by way of stock market flotation, as happens in the rest of the developed world.  There is no reason a well managed telecommunications utility should not be capable of surviving on its own in the commercial world.  If it needs a strategic link-up with an outside company, that could be achieved by way of commercial rather than equity partnership. Under the arrangement being contemplated, a single buyer will be able to secure a strategic stake in an <Col N="2125" /> overmanned and undervalued company, effectively shutting out all other bidders down the line.  This idea serves the interests of Irish taxpayers, the ultimate shareholders in Telecom Éireann, poorly.  Even this partial sale of Telecom Éireann will raise significant revenues for the Exchequer.  Will some of the proceeds of the transactions be applied to reduce the national debt level or will this too be swallowed up in yet more current spending programmes?</P>
    <P>This Government has set a disturbing precedent in its use of a State asset, the local loans fund, to pay for current expenditure.  The same must not be allowed to happen in the case of Telecom Éireann.  Despite the imminent Telecom Éireann sale, all indications show that the national debt will rise by a further £1 billion this year.</P>
    <P>For the last few years, we have been fortunate to enjoy a sustained period of low international interest rates.  That period should have seen a significant decrease in the annual cost of servicing our national debt.  Instead we have continued to add to our debt mountain. Falling rates mean that the higher indebtedness did not translate into higher interest costs.  Out debt service costs are now lower in real terms then ten years ago when the national debt was £10 billion lower than it is now.</P>
    <P>In pushing up the national debt at a time of low interest rates, we are storing up great trouble for ourselves in the years ahead.  Interest rates will not remain at their current low levels forever. Most respected commentators accept that we are now moving along the bottom of the current interest rate cycle.  When that cycle begins to turn, the impact on our public finances will be appreciable.  Should international rates rise by three percentage points over the medium term &mdash; this is a plausible and benign scenario &mdash; the additional costs to the Exchequer of servicing our existing debt burden would rise by almost £1 billion annually.  This would put severe pressure on the public finances, especially as rising rates would be likely to slow down economic growth and the <Col N="2126" /> pace of growth in Government tax revenues. It is imperative to adopt a clear and coherent strategy for the management of the public finances.  We need to recognise that the national debt must be stabilised, or reduced, if possible, if we are not to run into major problems in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>We must also take cognisance that like low interest rates, transfers for the European Union will not last forever. This country currently receives almost £2 billion per year from the EU under various headings.  This is an enormous sum of money for an economy of this size.  Effectively, EU assistance means that Ireland is one of the world's biggest recipients of development aid on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
    <P>All indications show that the volume of funding available to us from 1999 onwards will be sharply reduced by EU enlargement.  That might not be such a big problem for this State if we had used our EU windfall wisely.  However, we exhausted more energy in arguing how much we would get rather than about how we would spend it.  Many of our current spending programmes are heavily dependent on EU funding.  We have no guarantee that this funding is renewable and we should treat it as a finite resource.  Therefore, it is imprudent in the extreme to continue pushing up the volume of public spending when we are unsure of our ability to fund it in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Will we increase taxation to fund spending programmes when EU transfers run out or tail off or will we dispense with entire areas of Government activity currently funded by payments from Brussels?</P>
    <P>The huge injection of EU funds provided us with a marvellous once off opportunity to remedy our infrastructural deficits, in terms of roads, ports and airports, but, we seem to have missed it. In the case of the roads programme, for example, most of the major developments scheduled to get under way in 1995 &mdash; the Nenagh, Arklow and Kildare bypasses &mdash; did not start.  There must now be a serious question as to <Col N="2127" /> whether many of the projects listed in the national roads programme will ever be completed.</P>
    <P>We are facing into a tight fiscal situation in the medium term.  We are vulnerable to an inevitable rise in the interest rates cycle, facing into a major shortfall in EU funding and need to close the gap in personal taxation between ourselves and the United Kingdom if we are to remain competitive as an exporting country.  Everything points to the need for tight control of public spending to facilitate a reduction in the burden of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>It will be no use tackling this problem in 1999, it needs to be faced up to now. We need to get our act together.  Three of four budgets are required to deal with these issues, to set out a planned programme of debt reduction, tax reduction and public spending control. Last week's budget failed to recognise the importance of these issues.</P>
    <P>My party recently published a comprehensive five year programme covering taxation and public spending which showed how significant reductions in personal taxation could be accommodated without any cuts in the overall level of public expenditure.  We showed how, through a selective programme of State assets sales, sufficient funds could be raised to effect a reduction in the national debt with consequent savings to the Exchequer in debt service costs.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in the course of this debate Labour Party speakers have come into the House day after day to attack the Progressive Democrats document which, incidentally, was produced by a small Opposition party with meagre resources at its disposal.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, devoted her entire speech to the document last week.  I find it curious that they should concentrate on a five year plan put forward by an Opposition party rather than on a one year non-plan introduced by their party colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>One of the recent features of public <Col N="2128" /> administration apart from the obvious lack of transparency, is the lack of accountability for action and inaction. While serious financial matters have come to light in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to which I will advert shortly, the most easily understandable and glaring example of the lack of public accountability in a matter far more serious than mere financial losses, lies in what has now come to light about the activities of the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Its negligence in regard to contaminated anti-D immunoglobulin almost defies belief.  The ordinary civil negligence is, in effect, admitted by the Government and compensating those severely affected by the actions of the board will cost the taxpayer dearly.  A total cost in excess of £200 million is a possible outcome.</P>
    <P>The more sinister aspect, however, arises when one considers the question of criminal negligence.  The degree of negligence, wilful neglect and failure in this instance is so great it is difficult to see how it can be less than a criminal offence, but what accountability have we had in that sphere?  Who is responsible? Not alone are there no prosecutions, but there were golden handshakes for some officials of the board.</P>
    <P>I contrast this with the position in France where something similar happened in the blood transfusion line, and several of those involved were held criminally responsible and instead of golden handshakes received jail sentences. Here the official culture is that officials do not make mistakes, do not fail to react to formal warnings of dangers and, if they do, the matter will be covered up.</P>
    <P>I am glad the organisation, Positive Action, which represents the 1,000 women injured by the criminal negligence of the State, is endeavouring to enforce accountability.  It has my support and I wish it luck, but my experience suggests it will have difficulties.</P>
    <P>The matter of accountability in the <Col N="2129" /> beef division in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry over a period of years raises some serious questions. The cost of the beef tribunal to the taxpayer will, reputedly, be about £35 million in legal costs.  The additional cost to the taxpayer arising out of some of the facts uncovered will amount to further substantial sums, as yet unquantified. It is worth reminding ourselves that the chairman of the beef tribunal remarked in its course that if certain parliamentary questions had been truthfully and correctly answered the entire procedure might not have been necessary.</P>
    <P>In its report the beef tribunal explicitly found that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry failed to fulfil its &ldquo;duties and obligations&rdquo; under EU regulations relating to intervention, in particular Article 20/859/89.  Arising from this finding a fine of £74.2 million is proposed to be imposed on this country by the European Commission out of a total proposed fine of £109.925 million for various shortcomings and breaches of duty during 1990 and 1991.</P>
    <P>The lack of accountability is not just to the Dáil and public, it even extends to the Government.  When I inquired in 1989, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry whether intervention beef had been shipped to Iraq it refused to reply.  It was aware at the time that intervention beef had been so used.  It was a relevant matter as far as the State was concerned in seeking to defend proceedings brought against the Minister, but it refused to inform me. Politically, it was also relevant.</P>
    <P>The first that I or my Department heard about it was when the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry finally informed the beef tribunal in the latter part of 1992 that it had concealed this relevant and important information for nearly three years.  It would not have revealed it, but for the efforts of the beef tribunal.  It had concealed it from a member of the Government who was endeavouring to defend an action for a sum well in excess of £100 million and. <Col N="2130" /> possibly, as much as £200 million.  There is no reasonable excuse for this concealment. In ordinary terms, it was a coverup. Who benefited from it?</P>
    <P>With my letter in the autumn of 1989 I sent to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry a departmental veterinary certificate which had been sent to me by a meat company.  It subsequently transpired in 1992 that this certificate was a forgery.  The Department had to be aware on receipt of the certificate from me that it was a forgery, but it did not so inform me.</P>
    <P>Nobody has ever been held responsible for these concealments of the truth.  One senior official in the beef division of the Department altered official correspondence from CBF to excise all reference to the use of intervention beef for Iraq, to substitute other information and thereby deliberately to mislead.  He said in evidence that he believed his actions were in accordance with &ldquo;acceptable departmental policy.&rdquo; Obviously, they were; he has since been promoted to principal officer.</P>
    <P>These concealments could cost the State dearly.  The main, but not sole beneficiaries were a number of meat companies.  Why were the interests of these companies placed above the interest of the public and taxpayers? Why is there no accountability for so doing?</P>
    <P>One of the matters which has come to light consequent on the report of the beef tribunal is the widespread action of a number of beef companies which on boning out carcases for intervention purposes consistently stole meat, the property of the Minister who held it on behalf of the European Union under the terms of the regulations by means of actions that were &ldquo;not in accordance with the clear and unambiguous terms of the deboning contract&rdquo;.  The stolen meat was put into their own commercial stock and sold on the market for their benefit.</P>
    <P>The Department was fully aware of such illegal practices.  One official wrote a letter on 11 May 1989 to all meat companies drawing attention to the fact that <Col N="2131" /> the Department was aware of these practices, pointing out that they were illegal and asking for them to stop.  Notwithstanding the Department's knowledge it allowed these practices to continue. The companies concerned which were thus facilitated by the Department made illegal gains amounting to countless millions of pounds over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Nobody has ever been made accountable for this except for a few relatively junior employees of one private company. No effort has been made outside of one factory to recover the amounts illegally and fraudulently obtained.  So far as one can ascertain, no effort has been made to obtain recoupment from the beneficiaries of the practices that led to the proposed fines being imposed on the State.  Why should fraudulent beneficiaries be allowed to benefit and retain their ill-gotten gains?  At the same time the taxpayer has to pay up because the Department knowingly allowed it to happen.  Is this justice?</P>
    <P>It appears from page 465 of the tribunal report that one departmental official, over a period of 22 months in 1990-91, forged the name of the appropriate company representative on all the documentation submitted to the Department in respect of payment for all intervention purchases by that company. The tribunal found that during this period a serious and substantial fraud was perpetrated on the Department and the Commission at that factory. The official concerned, a civil servant, who was actively, continuously and deliberately involved in this matter, does not appear to have been made accountable in any way.  Why did more senior officials refuse to act?  Why did a Minister not act?  Is it because they approved of what was happening?</P>
    <P>These facts have been publicly documented for nearly 18 months and, apart from a small number of people, what has happened has not caused any great ripples of unease.  That a Department <Col N="2132" /> would act in this way is a matter of concern. That scarcely anyone should care is a matter of even greater concern.</P>
    <P>I alluded to only some of what is publicly documented.  There is much more relating to aspects of the beef industry and its relationship with the Department that is not yet publicly documented but which is no less serious. There will be another day for that, I hope.</P>

      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the budget.  We inherited the budgetary problems associated with equality payments, the beef sector and hepatitis C and, in the best interests of the general public and the taxpayer in the long-term, we speedily dealt with some of those matters.  As Members are aware, nothing was done about the equality payments issue for many years and, consequently, an enormous sum of money had to be paid out.  Problems put aside for the time being only add to taxpayers' costs in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few days some Members tried to put across that the budget and the efforts of the Government have not benefited middle income PAYE taxpayers. There are many benefits to be gained from a well run economy.  The low tax system in the UK was referred to.  I am sure none of us would wish private house owners here to go through the recent experience of their counterparts in the UK when high interest rates and rising unemployment levels caused many thousands of people to sell their houses at large discounts.  We should not consider the short-term advantage of reducing taxes without ensuring that our economy is soundly based.  As a result of a soundly based economy there are 45,000 more people at work.  This is important for the unemployed and for parents who want their children to <Col N="2133" /> secure jobs.  This is a significant achievement in one year, particularly when one considers the number of jobs created in previous years under different Governments, including ones of which my party was a member.</P>
    <P>The mortgage interest rate is another important area.  Deputy O'Malley spoke about the doom and gloom, but if we had done what his party wanted there would be much more pressure on interest rates.  We have the lowest interest rates in 30 years.  A person with a mortgage of £40,000 would have been £130 per month worse off in terms of mortgage interest relief alone when the Progressive Democrats Party was in power with Fianna Fáil.  It would be difficult to compensate for that in tax allowances.</P>
    <P>Third level education fees were halved last year and will be abolished this year.  Parents in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency will now have a choice about where to send their children for third level education.  In recent years many of them would not have been able to avail of third level education if they did not have the advantage of being able to go north of the Border for such education.  This is a step in the right direction, but the position could be improved further by providing more third level institutions in the Border region, particularly for those wishing to learn a trade.</P>
    <P>Enterprise is an important feature of the budget.  Corporation tax for small industries was reduced from 40 per cent two years ago to 30 per cent.  Small business organisations have been demanding such a reduction for some time.  This will mean a significant saving for small industries, particularly for those in my constituency who have not benefited for many years.  It will mean a saving of £30 million for that sector.</P>
    <P>The first £80 of weekly wages will be disregarded for PRSI purposes for those on low incomes.  A total of 18,000 people will benefit from the income tax exemption on £150.  The introduction of a special low rate of employers' PRSI of 8.5 per cent on the first £13,000 earned <Col N="2134" /> will mean that a person earning £250 per week will pay the lower rate of PRSI.  This will benefit many people in the food industry, in which County Monaghan plays a large part.</P>
    <P>In regard to the pig and poultry industries, I was disappointed the Minister reduced the tax on LPG by only 2p per gallon.  He should re-examine this matter. Two-thirds of our poultry is produced in County Monaghan by an industry which is under severe pressure. A large proportion of pig production also takes place in the Cavan-Monaghan region.  We are all aware of the problems caused by the differential between the punt and sterling.  The Minister must re-examine the question of taxation on non-automative LPG which is approximately 8.5p per gallon.  This is one way, within EU rules, of alleviating the problems of the poultry and pig meat industries in that region.</P>
    <P>The £80 per week recruitment subsidy is an important innovation in terms of employment.  In recent weeks we have heard a great deal about crime, which is causing much anxiety for the elderly and others living in rural areas.  One of the best means of tackling the crime problem is to ensure that as many people as possible are employed, especially in black spot areas, and the £80 subsidy should help in that regard.  Those involved in the mushroom industry and other part-time jobs in Border regions will benefit greatly from the three year rule in respect of medical cards.  Housewives and others could not afford to take up jobs picking mushrooms, etc., because the £30, £40, or £50 a week they earned would have resulted in the loss of their medical cards.  The measure whereby people can keep their medical cards for three years after taking up a job, is of tremendous benefit and will allow some growers to stay in business and others who have gone out of business to start up again, because without mushroom pickers that sector could not move forward.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in VAT refunds to farmers.  This will mean an extra £9 million in a full year.  The PRSI <Col N="2135" /> and tax reduction measures will also affect many small family farms.  The measure regarding tax on land leasing is a step forward.  In an effort to try to have land transferred to the younger generation we must encourage everybody to make their land available.  The fact that a farmer can earn up to £6,000 tax free from leasing his land will encourage him to engage in long-term leasing rather than on an annual basis. There are many benefits to agriculture in the budget and the main benefits are the result of a very active and aggressive Minister solving the many problems relating to farmyard pollution, milk quotas and the pig industry.</P>
    <P>There have been cries from the Opposition benches that the Minister is doing nothing about the crisis in the livestock industry.  When the Minister took over in December 1994 the pig industry was in crisis.  Farmers had been promised in February of that year that something would be done, but nothing was.  However, when Minister Yates came into office he immediately met representatives of the pig industry and tried to rectify the situation.  The pig industry has done well since, partly because of the Minister's work and partly because of the upturn in product price.  It has given farmers confidence that we have a Minister who cares and who has done much to improve payments etc.  These are the things that matter to farmers.  The measures in the budget may seem small but the overall efforts of the Government, through the Minister and through the back-up he got from the Cabinet, have been beneficial to the farming community.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the criticism of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, after he introduced his measures.  Members on the Opposition benches refused to recognise that he had increased the child allowance by £7, the biggest increase ever, and that he had improved many other areas.  They homed in on the 2.5 per cent given to pensioners.  This year the Minister defended his efforts to get more money <Col N="2136" /> for social welfare recipients and the long-term unemployed.  Again we heard the cry from the Opposition spokesman, Deputy McCreevy, that this was another case of the tail wagging the dog, and cries from another spokesperson, Deputy Joe Walsh, that he had not given enough.  There has been much talk on the Opposition benches that this is a three-way coalition, but, from this side of the House, the two speakers on the Opposition benches certainly look like a peculiar coalition.  They do not seem to be able to get their act together. Overall there has been an increase of 3 per cent this year.  The child allowance has been increased by £2 which is a £9 increase over a two-year period.  Pensioners living alone got an increase of £3.30 and the carer's allowance has been increased by £5.90.  These are significant improvements.</P>
    <P>Another problem that worries many people on social welfare and people in general is crime.  I welcome the innovative package put forward by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in the last few days.  It is a scandal that she has been singled out and blamed personally for crime in the past 12 months and particularly in the past few weeks.  During the first week of my campaign in the Mayo by-election about two years ago three people were murdered in a small corner of Galway and another not too far away in County Clare.  It just did not happen that it was only when Deputy Owen took office that there were brutal murders and unforgivable actions by layabouts who should be behind bars. This Minister has put much effort into her role in the past 12 months and she has now put forward a workable package which will provide jail places for people who should be in jail.  Despite all the talk about Castlerea and the money provided for it, the patients are not yet out of that hospital and will not be until next May.  It was more than a case of just providing the money for Castlerea. Money had to be provided to pay for hospital beds or homes for those in Castlerea Hospital.  The propaganda that a wall around Castlerea will solve <Col N="2137" /> all our problems is far from true.  The action the Minister has taken means that prison places will be provided quickly.  The appointment of extra judges and the institution of new Garda structures mean that we can look forward to improvements.  Anyone who thinks the problem of crime will be solved immediately is living in cloudcuckoo-land, but we must ensure that progress is made.</P>
    <P>There have been improvements in roads in recent years, paid for by the money provided from the tax amnesty and the additional money provided last summer.  I look forward to an announcement in the next few days of the allocation for the forthcoming year.  I appeal to the Minister, however, to give priority to the N2 from Dublin to Derry which goes through Monaghan town. The bombs are no longer going off in the North, the guns are no longer firing, and we have relative peace.  This gives people the opportunity to move freely through Northern Ireland.  It would be a failure on my part if I did not beg that that road be given priority so that tourism and industry in that region can thrive.  The fact that the Minister for Finance has made some gesture towards the cross-Border workers, that the Minister for the Environment has provided £6.5 million for the peace initiative and that INTERREG and the Combat Poverty Agency have offices in Monaghan is a recognition that thought is being given to the Border region, but we need to ensure co-ordinated efforts towards a region that has suffered so much over the 25 years of the troubles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the details of the budget.  Like most budgets it has been well debated.  If one is in Government one praises it, and if one is in Opposition one criticises it.  It has been well documented, well tabulated and well publicised.  My contribution will deal with the strategy of the budget.  Never was it more important for the economies North and South to be harmonised than at the moment.  I am disappointed the budget has not taken <Col N="2138" /> into consideration the effect it will have on cross-Border relationships.</P>
      <P>I grew up in the towns of Lifford and Strabane and was puzzled by differences between them.  It later became my responsibility as a public representative to do something about this.  For years I have been preaching in the confines of my party and in the House that we cannot have political unity in advance of economic unity.  Many of us forget this. In budget debates we think of the economy of the Republic without reference to what is happening north of the Border. Yesterday the Taoiseach cleverly and rightly cited Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution to say why according to them he has a responsibility to all the people of Northern Ireland.  I wonder what influence these articles had on the budget; I think they were totally ignored.</P>
      <P>From growing up in a Border region I have seen both sides of the coin.  For the first ten years of partition there was no economic border between North and South.  There was free movement of traffic and people.  This changed when Fianna Fáil came into office and fought an economic war with Britain.  Economic barriers and customs posts were erected.  These began on a small scale and were consolidated until they were dismantled by membership of the EU. This generation now knows the kind of relationship there would have been on this island if these tariffs barriers and customs posts had not existed.  People who wished to bring goods across the Border, mostly for their personal convenience, apart from professional smugglers, were stopped from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of a relationship would there have been between North and South if our economies had been harmonised? Some 200 years ago Henry Grattan preached economic union, free trade, a common currency and political separation.  The four points of this political philosophy dealing with the relationship between the British and Irish peoples are as valid today as they were then.  I am continually puzzled and <Col N="2139" /> concerned that leaders do not believe in the validity of that position.</P>
    <P>There cannot be political unity in advance of economic unity.  No party in power, including mine, has ever thought this through.  I was expelled from the House for protesting against the biggest blunder it made.  I was a lone voice in the wilderness saying it was wrong to break our currency's link with sterling. We made the Irish pound a foreign currency in six counties of this island.  No one thought this would happen as a result of making sterling a foreign currency in the Republic.  We were only concerned about joining the EMS and obtaining easy money quickly.</P>
    <P>No one is as aware as you are, Acting Chairman, of the economic convulsions caused in Border regions by the break with sterling.  A party in this House which preaches Irish unity does not have the right to make economic decisions which interfere with natural trading between people living in Border regions.  This policy is not in line with the goal of true unity between the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope my words will be listened to because we have an inescapable interwoven relationship with the people of Northern Ireland, not just with Northern Catholics, whom we see as our people, but also with Northern Protestants who are also part of this nation. Of the four million people living on this island, a quarter are Northern Irish Protestants.  We have treated them almost with contempt and have not shown concern for them when making economic decisions in this House.</P>
    <P>No one was consulted about the break with sterling, not even the people living in Border regions such as Monaghan, whom Deputy Leonard has the privilege of representing.  This decision was made by a handful of people in a clamour to join the strong currencies of Europe in the hope that our economy would embarrass the people of the North and force them to join a united Ireland.  How many politicians in the <Col N="2140" /> North have said a link with the Deutsche Mark will result in a strong Irish currency, will embarrass them and force them for economic reasons to become part of this State?  Economic advantage did not make the Catholics in Northern Ireland unionist and it will not make Protestants there nationalist.  The break with sterling was motivated by anti-British feeling, which has been confused with nationalism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford spoke about cross-Border workers.  People who live in the Republic and work in Northern Ireland must declare their income in the Republic for tax purposes.  People in the South may say this is fair enough, that the worker involved should pay the same tax as everybody else.  However, the core of this arrangement is that it is saying to people that if they work in Northern Ireland they should live there because if they live in the Republic they will be double taxed.  This is blatant partitionism. I am against this and have been since it was first introduced by my party, which was blind to the fact that it would have this effect on people.  It puzzles me that people in Northern Ireland have the slightest interest in having anything to do with the South.</P>
    <P>The currency problems caused by the break with sterling have caused deep and expensive difficulties for business people in Border areas.  Hoteliers, publicans and restaurant owners will take sterling at face value from customers in Northern Ireland because they are glad of the business.  However, when they exchange this money at the bank, they pay not only the exchange rate difference but also a banking charge.  This is hidden taxation caused by the blindness of politicians in this House.</P>
    <P>From the Opposition benches I listened to Fianna Fáil Ministers telling us the benefits which would result from membership of the EMS but which did not occur.  We are now in the worst of both worlds.  If our currency becomes premium to sterling, we can devalue &mdash; we have done so three times &mdash; because our trading with Britain would suffer.  If <Col N="2141" /> sterling becomes premium to our currency, we can do nothing about it.  There have been many advantages from membership of the EU but one of the disadvantages has been that we have been dragged into the currency position of Europe.  When we impose taxes on different commodities we do not stop to think how they will affect people living in Border areas.  If the price of petrol increases it will not have the effect on people in Cork it will have on those in Monaghan and Donegal.  People in Cork and Kerry will pay the additional costs for petrol but people in Monaghan and Donegal will drive across the Border for petrol when the prices increase.  They are forced to do that by decisions made by Governments in this House.  Nobody ever stopped to think that people living in Border areas would be at such a disadvantage, <i>vis-à-vis</i> counties further away from the Border.  I hope future Governments will iron out the economic differences between North and South.</P>
    <P>When we talk about equality of the economies North and South of the Border, we are really talking about a common economy with the rest of Great Britain.  Instead of always talking about the politics of Britain and Ireland, our leaders should consider how to bring about economic unity between Britain and Ireland because at least one million people &mdash; and perhaps half of the Catholic population of Northern Ireland &mdash; do not want to forfeit the economic benefits they now enjoy from Britain.  If we want to move in this direction we will soon realise we are facing a bigger problem than originally envisaged.  The Government should remember that the future of Ireland lies in economic harmony between North and South and, by extension, between Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget.  Some of the measures announced are welcome but PAYE workers have been let down. On the one hand the standard tax bands were widened and PRSI exemptions were increased but, unfortunately, the <Col N="2142" /> PRSI allowance was abolished.  The Government then decided to increase the excise on petrol and we can expect an 8 per cent increase in ESB charges in the next three years.  These measures have offset the favourable tax changes. PAYE workers will be only marginally better off in regard to their take home pay.</P>
      <P>The Government has referred a great deal to creating employment but the increases in the price of petrol, for example will result in increased transport costs, particularly in the west where we are furthest from the markets.  In an effort to create jobs in the western region, the Western Development Partnership Board examined the question of population settlement in the west.  The board issued its report to the Government at the end of last year and I welcome the framework plan suggested by the Board.  I am disappointed the board's report was not mentioned in the budget and I hope the Government will respond shortly to the framework plan outlined by the board.</P>
      <P>The board has highlighted the serious problem of depopulation and emigration in the western region.  It makes the point that 41 per cent of the population now live in the five eastern counties or, in more stark figures, that only 9 per cent of the population now lives in the north west.  When one considers the sparse population in Connemara, for example, it is obvious there is a major challenge facing the board and all public representatives, particularly those representing the western region.</P>
      <P>The former Archbishop of Tuam, Dr. Cassidy, recently referred to the fact that 1,000 people left his archdiocese each year.  That figure will certainly increase unless some action is taken. The action proposed is to encourage investment in the western region thereby making it more attractive for people to live there, as well as for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the announcement today by the intergovernmental committee on the islands that £2 million will soon be provided for the western region.  I know <Col N="2143" /> the Taoiseach has taken a personal interest in this matter.  However £5 million should be made available each year for the first five years to help the islands.  It is obvious from today's announcement two different Departments have responsibility for the islands.  Of the funding being provided, £1 million will come from the Taoiseach's Department with the other £1 million from the Leader programme through the Department of Agriculture. Food and Forestry.  That is indicative of the way some of these issues have been dealt with in the past.  One Department should be responsible for the islands.  I hope that will be the case in regard to the Western Development Partnership Board and that funds will be available to it.</P>
    <P>An issue that has been highlighted by the rural resettlement organisation is housing.  People in cities have expressed great interest in moving to the western region but there is a problem with insufficient housing.  That problem should be addressed by the Government which should provide suitable housing so that the work being done by people like Jim Connolly of the rural resettlement programme, in County Clare, can be undertaken in other counties in the western region.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of Government Departments should continue.  That has been successful and I am disappointed that the issue has been somewhat neglected. The Government must also accept that some cities along the western region are attracting people to their urban areas and this is causing major problems for smaller towns in rural areas.  That question was addressed by the Kiltimagh IRD in County Mayo which adopted a positive approach to the Leader programme when it was announced.  It realised it could transform the town by availing of funding from the programme.  Minor works such as replacing shop fronts could be funded and in that regard it has been very successful in County Mayo.  We now have a Leader programme in East Galway <Col N="2144" /> and we hope the community there will benefit from it and that urgently required jobs will be created.</P>
    <P>The peaceful way of life in the western region was always one of its main attractions but, unfortunately, the recent attacks on elderly people and other crimes in recent weeks and months have shocked everybody.  I hope the Government will come up with a more imaginative response than that proposed in dealing with this problem. We have been told that 25 prison places will be made available in Castlerea but nobody would accept that as being an adequate response.  There has been no answer to the question of a referendum on our bail laws, on a review of the right to silence or the reforming of the murder squad.  I hope we will get definite answers to these questions rather than hearing about task forces and committees being set up to examine them for a long time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Justice is serious about tackling crime, she should ensure the community policing scheme is reviewed and the extra resources that the Garda Síochána require, whether mobile patrols, vans and so on are put in place.  If she wants members of the force to live in the town in which they are stationed, she must look at the provision of Garda accommodation.  For example, a sergeant was appointed to Moylough, County Galway, 15 months ago but he and his family have not been able to live there because the Garda station has not been refurbished.  Having raised this matter, I eventually received a letter last week stating that the Department of Justice had decided on the requirements and I hope the Office of Public Works will do the necessary work.  The elderly in this area would have peace of mind if they could see the gardaí living in the community. I hope there will be grants available to the elderly for alarms and mobile phones.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the proposed tax relief for alarms because most elderly people to whom I have spoken do not pay tax.  I wonder why we need a task <Col N="2145" /> force when we know what should be made available.</P>
    <P>Changes could be made in the social welfare code to help the elderly, for example elderly people under 75 years will lose their secondary benefits such as free electricity and so on if they have an adult relative living with them.  The then Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputy Woods, reduced the age exemption from 80 to 75 years in the 1994 budget, but it is time to look again at the age exemption so that pensioners can retain the benefits to which they were accustomed and continue to have a relative live with them.  Pensioners are between a rock and a hard place in the sense that if they are living alone they will get an extra £1.10 in the budget but if they are under 75 years and have a relative living with them they lose the benefit of free electricity, free telephone rental, free television licence and so on.  The task force should look at this hardship for elderly people.</P>
    <P>On the question of rural development, there is the issue of decentralisation and the provision of education facilities.  There is an excellent university and regional technical college in Galway city but in recent years the Galway regional technical college set up a campus in Castlebar, which is proving very successful.  People in counties Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon believe their students should not have to leave their counties to participate in third level education.  There are other educational courses that could be provided in the counties and the Castlebar campus has proved how successful this can be.</P>
    <P>Due the fall in numbers in primary schools some teachers have to be transferred from their schools to another.  I welcome our education spokesperson's suggestion that two teachers should be the minimum number in every primary school.  He has pointed out that every country, with the exception of counties Laois and Offaly, have one teacher schools, totalling 163.  He suggests that these schools be allocated a second teacher which would cost in the region <Col N="2146" /> of £2 million to implement.  Great tribute is due to the sole teacher in one teacher schools whose only modern technology is the telephone.  Of the 163 one teacher schools, 42 are under Protestant management and some are Gaeltacht schools.  Schools for minorities should get special assistance.  A school needs 25 pupils on the roll to retain two teachers.  If the Government reduced that number by one, to 24, we would be able to retain those two teacher schools. The Minister should consider this and I hope he will be able to reduce the number by one.</P>
    <P>The provision of resource and remedial teachers is most important.  I welcome the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach's provision for additional remedial teachers.  Galway, the second largest county, has 48 remedial teachers but only seven resource teachers.  That will have to be emphasised in the future.  The resource teachers cover six or seven schools, which is a challenge to them.  I hope there will be more funding particularly for resource teachers.</P>
    <P>With the fall in the primary school population, the school transport system will have to be re-examined.  There is a ridiculous rule that there must be ten pupils between the ages of four and ten in a defined area in rural areas before the school transport services is provided. That figure will have to be reduced because of falling numbers.  As things stand the Government is getting good value because the same bus and driver will first take pupils to the second level school and then to the primary school. This has been a great success but it should be easier for transport services to be established in rural Ireland.  Other Members referred to the welcome change in third level fees but there is an anomaly in that part-time students, many of whom are employed and paying tax and PRSI, will not benefit from this.  They say they are subsidising the free third level education scheme.  They are being ignored and discriminated against and they are very disappointed <Col N="2147" /> that their case is not being addressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister ignored the farming sector.  Much play was made about improvements in REPs. We were told the first £2,000 received under REPS will not be taken into account in assessing means for social welfare purposes.  Will the same exemption be extended to applicants for medical cards, disabled person's allowance and other health allowances?  There is much hypocrisy surrounding this scheme as less than half the funding required for REPS is being made available. The scheme will grind to a halt unless the Minister succeeds in securing the necessary funds.  At present payments are delayed and departmental red tape is not helping the matter.  Farmers are asked for herd numbers and have been told 5 per cent of the plans will be inspected.</P>
    <P>This scheme was negotiated by the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, and deals with conservation, landscape protection, environmental problems, wildlife habitats, endangered species of flora and fauna and producing food in an environmentally friendly manner.</P>
    <P>The food industry was neglected.  I appreciate that the strength of the punt against sterling has caused problems but when Fianna Fáil was in office in 1989 it put together a successful package to help the timber industry and the mushroom industry.  A similar package is needed now and hopefully the Government will put one in place.</P>
    <P>Much publicity has been given to the Minister's animal health policy.  He must remember that unless there is a good working relationship between farmers, veterinary surgeons and the Department it will be difficult to implement such a policy.  Small farmers who may not be members of a farming organisation will pay more as a result of the changes being introduced by the Minister. I welcome the fact that graduates are setting up new practices.  The Minister has privatised this scheme although <Col N="2148" /> I am not sure if the Labour Party or Democratic Left realise this.  Veterinary surgeons will not set up a private practice in remote rural areas and it may be necessary to pay a subvention to encourage them to operate there.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that much money has been spent on the health area.  During the Christmas period a large number of people were left waiting for beds for a long time in the casualty department of University College Hospital, Galway and the matter was given media publicity. In the past this was attributed to flu epidemics and so on but now it happens during the tourist season when many visitors are in Galway.  Galvia Hospital recently postponed operations. The Minister will appreciate the seriousness of the matter.  I am confident he will secure funding to implement the interim proposal to provide badly needed beds.  The hospital has a huge catchment area.  Those living in County Clare use the facilities in Galway.</P>
    <P>Many people complain about early discharge from the regional hospital. There is a good hospice movement in Galway and if sufficient funds were provided we could complement the service provided in the regional hospital.  The hospice was built at a cost of £1.9 million and many requests for funding were made.  I hope the Minister, who will be the first Minister to visit the hospice in Galway, will provide the necessary funding although there is no provision for it in the 1996 Estimates.</P>
    <P>Every year 400 people die from cancer in Galway and 25 per cent of them need in-patient hospice care.  Some 5,000 people in Galway contribute towards the running of the hospice each year.  This shows how seriously the matter is taken by the doctors, particularly Dr. Kenneally, his staff and the directors of the hospice.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided funding for the mentally handicapped.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter.  I am disappointed that £262,000 was allocated as it is one-fifth of what we received in 1994.  I hope capital funding will make up for that reduction.  It is <Col N="2149" /> important that respite care and residential places are available, particularly in east Galway and south Roscommon.  At present the mentally handicapped in east Galway must avail of services in Arás Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo or in Galway city.  I hope he will consider my suggestion that medical cards be provided to the mentally handicapped and that the successful venture by the Western Health Board, Galway County Association and the Brothers of Charity in providing second level places for the mentally handicapped will be further developed.  The vocational education committees worked tirelessly to secure those places.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, east Galway is not promoted in the same way as the Connemara area and other areas on the western seaboard.  The major assets of the rivers Suck and Shannon should be promoted by Ireland West because angling holidays in particular are becoming very popular.  The existence of a marina in Ballinasloe will be a great asset to the town &mdash; up to now boats could travel only as far as Shannonbridge.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is in the House. I welcome in particular the increase in overseas development aid.  I am aware that mandatory payments must be made to the United Nations, but the Government should consider voluntary contributions to ensure they are effective and directed at the right areas.  Allegations have been made of scandals and ineffectiveness in that regard.  I hope the Minister will use the extra money to provide an effective and efficient overseas development programme.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  An attempt was made in the <Col N="2150" /> budget to strike a balance between the need to tackle long-term unemployment, maintain social stability and keep our finances in order to keep interest rates low.  Each of those areas is very important and the Government can be proud of its efforts in the budget and through its economic policies to achieve success in each area.  I am very pleased there is a balance between keeping finances in order and offering real hope to the many people trapped in long-term unemployment.  Unless specific measures are put in place the position of the long-term unemployed will not change.  For years people spoke about the need to reform our tax system, to make it easier to move from social welfare to work and to integrate the tax and social welfare systems.  It is interesting that when a budget addresses these issues in a real way there is very little praise for it.  It is a radical budget and in time that will become more obvious.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion about whether there is sufficient tax reform in the budget.  For the tax year ending 5 April 1995 workers paid PRSI on all income up to a limit of approximately £21,000.  Commensing on 6 April this year all employees will be exempt from PRSI on the first £80 per week of their earnings, yet we are told there has been no tax reform.  For the tax year ending 5 April 1995 employers paid 12.2 per cent PRSI on the wages and salaries to their employees, up to a limit of approximately £26,000.  From 6 April this year the 8.5 per cent reduced rate of PRSI will apply to the wage and salary costs of more than 60,000 employees.  That is a 30 per cent reduction in tax on labour in two budgets and it is focused on the more labour intensive and traditional sectors of industry.  Yet we are told there has been no tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past six days of debate the House has heard much about lost opportunities for tax reform and inadequate tax concessions.  We have lost sight of the true nature of the Budget Statement.  Tax reform and increases in social welfare allowances are only some <Col N="2151" /> elements of the budget, but let us consider the central purpose of a budget. The Budget Statement, which lays before the House the national economic and financial policies to be followed for the forthcoming year, is the single most important document this House considers each year.  It impacts on all Government Departments and services and affects the lives of every citizen.  It should, and does, reflect a cohesive set of policies followed over a period of years.  A cornerstone of these policies is the maintenance of a low interest, low inflation, stable economy, the benefits of which are enormous to every citizen.</P>
    <P>Little interest has been displayed during the debate in the economic policies underlying the budget, yet the real benefits are derived by the ever-reducing Exchequer borrowing requirement, the rates of economic growth and the inflation projections.  The benefits of lower mortgage rates, low inflation and increased employment are more substantial than any tax concessions announced on budget day, and changes in these areas would be very evident.</P>
    <P>Excellence in economic performance is not an accident; it results from sound economic policies.  Proper management of the economy delivers real benefits.  It is estimated, for example, that a family on an average manufacturing wage who took out a mortgage in 1992 has a much greater disposable income today than in that year.  Such improvements result from sound economic management, leading to lower PRSI, tax, mortgage rates and inflation.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for a significant slowdown in public expenditure, a further reduced EBR target and the targeting for the first time of measures aimed at those on long-term unemployment. Irish and European studies have shown that specific measures must be introduced to help people move from long-term unemployment.  People in those circumstances lose skills and contacts, thereby reducing their opportunity to get back into the workplace. Incentives such as those provided in the <Col N="2152" /> budget are necessary to help those people &mdash; I am referring to the continuation of the child dependency allowance for 13 weeks after a long-term unemployed person finds employment and retention of the medical card which is an important incentive to take up employment where possible.  These are the features of the budget that should be highlighted.</P>
    <P>The taxation measures announced in the budget merit more attention than has been given them.  A number of speakers focused on individual income tax measures but I prefer to focus on the overall impact.  Before paying tax at the higher rate, a married couple must earn more than £25,000, excluding mortgage interest relief and child benefit payments, which amount to £58 per month for a family with two children.</P>
    <P>An integrated approach has been adopted to business taxation, a matter to which Fine Gael has been committed for a long time.  The budget delivers for business, particularly small business, where jobs have been created in the last year and will be created in the future. Entrepreneurs who take risks must be supported, and this budget supports them.  The changes in employers' PRSI reduce the cost of labour on business. That encourages job creation and helps to maintain jobs in lower margin industries. That is what is needed to cope with increasing competition.  Last year set a record for employment creation.  A large number of new jobs were created but that was not an accident, it resulted from sound management.</P>
    <P>Large, high technology projects which create a substantial number of jobs are well publicised.  However, sustainable new jobs which will make a big difference will be secured through encouragement to small business operated by entrepreneurs willing to put their money at risk to create opportunities for small numbers initially and then gradually expand.  For example, the introduction of 30 per cent corporation tax for the first £50,000 of profits will directly benefit smaller business which are in every town, and that provision has been <Col N="2153" /> warmly welcomed by them.  It will encourage more reinvestment and job creation.</P>
    <P>I also welcome further reduction in taxes that will apply to the transfer of family businesses and farms.  Two years ago such transfers attracted the normal rate of capital acquisitions tax.  Following two consecutive initiatives by this Government the tax payable has been reduced by 75 per cent.  Family businesses and farms are not only critical to the economy, they are also an integral part of the socio-economic infrastructure of rural areas.  This provision is supportive of family business and farming families.</P>
    <P>The business tax measures announced in the budget are thoughtful, targeted and will undoubtedly stimulate the necessary growth and stability.</P>
    <P>The budget serves another function peculiar to Ireland in recent years.  It is one of the methods by which the Government honours its side of the social contract, a subject of recent comment. Since the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was agreed the rate of inflation has remained below the level anticipated, job creation has exceeded the targets in the contract and disposable incomes have increased because of tax reductions and lower interest costs.  We should not forget that when commenting on the social contract.</P>
    <P>I want to address comments that this is a left inspired budget.  I, and many of my party colleagues, very much resent the implication that Fine Gael has no interest in tackling the problems of the long-term unemployed, the poor, the marginalised and those dependent on social welfare.  The social welfare and pro-employment measures announced on budget day represent the first cohesive plan to tackle this problem.  Each party in Government subscribes to them and contributed to their design.  The independent economist, Moore McDowell, said that the measures in this radical budget have done more than <Col N="2154" /> any in a generation to tackle the problems of unemployment by a frontal assault on the main causes.</P>
    <P>Taking the 1995 and 1996 budgets together, the most extensive and expensive, measures taken have been the increases in child benefit.  That is a universal benefit.  We are aware from ESRI studies that the poorest families who experiences the greatest difficulty in making ends meet are those with a large number of children.  Child benefit reaches families directly.  That benefit has been increased by more than 40 per cent in the two budgets delivered by this Government.  It goes directly to assist all families.  It endures through unemployment and employment and raises the incomes of all families.</P>
    <P>For many years budget day was known as the day when taxes were increased.  It is now seen as the day when tax cuts are provided, but it is much more than that.  The economic policies and targets which this budget encompasses are set to ensure continued economic prosperity, increased job creation and greater income for all our citizens.  It is a strong budget that balances the need for social stability with the need for low interest rates and the need to tackle long-term unemployment, which is crucial at a time when there is a major focus on social unrest and concern about crime.  It is very important to tackle long-term unemployment, the knock-on effects it creates in society and the hopelessness and despair to which it can give rise.  We would have been negligent if we had not included these types of measures in the budget.  We would have been neglecting the key problem this country must tackle.</P>
    <P>I am extremely proud to be part of a Government that has introduced a budget with these priorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Frances Fitzgerald for sharing her time with me. In the short time available I join in supporting the budget and congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government on the presentation of an excellent programme <Col N="2155" /> of work for the next 12 months, which is what a budget should be.  For too long budget day was looked on as Christmas Day and people were disgruntled if there was nothing in it for them. Governments, depending on their weakness, were often swayed by the demands of strong lobby groups and did not recognise the effect the meeting of the demands of one of them would have on another.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted by the public that this is a good budget, it will have a steadying effect and does not have any throwaways, but it will benefit all the people, and that is as it should be.</P>
      <P>It is easy to criticise those on social welfare and say that they should be made work for whatever salary they might get.  From my experience of dealing with people on social welfare, 95 per cent of them would be only too happy to work for the income they receive if there were meaningful jobs for them, but unfortunately there are not.  In every society there will always be an element of people who do not want to work, the unemployable.  We must bring them along with us and encourage them to return to work.</P>
      <P>During the present crime wave people are inclined to single out one section of society as being responsible for all the trouble.  That is not true. Many respectful families, who through no fault of theirs are dependent on social welfare, abhor what is happening. In many cases the people involved in crime come from quite well off families, drive fast cars, young people with idle hands who do not wish to work and are out for kicks.  That is something I will deal with later if time permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on his management of the country during the past 12 months.  If there is confidence in the leader, there will be confidence in the country.  That confidence is reflected in references to the economy made by independent commentators.  There has been a turnabout in the economy during the past 12 months.  The indecisions of previous years and the stop-go policies <Col N="2156" /> are no longer part and parcel of this Government.  I look forward to the continued work of this Government during the next two years and to it having a further term of five years to enable it to complete its programme of work.</P>
    <P>It was reported in the press that the economy will continue to perform very strongly with gross national product expanding by 5 per cent following growth in excess of 7 per cent in 1995. That is an excellent forecast which can be lived up to.  Another comment was to the effect that the domestic economy will make a major contribution to overall growth, with personal consumption growing by 4.25 per cent and investment by 8 per cent; another, that exports will continue to do well, increasing by 9.5 per cent &mdash; clearly showing that people perceive the opportunities and are availing of them.  Another commentator said that, reflecting this well-balanced growth pattern, there will be a substantial increase of approximately 31,000 in total employment in addition to the increase of 45,000 last year, which will give further hope to those seeking jobs. Another pointed to the fall in underlying unemployment, based on a labour force survey of approximately 10,000 people whereas yet another predicted that inflation will remain moderate and consumer prices are expected to increase by a mere 2.25 per cent compared with 2.5 per cent in 1995.  In addition, I read today a forecast of another cut in interest rates.</P>
    <P>All of these commentaries demonstrate that the requisite parameters are in place, the Government is being taken seriously, is seen to be in control and efficiently managing our economy.  That is only to be expected since we have extremely capable Ministers in office and a Taoiseach who has done a marvellous job, unanimously recognised as providing good leadership, a man who can be trusted.</P>
    <P>We must always remember that public relations are critical and in this respect the Taoiseach's contacts and communications in regard to Northern <Col N="2157" /> Ireland have been exemplary.  His wellfocused, constructive statements are sensible without giving rise to any undue fears in any groups in Northern Ireland in their dealings with him.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the bedrock of our economy, so it is heartening that we have such an outstanding Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  When he assumed office 18 months ago major problems were being encountered in that sector.  Pig farming, so important in Cavan-Monaghan, was in dire straits, lobbying groups were protesting and many pig units closing.  In response the Minister tackled the problems of feed costs and marketing, to the extent that pig farmers are now doing extremely well, with pig prices at an all time high, among the highest in Europe, and continuing to rise.</P>
    <P>The poultry industry also had experienced difficulties.  I brought a delegation of poultry producers' representatives, including their well respected chairman from Cavan-Monaghan, to meet the Minister.  It took some time, to resolve the problems but they were resolved resulting in poultry producers being reinstated to their former profitability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard does not agree that the majority of dairy farmers are doing extremely well but he will admit that small dairy farmers, with insufficient quotas, are experiencing difficulties caused by the continued movement to ever larger units.  Nonetheless, the small farm remains an important unit and must be preserved.  We must be realistic in advocating the preservation of such small units.  Can small farmers survive on a 5,000 gallon milk quota or 10,000 gallons?  A quota of 20,000 gallons should be the minimum supplemented by some other source of income.  I am talking of the alternative enterprises of the 1990s not the alternatives of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when small farmers reared turkeys, produced eggs and so on in addition to their traditional farming in dairying, beef production or whatever.  To engage in alternative enterprises such as mushroom and vegetable production in combination with a <Col N="2158" /> 20,000 gallon milk quota can be a viable proposition.  In the case of small holdings, the Minister must endeavour to increase 5,000 gallon quotas to 20,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>I notice the tendency of larger dairying units to purchase milk quotas, moving into the 100,000, 200,000 250,000-gallon milk quotas, keeping 100 to 200 cattle which, rather than providing much employment merely support one family farm unit.  I would prefer to see those additional quotas divided among smaller units.  No doubt the Minister will address that problem.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat alarming to realise that, after the year 2005, a question may well hang over Structural Fund headage payments, now part and parcel of all small farmers' incomes, particularly those in disadvantaged areas.  Now is the time to take a serious radical look at this issue.  I understand there is a European Union criterion to the effect that when we reach a certain degree of economic prosperity we will no longer be eligible for such funding.  While that may suffice in some parts of the country, in the east and south east, it certainly will not in the west or Border regions where there is a huge difference in the standard of living.  Since the withdrawal of such funding would have very serious implications for less advantaged regions, rather than allocate it nationally, it should be allocated on a regional basis. This is a problem about which I have already spoken to the Minister and which I shall continue to stress here.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need to implement some controls on afforestation activities. Too many small holdings will be totally shaded by nascent forests not planted by farmers but by business people, corporate bodies and others who purchase land for plantation with the aid of substantial European Union grants, another serious development which must be examined.  Planning permission must be a prerequisite to the planting of such forests.  It is not good enough that small holdings can be totally shaded by forests planted by investors who pay above the odds for land in the knowledge <Col N="2159" /> that its utilisation will bring them substantial long-term benefit.  The Minister will have to urgently address that problem.</P>
    <P>I also read with some alarm that many such forests, four years after plantation, when one would expect trees to be well established, do not withstand independent inspection by the Department or Coillte.  While there is random planting of trees, their husbandry is not of the requisite standard.  It appears that some people simply plant the land they acquire and give all sorts of promises, but farmers who have signed contracts with them lose after that four-year period. It is imperative that farmers with marginal land, who seek the help of Coillte or other agencies in its planting, ensure that the contracts they sign are fully honoured so that, on the expiry of that four-year period, those plantations will qualify for the maximum EU grant.</P>
    <P>Regulations should be implemented to ensure that planting forests adjacent to farm land, or any other development does not impinge on farming activities. Just as planning permission is necessary to build a private dwelling or other construction, any such regulation should specify that an adequate tract of land should be left between any privatelyowned property and such plantation.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to improve safety procedures on boats; whether the resources for inspection of boats by marine officers are adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter in view of the number of serious accidents which have taken place on the sea in recent months.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>My key policy objective in maritime safety is to ensure that the highest standards of safety are set and enforced, to minimise the risks to human safety on our seas, rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>Irish regulation of safety matters in maritime transport has two sources, the international and domestic.  The former consists of the vast body of international law, regulations and guidelines which emanate from fora such as the International Maritime Organisation, the European Union and the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.  Ireland participates actively in the formulation of the constantly evolving safety strategies of these bodies, and the Department of the Marine gives priority to implementing their safety standards in Irish law.  The Department is actively developing a new, safer stability standard for roll on-roll off ferries in conjunction with other north west European countries and the International Maritime Organisation.  Our aim is to ensure that this mode of transport, which is essential to us as a highly mobile island trading nation, attracts the full confidence of the travelling public, including the large numbers of our UK and continental visitors.</P>
      <P>Irish-registered vessels are subjected annually to thorough inspection by my Department's marine survey office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates, as required under IMO Conventions.  Foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports are also inspected by marine survey office staff under the provisions of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.  I am satisfied that the resources available to the Marine Survey Office are adequate to deal with our international maritime safety obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the domestic front, the Merchant <Col N="2161" /> Shipping Act, 1992, extended safety regulations for the first time to boats carrying less than twelve passengers. While the large number of additional boat surveys necessitated by this legislation has given rise to some delay in processing applications for boat licences, I understand progress has been made in clearing the resultant backlog, which is unlikely to recur.  My officials are, however, currently assessing the implications for the marine survey office staff complement of introducing proposed new safety regulations for commercial sea angling vessels.</P>
    <P>I recently established a high-level group to review the question of the safety status of the Irish fishing fleet. My action in this regard was prompted by the recent losses of fishermen at sea, including the tragedy of the loss of six crew aboard the <i>Carrickatine</i> last November.</P>
    <P>The review group's terms of reference are: to review the safety status of all categories of vessel in the fleet; to review the status of training for fishermen; to review manning requirements and compliance therewith; to make recommendations on safety requirements to apply in future, together with a suggested timeframe for their implementation; and to assess the financial and sectoral implications of the implementation of the recommendations made.</P>
    <P>This review will be the most thorough and wide-ranging examination of the safety of the Irish fishing fleet.  Its purpose is to establish what actions may be necessary to ensure the highest safety standards in the fleet and, ultimately, to reduce the number of tragedies involving fishing vessels.  I can assure the House that any recommendations arising from this review will be given urgent and full consideration, and that appropriate action will follow without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the positive approach adopted by the Minister and the concern he has expressed.  Will he accept, because of the series of accidents and facilities that have occured, there is no room for delay in providing <Col N="2162" /> new safety procedures and equipment particularly in the fishing fleet?  In view of the huge costs associated with search and rescue and the failure by some boat owners to have on board the more sophisticated identification and location equipment, which is now available, will he consider grant aiding small boats, to provide this vital equipment which will lead to making considerable savings on the search and rescue operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy when I say every effort must be made to ensure there is maximum safety to eliminate any possible loss of life.  A review group set up, under the chairmanship of Mr. Donal O'Mahony, will report to me by the end of May.  I have given an undertaking to the group that its report will not be allowed gather dust on the shelves of the Department of the Marine and that we will take immediate action on the recommendations.  If the group wishes to make an interim report or interim recommendations we will follow up on those also.  I do not want to anticipate its recommendations but I will do whatever I can in terms of giving assistance.</P>
      <P>In the period 1994 to 1999, under the Operational Programme for Fisheries, in excess of £30 million will be invested in vessel modernisation, involving £9 million EU funding and £1.5 million Exchequer funding.  Improvements involving safety on board vessels is given a high priority when we are selecting projects for grant aid.</P>
      <P>Any recommendations arising from the review group will be given full consideration and I will be pleased to report back to the Deputy on what steps we can take to assist small boat owners.</P>

      <P>Because of the mysterious nature of some of the accidents at sea and the fact that submarine activities could have played a part in these tragedies, has the Minister had any discussions with his counterpart in the UK or elsewhere about these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that any of the recent fatalities <Col N="2163" /> resulted from accidents involving submarines. The most recent tragedy in Donegal resulted in many weeks of search both by the Naval Service and the fishing community in the north west and there is no evidence to suggest this tragic accident was caused by a submarine. If any such evidence comes to light I will pursue it.  The Irish Marine Emergency Service has given no indication to me that this unfortunate tragedy was caused by such an incident.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, I consider that the entire marine leisure area has huge potential for economic growth.  I am working with the Marine Institute to develop a plan to exploit the unique coastal resource on a basis which will be both sustainable over the long term and will create new employment.  New policy in relation to the sector should focus, in particular, on leisure sailing given its proven capacity to attract sailing tourists and generally add to economic growth in some of the more deprived areas of the country.  The House will also be aware of the very considerable interest in the area of water based activities shown by the attendance at the recent seminar in Sligo organised by the Marine Institute. The contributions to this seminar have uncovered a unique vibrancy, borne out of a recognition by local communities, individuals and business of the opportunities in the sector.  My policy will be to draw the strands together, point out the opportunities and actively progress development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of moorings and marinas will be a major element of the necessary infrastructure for the development of sailing tourism and I will actively support policy in this regard while at the same time ensure that the <Col N="2164" /> necessary safeguards are retained. While my Department is not in the business of investing in these commercial projects, it seeks to facilitate them by, for example, granting the necessary consents under the foreshore Acts.  My Department's planning of harbour developments to support the fisheries sector also takes account of the needs of other users and is designed to facilitate them.  For example, in the course of the major reconstruction of Kilmore Quay for Wexford County Council, works have been designed and carried out with a view to including a marina development. The details of the lease agreement are being negotiated with the council at present.  My Department is also constructively considering a number of foreshore applications in respect of marinas and has in recent years granted leases for marinas in Carlingford in Louth, Malahide in Dublin and Kinsale, Crosshaven and Baltimore in Cork.  I have a more direct role to play in areas for which I am the harbour authority, for example, Dún Laoghaire. I will deal in greater detail with the marina development proposals for Dún Laoghaire in reply to a later question.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.6 million is provided in the operational programme for tourism for all aspects of marine leisure, including marinas and moorings.  Projects in this area are processed by the Department of Tourism and Trade with the assistance of my Department.  The provision of resources for this vital infrastructure will, of course, be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the current policy review.  I assure the House that I will give my full support to any worth-while plan which emerges.</P>

      <P>Nobody doubts the tremendous potential for development in the marine leisure area and the necessity to marry this with other developments along the coast.  Does the Minister agree that we have a paucity of resources in terms of the provision of the necessary infrastructure and that a dynamic effort will be required to ensure we have facilities which will <Col N="2165" /> attract visitors and maximise the potential in that area?  Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the position at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is tremendous potential in this area and shortly after I was appointed Minister I asked the secretary of my Department to make provision in the Estimates for marine leisure and tourism under a separate subhead.  The Department of the Marine will play a positive role in this area but we will reach the point when we have to pass on responsibility to, for example, the Department of Tourism and Trade which provided grant aid.  I visited several small harbours which have tremendous potential for the development of marine leisure and tourism facilities and I intend to exploit any opportunities.  That is why one of the seminars organised by the Marine Institute focused on marine leisure and tourism and highlighted the potential which exists.  This seminar was held close to Christmas and I was very heartened that more than 350 people attended.  They engaged in worthwhile exchanges of views and put forward many positive ideas to be incorporated in the overall policy document which will be produced when the series of seminars is concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of ensuring the greatest possible co-operation between Departments but I am not in favour of handing over responsibility for the provision of this infrastructure to the Department of Tourism and Trade at a certain stage.  If such developments are not driven by the Department of the Marine, which has responsibilities in this area, they will not be successful. Will the Minister reconsider this aspect and ensure his Department will be the driving force behind the provision of this infrastructure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is very active in this area but many small harbours are the responsibilities of local <Col N="2166" /> authorities, some areas are the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and others are clearly linked to tourism which is the responsibility of the Department of Tourism and Trade, regional tourism boards etc.  My Department has given, and will continue to give, technical assistance and advice to communities and local authorities.  I appeal to Deputies who are members of local authorities to ensure discussions take place at local level on the potential in their areas for the development of marine tourism and leisure.  My Department will not be found wanting in terms of offering advice and providing technical assistance and back-up services for such developments.  There is no point in two Departments doing the same job.  We can bring a project to a certain point and it is then the responsibility of the Department of Tourism and Trade to promote and grant aid it through the operational programmes.  This is not to say we are washing our hands of such developments.  Rather, we highlight their potential through holding seminars and providing technical back-up and assistance to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  If the Deputy has any positive suggestions in this area I will consider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter part of the Minister's answer proves my point.  I am not being political when I say this national resource is totally underdeveloped because many developments have fallen not between two stools but between four or five stools.  This is likely to continue until such time as one Department takes the lead and refuses to take any nonsense from the authorities who have responsibility in this area and who are failing to make the necessary provision to ensure that the potential is developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to overcome some of the difficulties which existed in the past the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, who has responsibility for the islands and the west, has been given the <Col N="2167" /> task of co-ordinating the efforts of various Departments to ensure that particular projects proceed.  This is a positive step forward and the Minister of State has my total support in his efforts. My Department will co-operate with him in those areas to ensure that those developments proceed.</P>
      <P>I want to give one example of a potential development.  In the not too distant past I visited Rossaveal where the Department of the Marine has invested a considerable amount of money in a fishery harbour centre and from where two ferries operate to the Aran Islands.  I was told that 250,000 people used these ferries during the summer.  There is obvious potential in Rossaveal for the development of a small terminal which would provide comfort for people waiting for ferries and where Irish goods, food and beverages can be sold.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, can play an active role in ensuring that such a development takes place and that the fishery harbour does not interfer in any way with the ferry service to the Aran Islands.  The Deputy is correct.  People saw this potential but nothing was done about it until now. That Minister's job will be to see that structures are in place to ensure the potential that exists will continue and be improved.  We will involve ourselves in any other suggestions or proposals and we are actively seeking them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 6 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Following the Government's consideration of the report of the Efficiency Audit Group on its study of the Defence Forces, an implementation group was established to draw up a development plan for the Defence Forces setting out the measures to be undertaken during the first three years of the reform process.  The question of the location of individual units, battalions and their headquarters will be addressed in the context of the proposed reorganisation of the Defence Forces on foot of the report of the implementation group.  I have yet to receive the report of this group, which I understand will be presented to me shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the broader question of the location of units and how this will affect individual barracks, this is a longer term issue which will be progressed gradually during the course of the development plan.  As I have said when the Government established the implementation group, any changes under the reorganisation plan will be undertaken in a planned and sensitive manner.  On the general issue of barrack plans I can only reiterate what I said before, that the Government decision of July 1995 made no provision for the closure of barracks.</P>
      <P>The announcement by the Minister for Finance that he was providing £13 million towards a voluntary early retirement package was made in the context of the expenditure Estimates for 1996. It is my intention to submit to Government definite proposals for such a scheme, shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for deciding to recruit an additional 1,000 people to the Defence Forces.  The Army will appreciate this move and it will raise its morale.</P>
      <P>The main part of my question cannot be answered because the Minister does not yet have the report in his possession. However, will a similar amount of money be allocated in next year's budget to continue the process of retirement from the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased the Government decided to proceed with the voluntary early retirement scheme and this, as I have already said, will be phased over a three to four year period, which will mean an annual commitment to give the moneys required to phase out those who have applied for the scheme.</P>
      <P>As part of the restructuring of the Defence Forces, the numbers will be set at 11,500 people.  There are currently around 12,800 people in the Defence Forces.  While it is important to address the age profile problem, it is also not good enough to remove people without replacing them.  The voluntary early retirement scheme will apply to approximately 2,300 members.  Another 1,000 people will be taken in, which will reduce the serving figure to 11,500 people.  This will also address the age profile problem.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is always difficult to anticipate how many people will apply to a voluntary early retirement scheme.  Indications suggest there is a fair level of interest but we will not know for certain until the details are published.  Those currently serving in the Defence Forces will have an opportunity to assess their situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having decided on a major restructuring of the Defence Forces, the first in any real sense since the foundation of the State, I am anxious that we proceed with the plan, which was initiated with the EAG in 1988 when the idea of looking at various Government Departments came up.  Now that we have <Col N="2170" /> decided on this, it should be done in a positive, constructive and planned way.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the assistance from the military authorities and the representative associations, which have actively played their parts in looking at new structures and in making proposals, suggestions etc.  When I get the report, I will consider it carefully and present it to Government for approval.  If the Government approves the plan, I imagine it will also give a commitment to the ongoing funding of the voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of £13 million has <Col N="2172" /> been provided for building and engineering works under subhead V of the Defence Estimates for 1996.  This provision will be expected on capital projects, £9.0 million, and maintenance projects, £4 million, throughout the Defence Forces, and will be allocated between a wide range of competing projects on a priority basis.  Details of the building programme are being finalised at present.  However, I expect that it will be possible to devote at least £1 million to works at the Curragh on current projects, including refurbishment and upgrading of living accommodation and various other buildings, and on a wide range of maintenance jobs.  In addition, consideration will be given to the possibility of commencing some new projects, such as the upgrading of the ammunition depot, extension of energy conservation measures and further accommodation refurbishment.  The total value of contracts placed for the maintenance and upgrading of facilities at the Curragh between 1987 and 1995 was of the order of £8.37 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The thread running through the Price Waterhouse report is that the Curragh should be earmarked as the location of any new national training centre for the Defence Forces. In that context, will the Minister accept that a figure of £1 million will not make a great impact at the Curragh?  Having visited it a number of times last year, the Minister is only too well aware of the necessity for a major capital injection. It is the ideal location for a training centre.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the figure to be made available this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be smart but, as the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot anticipate the proposals of the implementation group which is considering possible locations for a national training centre which he believes should be sited at the Curragh.  The issues raised by him will be taken into account in the consideration and approval of the <Col N="2173" /> implementation group's plan when presented.  If it is decided to establish a national training centre at a particular location, the necessary funding will have to be made available.  The EAG report was considered by the Government which decided in July last to proceed on a certain basis.  It was not in total agreement with what the EAG had recommended. The implementation group is considering the proposition that a national training centre should be located at the Curragh.  When its report is presented the question of funding will have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the implementation group has not yet reported did not prevent the Minister from making the statement yesterday about recruitment notwithstanding the fact that no one has yet opted to accept the early retirement package.  It appears he jumped the gun in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The crime package announced by the Minister for Justice during the week provides for 50 prison places at the Curragh.  When a similar proposal was made in recent years the Department of Defence had serious reservations about the security of the ammunition depot.  What has changed in the meantime whereby the Department is now happy to agree to this proposal? In this context it will be necessary to make certain alterations.  Will this have any financial implications for the Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the alterations will be financed by the Department of Justice.  In response to the first part of the question, I did not jump the gun.  A sum of £13 million was made available in the budget to offer terms up to 2,300 members of the Defence Forces under the voluntary early retirement scheme and to recruit up to 1,000 personnel over the period of the plan.  It <Col N="2174" /> was necessary to make the implementation group aware of this decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Naval Service currently has a total of seven vessels which are deployed in the most efficient manner on fishery protection duties having regard to current and predicted fishing patterns.  The Naval Service fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>On the question of manpower, recruitment to the Naval Service is kept under continuous review within the Department so as to enable the Naval Service discharge its functions effectively. Fifty recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service in 1995 and the personnel strength of the service is at its highest ever level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new arrangements which came into operation on 1 January 1996, the total number of Spanish fishing vessels allowed in Irish waters remains limited to 93, of which 40 named vessels only are permitted to fish inside the Irish Box.  The entry and exit reporting system, which requires prior notification by all large fishing vessels entering and leaving Irish waters and the Irish Box, is now in operation.  This will enable our air and sea fishery protection services to <Col N="2176" /> closely target illegal access or other illegal fishing activity in Irish waters generally and in the Irish Box.</P>
    <P>The Departments of the Marine and Defence are working closely together to ensure that our sea and land based fishery surveillance resources are deployed efficiently and effectively in implementing the new control and monitoring regime and ensuring that all vessels fishing in Irish waters comply with the rules.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the year, the Naval Service and Air Corps have concentrated their patrol efforts in the Irish Box.  The Naval Service has recorded 107 sightings of fishing vessels in the box, have boarded 26 vessels in the area and have detained two fishing vessels for alleged breaches of fisheries legislation within the Irish Box.  In addition four other fishing vessels have been detained by the Naval Service for alleged breaches of the fisheries legislation in other areas.  The Air Corps has carried out 26 aerial maritime patrols since 1 January 1996.  Air Corps patrols are co-ordinated with the Naval Service patrols and sightings made by the CASA patrols are passed to the Naval Service vessels on patrol for whatever action they deem necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to additional fishery protection surveillance resources, enhancement of the protection capability is planned under the new EU five-year financial aid package for fisheries surveillance. The overall package was agreed at the Fisheries Council in October 1995.  Under the package, Ireland will receive financial support for a significant programme of capital investment in fishery surveillance equipment and in this regard Ireland will attract a higher rate of EU aid than other member states.  Additionally, in recognition of Ireland's very heavy surveillance costs, a sum of £12 million is to be made available to Ireland over the period 1996 to 2000 to fund operational needs of the protection service.  Ireland is the only member state which will receive such support.</P>
    <P>I will be putting a package of specific <Col N="2177" /> spending proposals for 1996 and future years to Government shortly and will commence negotiations with the Commission with the objective of securing the level of capital and operational resources identified as necessary to maximise our fishery surveillance programmes. The question of an additional ship for the Naval Service is being considered as one of these proposals and if a commitment for funding towards an additional ship is secured, then the question of additional recruitment to the Naval Service will obviously have to be reviewed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Commission has to decide on the 1996 programme before the end of March and at that stage I should be in a position to outline to the House the specifics involved, the make-up of the proposals, the level of support and the matching funds which Ireland will have to put up.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Minister's reply was detailed and flowery. Last October, following his negotiations in Brussels, he gave more or less a similar reply but in the meantime very little happened.  There are no additional Navy boats or personnel and, consequently, fishermen are concerned about the lack of protection from Spanish fishermen in our waters.  Does the Minister accept that, because of the concerns of fishermen and in the interest of protecting our fishing stocks, we must spend some of the moneys allocated by the EU immediately, not next month or next year?  Also, will he give a definite date as to when additional personnel and patrol boats will be provided by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that we are lacking in any way in terms of fishery surveillance.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps are doing an exceptionally good job as indicated in the facts and figures I outlined.  In reply to later questions on the Order Paper I will give the Deputy more information on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can over-exaggerate in regard to <Col N="2178" /> this matter and cause an unnecessary scare.  On Monday last the press were invited to Haulbowline to see how the Naval Service operates and co-operates with the Air Corps.  Any Member of the House who wishes to do so is more than welcome to visit Haulbowline.  I would be pleased to make the necessary arrangements for members of the Opposition, particularly spokespersons, who wish to make that visit.</P>
    <P>Some moneys have been spent from the operational funds we received, the only member state to avail of such money.  We received £12 million to be expended over the period 1996 to 2000. We could only start spending that money on 1 January 1996 and the same applies in respect of capital grants.  We have put in place procedures to develop proper plans, with professional advice from the Naval Service, the Air Corps and departmental officials, so that the money is spent wisely and with maximum results.  Much of our efforts leading up to 1 January was expended on putting in place procedures to ensure that the new provision of reporting when entering and exiting the Irish Box operates properly.  That will help considerably in controlling illegal fishing. There is now an obligation on fishermen from all member states to report when entering and exiting the Irish Box.  In addition, as and from 1 January 1998 they will also have to report their catches when leaving the Box.  This will ensure that quotas are adhered to and that other illegal fishing methods are eliminated.</P>
    <P>Officials in the Departments of the Marine and Defence, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and I share the belief that those who abuse or break the law should be dealt with appropriately. We will deal with those who break the laws laid down by the European Union in regard to fishing.  I am not suggesting that people have been adhering to the law, but our legislation, which was passed by the Deputy's party when in Government, is tougher than that of any other member state.  I will ensure it is <Col N="2179" /> rigorously applied to those who insist on breaking the law.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Does the Minister accept the concerns of Irish fishermen about the lack of Spanish activity in the Irish Box?  Our fishermen are concerned that the Spanish are playing a cat and mouse game with them and that as soon as the Navy and the patrolling system is diverted elsewhere there will be a stampede of Spanish fishermen into the Irish box.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Navy and the Department are in a position to deal with such an invasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>To allay any fears, including those of Deputy Browne, I will reiterate the exact position.  As and from 1 January 1996, 93 Spanish vessels are entitled to fish in the Irish Box, but only 40 are entitled to do so at any one time.  Those 40 must be named and report when entering and exiting the box.  In other words, at any one time there should not be more than 40 Spanish vessels in the Irish Box.  The advantage of the new system is that we will know the name and number of each vessel that is entitled to be in the Box and this will be closely monitored by the Air Corps, through the CASA aircraft, who will pass on the information to the Naval Service.  There will not be any relaxation in terms of controlling the Irish Box.  Given the strict controls imposed on people who insist on breaking the law and the manner in which we do our business, those who broke the law in the past will be conscious of the fact that if they wish to do so in the future they will be penalised.</P>

      <P>We recently arrested the owner of a vessel which was just outside the Box, having fished in it.  The vessel was brought to Cobh and the owner brought before the District Court.  We <Col N="2180" /> received a bond for the value of the vessel, the gear and the stock and intend to proceed through the Circuit Court to confiscate the vessel, the stock and the gear.  If we do that often enough people will realise we are serious about upholding our laws and perhaps those who have broken the law in the past will not do so in the future.  Anyone who continually breaks the law should be put out of business.  We do not have any compunction about going to Europe and leading the charge on further penalties to be agreed at European level, but in the meantime we should try to allay the fears generated by exaggeration in some foreign media about what is happening inside the Irish Box.  I assure the Deputy that we are here to protect the fishing industry and Irish fishermen, and we intend doing so.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that 50 recruits have joined the Naval Service.  Can the Minister say how many have retired in the same period?  I would like to pay tribute to them because they are doing an excellent job, but it is widely accepted that they are under-resourced and that there is a need for additional patrol boats to protect our coast.  The Minister may say that a vessel coming into or leaving the Irish Box must indicate that it is doing so. However, it is not as if they are going into a classroom every morning and can be noted.  There is much concern about the Spanish boats, and not just in Ireland.  We have seen what happened elsewhere.  Additional resources are needed.  While we welcome the Minister's determination and the way he has dealt with the question, there is no doubt that the Spanish are expert at finding loopholes in the law.  I hope all the resources sought by the Naval Service will be provided.</P>

The reality is that 1,000 vessels are entitled to fish in Irish waters, and 40 of <Col N="2181" /> them are Spanish.  The Spanish will be dealt with in the same way as any other member state.  The law applies equally to all, and we will deal with whoever breaks the law, whether they are British, Spanish, French or anybody else.  We are not just concentrating on Spanish vessels.</P>

There is much information stored that would surprise many people if they had the opportunity of looking at it.  If the Opposition spokespersons wish to look at the information we will make it available to them.</P>
      <P>I can give the Deputy the information he requires about the Naval Service.  Its strength at the end of November 1995 was 1,064 composed of 135 officers, 919 other ranks and ten cadets.  This strength is the highest ever in the Naval Service.  I do not have the figures relating to retirements, but I can get that information for the Deputy.  We are the only member state to have got money under the EU operational scheme, and if we require more crew to man a new ship or ships we could get assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.  National waters are not currently used as a basis for the compilation of fisheries statistics or stock assessments.  Ireland along with other member states compiles sea fishery statistics in respect of Irish fishing vessels, and landings by foreign vessels into Irish ports, based on the statistical areas defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, commonly known as ICES, which co-ordinates fisheries research in the North-Eastern Atlantic.</P>
      <P>These statistics are used by the EU and ourselves for scientific analysis, stock assessment, setting quotas and managing fisheries.  The ICES areas, however, are designed to reflect the distribution of fisheries resources and do not correspond to national waters.</P>
      <P>The basis, therefore, for firm estimates of total catches in Irish waters in the format sought by the Deputy is not currently available.  I would certainly agree that a greater level of detailed data on fish stocks broken down along the lines suggested is a valid and essential objective.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the details of the 1996 total allowable catches and individual member states' quotas by species for each of the ICES areas, which were set at the December Fisheries Council are due to be officially published in mid February.  I will forward the published details to the Deputy as soon as they are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advised the House in a reply last November of details of landings by Irish vessels in 1994 in respect of all species. <Col N="2183" /> I am arranging for landing statistics 1986-94 to be forwarded to the Deputy. Similar statistics for 1995 are currently being finalised and I will also provide these to the Deputy as soon as they come to hand.  The statistics give the volume and value of landings by Irish vessels into both domestic and foreign ports.  In 1994 the volume of sea fish landed by Irish boats was 291,215 tonnes, valued at over £108 million.</P>
    <P>Details of the volume of landings of each of the member states are available on a monthly basis.  Data relating to the value of landings is not published by the EU and would have to be requested from each member state on an individual basis.  We will endeavour to assist the Deputy with this information requirement.</P>
    <P>There is still an enormous amount of work to be done in compiling a reliable common database in all aspects of EU fisheries including fish stocks, catches, landings and sales.  The situation is improving but there is still a long way to go, particularly at EU level, as the Commission will acknowledge, to ensure that a comprehensive statistical basis on all aspects of the sector is available to fully inform assessments and decisions on future management strategies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  How does he assess the performance of the Marine Institute? What are the main findings of fish conservation? What amount is provided for marine research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very wise decision to set up the Marine Institute which is doing exceptionally valuable work.  It is building up its resources and in the short, medium and long-term will be of particular benefit to Ireland in terms of the development of the marine resource.  I do not have details of the allocation for this year, but I can get the figure for the Deputy from the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much improvement is necessary <Col N="2184" /> regarding the scientific evidence available to us when deciding, particularly at the December Council meeting, on the total allowable catches and, ultimately, the quotas allocated to member states. We are assisted in that work by the Marine Institute.  We also get scientific assistance in the Department of the Marine and from Europe.  There are constant disputes resulting from differences between the scientific evidence produced by the Commission in negotiations and that presented by fishing organisations.  I have made it clear that Ireland sees it as essential that the Commission continue to improve the overall scientific evidence available to it to properly assess the state of the various stocks in EU waters.  This is a little haphazard at the moment although by and large the scientific evidence has been fairly accurate.</P>
    <P>If catches contain only young fish, stocks will be in trouble; one does not need to be a great scientist to understand this.  We are deeply concerned that people will forget about rules and regulations and begin to trawl and catch young fish because of the lack of scientific evidence and the demands on fishermen to make a living.  If this happens the future of the industry will be destroyed.  In this country and at EU level we must improve the scientific evidence available to us so that it will be acceptable to the various organisations and member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is almost impossible to formulate a policy in this area without scientific information?  This has been approached in a haphazard way, to use the Minister's own words, by the various sectors.  This is a serious issue for the fishing industry in Ireland, particularly when scientific information on fishing grounds is of the utmost importance. Will the Minister indicate if this matter is being treated by him with the urgency it deserves?  It is very serious for the future of our fishing industry if undersized fish are being caught in our waters.</P>

      <P>At the December EU fisheries Council meeting I made it clear that conservation will be one of Ireland's priorities during our Presidency of the EU.  We were the first member state to put conservation proposals to the Commission and we are endeavouring to have these agreed at EU level.  We led the debate on conservation and will continue to do so.  We must persuade member states that it is essential to agree at EU level a set of conservation proposals which will ensure the long-term viability of the fishing industry in Europe.  A great deal can be done and people can still make a decent living if we are sensible about the manner in which we protect our stocks, particularly our young and small fish.  We will continue to lead the charge with regard to the availability of accurate information and to seeking agreement on conservation proposals which will ultimately benefit the fishing industry in Ireland, which is our primary concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the operational programme £30 million is being provided for modernisation.  Some £9 million of this will be provided by the EU, £1.5 million from the Exchequer and the balance from the industry.  The programme in this country will be reviewed this year.  The previous Government decided how much money would be allocated to each operational programme. I felt that the fishing programme could have been given more from the total allocation.  I will try to divert money to fisheries, whether to infrastructure or the modernisation of our fleet, and to make provision for young people to enter the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are spending a great deal of money on training young people in the industry but they find it difficult to be in a position to skipper their own trawler or to make a fair living.  I do not <Col N="2186" /> want a situation similar to that of taxi licences whereby young people will be excluded.  To develop the industry we need to attract young people to it.  The training we have provided for them will go to waste and will be availed of by other countries unless we find some mechanism of giving them an opportunity to enter the industry in a big way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Deputy that penalties for serious and persistent breaches of fishing law must be tough, effective and consistent right across Europe.  I am fully committed to getting greater commitment to a system of maximum deterrents in all member states.</P>
      <P>Over recent years Ireland has been forcing the pace on the penalties issue in Europe and we have set the standard for others to follow in having a very tough regime by European standards. Since 1994, a regime of hefty fines and confiscations of nets, catch and boats has been available to Irish Courts. Experience of the current legislation is kept under constant review and I am always prepared to consider the scope for going further.</P>
      <P>Our control and enforcement regime and the related penalties are paying dividends.  Boardings are going up and detentions, proportionately, are going down.  Of itself that demonstrates fishermen are being forced increasingly to accept that illegal fishing is not worth the risk.  This is an important point which indicates that illegal fishing is decreasing because of the penalties those engaged in such fishing will face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However I am not satisfied, frankly, <Col N="2187" /> with the level of penalties and enforcement elsewhere and we will continue to pursue with Spain and other member states as well as the Commission the need for firm action by flag states to put a stop to their boats committing offences in EU waters.  Suspension or withdrawal of licences by the flag authority is an obvious option where offenders are caught repeatedly breaking the law.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, Ireland does not have the legal discretion to impose unilateral bans on other EU fishing vessels with entitlements to fish in our waters. As I said, however, I am keeping the legislative options here under close review.  I will also continue to pursue our long standing agenda to stiffen the resolve of other member states to crack down hard on non-compliance where we demonstrate that their vessels are committing serious offences.  I am determined to safeguard stocks and eliminate illegal fishing in our waters and I expect no less from other member states and the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response.  There is plenty of evidence that there are habitual offenders in this regard.  The Spanish seem to be to the fore among these offenders.  Does the Minister agree that these people are pirates and saboteurs?</P>
      <P>The number of boardings is increasing and that may also reflect an increase in the number of incursions into forbidden territory.  In terms of the size of these vessels and the overall catch, it has been accepted up to now that the number of confiscations and fines imposed is minuscule and does not serve as a deterrent. I ask the Minister to seriously examine the current legislation and in particular the penalties we impose.  We need a common European policy in this regard because in most countries when persons habitually commit, say, motoring offences, their licence is revoked. What I am calling for now is not inconsistent with what is accepted across the European platform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2188" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disagree with the Deputy but I maintain the reason we have increased the number of boardings is the improved surveillance system. The assistance of the Air Corps, through use of the CASA aircraft, together with the technology now in place, ensures that our Naval Service can direct itself to the areas where the maximum amount of fishing is taking place.  Without that assistance and co-ordination we could have 100 naval vessels patrolling our seas but they might not meet the maximum number of fishing vessels.  If we can identify those vessels from the air and through the use of other technology available to us, we can direct surveillance vessels to the exact locations.  We have a great deal of information available to us in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about flag states, be they Spanish, French, etc., and we must not differentiate between one member state and another.  If the law is broken the same penalties will apply to Spanish, French or British vessels. We should not concentrate solely on the Spanish fleets and ignore the actions of others.  The Spanish are not the only people breaking the law.  If a British registered vessel owned by a Spanish company or individual breaks the law, the flag state is responsible for the activities of that vessel.  The EU has an obligation to ensure that, wherever the boat lands its fish, we have the necessary information about it.  Vessels must not be allowed to fly flags of convenience and then break the law by fishing wherever they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal I put forward is that if somebody consistently breaks the law, they should lose their licence.  If a person consistently breaks the law in relation to, say, drink driving, their licence is revoked or if somebody breaks company law they can be put out of business &mdash; we had to change the law to ensure that.  I do not see any difference in this area.  We are fed up having to defend ourselves against allegations from the fishing industry, the media, etc. We do not have anything to defend.  We agree with everybody that if individuals <Col N="2189" /> break the law, they should be dealt with. We can implement laws, provide the necessary resources and put in place surveillance methods but in the final analysis we must have the co-operation of all EU member states in monitoring vessels fishing illegally in the waters of another country which return to a safe haven where they can land small fish or quantities in excess of their entitlements. The Commission must assume its responsibility in this regard by having spot checks in various European ports to ensure that EU law is being adhered to.  I support the Deputy in the views he has expressed because they coincide exactly with my own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept there should be no distinction between offenders in terms of penalties, regardless of the flag they are flying, but is it not true in the case of the evidence available so far, both on illegal fishing and convictions, that more than 80 per cent of the offenders were Spanish?  Also, will the Minister agree that the fishing regulations in Spanish ports are less rigorously enforced than in most other EU countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a problem with the French, Dutch, Spanish or any other country sending inspectors here to ensure that we are adhering to the law at our landing points, provided we can do the same in those countries. The best solution would be for the EU to carry out spot checks, through its own inspectorate, and it is up to each member state, in the interest of EU policy, to allow that.  They should not have to give notice that they intend visiting on a particular day because we all know if that were the case everything would be in order during the inspection.  They should have the authority to carry out inspections without notice to ensure that the law is being adhered to.  That is the only way to resolve this problem which must be approached on an EU level.  I can give a categoric assurance to the House that I will do all I can, particularly during our Presidency, to put in <Col N="2190" /> place proper laws to ensure fair play for everybody and, in particular, conservation proposals which will guarantee the long-term future of the industry.</P>

      <P>Under our law we can confiscate a vessel and the owner has to buy a new one.  However, the crunch comes when the owner applies for a licence for the new vessel.  I have asked that we consider imposing a fine equal to the value of the vessel rather than confiscating it but if we are to succeed in this regard there is little point in adopting a tough stance if it is not agreed at European level.  We must try to persuade the other member states to agree to the revocation of licences or some penalty to be imposed by the flag state on the person who continuously breaks the law.</P>
      <P>In relation to conservation, we have put proposals to the European Commission &mdash; we were the first member state to do so &mdash; and we intend to follow up on those.  I am hopeful we will succeed in getting this item on the agenda of a European Council of Ministers meeting at a stage where we know it will be passed.  As the Deputy knows, there is little point putting forward a proposal if it will be defeated.  It is better to persuade people to one's own point of view so that when the item is eventually on the agenda, it has a fair chance of being passed.  That is what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I have asked the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board to place their proposals for the development of a marina and the installation of facilities for sail training and other harbour leisure users on public display.  All interested parties &mdash; harbour users and local residents alike &mdash; will be invited to view an exhibition of proposals for development, to be mounted in March, and to comment by making submissions to the board.</P>
      <P>Developers will also be invited to look at the proposals and identify ways in which they might participate in the advancement of plans.</P>
      <P>All opportunities for increasing the availability of moorings and making better use of the water space in the harbour will be examined.  The exhibition will display marina possibilities and address how its installation can be advanced. Significant support for the initiative is expected from the Dún Laoghaire combined clubs.</P>
      <P>No proposals exist yet for the development of the Carlisle Pier on its decommissioning from ferry operations. The proposals to be put on display will, however, be seen to be complementary to the future development of the Carlisle Pier.  This is an important continuation of the public consultation process undertaken by the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board when drafting the Development Plan for Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For any development project to succeed in Dún Laoghaire Harbour, it must be advanced with the agreement of harbour users and the local community. This exhibition will allow all interested parties an opportunity at an early stage to have an input into the way in which <Col N="2192" /> a marina and other recreational and leisure facilities are to develop in Dún Laoghaire Harbour in the future.</P>

I am confident that following that process of consultation, it will be possible to proceed with the planned leisure, recreational development for the totality of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen. I have every confidence that she will come to grips in the short-term with the wave of crime gripping the country.  I know she will deliver and from a person of her background I would expect nothing less.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the mentality of a judge handing down concurrent sentences. Each crime must have a penalty and crime must be punished.  Therefore, if someone is to be sentenced to 12 months for crime A, and to 12 months for crime B, he must be sentenced to two years' imprisonment and serve the full term.  The nonsense of remission for good behaviour does not wash with the public &mdash; what else could one expect but good behaviour from a person behind bars?  If they are not of good behaviour, there should be people to ensure they behave themselves.</P>
      <P>I have absolute confidence in the Garda Síochána who are an excellent body of men.  However, time has caught up with them and the force needs to be reorganised.  The modern criminal can move fast, as a matter of fact they are better equipped with modern communications technology than some of the Dáil Deputies.  The gardaí must be equipped to deal with them. I accept it is difficult for a garda to relocate on promotion when he and his family have lived in an area for a number of years but I think it is important that gardaí of whatever rank reside in the area to which they are appointed.  In that way a garda will get to know the people and get a feel for what is happening. If he arrives at work at 9 a.m. and leaves at 6 p.m. he has not the personal contact that former gardaí had in the area.  That point was made to me and I think it worth taking on board. While I do not wish to uproot garda families it should be a condition of appointment from now on that the garda will reside in the area to which he is appointed.</P>

      <P>For months before the budget we were treated to daily reports <Col N="2247" /> of high revenue yields and additional funds being made available to the Minister for Finance.  Naturally it was expected there would be substantial cuts in income tax and PRSI.  It is wrong for the media and politicians to build up those hopes and expectations.  Not only will people be no better off, they will be worse off.  The average taxpayer will benefit by £2 per week but when account is taken of the expected increase in ESB charges, television licence fees, the increases in petrol and cigarettes and so on, a householder who smokes and takes a drink will be no better off.</P>
      <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the budget is the addition of another £1 billion to the national debt.  When the Labour and Fine Gael Parties were in Government in the mid-1980s, they doubled the national debt from £12 billion to £24 billion.  They now have the added distinction of being the first Government to top the £30 billion mark.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach's party political broadcast on the budget in which he spoke about the 45,000 extra jobs created in 1995.  This point was reiterated today by two Members from my constituency.  If that were the case, would we not have expected the creation of 1,300 jobs approximately in Cavan-Monaghan, as our share-out? The facts are different.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach prior to the Christmas recess asking about the increase or decrease in the numbers unemployed from September 1994 to September 1995 and I was told there were an additional 400 people on the live register.  With the claim of an additional 45,000 jobs, one would have to ask questions about equality between areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority should be to provide employment and the Government's performance should be assessed on how it deals with the unemployment problem. <Col N="2248" /> There are a number of successful furniture manufacturing companies in Monaghan as well as firms manufacturing structures for timber framed houses some of which are exported to Japan. These companies found it difficult to get extra staff.  It is regrettable that people are unwilling to forego social welfare benefits and dole to take up indoor jobs offering security and the prospect of continuing employment.  We must examine our social welfare system. The food industry provides much employment in my constituency with up to 2,000 people employed in the food processing and mushroom industries.  It is ironic that the food processing industry should have to fight so hard to survive due to the continuing strength of the punt against sterling.  At present it is IR£1.04 to £1.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated that the food industry was assisted in the budget.  However, the reduction by .44 of 1p per litre of liquid petroleum gas will not offset the additional transport costs incurred by firms exporting to Britain.  The fact that food producers and the representatives of the processing plant met the Minister to fight for the industry's survival gives the lie to the statement that the industry was assisted.</P>
    <P>The development of the mushroom and poultry industries are prime examples of the enterprising spirit in a region with a strong work ethic and that is why it is annoying to hear people will not take up employment.  The poultry industry, which provides employment for young people, was built up without any Government support or assistance. Two housing units were built at a cost of £180,000.  The co-op was set up in the 1950s.  Primary producers did not receive any financial assistance.  Feedstuffs for poultry costs £15 per ton more here than in Britain or the North.  I tabled a question to the Minister and he stated in reply on 24 January that the question of comparative feed costs for <Col N="2249" /> poultry had been addressed in a report on the implementation of the development strategy for the poultry processing sector by the poultry meat forum set up in January 1995 and that the report will be available shortly.  Twelve months have elapsed and the industry is on its knees.  During my time in the private sector if something needed to be done it was done immediately, not 12 months later.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax exemption proposal in regard to farm levies and the removal of the disincentive in the treatment of the value of farm stock under the early retirement scheme.  That is an important contribution.  I also welcome the increase in farmers' flat rate VAT from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent.  The Small Firms Association fought hard for a reduction in corporation tax and this has been reduced from 38 per cent to 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of taxable income.  The mushroom industry, which is not a manufacturing industry, was subjected to 38 per cent corporation tax. Cross-Border workers residing in the South are exempted from paying the 2.25 per cent levy.  Two schoolteachers lived in the same street in a town in my constituency.  One of them was born in Northern Ireland and the other in the South.  Both teach in the North.  One owed the Revenue Commissioners £3,500 in taxation and I arranged for him to meet the Minister for Finance.  I am glad the matter of double taxation has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about setting up Teilifís na Gaeltachta at a cost of £16 million. People in north Monaghan have been unable to get a proper signal for many years.  In December I tabled a question to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht asking him to request RTE to provide a transmitter to improve the signal in the north Monaghan area.</P>
    <P>I received a long reply which stated:</P>
    <P>As a further improvement measure <Col N="2250" /> RTE propose to establish a new transmitter station for North Monaghan. At present possible sites are being assessed.  RTE hopes that, subject to the necessary international coordination, licence and planning permission, the new station for North Monaghan will be on-air during 1997.</P>
    <P>A sum of £16 million is being provided for Teilifís na Gaeltachta while people in many parts of the country do not receive a proper signal and are unable to see the stations that are broadcast already.</P>
    <P>There has been a call for the Taoiseach to set up in the Border area an interdepartmental task force to co-ordinate the various schemes in the area.  At present there are 36 programmes, including the Operational Programme 1994-99; the INTERREG Programme, the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, the International Fund for Ireland Programme, the Leader Programme and the county enterprise boards, which are administered by ten agencies.  I support the call for an interdepartmental task force.  Unless there is co-ordination of these programmes we will not be in a position to gain the maximum benefit from the funding available.  Existing agencies such as the ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency should be given greater responsibility under the Peace Initiative Programme. A co-ordinating body is necessary to administer the £200 million available under the various headings.</P>
    <P>Funding is available for health boards under the Health Programme.  There is very good co-operation between health boards north and south of the Border in maximising the use of hospital space, specialities and so on.  Those health boards are in a better position than most to take advantage of the funding available.</P>
    <P>Professor John Fitzgerald of the Economic and Social Research Institute carried our a review of the Operational <Col N="2251" /> Programme 1989-93 and gave an evaluation of the position as he saw it for 1994-99.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> he stated:</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have given a lot of attention to the need for increased support from the European Community to help lift the standard of living closer to the average Community level.  However, we have given much less thought to what we want the money for and how we propose to spend it.</P>
    <P>Those are very sensible words.  Professor Fitzgerald went on to state:</P>
    <P>But investment in human resources is essentially an act of faith.  In the 1989 to 1993 programme, experience shows that the principal beneficiaries from educational programmes were the middle classes.  While £220 million went to high tech courses at universities, only £72 million was allocated to FÁS's youthreach programmes for early school leavers with no qualifications whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The statement that we have given little thought to what we want the money for and how we propose to spend it is true.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the EU audit service was very critical of expenditure in Border areas and stated there is little sign of cross-Border co-operation.  I would ask that an interdepartmental task force be set up to deal with this matter.  The audit service said that only 39 projects out of 270 benefit from the joint London-Dublin finances.</P>
    <P>A number of groups have been set up on the northern side of the Border to attract industry.  At present there is a great shortage of factory space, particularly in Monaghan, and the IDA claims it has no money to build factories.  It proposes that developers build premises <Col N="2252" /> and in the event of them remaining vacant it will pay the rent for a year, thereafter the developer would pay.  On 24 January last I put down a question to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment asking if he would request the administrators of the various schemes mentioned earlier to refocus their programmes to take into account the identified shortage of factory space necessary to meet demands in Border regions.  In the course of his reply the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>To enable IDA Ireland compete for mobile overseas industry, one of the essential requirements is the availability of good quality, fully serviced industrial sites and buildings in key locations.  Other requirements include quality transport, infrastructural and educational facilities, and proximity to a sizeable population centre.</P>
    <P>A site was secured in Monaghan 20 years ago and a 24,000 square foot advance factory was built about 16 years ago.  The factory was sold in 1987 and has been sold twice since, but not one industrial worker has stood inside its door.  To overcome the problem in this area we must re-examine industrial development.  At that time Monaghan County Council provided a treatment plant close to the factory, on the national road between Monaghan and Armagh, in anticipation of securing industry for the site.  An interdepartmental task force should be considered to oversee the spending of money in this area.  Development funding must be made available to build much-needed factories.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland and Border Counties Trades and Investment Council, whose headquarters is in New York and which was set up by American businessmen with Irish connections representing 360 businesses, operates by way of strategic alliance and networking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2253" /> Members of that council met public representatives and local business people to ascertain if some local factories could network with American factories. Additional factory space, which is difficult to obtain, is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the nutrition advisory group set up by An Bord Glas stated that there was a low level of fruit and vegetable consumption here compared to other EU countries.  That is not only disappointing but disgraceful. Thousands of jobs could be provided in the fruit and vegetable industry.  The continuing substantial increase in the importation of potatoes and many other vegetables which could be produced here is disappointing.  I made that point here on numerous occasions and I recall a Member, a publican representing a Dublin constituency, shouting across the floor of the House that we cannot grow bananas or oranges.  That may be true, but we can grow turnips, beetroot and carrots.</P>
    <P>Following the findings of the advisory group, I asked my local health board to follow up this matter.  This low level of consumption should be brought to the attention of parents.  I asked the Minister for Health if he had consulted the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or An Bord Glas following publication of the report and what were his proposals on the matter.  He said he was undertaking widespread consultation on the report and that it is recommended that four portions of fruit and vegetables should be consumed daily. Much fallow and set-aside land could be used to grow non-subsidised crops.</P>
    <P>I have often raised the issue of an alternative energy programme and I discussed it with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications today.  Under EU regulations Governments are committed to advertise for and provide alternative sources for electricity generation.  A report published last March identified various sources of power including wind power, hydro <Col N="2254" /> power, combined heating power and gas that could be obtained from land-fill sites, all of which are grant aided.  At that time we understood that such sources of energy could be grant aided under the biomass heading.  There is a problem in my county in disposing of farm waste and mushroom waste compost. We visited a plant in England where such waste is used to generate electricity for the national grid.  The EU require that there be competition in this area.  In a question I tabled to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications I asked if cognisance is taken of the need to recycle waste.  I was told that each application is dealt with separately.  Account was not taken of the financial and environmental benefits an area could derive from recycling waste at a time when there is much talk about the benefits of a green environment.</P>
    <P>We have asked that the operational programmes should be refocused to take account of the peace initiative. Recently there has been much talk about the Dublin-Derry route.  When the last tranche of funds was announced and the last programme was drawn up, emphasis was placed on the Dublin-Sligo and Dublin-Belfast routes, not the Dublin, Ardee, Monaghan, Derry route. Since then much pressure has been exerted to ensure that the Dublin-Derry route is developed as the fifth national corridor.  The improvement of that route is strongly supported by the Northern Ireland roads authority, a body which heretofore did not appear to have much interest in it.  It is also supported by various county councils including those in Derry, Dublin, Donegal, Fermanagh and Monaghan, various North-South bodies and the Derry-Donegal cross-Border group.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 October stated that a committee in the village of Collon is pressing for improved road safety measures along that route due to increased traffic on the <Col N="2255" /> road as a result of the peace process. Within a short period of the commencement of the peace initiative there was a 25 per cent increase in the number of vehicles using that route daily.  That increase should be sufficient evidence of the urgent need to improve that route. There has also been a welcome increase in trade, slightly greater north than south of the Border.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak in this debate.  This budget goes a long way towards tackling the fundamental problem in our economy, that of long-term unemployment, the implications and effects of which are much wider than most people credit. Long-term unemployment affects us all. In addition to the obvious effects on the unemployed, it costs money in a range of areas beyond direct transfers to those involved.  If the Opposition are serious not only about tackling long-term unemployment but about the economy as a whole, it should welcome the measures spelt out in the budget by the Minister for Finance.  The Opposition seems to be all over the place.  It disingenuously seeks to portray the budget as one under which the long-term unemployed have won out over middle income earners and the low paid.  If this reflects a genuine concern, it is somewhat late in coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in power taxation relief was deliberately targeted at the well off. Members need not take my word for that.  I refer them to a recent Davy Stockbrokers' report.  I doubt whether Davy's carry a torch for the Labour Party or Democratic Left in this regard. That report states that since the Labour Party came into Government tax reform has been directed disproportionately at the lower paid.  As Deputy Ahern was Minister for Finance in the previous Government, one might expect him to recall those facts.  He probably does, but <Col N="2256" /> it does not suit Fianna Fáil to recall them now as it appears to be playing footsie with the Progressive Democrats in an effort to win the middle class vote. Of course, they are acting on the dangerous assumption that the middle classes do not care about the standard of State-provided education, health care or poverty, which I do not accept.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to this budget we were treated to two policy documents, one from Fianna Fáil and another from the Progressive Democrats.  Fianna Fáil made little attempt to publicise theirs, rightly so, because of its quality.  One of its contentions is that, each year, the Government will have between £200 million and £300 million to play with on budget day.  The difference between those two figures is a substantial sum which, over five years, amounts to £0.5 billion; so much for Fianna Fáil costed programme.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Progressive Democrats have not been bashful about their party proposals.  Indeed, Deputy Michael McDowell's comments have appeared so often in newspapers of late, he must qualify for honorary membership of the National Union of Journalists. The Progressive Democrats appear to have a problem with a growing economy. They contend the Labour Party is responsible for the increased income tax take &mdash; they are right &mdash; we have created jobs to allow people to work, certainly very many more than were achieved by Deputy Desmond O'Malley when in office.</P>
    <P>As is only right, the budget targets the long-term unemployed.  As I already suggested, the existence of a group of people beyond society is not only unfair on them but costly on the remainder of us.  If we do not tackle this problem now, its continuation may lead to second and third generations without any stake in society.  The problem of the culture of social disadvantage is that it crosses generations so that, if remedial action is not taken now, it will impose a <Col N="2257" /> burden on the taxpayer for generations to come.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to this problem is comprehensive, involving public spending &mdash; anathema to both parties in Opposition but beloved of them while in Government.  For example, this year the capitation grant to schools with disadvantaged status will increase by an additional £10 to £75, representing an increase of two-thirds since the Labour Party came to Government and a substantial commitment to tackling the problem of social exclusion at its roots.</P>
    <P>Other measures announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement have been the subject of greater publicity but, as a whole, represent the first real attack on long-term unemployment.  In particular, the proposal to allow the long-term unemployed to retain their child benefit allowance for 13 weeks after taking up employment, with their eligibility to apply for the family income supplement, is very worthwhile.  In addition, the fact that unemployed people who return to the workforce can retain their medical card for a three year period is a particularly meaningful strategy since its loss proved a major deterrent to those wanting to return to the labour market.  I expect this proposal to be very successful.</P>
    <P>There is also the scheme to provide an £80 subsidy to employers who recruit long-term unemployed people.  While welcoming this initiative, we need to be extremely careful to ensure that proper guidelines are in place to safeguard against its resulting in the displacement of existing workers by long-term unemployed people &mdash; on the back of a subsidy such as this &mdash; with the potential of benefiting employers only.</P>
    <P>Another good move has been dropping the publicised intention to reduce dole in the case of 18 and 19 year olds, something I opposed publicly at the time, which would have been a very <Col N="2258" /> regressive move.  These young unemployed people, very often with poor, if any, educational qualifications, represent a particularly vulnerable group which has been ignored for many years. New strategies will have to be devised to cater for them.  While some budgetary provisions for them are welcome, they are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The notion of reducing dole payments to force young people into further education or the labour force is outrageous. Here, I make the point that anybody in receipt of unemployment assistance at the age of 18 or 19 will already have been means-tested.  Indeed, many people argue that current unemployment rates are below the breadline. Therefore, I do not know how it can be argued that inflicting greater poverty on people will force them to remain in education.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what happens to 18 and 19 year olds who are unemployed, perhaps with a pass level leaving certificate. We should be endeavouring to retain them within the education system, providing them with opportunities to participate in further training, PLC courses and the like.  The reality for them is that, if they choose to do nothing and remain at home, they will be paid unemployment assistance whereas if they choose to participate in a PLC course, the State offers them no financial support.  Despite that present huge disincentive to them to remain in education, very large numbers do manage to survive without any independent income, and to whom great credit is due.  I understand there are at present approximately 17,000 or 18,000 people participating in such PLC courses without any State subvention.</P>
    <P>That scenario contrasts starkly with that of others who attain honours level leaving certificates, admitting them to third-level education, whether in universities, Dublin Institute of Technologys or regional technical colleges where fees have been abolished.  While welcoming <Col N="2259" /> that, it appears that we concentrate on one end of the market, the high achievers, those with a number of honours in their leaving certificate, to the detriment of those other lower educational achievers.  This differentiation should be given greater attention in future because it constitutes another problem.</P>
    <P>The irony is that what the Opposition finds particularly difficult to stomach in this budget is that, in tackling long-term unemployment and improving social welfare, these measures have been achieved while maintaining control over public expenditure and promoting social solidarity.  Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made great play here of the elimination of the current budget deficit in 1994.  He may recall that that had been a great surprise to him as well as to others.  Yet, the proposed current budget deficit this year is forecast to be 0.2 per cent.  Since Deputy Bertie Ahern must be fully aware that budget figures are always properly cautious, it should come as no great surprise to anybody if the current account transpires to be in surplus at the end of this year.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement is 2 per cent only, well below what had been expected by most commentators, falling well within the Maastricht criteria.</P>
    <P>The real beneficiaries of this prudent, economic management of our economy are the middle income groups.  Mortgage interest rates are lower than for many years although the Opposition has engaged in churlish attempts to suggest that responsibility for that lies beyond the State.  While interest rates reflect wider development, the markets are capable of forming a judgment on our economy alone if they felt the need to so do.</P>
    <P>The positive reaction to Government bonds in the aftermath of the budget indicates the confidence of the market in the strength of our economy.  I very <Col N="2260" /> much doubt the market would feel the same if a Government introduced a package along the lines of the Progressive Democrats' policy document published a few weeks ago.  Markets tend to recognise political posturing when they see it.  Another fact which the Opposition conveniently ignore is that interest rates this year are more likely to fall than to increase, given the difficulties in the German economy.  It has also criticised the introduction of free third level fees.  Let them explain that to the middle income group.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a few omissions in the budget but first I shall refer to taxation. We have heard much criticism from Opposition Deputies of the ongoing changes in relief on mortgage interest.  I would remind the House, regrettably no Opposition Deputies are present but perhaps they are listening in their offices, that this measure and the timetable for its implementation was introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  It seems Opposition Deputies are suffering from collective amnesia.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare side there is much to commend this budget.  The general increases are well above the projected rate of inflation.  There have been further increases in child benefit and in family income supplement.  The popular back-to-work allowance scheme has been substantially increased.  There are also increased payments for anyone who has twins and improvements in the back-to-school footwear and clothing allowances.  An important and farreaching improvement is the opening up of the free schemes to State pensioners and low income private pensioners.  I welcome this because we are all aware of many elderly people who have paid into occupational pension funds for many years.  When they retire they are in receipt of a small pension and may not qualify for a State pension.  Frequently those people were worse off than those in receipt of social welfare <Col N="2261" /> pensions because they could not avail of any of the free schemes.  This is a welcome change as it allows pensioners, whose pension from work does not exceed the rate of contributory old age pension plus £30, to avail of the free schemes.  This is a good start and I would wish to see it extended.</P>
    <P>Another welcome development is the increase of 1,000 places in VTOS courses.  In welcoming this extension I ask those in charge of the VTOS to actively market these places because in the past they have not always been taken up.  Many people are unaware of the facility to return to education while retaining their social welfare benefits. Community employment workers have been given proper status as workers and this is recognised for the first time by the introduction of the class A stamp for them.</P>
    <P>There are some omissions from the budget.  No research funding is provided for examining taxation and social welfare systems in a different light.  The world is changing rapidly.  There are new roles, particularly for women, new family arrangements and new working arrangements.  Our tax and social welfare systems do not reflect those roles adequately.  We have to examine new ways of doing things because the existing systems do not always serve modern needs.  In that respect I welcome the proposals by the Conference of Religious of Ireland which are balanced, reasonable and well thought through. Its idea is to develop a basic income system. Such a system would have much merit.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Campaign on Dangers of Ecstasy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the authorities seized a vast quantity of ecstasy tablets. The seizures represented a big increase <Col N="2262" /> on previous figures yet the evidence suggests, and the Garda readily acknowledge, that the seizures represent only a tiny fraction of the quantity that is coming in.  Any young person will tell you that ecstasy is readily available on the streets and in many pubs and clubs.  The fact that vast quantities of the drug are being consumed by young people indicates a totally misguided and inaccurate perception of the dangers involved.  Doctors sometimes compare ecstasy to Russian roulette because while a person could take ecstasy regularly, without any side effects, each tablet has the potential to kill.</P>
      <P>The dangers of ecstasy are fivefold. First, many ecstasy tablets are of dubious quality and contain other substances. This can amount to a lethal cocktail in some cases.  Second, even ecstasy tablets which are pure can kill because it is not possible to predict how any one individual will react to the drug at any given time.  Third, apart from those victims who die immediately, many suffer from long-term kidney failure, heart disease and serious depression.  Fourth, increasingly ecstasy is becoming a gateway drug to heroin but of more concern is the increasingly common practice of people taking heroin to come down from an ecstasy high. In many cases this leads to a chronic heroin addiction.  This practice is being actively encouraged by drug dealers who are now selling ecstasy tablets and heroin made up in one pack.  Fifth, unlike heroin, ecstasy is relatively inexpensive. Tablets can cost from as little as £10 to £15 each and the price is coming down regularly.  While medical evidence against ecstasy is steadily growing, more and more young people are dicing with death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An article in a recent issue of <i>Communiqué</i>, the journal of Garda management, put the number of ecstasy-related deaths last year at 14.  In Scotland in 1993 three teenagers died in an evening as a result of taking ecstasy tablets, yet still the perception among young people <Col N="2263" /> of all social classes is that E is a harmless drug.  It is this misconception which makes ecstasy so deadly.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health has a clear responsibility to change that perception and to do so urgently, even more so given the growing use of ecstasy as a bridge drug to heroin.  Merely distributing leaflets about ecstasy will not achieve this.  There is an obvious need for a campaign similar to that mounted against AIDS some years ago.  It should include use of television, billboards and local radio stations.  Such campaigns have been effective in the past and are the only means by which successful campaigns against ecstasy abuse can be mounted.  I urge the Minister to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this important issue. We frequently hear in the media or anecdotally of tragic human stories involving drug misuse.  I welcome this opportunity to outline the action taken by my Department to promote awareness of the dangers of using ecstasy and other drugs.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department is currently planning a drug misuse prevention mass media campaign. The aim of the campaign is to alert and educate people on the dangers of all drug misuse including ecstasy.</P>
      <P>For many years the health promotion unit has been actively working to increase awareness of the dangers of drug abuse and it provides a series of booklets and leaflets for health professionals and the public.  An information leaflet specifically on ecstasy has been produced and has been widely distributed. Information on ecstasy is also included in the booklets and leaflets for professionals and parents.  In addition, the unit has developed a range of educational and health promotion materials especially targeted at young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of accurate information about the effects of drug taking is an <Col N="2264" /> essential component of any drug education programme.  However, effective and extensive education about drugs also entails examining attitudes, promoting decision-making skills and building self-esteem.  A crucial part of the process is using appropriate settings where young people will be receptive to health messages and where lifeskills such as assertiveness and high self esteem can be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Young people are subject to many influences and the school provides an ideal setting for primary drug prevention strategies.  An important element of the fight against drug abuse is the substance abuse prevention programme entitled &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; which is now available to all second level schools.  This programme was developed by the health promotion unit and the psychological service of the Department of Education with assistance from the Mater Dei counselling service.  It is a comprehensive drug education programme, the aim of which is to enable students develop their ability to take charge of their mental health and to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives.  The programme materials include information on ecstasy and its effects.  The programme has been introduced in approximately 50 per cent of schools and in-service training and wider dissemination are continuing.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit also runs a community-based training programme with the health boards which looks at the extent of the drug problem at local level and seeks to provide local answers. The programme entitled &ldquo;Drugs Questions Local Answers&rdquo; involves a multi-sectoral approach for health-education professionals and others interested in drug related problems which they meet in their work.  The unit also supports pilot projects which aim to facilitate communities in tackling their own drug prevention issues.</P>
    <P>A further programme is the parent education on alcohol, drugs and family <Col N="2265" /> communication which was developed by the health promotion unit in conjunction with the Cork social and health education project of the Southern Health Board.  This project recognises that young people and their parents must be provided with assistance to help them deal with the problems posed by licit and illicit drugs.  A course has been developed which focuses not only on drugs but also on the skills and personal attributes that help people deal with the drug problem.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be interested to learn that the health promotion unit partners the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and the National Youth Council of Ireland in the national youth health programme. This programme develops materials and provides training in health issues specific to young people in the non-formal education sector.  The issues addressed include drug education and prevention.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that there are no easy solutions to the problem of drug misuse, I am confident a multi-sectoral approach at national and community level, together with a mass media awareness campaign, can bring positive results.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Advertising by Solicitors.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A three quarter page advertisement in the Golden Pages advises people &ldquo;Make Sure You Receive The Compensation You Deserve&rdquo;.  The advertisement is covered with the words &ldquo;accidents, claims and compensation&rdquo;.  As if further encouragement was needed, it gives a freephone number which can be used by members of the public who think they might be able to make a quick buck out of a public liability system, the bill for which has spiralled out of control in recent years.  This is not the only such advertisement in the directory; there are <Col N="2266" /> approximately 20 pages of advertisements which have been placed by rogue solicitors.</P>
      <P>In many cases people are more than entitled to receive compensation for injuries suffered and those responsible should be made pay up.  A responsible solicitor is capable of weeding out frivolous claims from genuine ones but unfortunately the number of frivolous claims is increasing on a yearly basis. Instead of weeding out claims a minority of solicitors latch on to frivolous claims and use the slogan &ldquo;No Win, No Fee&rdquo;, and when they win the cases there is a substantial fee to be paid.  By placing these advertisements in the Golden Pages and local newspapers and distributing fliers these solicitors encourage members of the public to seek a lotto style compensation.  In poor working class housing estates members of the legal profession have rented shops where they have erected obscene advertisements which scream &ldquo;accidents, claims and compensation&rdquo;.  This dangerous culture must be controlled and I ask the Minister to take my proposals on board.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be familiar with the type of claims to which I have referred while my colleague on Dublin Corporation will be aware of some of the more recent claims against that local authority. A claim for compensation by a person who slips on mashed potato can have the effect of closing down 60 Dublin Corporation senior citizen meals on wheels complexes.  A person who feels he is inconvenienced while his home is being refurbished and redecorated by Dublin Corporation at great expense to the State must blame someone and all too often it is the local authority. It is estimated that in 1995 Dublin Corporation spent 100 times more money on public liability claims than on architectural preservation measures. The number of claims has increased threefold in the past three years.  Yet few would argue there has been a comparable increase in the number of genuine accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of this increase can be attributed <Col N="2267" /> to the absence of strict guidelines on advertising by solicitors.  When the Law Society held a referendum on the issue of advertising it was on the firm understanding that guidelines would be introduced to regulate this area.  These guidelines were due to be published before Christmas but there is still no sign of action.</P>
    <P>Many solicitors share the concern expressed by me and others about the proliferation of ambulance chasing advertising which undermines the standing of their profession.  If the Law Society does not move swiftly to regulate advertising by its members then the Government will have to introduce statutory regulations. Local authorities and taxpayers cannot continue to bear the burden of the mounting public liability bill.  At the end of the day, we all have to pay the price for the greed of a few in terms of reduced local authority services such as centres for the elderly and playgrounds for the children.  This House must send a clear message to the Law Society that if it is not prepared to regulate advertising by its members as a matter of urgency then legislators will have to do this job for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this important issue on the Adjournment as it gives me an opportunity to outline the position.  It is a matter for the Law Society, under section 71 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, as amended by section 69 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, to make regulations with respect to the professional practice, conduct and discipline of solicitors. The Oireachtas has, under the Solicitors Acts, delegated to the society the responsibility to maintain a high general standard of professional conduct.  Professional practice with regard to advertising by solicitors is regulated under the Solicitors Advertising Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 344 of 1988).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New statutory guidelines were inserted in section 71 of the Solicitors <Col N="2268" /> Act, 1954, by section 69 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, which allows the Law Society to prohibit advertising which is likely to bring the solicitors' profession into disrepute, or is in bad taste, or reflects unfavourably on other solicitors, or contains an express or implied asssertion by a solicitor that he has specialist knowledge in any area of law or practice superior to other solicitors, or is false or misleading in any respect, comprises or includes unsolicited approaches to any person with a view to obtaining instructions in any legal matter, or is contrary to public policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is satisfied that these statutory guidelines for any advertising regulations that the society may make are fully adequate to ensure that a high standard of professional conduct in the solicitors' profession is observed with regard to the advertising of solicitors' services.  While the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, provides no time limit within which any advertising regulations which the society may make would be introduced, I understand the society is currently reviewing the existing regulations with a view to establishing tighter controls on touting for business by solicitors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Veronica Guerin wrote a story in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> suggesting that the British tour operator, Thomson's Holidays, which recently entered the Irish market has taken nearly 2,000 bookings but has not yet completed a deal with an airline.  I am not able to verify that report, although I know Thomson's Holidays has just entered the Irish market and there is a large scale price war between this new entrant and members of the existing travel trade.  Increased competition is a good thing but according to this story thousands of people have booked holidays that Thomson's has not <Col N="2269" /> publicly guaranteed.  The article has not stated publicly on which airline these passengers are booked either.  The Minister should reassure those affected and tell them they have nothing to worry about because his Department has checked out the matter, has used all the armoury available to him, such as bonding and consumer and travel trade protection, and is satisfied that Thomson's has guaranteed that the customers will get what they booked.</P>
      <P>I welcome increased competition.  The price war in the travel industry is a matter for the private sector and there is no reason firms should not compete strongly.  However, the same rules must apply to new entrants on the market.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister will tell me, but if he only quotes the regulations and does not reassure the customers that his Department has received guarantees from Thomson's that their holidays are safe, his reply will not be of much use.  I am informed that over 2,000 people have booked holidays with Thomson's.  Has the Department received guarantees from this operator that customers who paid for holidays will get what they expected when they booked them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my function to regulate capacity or competition in the holiday market nor do I have statutory powers to do so.  My role derives from the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982. This was enacted to deal with the issue to which the Deputy refers and it has worked well since its inception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the 1980s, the collapse of travel agents and tour operatores was an all too frequent occurrence and there was no protection for people on holiday or those about to travel.  The 1982 legislation has produced an important and highly successful mechanism whereby holidaymakers' interests and money are protected.  It has enhanced consumer <Col N="2270" /> confidence in the industry and fostered stability within the travel industry.</P>
    <P>All tour operators and travel agents operating here are licensed by my Department under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, every single one of them must obtain a new licence once a year.  When renewing their licence their financial and organisational structure is reviewed. This is to establish as far as possible that they have the wherewithal to operate in this very competitive market and are likely to sustain their businesses through periods of slack trading or intense competition. I assure the Deputy that, where my Department is dissatisfied with the level of investment in the firm, its operating costs or its cashflow projections, we require the operators to take corrective measures before the licence is renewed.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, the real security for the general public comes from the 1982 Act.  All licensed operators are required, before their licences are granted, to take out a bond to cover a set percentage of their projected turnover for the duration of the licence.  This bond can be in the form of an insurance policy, a bank guarantee or a straightforward cash deposit with my Department.</P>
    <P>The bond cannot be touched by the operator and is administered solely by my Department.  It is there for two clear purposes; first, it is used to repatriate travellers who find themselves abroad on holiday in the event of the collapse of the tour operator or travel agent with whom they have done business, second, it is used to refund full payments or deposits on holidays made by the travelling public in the event of a collapse.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that licences expire annually and an analysis of the financial performance of licensees is undertaken by my Department once a year, business failures can sometimes occur.  In a further effort to avert this, the financial performance and business projections of <Col N="2271" /> tour operators and travel agents are monitored during the year.  Should it become evident that the turnover of the firm in question is running ahead of projections made when the licence was issued, and hence, that the bond may not be adequate to cover the cost of potential collapses, the firm is required to increase its level of bonding with immediate effect.</P>
    <P>A further safeguard to ensure the interests of the public are protected lies in the existence of a special travellers' protection fund which was also provided for by the 1982 Act.</P>
    <P>This fund is available to my Department solely for the purposes of supplementing the resources that become available from the operators' bond when an operator ceases trading.  I am pleased to say that there is now over £4 million in the fund, safely invested by the State as an added protection to the travelling public.  Indeed, such was the buoyancy of the fund that as early as 1986, it was possible to suspend the collection of moneys for it which has been achieved by a levy on holiday sales.  I am glad that since then, the bonding mechanism has been so successful in dealing with the small number of collapses in the travel industry that it has not been necessary to renew this levy.</P>
    <P>As regards the current media coverage of the likely activity in the travel industry this year, I draw the Deputy's attention to further more recent legislation. The Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act, 1995, strengthens the position of consumers' interests as regards false advertising and inadequate information on holidays being purchased. The Act gives an important role to the Director of Consumer Affairs in ensuring that the travelling public get what they pay for and are treated honestly and fairly when buying holiday packages.</P>
    <P>The potential problem in the travel industry which has been reported in the <Col N="2272" /> media of late is the risk of a mismatch of capacity and demand for the coming season on the part of the industry itself. The controls exercised by my Department are not intended to intervene in normal market activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the representatives of the Irish Travel Agents Association when I met them recently, developments in the industry will be carefully monitored as the season progresses. A price war may have temporary benefits for a small number of consumers but would be in no one's interests in the medium to long-term, neither the consumer or the trade.  I appeal to the industry itself to act in a responsible and realistic way when planning capacity for the coming season. This is of paramount importance to ensure the stability of its own sector and individual businesses as well as being in the interests of the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  As the Minister of State is aware, it concerns the shabby and dishonourable treatment meted out by the Army authorities and political figures from many quarters to the 37 Irish soldiers who went to Rwanda in August 1994 where they worked in Goma on the Rwanda-Zaire border for 16 weeks.  Prior to their departure they were addressed by the then Chief of Staff, A.J. Wall, who informed them that they would receive specific duty allowances and various other emoluments.  They returned home prior to Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In autumn 1994 everyone in the country was exercised by the plight of the people of Rwanda.  When she visited the <Col N="2273" /> country the President praised the soldiers concerned for the work they were doing in a spirit of generosity and humanity.  That work would not have been done by many others.  All the agencies with whom they worked paid tribute to their diligence and commitment. All over Ireland school children and people of all ages made donations to help in whatever way they could.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period the rate of progress in processing this matter has been unsatisfactory.  Anything received had to be wrested from the Army authorities and was given grudgingly.  I understand that the needs of the officers who served with GOAL have been met. I am not making their case, but that of the enlisted personnel whom I have met on a number of occasions during the past four weeks.  I know what I am talking about.  They are incensed that the Army authorities have been inactive in the payment of any moneys due.</P>
    <P>When its suits us to do so, we pay due tribute to our Army personnel.  When he spoke in this House President Clinton lauded and paid a moving tribute to our troops for the work they have done in foreign fields.  We all appreciate their efforts.  The dilatory way in which their grievances have been addressed in this instance &mdash; they are seeking the payment in full of the moneys they were promised prior to departure &mdash; reflects badly on the Army authorities and political figures responsible in Dáil Éireann.  I appeal to the Minister of State, in his capacity as Government Chief Whip, to see that justice is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the subject raised by the Deputy as it provides me with an opportunity to set the record straight in relation to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that the Government announced on 20 July 1994 that special leave, with pay, would be arranged for public servants wishing to assist Irish aid agencies in the humanitarian relief operation being undertaken <Col N="2274" /> in the Rwanda/Zaire area at that time. There was an immediate and exemplary response from military personnel to requests for volunteers to serve with aid agencies and I take this opportunity to commend and thank them again for the contribution they have made to helping the innocent victims of conflict.</P>
    <P>Following requests for the despatch of Irish troops to aid the famine relief efforts, the Government also agreed to send a small Defence Forces contingent as part of the Irish aid effort.  The Irish Rwanda Support Group consisted of 37 personnel who were based in Goma. The personnel in question, while seconded to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, in a civilian capacity, were operating <i>de facto</i> as a military unit under the control of an Irish officer in charge and were at all times subject to military law.</P>
    <P>Personnel of the Defence Forces serving overseas in a military capacity receive allowances in respect of such service.  Therefore, when the fact that the personnel seconded to the UNHCR were operating as a military unit was raised under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force, and bearing in mind the combination of difficult working conditions, daily personal risk and the degree of separation from their families, officials of my Department proposed that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment should be made to those personnel.  Under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme agreed with both PDF Representative Associations, such discussions are confidential and it would be inappropriate, therefore, to go into the details of the offer made.  However, the original offer, which was generous, was subsequently increased following discussions with the representative association and was accepted by RACO in March of last year.  The offers made have been discussed at the Defence Forces Conciliation Council with PDFORRA on many occasions and have been rejected by the association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2275" /> An imprest of £1,000 against the overseas allowance was paid to each member of the IRSG before they departed.</P>
    <P>The personnel who served with the UNHCR did so in a voluntary capacity, as did all the other public servants such as doctors, nurses and engineers who used their skills to assist in the aid effort in Rwanda.  None of those people, including personnel of the PDF who <Col N="2276" /> served with non-governmental agencies such as Concern and Goal, has either sought or been offered any form of compensatory payment by the Government. The <i>ex-gratia</i> payment which was offered to PDFORRA on behalf of the UNHCR personnel continues to be available to them should they wish to accept it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 February 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 14, 17 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1995 the Government announced its response to the report of the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG) on its review of the Defence Forces and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.</P>
      <P>The Government indicated that they accepted the general thrust of the EAG report.  It was also stated that an Implementation Group would be established to draw up detailed and fully costed proposals to implement a first phase plan covering the next three years.  This plan would be based on the reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Forces on the basis of a three brigade structure with a total manpower level of 11,500.  The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 30 November 1995 was 12,770 made up as follows: Army, 10,608; Air Corps, 1,098; Naval Service, 1,064.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the Efficiency Audit Group was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile.  At present the average age of Permanent Defence <Col N="2195" /> Force personnel is as follows: Privates, 33 years; Non-Commissioned Officers, 36 years; Commissioned Officers, 38 years.</P>
    <P>The required reduction in the manpower level to 11,500 over the three years of the first phase plan and the lowering of the age profile, will be achieved by means of a voluntary early retirement scheme combined with a programme of recruitment of young personnel.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance which I attach to the lowering of the age profile, I propose that there will be an intake of 1,000 recruits over the next three years, commencing in 1996.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is a considerable degree of interest in a voluntary early retirement scheme among personnel of the Permanent Defence Force.  The terms of such a scheme, which have yet to be finalised, will be commensurate with those offered in other areas of the public service.  In the circumstances, it is difficult to predict how many personnel will wish to avail of the scheme.  I am confident, however, that it will make a significant contribution to the reduction in strength of 1,300 personnel which was decided last year by the Government.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that all those wishing to avail of voluntary early retirement scheme will be dealt with in a humane and equitable fashion having regard to their needs and those of the organisation.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.  The Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance, including assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs, and they will continue to do so.  It is not the practice for operational and security reasons to give details of the number of such requests.</P>
      <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such requests.  Recent Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a Joint Task Force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, will also increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.  The question of whether additional resources are required will be kept under review as these measures are implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Salmon Review Group was finalised in 1987.  It is an admirable report in many respects, and is ambitious and wide-ranging in its analysis and findings in relation to salmon management policy issues at the time.</P>
      <P>However, some eight years on, and given international and national developments since 1987, I decided last year that our national salmon policy needed to be comprehensively revisited.  I also concluded that policy objectives should be informed by a thorough review of salmon management strategies backed up by full consultation with concerned interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, as I have previously advised the House, I established the Salmon Management Task Force last October.  The remit is to develop practical proposals for the management of wild salmon stocks, in line with stated policy objectives on conservation and development and with full regard for the interest of those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation be they commercial or angling.  In developing their proposals, I asked the task force to widely consult all relevant interest groups and to take account of a number of policy guidelines on salmon management as follows: the primary goal is the conservation of wild salmon stocks; account to be taken of the international <Col N="2203" /> pressure on salmon stocks; fishing effort for wild salmon to be managed on a catchment basis; the sustainable development of the salmon resource to be grounded in the support of local communities and fishermen; the salmon regulations to make sense and be respected by the majority of the industry to be effective; a new spirit of partnership with coastal communities to manage the wild salmon resources effectively.</P>
    <P>The task force under the chairmanship of Professor Noel Wilkins UCG, has been working intensively since inception and as part of its work has held a series of regional public consultations around the country.  Those debates, I understand, have been frank, open and have made a positive contribution to the developing thinking of the task force.</P>
    <P>In that context I have received a copy of the IFO's submission to the task force setting out the organisation's proposals for the future management of salmon stocks.  The IFO submission is being carefully considered by the task force, with over 200 other submissions received to date.  The level and intensity of interest reflected in the large number of submissions and views expressed confirms my own belief that the time was ripe for a renewed national debate on future directions for salmon policy.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving, and publishing, the task force report at an early date (probably end March) and subsequently, to a full and constructive debate on its findings and conclusion in this House and indeed elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 32 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>During the month of January, 28 Spanish fishing vessels notified the Fishery Protection Services under entry-exit Rules that they were entering the Irish Box for the purpose of carrying out fishing activities.  No Spanish registered vessels were found to be operating illegally in the Irish Box during January.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Department of the Marine are working intensively together to ensure that all our fishery surveillance resources are deployed to maximum effect and that all vessels fishing in Irish waters comply with the requirements of the new regime which is now in place in relation to access to our waters.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps have carried out intensive surveillance activity with particular emphasis on the Irish Box during January.  We will continue to maintain this level of activity, backed up by the Department's Sea Fisheries Control Inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty-two foreign vessels were boarded at sea during January and 21 of the boardings took place in the Irish Box.  Up to yesterday six vessels had been detained, one of which was detained in the Irish Box.  The vessel detained in the Box was UK registered <Col N="2205" /> (and Spanish owned).  Of the five detentions outside the Box, two were Spanish registered vessels, two were UK registered vessels and one French registered vessel.  Four of the detained vessels have been charged, charges are proposed in a fifth case and the remaining vessel was released with a written warning.</P>
    <P>None of the alleged offences detected during January related to failure to observe the entry-exit reporting requirements.  The one alleged offence detected inside the Irish Box related to having illegal net attachments and under recording of monkfish.</P>
    <P>In the general matter of prosecutions Deputies will appreciate that in the normal course of events, a number of months elapse between the detention of a fishing vessel and the resultant court proceedings.  I am advised that court proceedings in relation to the four boats detained so far this year are scheduled to take place around the middle of March.  The imposition of penalties is of course a matter for the court having considered the evidence presented by both sides and guided by the maximum penalties prescribed under the fisheries Acts.</P>
    <P>Pending the hearing of those cases Deputies will also appreciate the need for circumspection in any statement to guard against prejudicing the proceedings.</P>
    <P>As I said, our air, sea and landbased fishery protection services are fully committed to monitoring and enforcement of fishing regulations and potentially illegal activity is being closely targeted on land and at sea.  I intend to build on the track record to date to ensure that existing resources are applied effectively to the considerable task of conservation and protection and to the enhancement of that capability as necessary, with maximum EU financial support.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 30, 76 and 78 together.  I am advised that Cork Dockyard Ltd. has not sold the shipbuilding capability, the shipbuilding halls or the slipway at the dockyard at Cobh, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the agreement for sale of the Verolme Cork Dockyard to Cork Dockyard Ltd., included an anti-asset stripping clause.  The Minister for Finance and ICC Bank hold responsibility for the contract of sale.  Enforcement of the anti-asset stripping clause is a matter between ICC and the company.</P>
      <P>I am advised that Cork Dockyard Ltd. has a permanent staff of three at present.  The company does not directly employ any blue collar workforce. Instead all the ship repair work is carried out by subcontractors using casual labour.  I am further advised that over the past six months the average number of people employed at the dockyard on ship repair (including the aforementioned contract casual staff and the permanent staff) amounted to approximately 50.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 35 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I fully share the concerns of Deputies that for EU fisheries controls to be fully enforced and effective, the total commitment of all member states and fishing industries is absolutely essential.  In line with the fundamental EU principles of sovereignty and subsidiarity, national authorities have the responsibility to police their respective waters and amounts being fished, the subsequent landings of fish into their ports and the application of appropriate penalties where breaches of the law occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been at the forefront in Europe in pressing for tighter controls for better enforcement and for the resources with which to carry out the <Col N="2208" /> job of monitoring and enforcing the Common Fisheries Policy throughout EU waters.</P>
    <P>For our part, as I have outlined on many occasions before, Ireland has strict controls in place to ensure that both the Irish fleet and foreign fishing vessels operating in Irish waters comply fully with the EU fishing regulations. The fisheries protection services detain all vessels suspected of being in breach of fishing regulations and prosecutions follow in every appropriate case.</P>
    <P>The penalties under Irish law for fishery infringements in our waters are among the toughest in Europe, and reflect our determination to safeguard fish stocks and eliminate illegal fishing activity in our waters.  I make no apology for expecting no less a demonstrable commitment from other member states in monitoring and enforcing EU law in all respects.</P>
    <P>The Commission has explicity endorsed the need for strong control measures by all member states as vital to the CFP's credibility and efficiency. The Commision's own inspectorate service has been augmented in recent years and has the task of inspecting the national inspection services as opposed to fishing industries.</P>
    <P>I will be continuing to press for much closer scrutiny of the fishing activities of all EU fishing vessels backed up by greater use of new technology, notably satellites, which will substantially help to tighten controls and close loopholes. And, while accepting that the Commission inspectorate is independent of member states, we have frequently raised with the Commission the need for its inspectors to undertake targeted investigations in key geographical areas of concern.  My officials are also discussing with Spanish ministry officials the scope for enhanced high level and technical liaison including a programme of regular inspection visits to each others ports and information exchange. I have taken up this issue with my Spanish colleague both in bilateral discussions and exchange of letters.  I am <Col N="2209" /> hopeful that those initiatives will pay dividends in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Much of what appeared recently in the <i>News of the World</i> was hyped up and highly inaccurate particularly on specific events and operations in Irish ports and Irish waters.  The detailed briefing held in Haulbowline last Monday was designed to set the record straight and I hope laid to rest many of the misconceptions doing the rounds. Where there are substantiated genuine concerns and claims expressed about illegal fishing activity it is my priority to have them followed up and addressed. Allegations about landings of undersized fish are a case in point.</P>
    <P>I caution that suspicions about landings of undersized fish from Irish waters into ports in Spain or other member states are difficult to substantiate or prove.  Such landings can be and are often claimed to be, from the Bay of Biscay or the Mediterranean where there are as yet no rules about minimum fish landing sizes.  But Deputies can rest assured that I and the Department will continue to vigorously follow up specific concerns.</P>

      <P>The range of services normally provided by a coastguard services encompasses such diverse activities as fishery protection, search and rescue, provision of lights and navigational aids, drugs interdiction, revenue control, pollution prevention and control and the provision of coastal radio services.</P>
      <P>Various models and structures have evolved over time in different parts of the world in regard to the delivery of these services to the public ranging from the American Coastguard (which is quasi-military and also supervises shipconstruction and certification of seamen) to the British Coastguard which is largely unchanged from what operated here before independence and mainly consists of a static coast-watch.  The way in which the various services in question are provided here developed historically having regard to the particular circumstances that prevailed here and to the requirements and resources available. The present arrangements work well and I have no plans to set up a coastguard service as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that following the publication of the Doherty report in February 1990 the arrangements for marine search and rescue as well as the coast radio services were reorganised under a new executive office established in the Department of the Marine viz. the Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES).  The fact that fisheries protection is the responsibility of the Naval Service, assisted by the Air Corps, (both of which are under military <Col N="2211" /> control) would pose difficulties in integrating these services in a Coastguard as would the fact that the Commissioners of Irish Lights are an all-Ireland body.</P>
    <P>I should also remind the Deputy that it is the intention that Naval Service officers should be authorised to arrest suspected drug smugglers at sea without having a Garda present as part of newly co-ordinated arrangements for dealing with the illicit drugs trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned following the most recent revelations regarding the Beaufort Dyke dumpsite in the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The revelations to which the Deputy refers are contained in a report of a survey carried out recently by the Scottish Office around the dumpsite.</P>
      <P>The report, which is currently being studied in my Department, confirms that some dumpings of munitions have taken place outside the confines of the charted dumpsite.  This finding represents a very serious situation and, given gas pipe laying works in the area, might explain the source of phosphorous devices which were beached on the Scottish and Donegal coasts during the period October to December 1995.</P>
      <P>On the other hand it is reassuring to note from the findings that analysis of edible fish and shellfish showed no significant pollution and that analysis of seabed sediment showed that the levels of heavy metals were similar to the safe levels elsewhere around the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State and I have been in contact with the UK authorities since last October on <Col N="2212" /> the issue of munitions dumpsites in waters around Ireland.  We have sought an urgent meeting with Earl Howe, UK Under Secretary of State for Defence and Lord Lindsay, Minister for Agriculture and the Environment at the Scottish Office, to discuss the report findings and to develop mechanisms for the review, monitoring and management of the Beaufort Dyke and all other munitions dumpsites which exist in waters around Ireland.  We expect that this meeting will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>On the international front we are seeking to have this issue and that of all other munitions dumpsites addressed through the Quality Status Report (QSR) mechanism of the OSPAR Commission. I welcome the intervention of the EU Commissioner for the Environment who has indicated that she intends to raise with the UK Government whether there are issues in relation to the dumpsites which could be solved at community or international level.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that we are taking every possible action to get a satisfactory resolution to these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1994, including those which relate to the forfeiture of vessels, catch and gear, were discussed <Col N="2213" /> at considerable length in the House during the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Indeed the Official Report shows that the Deputies' party colleagues, Deputies Clohessy and Molloy, made substantial and knowledgable contributions to that debate on the First and Second Readings and on Committee Stage.  However, I am glad to have this opportunity to again outline the relevant provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>The section in question extends the circumstances in which the courts may order the confiscation of a fishing vessel. Such confiscation can arise on conviction for serious breaches of fisheries law which threaten stock conservation. It is of course a matter for the courts to determine and impose penalties available under the law.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of a provision in the 1983 Fisheries Act, which provided for the confiscation of a vessel convicted of repeat offences, it became apparent that after conviction on a first offence, owners frequently transferred ownership of the vessel to another company. In those circumstances, each conviction becomes a first conviction and the threat of forfeiture could be avoided.</P>
    <P>To address this loophole, the 1994 Fisheries (Amendment) Act places upon the owner of a vessel the onus of proving that the transfer of ownership is bona fide, at arms length and that the sale price reflects the going market rate for the vessel.</P>
    <P>The courts may, also, under the 1994 Act order a vessel to be confiscated on a first conviction if the offence is considered to have been a particularly grave violation of conservation measures.</P>
    <P>For ease of reference and for the Deputies' information, I have annexed to my reply a copy of the relevant section of the Act which deals with the matters which the Deputies have raised.</P>
    <P>12.&mdash;Section 234 of the Principal Act (inserted by the Act of 1978) is hereby amended by the substitution <Col N="2214" /> of the following subsection for subsection (1) thereof:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;234.&mdash;(1) Where a sea fisheries protection officer has in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 233 detained a boat and the persons on board the boat at a port, any sea fisheries protection officer shall, as soon as may be, bring the master of the boat and any other persons on board the boat against whom proceedings for an offence under a provision of Chapter II or III of this Part have been or are about to be instituted before a judge of the District Court and thereupon the said judge shall, if he is satisfied that such proceedings have been or are about to be instituted against the master and those other persons or any one or more of them, by order directed to a sea fisheries protection officer require such officer to detain at a specified port in the State the boat and each person (including the master) aforesaid in respect of whom he is so satisfied until such proceedings have been adjudicated upon by a judge of the District Court under section 8 or 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, or under section 2 (2) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978, or otherwise in the exercise of his summary jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>13.&mdash;Section 302 of the Principal Act (inserted by the Act of 1962) is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;Act&rdquo; for &ldquo;Part&rdquo; in each place that it occurs therein.</P>
    <P>14.&mdash;The Act of 1978 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 4 (as amended by section 7 of the Act of 1983) thereof:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  Where on conviction on indictment of a person for an offence under any of the following sections of the Principal Act, that is to say, sections 221, 222, 222A, <Col N="2215" /> 222B, 222C, 223, 223A, 224B, 226 and 227&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that offence (or that offence when taken in conjunction with any other offence or offences, under any of those sections, of which that person has been so convicted) is considered by the Court to constitute a serious abuse of measures prescribed and adopted under section 223A (1) (inserted by section 4 of the Act of 1983), or</P>
    <P>(b) (i)  the conviction is a second or subsequent conviction on indictment for an offence under any of those sections committed on board the same boat within three years of the date of the commission of the previous offence and whether the person convicted is or is not the same person on each occasion, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the boat is at the time of the commission of the offence owned or part owned by a person who was the owner or part owner of the boat on the occasion of the commission of any of the previous offences referred to in subparagraph (i),</P>
    <P>the Court may, at its discretion, in addition to any other fines and forfeitures to which the person may be liable, order the boat to be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the conviction is a second or subsequent conviction on indictment for an offence under one of the sections mentioned in subsection (1) committed on board the same boat and the date of the second or subsequent offence is within three years of the date of commission of the previous offence and whether the person convicted is or is not the same person on each occasion, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> (b)  the ownership has changed between the commission of the first and second or subsequent offences, then if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the change of ownership has been effected in order to evade a possible forfeiture of the boat upon a subsequent conviction the onus shall be on the owner to furnish to the Court sufficient evidence showing, to the satisfaction of the Court, that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  neither the legal or beneficial ownership of nor any legal or beneficial interest in the boat remains with the owner or a part owner of the boat at the time of the previous offence, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the sale, assignment or transfer of the boat was done in good faith and for valuable consideration reflecting the market price or worth of the boat for the period in which it was acquired,</P>
    <P>and where such evidence fails to satisfy the Court,</P>
    <P>the Court may, at its discretion, in addition to any other fines and forfeitures to which the person may be liable, order the boat to be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section owner and part owner shall include a person who, although no longer the legal owner or part owner, handles, manages or carries on the operation of the boat.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Court shall not order any boat to be forfeited pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) if a person claiming to be the owner of or otherwise interested in it applies to be heard before the Court to show cause why the order should not be made.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Court in ordering the <Col N="2217" /> forfeiture of a boat under this section may, if a mortgagee or chargeholder satisfies the Court that he granted a mortgage or charge in respect of the boat to its owner or owners in good faith, order that the boat be sold and that some or all of the proceeds be paid to the mortgagee or chargeholder to meet the outstanding mortgage or charge.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>15.&mdash;(1)  In this section &ldquo;officer to whom this section applies&rdquo; means an officer of the Minister, a sea fisheries protection officer, an authorised person or an authorised officer as defined for the purposes of any section of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person who assaults an officer to whom this section applies in the exercise of any power conferred on that officer by any provision of the Principal Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's concerns about the shipment of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium through the Irish Sea.  The implications of an accident or collision need no spelling out by me to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2218" /> At present such shipments are governed by the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuels known as the INF Code. I, consider the INF Code to be deficient in a number of very important respects and I wish to inform the Deputy and the House of the steps which I am undertaking to have them changed.</P>
    <P>Nuclear materials&mdash;the most lethal of all cargoes&mdash;are, at present, effectively exempt from the normal rules governing dangerous cargoes.  Many of the basic requirements for dangerous cargoes are noticeably absent from the INF Code.  There is no requirement to plan the route or to notify coastal states; no requirement to carry out hazard evaluations of the materials being transported and of the flasks in which they are contained; there are inadequate arrangements in the event of accident for emergency response, for recovery of materials lost or sunk or for a liability regime for compensation and salvage.</P>
    <P>At the International Maritime Organisations' (IMO) Assembly in London last November, my colleague at the Department, Minister of State Gilmore, secured agreement from representatives of the 152 countries in the IMO to adopt Ireland's Resolution governing the shipment of nuclear materials and to strengthen the INF Code.  Ireland's Resolution seeks to address the deficiencies in the INF Code.  The Resolution instructs the IMO's Marine Safety Committee (MSC) and the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to consider extending the INF Code to include the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash; route planning</P>
    <P>&mdash; notification to the coastal state</P>
    <P>&mdash; marking of flasks</P>
    <P>&mdash; protection and salvage plans in the event of emergencies</P>
    <P>&mdash; the designation of sensitive areas in which nuclear shipments must take place.</P>
    <P>The deputy chief surveyor of the Department's Marine Survey Office represents Ireland on both the MSC and <Col N="2219" /> the MEPC.  These Committees have been instructed to thoroughly examine Ireland's proposal and to report to the next Assembly of the IMO next year with recommendations as to how the INF Code should be strengthened. Work has commenced on this issue and I am confident that procedures to strengthen the code will have been considered and prepared in time for the next IMO Assembly.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also be preparing a detailed presentation of the IMO which will strengthen its case for implementation of new standards governing the shipment of nuclear materials.  Ireland's case will be presented at a special meeting of the IMO in March.  The meeting was called by the Secretary General of the IMO, following concerns expressed by Ireland and supported by other IMO countries about deficiencies in the current rules governing the carriage of nuclear materials (INF Code).  Ireland will be represented at this meeting by the Deputy Chief Surveyor, Marine Surveyor and the Radiological Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On 13 September 1995 an EU Directive concerning reporting arrangements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods (HAZMAT) came into force.  Ireland has requested that the definition of &ldquo;dangerous goods&rdquo; be expanded to include substances coming under the INF code.  The EU Commission has agreed to put Ireland's proposal on the agenda of the next committee meeting and to submit a proposal for amending the Directive to incorporate the Code to Parliament and Council.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware it is Government policy not to admit entry to an Irish port of any vessel carrying nuclear materials and in line with that policy the Harbours Bill, 1995, makes provision for harbour-masters to prohibit the entry into harbours of the following:</P>
    <P>(i)  a nuclear powered ship, vehicle or other conveyance;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2220" /> (ii)  a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying one or more nuclear weapons;</P>
    <P>(iii)  a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying nuclear material (within the meaning of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991).</P>
    <P>I assure the House I will continue to pursue every avenue to ensure that a tough new code governing the shipment of nuclear materials is put in place.</P>

      <P>A policy decision was taken in 1994 that an element of excess tonnage necessary to fully meet the replacement capacity required in the introduction of new larger pelagic tankboats into the fleet could, exceptionally, be withdrawn from the polyvalent sector which includes whitefish and dryhold pelagic vessels.</P>
      <P>An estimated 1,000 tonnes has been withdrawn over the period, largely from the whitefish sector.  The final outstanding balance, amounting to a further 1,000 tonnes, must be similarly withdrawn before the end of this year, which will complete this programme.  This figure would represent a tiny proportion of the total white fish fleet.</P>
      <P>All future new proposals for the introduction of pelagic tank boats will require 100 per cent of the replacement capacity to be withdrawn from the existing pelagic tank boat fleet.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The security, financial and otherwise, of the elderly is of the utmost importance and this is reflected, so far as my <Col N="2236" /> Department is concerned, in the various benefits available and the ongoing improvements which are implemented in response to developing circumstances and emerging needs.</P>
    <P>The question of what more might be done to enhance the security of the elderly in the light of the recent attacks has been under consideration for some time.  My decision to establish the task force was in response to an ICTU pre budget submission seeking assistance for elderly people with regard to their security.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, provided for tax relief for the purchase cost of alarm systems for persons aged 65 and over living alone. Following consultation with my colleagues I announced in this House on Wednesday 24 January that I was setting up a task force to examine the situation of those, mainly people receiving social welfare pensions, who could not avail of the tax allowance initiative because their incomes were below the relevant tax exemption limits.</P>
    <P>Advertisements inviting submissions to the task force were placed in the national newspapers on Sunday and Monday last and will be carried in the main provincial newspapers this week. In all, the advertisement will appear in 35 newspapers at a cost of approximately £22,924.90.  This and other costs arising will be met out of my Department's allocation for administration.</P>
    <P>The task force members are drawn from various Government Departments and organisations who have experience and expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>The members of the task force and the bodies they represent are as follows:</P>
    <P>Chairman: Mr. Edmond Sullivan, Director General, Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Members: Mr. David Thompson, President, Irish Security Industry Association; Mr. Tom Geraghty, SIPTU; Mr. Jim Quigley, President, Muintir Na Tíre; Mr. Bryan Barry, Assistant General Secretary, Irish <Col N="2237" /> Farmer's Association; Mr. Bob Carroll, National Council for the Elderly; Mr. Benny Kevitt, Director, Long-term Schemes, Department of Social Welfare; Ms Rosheen Callender, Special Adviser to Minister for Social Welfare; Ms Sylda Langford, Principal, Planning Unit, Department of Social Welfare; Mr. Noel Usher, Principal, Department of Health; Mr. Pat Folan, Principal, Department of Justice; Mr. Joe Dowling, Chief Superintendent, Garda Síochána; Mr. Patrick Ruane, Principal, Department of Environment; Mr. Joe Mooney, Principal, Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Newspaper Industry was set up by me following a comprehensive debate on the newspaper industry which took place in the wake of the publication of the Competition Authority's report on newspapers.  Following receipt of that report, I had discussions with interested parties and I hosted a forum on the newspaper industry.  The commission was given wide-ranging terms of reference which required broad membership from many walks of life.  In drawing up membership, I invited nominations from representative organisations within the industry including IBEC, ICTU, NUJ, NNI and PNI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in order that the commission would be representative of as many facets of Irish life as possible, I nominated persons with special insights from advertising, economics, business and media law, communications, business, culture and equality sectors.  I received representations from <Col N="2238" /> interested persons, groups and organisations to be nominated to the commission. It was not possible to accommodate everyone's wishes.  The commission is independent and consists of 20 members under the distinguished chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay.  I am confident that the membership of the commission is balanced and I look forward to its important report.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission has received submissions so far from a large number of organisations and individuals including the National Federation of Retail Newsagents.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the difficulties being faced by winter fatteners as a result of the fall in market prices since the end of last year.  This fall has been mainly due to difficulties on the British market and the uncertainty created in the market by the reductions in export refunds during last autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have impressed on the EU Commission and my colleagues at the Council of Ministers the need for a restoration of the refunds to levels which would underpin the income situation of beef producers and in particular, winter fatteners.  The matter was again raised <Col N="2240" /> at the beef management committee meeting last week but the Commission refused to propose an increase in refunds, citing the strong market prices in the EU overall, as one of the reasons for not doing so.  I will continue to press the Commission to take action before the current licences, taken out at the higher level of refunds, expire at the end of next month.  These licences are in adequate supply to cover normal exports until the end of February.  I should point out that no export licences have been taken out by beef traders here at the current lower rates.</P>
    <P>The payment of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium, which is worth up to £60 per steer slaughtered this spring and £14 million in total, will be an important factor in maintaining returns to winter fatteners.  Nonetheless, an increase in refunds &mdash; or equivalent action &mdash; is urgently needed and I will continue to press our case on this until it is achieved.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to this House in answer to Question No. 627 on 23 January 1996, final decisions have yet to be made on the programme of protection works to be undertaken by the Department of the Marine this year.</P>
      <P>I would like, however, to advise the House of the emerging position for 1996.  There is a commitment from 1995 to complete works in respect of Killiney, County Dublin and Ardgroom, County Cork.  These works involve, in the case of Killiney, the stabilisation of the cliff and the consequent protection of the roadway and rail line; the works at Ardgroom are aimed at protecting the roadway at Pallas Pier, which is used by the local aquaculture industry.  The total cost of these works to the Marine vote in 1996 is likely to be in the region of £107,000.  The Vote provision is £760,000 which translates into a total expenditure of over £1 million, given a 25 per cent contribution from non-Exchequer sources.</P>
      <P>A major programme of works at Bray, County Wicklow, is due to commence this year, to be completed over 2 or 3 years.  The overall cost of the project, which involves securing the promenade and a section of the harbour wall, will be about £2.3 million.</P>
      <P>Whether other minor works can be engaged in this year, in addition to those planned for Killiney, Ardgroom and Bray, will depend on the final cost of these projects, particularly the programme of works at Bray.</P>
