    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The events surrounding this year's marching season in Northern Ireland underline the fundamental need for dialogue and negotiation to prevail in all circumstances of disagreement.  That need is further underscored by the undoubted damage done by these events to inter-community relations and to confidence in political authority and the political process itself.  Further harm was done to perceptions regarding the impartial enforcement of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was very understandable Nationalist anger over Orange Order actions like the blocking of roads.  The <Col N="5" /> consequent polarising effects on inter-community relations are deepened further by business boycotts.  Such actions impact negatively not only on the economic well-being of both communities but also on the climate for healing and reconciliation which is so essential to eventual agreement.  The Government is totally opposed to actions of this kind and we urge everyone with an influence on the situation to bring an end to the boycotts.</P>
    <P>There was also extensive intimidation and damage to property, including Catholic churches and schools, Orange halls and Protestant places of worship, as well as further punishment beatings. Worse still, a number of people were murdered in apparently sectarian, internecine and punishment shootings.  The Government deplores and condemns all these manifestations of violence and expresses its sympathy with all those who suffered as a result.</P>
    <P>Recently there have been protests outside Catholic Churches in Ballymena, Bushmills and Dervock.  Any interference with people's rights to religious worship is profoundly wrong and contrary to the most fundamental of civil and religious liberties.</P>
    <P>In regard to the issue of parades and marches in Northern Ireland, the Government's approach is that, as a general guiding principle, a balance has to be struck between the rights of the different parties involved.  We respect the right of people to commemorate and celebrate the historic and socio-cultural traditions of their community, including by means of parades and marches, but we also believe that these should not be routed through areas where they are unwelcome.  In addition, we believe that reasonable account should be taken of shifts in the distribution of population when settling on routes.  We consider that the detailed application of these general principles in regard to particular parades and specific locations is best settled by agreement between representatives of those directly involved.  We also believe that there must be an over-riding respect for the rule of law.  Our <Col N="6" /> views on these matters were conveyed to the British Government in the leadup to this year's marching season and in the aftermath of the events this summer, particularly during July.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the British Government has recently established an Independent Review of Parades and Marches.  The Irish Government will make a submission to this review.  It is our firm view that everything must be done to avoid a repetition next year of the damaging events which characterised the 1996 marching season.  We hope that the review will lead to an approach on the parades issue which will command widespread acceptance and confidence in both communities. That would need to embrace the question of policing and, in particular, how policing arrangements could be made more acceptable to the Nationalist community.  Ultimately I believe, however, that a satisfactory resolution lies in the achievement of a widely accepted political settlement which will provide the context for policing structures that will draw support and recruitment from across the full spectrum of people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Following the events of the summer months, it is more important than ever that the primacy of politics is firmly reestablished. In that regard, the multi-party talks, which resumed on 9 September, are vitally important in two respects: first, they are the only viable means in existence to build a new political way forward through agreement: and, second, they are centrally important to the restoration of public confidence in the political process, which was badly shaken by the events surrounding this year's marching season combined with the continuance of the IRA campaign of violence.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the position before the talks recommenced, the Government set out energetically from 9 September to inject much needed momentum and substance into the talks process.  Since the resumption, we have sought, in close co-operation with the British Government, to achieve that <Col N="7" /> result.  An intensive series of meetings have been held with a view to securing the earliest possible launch of substantive negotiations in the three strands and a parallel serious handling of the decommissioning issue.  We are continuing with these intensive efforts.</P>
    <P>Since the talks resumed, the Government has been represented by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Ministers for Justice and Social Welfare, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, the Attorney General and senior officials from the relevant Departments.  As I previously indicated in this House, I do not propose to report on every meeting and contact I or my officials have in the Northern Ireland context.  However, since I last reported to the House on developments in Northern Ireland, the Government has also been in frequent contact with the British Government and the other talks participants in addition to contacts in the talks themselves.</P>
    <P>I was in telephone contact with the British Prime Minister on Monday last and the Government meetings with the SDLP and the Alliance Party on 4 and 5 September respectively were most useful.  On the multi-party talks issue, both parties emphasised strongly the need for a speedy resolution of agenda-based issues and for real movement into and within substantive negotiations.  We exchanged views on how best these aims might be met, recognising the importance of agreement on how decommissioning is to be addressed and thereby ensuring that this issue does not derail, or detract from, the wider negotiations. For its part, the Government undertook to the parties to do everything possible to give renewed impetus and focus to the multi-party talks and it has done so.</P>
    <P>Regarding contacts with the Unionist and loyalist parties, the Government has long recognised the importance of a deeper and wider process of exchange. The Government formally invited the UDP and PUP on 28 August to discuss <Col N="8" /> directly with it the concerns raised publicly by some members of the loyalist leadership.  They did not take up that particular invitation, but there have been frequent contacts, within the talks process and outside it since then and these conversations have proved useful.</P>
    <P>Channels of communication at the level of officials with Sinn Féin remain open.  These channels are being kept open specifically and solely with a view to securing a restoration of the IRA ceasefire.  That remains a fundamental requirement for Sinn Féin participation in the multi-party talks, which provide that party with an unparalleled opportunity to makes its own distinctive contribution to the shaping of a new agreed way forward.</P>
    <P>The political process, as embodied in large measure by the multi-party talks, is the only viable and meaningful option available for the advancement of political aims.  Sinn Féin states that the party wants to play its part in the shaping of a new political settlement, agreed within a workable timeframe.  The opportunity for it to do that is now there, making a restoration of the IRA ceasefire a matter of such compelling logic that its inevitability, sooner or later, can scarcely be in doubt.  It would be much better for everybody, including the republican movement and those it represents or who support it, if it acted on that logic now, or in the very short-term. Whether that will happen, I cannot say.</P>
    <P>The murder in Belfast last week, and more particularly the discovery of a massive amount of explosives and other bomb-making equipment in Britain on Monday, undermine the position of those who have been advocating a peace strategy.  Furthermore, they do not inspire confidence that the Sinn Féin leadership is successfully persuading republicans to move in a peaceful direction. The sooner the republican movement as a whole realise the futility of violence, the better.  It can best demonstrate that by calling a renewed and credible ceasefire, which, this time, will hold in all circumstances.  In this context, it may be helpful to Members if I <Col N="9" /> placed on the record of the House the full content of what I said in the United States in regard to the possibility and desirability of an IRA ceasefire, as distinct from what I was represented as saying.  My remarks were made in answer to a question by a journalist who raised the matter.  The question was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Did President Clinton give you any indication that there was any reason to believe that an IRA cease-fire was being contemplated, say between now and Christmas &mdash; in the short-term future?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My reply was as follows:</P>
    <P>Not in those terms &mdash; he did not. But there is a possibility of an IRA ceasefire, I suppose.  I have been asked questions about IRA ceasefires before and I have said that I felt that the logical time for them to have a ceasefire was before the talks started on the 10th of June, because these talks were what they had been demanding for years; &ldquo;Peace Talks Now&rdquo; was their slogan.  But perhaps it takes time for them to make decisions and judgments and, perhaps, they are coming to a point where they will be able to make a decision and have a ceasefire.  It's important that the ceasefire be credible, to be one that people understand will endure, and to use the term they use themselves &mdash;&ldquo;will hold in all circumstances&rdquo;.  That was the term they used themselves and I underline the word <i>all.</i> That is important; that people understand that; that everybody understands that. But I think there is a recognition that really fruitful negotiations can only occur in an atmosphere of absence of threat of violence; that there will be an undue defensiveness and an undue unwillingness to compromise as long as the threat of violence remains. Thus, I would hope &mdash; I have some reason to hope &mdash; that that's being understood now, and that the conditions may exist in which a ceasefire could be called.  But I have no way of <Col N="10" /> being in any way categorical about that.</P>
    <P>Members will note I did not use the words `optimism' or `optimistic' about the prospects for an IRA ceasefire.  The strongest word I used was `hope', and I still hope that those in the republican movement who favour a peace strategy can prevail.  Encouragement and hope must be given to those in Ireland and America who wish to see peaceful conditions restored and some space must be made for the creation of a peaceful atmosphere for negotiations.  Subsequently, in my address to Congress.  I called for an IRA ceasefire, and in a further interview with journalists I said that Martin McGuinness said true negotiations can only take place in an atmosphere of genuine peace.</P>
    <P>In addition to a meeting with President Clinton accompanied by Vice President Gore and Secretary of State Christopher, I also met Speaker Gingrich, Senator Bob Dole, the nominee of the Republican Party for the US Presidency, and the Friends of Ireland <i>ad hoc</i> committee in Congress.  I addressed the Joint Houses of Congress and a dinner hosted by the Irish Ambassador which was attended by leading members of the US Congress and Administration.</P>
    <P>The passage in my address, to which Deputy Ahern's Question No. 17 refers, aimed to emphasise not only our rejection of coercion but also the balanced approach that the Irish Government is pursuing.  A balanced approach is not only right but is the only practical approach because the consent of both communities is necessary for viable long-term political arrangements for Northern Ireland.  What I said is entirely consistent with the Government's adherence to the principles of agreement and consent as set out in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Joint Declaration, the Joint Framework Document and the Realities, Requirements and Principles document of the forum. The unity of the people of Ireland by agreement and consent is a valid and legitimate aspiration to pursue by <Col N="11" /> democratic means.  I set out my position on this matter in some detail in this House on 5 June and in my speech in Finglas on 30 April last, in which I also outlined the Government's position on North-South co-operation as set out in detail in the Joint Framework Document. It is an inescapable truth, however, that if we are to have stable political arrangements for the governance of Northern Ireland, widespread cross-community agreement is an absolute necessity.</P>
    <P>My official visit to the US also enabled me as President in office of the European Council to discuss EU-US relations.  In my meeting with President Clinton we discussed the implementation of the New Transatlantic Agenda agreed between the EU and the US in Madrid in December 1995 and the recently enacted Helms-Burton and D'Amato legislation.</P>
    <P>We agreed that implementation of the New Transatlantic Agenda was a priority.  Both sides are working together over a wide range of areas with a view to being able to report achievements at the next EU-US summit and I am confident that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>The President outlined the background to the enactment of the Helms-Burton and D'Amato legislation and I outlined the Union's concern at the extraterritorial effect of this legislation. It is clear that an amicable resolution of this issue is in the interests of both the EU and the US.  President Clinton also gave me his assessment of the state of the Middle East peace process.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible to have an EU-US summit in early December to enable us to review progress on the implementation of the New Transatlantic Agenda and to discuss other issues of mutual concern.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach still stand over his statement in the United States that he believes a cease-fire and an agreement are inevitable in the short-term?  If so, on what solid ground does he base his belief?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated previously, the logic behind the peace process adopted by the republican movement some time ago requires that there is another ceasefire.  In particular, I draw the House's attention to remarks by a senior representative of Sinn Féin, Mr. Martin McGuinness, who stated that he believed &mdash; he is correct &mdash; that real negotiations can take place only in the absence of violence.  It was to those remarks in particular I was referring when I said it is important people understand that the ceasefire will hold in all circumstances.  Based on Mr. McGuinness's remarks, I believe it is recognised that fruitful negotiations can occur only in an atmosphere in which the threat of violence is absent and that there will be an undue defensiveness and unwillingness to compromise as long as the threat of violence remains. Thus, because Mr. McGuinness of Sinn Féin recognised the reality some days previously, I have reason to hope that is being understood now and that the conditions may exist in which a ceasefire could be called.  However, I cannot be categoric about that.  That is the basis on which I made my statement.</P>
      <P>As I said previously in the House, the republican movement cannot exist in a limbo between peace and war.  It is not possible to have serious negotiations, with some people giving their best and making maximum concessions, as long as the threat or actuality of war continues. If the republican movement is pursuing a peace process the Rubicon, the dividing line between peace and war, must be definitively crossed by it. It must ensure that everybody in the movement, from the most senior person to the most recently recruited individual in any arm of the movement, understands why the Rubicon between peace and war is being crossed and the analysis, which shows that there can be security for one only if there is security for all, on which that is founded.  Therefore, we must seek agreement through all-party negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe an IRA cease-fire is inevitable because the principal <Col N="13" /> demands made as a condition for a ceasefire and the pursuit of the peace process have been met.  One of the republican movement's principal demands prior to and during the original ceasefire was that peace talks should take place immediately.  Those peace talks were delivered in form and in substance on 10 June.  There is a clear indication from the British and Irish Governments that they intend to ensure that the negotiations are substantial and deal with all relevant matters.  The two Governments are working together intensively to ensure that is delivered.  The republican movement was also concerned that a single issue, such as decommissioning, should not be allowed to block discussion or progress on other issues.  That is not happening and will not happen.</P>
    <P>If one analyses the matter objectively, one will note that the conditions the republican movement sets for the introduction of the ceasefire have been met. Peace talks were delivered on 10 June, substantive negotiations are being delivered and no single issue is being allowed block progress on other issues.  If one objectively analyses the words used by Sinn Féin spokespersons in the past and recently, one will note that the conditions for a ceasefire have been met.  If the republican movement is committed to the peace process, as I believe it is, a ceasefire is inevitable.</P>

      <P>We face many serious difficulties, but as was often the case in history, it is when one faces the greatest difficulties and when challenges appear greatest that one can often find the greatest ground for hope and forward movement.  It is only when people truly understand the gravity of the alternative <Col N="14" />&mdash; namely, failure &mdash; that they are willing to make the compromises necessary to achieve success in the current talks.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that Monday's discovery of bombs and explosives in London makes a mockery of the comments he made in the United States?  Does he further accept that, far from contemplating a ceasefire, the IRA is determined to continue its campaign of murder and terror?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fortunate those bombs did not reach their target. The amount of explosive involved could have inflicted bombs on London equivalent to five times the magnitude of those ignited to such devastating effect in Manchester.  That the IRA was at such an advanced stage in delivering those bombs to their targets undermines the efforts of all who have been seeking an IRA ceasefire.</P>
      <P>That the basis on which the Government has continued to keep open channels of communication at official level to Sinn Féin is that we believe there are people within that party who seek a complete ceasefire that will hold in all circumstances.  If we did not believe there were grounds for hope for an IRA ceasefire, there would not be any ground for keeping open the channels of communication to Sinn Féin.  The sole reason for maintaining those channels was the hope that they would contribute to a ceasefire.  If I thought there was no such hope and what I said in Washington was wrong then, within the terms of the Government's approach to the channels of communication to Sinn Féin, I would be obliged to close them. The only reason I keep them open is that there is hope for a ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That hope is diminished by the activities of the IRA.  However those activities serve to remind us of the difficulty of the task of those within the republican movement who are working for a peaceful strategy.  Their task is not straightforward; they are dealing with a culture which has deified violence for <Col N="15" /> many decades, which has considered violence to be not just acceptable but almost a holy option.  This requires a serious process of re-education in the republican movement.</P>
    <P>I hope Members recall what I said in the House at the time the last ceasefire broke down.  I said that one reason for the breakdown was that, while the leadership was convinced the peace process was good and had a certain logic &mdash; requiring the maintenance of a ceasefire in all circumstances &mdash; it had not re-educated all its people at every level to ensure those on the ground also understood and accepted the analysis of the peace process as meaning not just a ceasefire but a total cessation of violence for good.  That is the logic of the peace process and to my mind it is inevitable and inescapable for all who adopted it on the first day.  I continue to hope they will soon be able to follow that logic and because I do so, I have not closed off channels of communication to Sinn Féin.  If I believed otherwise, I would have no option but to close them.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has not closed off the doors to those in Sinn Féin who are working to restore a ceasefire.  My disagreement is on a different point.  It seems the Secretary of State believes politics is at a low ebb &mdash;&ldquo;extremely bad&rdquo; were the words he used less than 24 hours ago. Luckily for everyone concerned we have had the successful capture of a third IRA cell within the last few weeks, and a bomb factory here has been successfully located and put out of action. The Taoiseach still saw fit to give an optimistic assessment.  When he gets the opportunity, would the Taoiseach not be far better employed explaining to the world the gravity of the situation and trying to point out the dangers of what could happen, rather than spreading fatuous optimism around the world when, by his own admission today, he has no solid foundation for it?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is at pains to tell us he simply said he hoped there would be a ceasefire.  We all hope that, but the IRA's logic is different <Col N="17" /> from ours.  He made clear earlier that when he was asked a specific question, as to whether he believed there would be an IRA ceasefire between now and Christmas, he said there was a possibility. Does he accept that talking about the possibility of a ceasefire when he clearly had no grounds for doing so was a wrong and dangerous thing to do which gives credence to those in the republican movement who are trying to play the &ldquo;hard cop, soft cop&rdquo; approach and want an each way bet on violence and politics?  Would he accept that as late as last night Mr. Mitchel McLoughlin, a senior representative of Sinn Féin, said on RTE television that there were no grounds at present for the restoration of the ceasefire?</P>

They demanded all party talks and they have them; they demanded that those talks be substantive and they are; they demanded that decommissioning would not be a roadblock in the talks and it will not be.  In terms of their own demands, there are grounds for an IRA ceasefire now.</P>

Sinn Féin wants negotiations and <Col N="18" /> therefore there must be an IRA cease-fire for the sort of negotiations that it wants to occur.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>I regret all deaths. One of the reasons I am working as <Col N="19" /> hard as I am to secure an IRA ceasefire and a total end to all violence is to ensure that deaths of this kind will not occur again and families will not be bereaved in the way the O'Neill family is currently bereaved.  Those responsible for putting Mr. O'Neill in the position he was in have a responsibility in the matter, but it is right that the independent police authority should investigate the circumstances as far as the forces of law and order were concerned and any role they had in the matter.  That will be investigated and it is important that it should be.  It is also important that we should recognise a responsibility on the part of the people who put Mr. O'Neill in the position of doing the sort of work he was doing at the time and on those who, as yet, have failed to call an IRA ceasefire.  We need to express relief that the bombs did not reach their targets. It is a matter of great sadness that Mr. O'Neill is dead, but many other people would be dead if the IRA's objectives had been achieved in London.  We must pursue justice for all and ensure that everybody has his or her right to life protected and that the forces of law act in accordance with the law.  We must express our happiness that so many other lives have been saved as a result of the police operation.</P>

      <P>We all share concern when a person dies, whether it be the late Mr. O'Neill or any other person. Thankfully, the operation planned by the IRA was stopped and the inevitable damage that would have resulted from the planned bombings in the name of the people of this country was prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to what the Taoiseach said in Washington and what he said in answer to supplementary questions by my party leader, Deputy Ahern, and the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney.  Given that he said we are coming to a position where a cease-fire is possible, that there is some reason to hope that one will be called &mdash; in <Col N="20" /> answers today he said that one is inevitable &mdash; why if that is his point of view did he blame the messengers, the media, for misreporting him earlier?  In his response to a supplementary question he made the point that he felt the cease-fire broke because Sinn Féin failed to educate its members as to expectations. I put it to him that one of the main reasons it failed was his refusal to meet John Hume and Gerry Adams last October when a ceasefire was still in existence and when the Mitchell report was binned by the British Government. The bomb went off and at the end of February the British and Irish Governments ran to try to put the ceasefire back in place by agreeing on talks.  That is the history and the reality.</P>

      <P>Part of the problem is that since August there has been an atmosphere of deep pessimism because of events that have occurred.  It is inevitable that in that atmosphere of pervasive pessimism the first sign of any hope will tend to be magnified out of all proportion. I remind Members that in the immediate aftermath of the original ceasefire there was an atmosphere of absolutely euphoric optimism.  A question of any kind could not be asked about the possibility that violence might be resumed because that ran against the currently prevailing and politically correct mood which was one of optimism. We now have the inverse of that, or have had it until recently, whereby anybody who expresses the slightest hope is running contrary to the perceived wisdom of the herd.</P>

It is unsatisfactory in an atmosphere of overwhelming optimism to fail to ask hard questions or in an atmosphere of overwhelming pessimism to point to signs of hope, such as the comments by Martin McGuinness that there could not be real negotiations without a ceasefire in effect.  To point to those was realistic and responsible and I do not believe that parties opposite should allow themselves to be as carried away by prevailing moods as they seem to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those words must be put on the record so that we can see the situation as it is.  Efforts are being made to advance matters but there are many difficulties.  One of the great difficulties was and is the fact that the events at Drumcree have done enormous damage to community relations and have made the task of politicians more difficult because their constituents are not as willing to trust other constituents of a different political persuasion as they may have been last June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Dermot Ahern, I am not responsible for and do not report on the medical people to which the Deputy refers, whether they are administering medicaments to the press or anybody else.  However, it is important that there <Col N="23" /> are intensive contacts between the SDLP and the Unionists.  In large part the &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo;, to use Sir Patrick Mayhew's word, signs coming from the talks in Belfast are due in no small measure to the efforts being made by those two parties and others at present.</P>
    <P>I believe the House will agree with me that the purpose of these talks is to involve all parties.  This includes Sinn Féin which has an electoral mandate and can take part in the talks once the conditions for its participation are fulfilled, namely, an IRA ceasefire.  This will happen because the logic of the peace process makes it inevitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since there was never any logic to the violence, logic does not enter into the equation.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Sinn Féin leadership is genuinely trying to have a ceasefire restored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.  She should understand that since 1986 or earlier there have been those within the republican movement who have been analysing the situation logically.  Through the application of logic they concluded &mdash; a conclusion which neither the Deputy nor I had to come to because we were always of this view &mdash; that one million Unionists could not be coerced.  While continuing with a two track process, one track entailed a logical analysis of the ultimate futility of the other track, which was violence.</P>
      <P>This is still the case in the republican movement.  As I said there are these two tracks; they are fundamentally incompatible, but ultimately the track based on logic &mdash; the analysis of the peace process which says that one million Unionists cannot be coerced &mdash; will prevail over the other track because there is no other way anybody can have peace or have a decent life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from the Deputy being dismissive of the sincerity of the logic of those in the republican movement seeking peace, there is sincerity and logic in the peace process.  It is a logic that leads <Col N="24" /> inevitably to an ultimate, complete and total cessation of violence.  In this sense a ceasefire is inevitable and we should not say anything in this House that in any way diminishes the sense that it is not only logical but inevitable.</P>
    <P>In this sense, to answer the second part of Deputy Harney's question, the people pursuing the peace strategy within Sinn Féin are genuine.  I hope and believe that they will prevail because they have logic on their side. Those who use violence have no logic on their side.  All they have are atavistic feelings of a negative kind and animosities of a primitive and emotional nature which lead nowhere.  As I remarked at the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of 1916, 60 million people died in Europe pursuing atavistic objectives by violent means in the first half of this century.  Virtually nobody died in western Europe in the second half of the century thanks to the prevalence of a democratic approach to politics based on the rule of law.  Those within the republican movement who continue to pursue the methods of violence are pursuing methods that are 50 years out of date.</P>

      <P>John Hume said recently that if he believed that a ceasefire was imminent, that there were people working for a ceasefire or that there was a possibility of one, he would do what the Taoiseach's predecessor did and remain silent and work for it.  Will the Taoiseach take this into account when analysing the progress that can be made?  My greatest objection to what the Taoiseach said in the USA was that he put pressure on those directly engaged.  Will he take this into account as he proceeds with the peace process?</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there are three issues which are important if we are to try to make progress?  The first is that there be a realistic acceptance by the British Government &mdash; the Government accepts this &mdash; that decommissioning will not take place alongside talks but will occur at the latter stages. Second, definite signs must emerge &mdash; the Taoiseach today outlined the efforts of the Government since 9 September &mdash; of a real effort to try to make the parties to the talks seriously committed to making progress.  Third, confidence building measures, especially on the prisoners issues &mdash; we welcome the progress made by the British Secretary of State, Mr. Howard, last Friday &mdash; must be addressed.  Does the Taoiseach agree that these are three central issues which must be addressed, especially by the British Government?</P>

      <P>There are occasions in politics when silence can be as eloquent as words.  Sitting beside the President of the USA in the White House I was asked if there was a possibility of a ceasefire.  Knowing as I did that the President had worked as hard as he had and had taken such risks for a ceasefire and also knowing that all the conditions set by the IRA for a ceasefire had been met and that Martin McGuinness of <Col N="26" /> Sinn Féin had said that there could not be real negotiations without, in effect, a ceasefire, a refusal by me to answer such a question would have been interpreted as a statement by me, in effect, that there was no hope of a ceasefire.  I do not believe there is no hope of a cease-fire. The carefully chosen words I used which I quoted in this House, were the right ones to use.  There is hope but there is no reason to go beyond the use of that term.  I have not used the term &ldquo;optimism&rdquo; in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to challenge head on another underlying assumption in Deputy Bertie Ahern's question that discussing the prospects of a ceasefire somehow makes a ceasefire more difficult. The last ceasefire failed because the volunteers in the republican movement did not understand why the first ceasefire was called or the constraints there were on everybody else who responded to that and believed their leadership had sold out.  None of those things was true and what was necessary was that there should be a serious public discussion of these issues so that everybody would understand that a ceasefire is the inevitable outcome of a peace process. There cannot be a peace process without a ceasefire, without a cessation of violence.  It is not possible for people to continue to pursue a peace process by violent means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also appropriate that I should say, as I did in the United States, that if there was a second ceasefire, this time it had to be credible and had to hold in all circumstances.  I do not want anybody to think, nor I hope would any party in this House want anybody to think, that a tactical ceasefire will suffice.  I know the leadership of the republican movement does not believe that; it is not pursuing the concept of a tactical ceasefire.  In so far as it is pursuing a peace process, it is sincere in wanting a ceasefire that will hold in all circumstances, but it is important that everybody in the republican movement should understand that. That was why I availed of the opportunity, when I was asked the question to say the ceasefire must be viable, must <Col N="27" /> hold in all circumstances and must convince others.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The position on spending in 1996 is being closely monitored.  There are upward pressures on certain areas of current and capital spending.  As we move into the last quarter of the year the position will begin to firm up and, as in previous years, it is likely that expenditure savings will begin to materialise.  The publication of the end-September Exchequer returns next week should give a clearer view of the emerging position on supply services spending.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to state what changes in expenditure programmes will be made in 1997 before the 1997 Abridged Estimates and Public Capital Programme are laid before the Dáil.  In July, my Department issued in the Estimates Circular, guidelines to Departments on the approach to be followed in preparing their 1997 Estimates proposals. Consideration of the proposals of Departments is well under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister well knows, A Government of Renewal contained a firm commitment in regard to the increase in the level of supply services one year over the next.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> Over the period of this Programme it is intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to a maximum of 6 per cent, in nominal terms in 1995, and to an average annual 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the Programme.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of the 1996 Estimates the Minister had to overshoot the annual average inflation rate of 2 per cent, he could not adhere to that figure. What is the programme for 1997?  Will the commitment contained in A Government of Renewal be adhered to because, if that is the case, it will mean the relevant increase over 1995 will not be greater than 4 per cent, the rate of inflation over those two years being somewhat less than was forecast, plus 2 per cent, resulting in a figure of less than 4 per cent.  That firm commitment was given for very good reasons.  Will the Minister say whether it will be adhered to in the preparation of the 1997 Estimates?</P>

Do I take it, therefore, that the 1997 Estimates will be in conformity with the commitment given in A Government of Renewal drawn up between the Fine Gael.  Labour and Democratic Left parties which will mean that increased expenditure in 1997 over 1995 will be of the order referred to in my question?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 44 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department were made aware, for the first time, of the preliminary results of the CSO study into the growing gap between the estimated level of unemployment as measured by the Labour Force Survey and the number of persons on the live register at an interdepartmental meeting which commenced at 4 p.m. on 11 September 1996.  Arising from that meeting, a number of substantive issues had to be pursued between the CSO and the Department of Social Welfare before the report could be finalised. Following the necessary clarifications, the study was published on 18 September 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also considered the CSO study on 18 September 1996 and subsequently announced a series of initiatives designed to ensure that only those who are genuinely eligible receive unemployment payments.  These measures represent an enhanced programme of systematic controls targeted on areas of concern highlighted by the study, namely, working while signing, accurate addresses and availability for work.  It is the Government's intention <Col N="31" /> that the existing close liaison and co-operation between the various agencies which have a role to play in combating fraud and abuse will be strengthened further.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners there is already a high degree of co-operation, including exchange of information, between Revenue and the Department of Social Welfare in combating social welfare fraud. This co-operation includes the use of common indentifier numbers, the regular exchange of information about income, employments and self-employments and the operation of the joint investigation units throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners indicated they will be prepared to co-operate as appropriate in any new measures the Department of Social Welfare may take in relation to fraud.  Deputies can be assured of the Government's determination to ensure the relevant agencies pool and apply their expertise to identify and confront those who are simultaneously defrauding the taxpayer and doing such a disservice to those who are earnestly seeking work but are unable to find it.</P>
    <P>The financial implications for the Exchequer of the Government decisions arising from the results of the CSO study are not yet clear.  A range of assumptions have to be made in interpreting the report in this respect.  Any figure to be factored into the budgetary arithmetic must be as firmly based as possible.  My Department is in contact with the Department of Social Welfare to finalise estimates of the savings to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I have been asked if I will commit the savings that emerge to a reduction in income tax.  It is the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, to lower the tax and PRSI burden on earned income, focusing assistance especially towards those on lower incomes.  Significant improvements were made in this regard in the last two budgets.  There are, of course, different views as to the form further reductions in taxation should <Col N="32" /> take, and the groups towards whom relief should be targeted.  I hope to consolidate and build upon the type of measures introduced in the last two years in the 1997 budget.  However, final decisions on the precise composition of the income tax package can only be taken in the context of the overall budgetary package close to budget time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it the Minister now agrees with a point I made on many occasions, that there is no reason the Department of Social Welfare with some political will and guidance should not be able to reconcile the figures between the labour force survey and the live register?  It is not impossible to so do.  Would the Minister now agree it is possible to reconcile those conflicting figures given the level of technology available to the Department of Social Welfare?  As a former Minister for Social Welfare I assure the Minister there is no good reason this cannot be done, whatever officials in the Department of Finance are being told.  It can and should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the fundamental conclusion to which the Deputy has come.  If he is inferring that officials from the Department of Social Welfare have consistently misled officials in the Department of Finance that is a very serious allegation.  If he is saying, on the other hand, that the Department of Social Welfare has the ability to independently verify the accuracy of its records outside the CSO or the labour force survey, that is not the information we have.  I have heard Deputy McCreevy make that point on numerous occasions on the floor of this House in unscripted remarks.  However, that is not my understanding of the situation having made inquiries subsequent to the Deputy's assertions.  If the Deputy has specific information to the effect that the Department of Social Welfare has the independent capability to verify accuracy outside the CSO on the mismatch between the labour force <Col N="33" /> survey and the live register, which is of the order of approximately 90,000.  I invite him to present it.  I do not have that information.  When I sought it I was told it is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it was unfortunate, to say the least, that the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, which considered this matter on the day after new information on this matter became available to the Department of Finance and which questioned the Secretary of the Department of Finance with some degree of vigour and intensity over a long period of time, was left completely in the dark as to even the existence of a survey of this kind which would have explained in large measure the divergence between the labour force survey and the live register?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister also agree it was especially incumbent on his Department to provide to the Oireachtas Committee dealing with the matter, an indication at the first available opportunity, that such a study had been carried out and that the preliminary and as yet unfinalised indications were that the estimates of the Department of Social Welfare about the extent of fraud &mdash; that it was less than half of one per cent &mdash; were wildly wrong?  Does the Minister agree it would have been preferable to give the committee a clear indication of the reality rather than allowing it pursue the line Deputy McCreevy has just pursued about the difficulties of liaison between the two Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not unfortunate that the coincidence of the report being delivered to my Department on Wednesday at 4 p.m. in a draft form was the day before the Secretary of my Department met the committee of which both Deputies opposite and others are members.  I was not briefed until 3 p.m. on the Thursday afternoon as to the full contents of the initial report.  I had been told late on Wednesday afternoon that a report had <Col N="34" /> come in, that it was a preliminary report, that my officials were checking figures as to their accuracy and that they intended to brief me comprehensively. They subsequently did so at 3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon.  The Secretary of the Department as is normal practice in all Departments, sent me a copy of the opening statement he intended to give to the committee.  I was aware of the contents of that statement.  I turned on my monitor to see some of the questions and answers on the matter which Deputy McDowell has just described. As far as I am concerned the Secretary of the Department of Finance behaved absolutely properly having regard to the quality and status of the information he possessed at that time.  If he had gone beyond the point to which he went, he would have been open to a charge of interpreting information whose veracity was still subject to confirmation.</P>
      <P>We know in respect of those people who were working and drawing social welfare benefits at the same time that the figure was significantly reduced subsequent to 4 p.m. on that Wednesday.  If there is an inference in Deputy McDowell's question &mdash; I am not so sure that there is and if there is not I will immediately withdraw my remark &mdash; to the effect that the Secretary of the Department of Finance deliberately prevented information being made available to the committee which he knew was in the process of emerging and which is rightly the property of the Oireachtas.  I categorically refute it.  The information we got was of a preliminary nature.  The Secretary had prepared his remarks for the committee the day before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time we got the information in the Department was at 4 p.m. on the Wednesday.  He addressed the committee that afternoon.  At the same time or some little time after, I was briefed by the officials for the first time.  Even at that stage, they looked for verification. If the thrust of Deputy McDowell's question is to suggest that the Secretary of the Department of Finance attempted to cover up or to prevent factual information becoming available to <Col N="35" /> the committee, I repudiate it categorically.</P>

      <P>I am not implying that the Secretary of the Department of Finance attempted to mislead the committee. Having reconsidered what was said, it became apparent to me that he was having difficulty answering the questions that Deputies McCreevy, Cullen and I put to him, bearing in mind what he must have known at the time. The decision not to reveal to the committee the existence of such a study, the substance of which would have an outcome on the questions which were being put to him, and also that the two Departments had co-operated to the point of establishing such a study and receiving a report which they were considering on the issue, was a matter of not keeping adequate faith with Members of the Oireachtas who not only are entitled not to be told untruths &mdash; I accept no untruths were told &mdash; but to be told truthfully the factual position. We spent an hour and a half on that day dealing with this matter, most of which time was devoted to this subject, but the <Col N="36" /> most fundamental piece of information was not revealed to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell has repeatedly used the word &ldquo;truthfully&rdquo;.

He was not in a position to speculate as to its contents nor to reveal the fact that such a study had been carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the simple reason that until such time as a definitive result from that study was available, much negative speculation could have been bandied about which would not have been helpful.  People would have asked why we were carrying out studies and did not just give the results.  In the circumstances and having regard to events surrounding the occasion, the Secretary of the Department of Finance carried out his responsibilities impeccably.</P>

      <P>I did most of the questioning of the Secretary of the Department of Finance on this topic which, as the Minister is aware, is one of my favourite hobby horses.  I have no problem in agreeing the line taken by the Secretary of the Department of Finance since he did not know the outcome of the report but I take on board Deputy McDowell's view that we were not aware that such a report was in the course of preparation.  In light of the relevance of events of November-December 1994, I am delighted to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, make the point very clearly that it would not have been correct for the Secretary of the Department of Finance to even hint at the existence of a report until there was, to quote the Minister, a definitive report.  I am sure the Minister will convey that message to all his Labour Party colleagues, particularly those in Government.</P>

One must also have regard to the nature of the individual institutions, their particular customer markets, the needs of the whole community in its broadest sense and developments in the EU.</P>
      <P>Our examination of the matter is making progress and I hope soon to be in a position to make a proposal to the Government.  Pending the Government's consideration of this matter it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further.</P>

      <P>The reply the Minister gave is effectively the same as that he gave in April 1995, June 1995 and May 1996.  Does he agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that the third banking force has been funked by the Government because the Coalition parties could not agree on the matter?  It is evident that they still cannot agree on a third banking force.  This is the first chink in the Government's armour and many more will appear as the days go on.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to engage Deputy Ahern from Cork North East &mdash; one must distinguish between the different Deputy Aherns &mdash; in such a manifestly political debate, but I draw his attention to a fact which possibly has not come to his observation, that both banks are behaving and performing exceptionally well.  They reflect a vibrant market and service it.  The ACC in particular has expanded from its narrow customer base to a much wider base and ICC is still the driving bank for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has announced its programme of legislation in regard to crime all of which is appropriate to this matter.  We need to assemble evidence to arrest people.  The assembly of evidence is a particularly painstaking process because there is no point in putting people on trial unless there is sufficient evidence for a conviction. That is something which has to be decided by the Director of Public Prosecutions who is an independent officer. The Garda have a heavy responsibility in assembling this evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> The legislation we recently passed in regard to the financial transactions of those involved in organised crime will be particularly helpful in understanding the motivations of the people concerned and also in ensuring they do not enjoy the rewards of organised crime.  If the Garda or any other prosecutorial authority recommend further changes to legislation they will be introduced.  The Minister for Justice stated it is her intention to ensure there will be regular reviews of criminal legislation and a vehicle is provided for reviews to be made effective whereby any suggestions made which could improve the record in the detection of crime will be implemented as promptly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the concern of everybody in this House and the public that contract killings &mdash; there have been a number in my constituency &mdash; continue unabated?  To the best of my knowledge no case has been built up against anybody by the DPP or anybody else.  I know the Taoiseach can do nothing on his own but he should at least ask the forces of the State to try to focus on who is behind them.  It is a matter of great public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to today's Order Paper which contains the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill which will soon be law.  Anybody who thinks about this matter will appreciate as I know the Deputy does that contract killings are more difficult to detect than killings by people who have a personal motive for the killing. The contractor is other than the person who does the killing.  One has to identify the relationship between the two.  Very often a relationship would have existed, and there would not be any witnesses or evidence of the transaction between them.  It is more difficult therefore to match the person with the motive with the murderer than it is in a case where the person with the motive did the deed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious point behind what <Col N="512" /> Deputy Ahern said about contract killings being a very serious problem which requires an extraordinary response. That is part of the reason we have introduced the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill and taken extra powers to investigate the financial dealings of major crime figures. It is partly through the evidence of these financial dealings that we may be able to find evidence of the transactions which may be behind the contract killings by a third party.  It is important that we understand that and that the legislation we put through the House with all-party support addresses this problem in substantial measure in the best way possible.  The legislation will only come into effect at this juncture and cannot be used retrospectively.  This legislation will result in a considerably improved climate in which it will be less easy for people to engage in this appalling activity.</P>
    <P>It is important this matter should be raised here today because any killing is unacceptable.  There must be the most vigorous use of all the resources available to the State to bring the people involved to justice.  I assure the House that is being done and if further legislative powers are necessary, these will be taken.</P>

      <P>On promised legislation, I notice on the list that a Bill is proposed from the Department of the Environment to amend the Constitution to allow for the election by emigrants of three Senators.  Has the Government yet decided from where these three seats in the Seanad are to come?  Is the Government listening to the voice of emigrants who do not want this proposal to go any further?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied there is any call for this Bill to be proceeded with any further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is currently under consideration by the Government.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister for the Environment published a discussion paper on the subject during the summer which outlined some of the difficulties with any proposal in regard <Col N="513" /> to votes for emigrants, whether it be votes in elections to the Seanad, the Dáil or county councils.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to repeal section 14 (2) of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, the terms of which prohibit the publication of reports of divorce, separation and nullity cases except to the extent that they involve disclosure of, <i>inter alia</i>, the names, addresses and occupations of <Col N="521" /> parties and witnesses to those proceedings. Because the <i>in camera</i> rule applies to those proceedings they cannot, in any event, be reported.  The printing of law reports is, of course, not prohibited.  In practice the names of the parties or addresses and other distinguishing features are erased from all reports as well as unreported judgments. Publication of the details of a case which has been heard <i>in camera</i> constitutes contempt.  I am satisfied the law which should be seen to operate in the family law area is the one provided for under the <i>in camera</i> rules.  This is the rule which will apply specifically to divorce proceedings by virtue of section 34 (5).  This amendment will help to make the position even more clear.</P>

Section 14 (2) of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, states:</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published any report, statement, commentary or other matter of or in relation to any judicial proceedings for divorce, nullity of marriage, judicial separation, or restitution of conjugal rights save and except all or any of the following particulars of such proceedings, so far as the same can be printed and published without contravening any other subsection of this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, shall not apply to marriages solemnised between the 1st day of August and the 31st day of December, 1996.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a debate we have had with the Minister previously.  We have had argument and disagreement on this issue. From the outset there has been concern about the marriage notification procedure which is now obligatory.  It is essential to give notice of marriage three months in advance of the date on which one intends to be married.  There are two points here: there was no concern that before the provisions came into force on 1 August there was no explicit provision in the Act for the procedures for giving and receiving notification. Various legal authorities had expressed concern about that matter and the fact that it could lead to difficulties in the future.  The Minister said he took the advice of the Attorney General who said that the Interpretation Act, 1937, could apply in this case and, therefore, there would be no reason to be unduly concerned.  This point has not been generally agreed and there still remains some question of doubt.  We cannot understand why the Minister leaves the issue in any doubt.  There should be no doubt and it is not right to leave any marriage in a questionable situation.  We suggest the Minister removes the doubt and takes on board our amendment or an amendment with slightly different wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since all this argument and debate took place earlier this year, we have <Col N="523" /> been informed that some 6,733 couples are to be married over those three months and have given notice.  That number may have increased slightly because that information was given in July.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us the final number which in any event is in the region of 7,000.  When that figure is doubled, 14,000 people could be involved.</P>
    <P>We have been informed by reports in the media since then that over 100 couples applied to the courts for exemptions. Will the Minister tell us the numbers who have applied for exemptions to date?  We were also informed through the media that at least three couples were informed that the validity of their marriages is uncertain.  That is a very serious matter.  By exempting the first three months the Minister would deal both with the issue of people who were not sufficiently aware in the first instance and the lingering doubt which may exist from the long-term point of view in relation to marriages which take place within that three month period from 1 August to the end of October.</P>
    <P>The notice placed in the newspapers made it clear that any person who intended to marry on 1 August 1996 must have given notification on or before 1 May 1996, and unless they obtain an exemption, any marriage which takes place in the State on or after 1 August 1996 will not be valid in civil law unless these requirements have been met.  It is clear from various surveys that many people do not read the newspapers nowadays and certainly do not read all the notices.  To a large extent, the Minister was depending on the various churches in each diocese to inform the people concerned of this requirement and, generally, that is what happened.  There have been exceptions and people were not aware of the requirements on time.  Obviously the exemptions applied for in courts would relate to some of those cases.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and remove all doubts in this area.  Why be obstinate about it? <Col N="524" /> Why leave people in doubt?  Why not listen to the House on an occasion like this?  The same points are being raised by both sides of the House.  The result of the vote on Committee Stage was very close, 12-10.  Some of the 12 who said they were not happy wanted the Minister to look again at this issue. Some Members on the Government side are concerned and are also asking questions.  Concerns have also been expressed by Members on this side of the House and the evidence which has come to light since that time seems to confirm these concerns.  The simple remedy to this problem is to exempt the three month period, and we have tabled an amendment in this respect to enable the Minister to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>The headline in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 27 August stated &ldquo;No notice couples must wed again&rdquo;.  The Minister's press officer wrote to the newspaper advising them that people should not worry and that the Attorney General had given his assurances. However, this article stated:</P>
    <P>Serveral couples who were married this month are not legally married in the eyes of the State because they failed to provide adequate notice of their intention to wed.  It is believed letters have now been sent to at least three couples informing them that the validity of their marriages is uncertain under civil law because they married after new legislation came into effect on 1 August requiring three months notice which they had not given.</P>
    <P>Some people have already experienced difficulties in this regard.  In an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 29 August a TD made allegations about the church's position in relation to such marriages. Apparently some of the people who performed these marriages felt they were valid and should not be affected. It was a Deputy from the Government side of the House who brought this matter to our attention during the latter days of August.  What is the necessity for all this and why can the matter not be clarified once and for all so that there <Col N="525" /> is no future doubt about it?  Will the Minister accept the amendment and put the issue beyond doubt?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated on Committee Stage, the effect of section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, relating to notice of marriage, which came into effect on 1 August last is that unless special exemption has been obtained in accordance with the Act a marriage shall not be valied unless the parties give three months notice of their intention to marry.  There has been a certain amount of comment both inside and outside the House on this provision, particularly as regards its application in respect of marriages during the months of August, September and October.</P>
      <P>It was obviously not the intention of the 1995 Act that marriages could not take place in August, September and October 1996 and if it had been intended that persons could not marry during those months the legislation would have specifically provided for that.  I wish to emphasise again what I said on the matter on Committee Stage. The presumption under rules of statutory interpretation is that the Oireachtas intended that couples be obliged to notify the registrar of their intention to marry and that the registrar should have the power to receive such notices prior to the commencement of section 32.  The advice from the Attorney General is that the provisions of section 10 (1) (b) of the Interpretation Act, 1937, cover exactly the situation which arises in relation to those notices of marriage given prior to 1 August 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1937 Act provision deals with a situation where an Act of the Oireachtas is expressed to come into operation on a day subsequent to the date of passing of such Act.  It makes clear that if an Act confers a power, the exercise of which is necessary or expedient to enable that Act to have full force and effect immediately upon its coming into operation, such power may be exercised at any time after the passing of the <Col N="526" /> Act.  Consequently, on the basis of ordinary rules of statutory interpretation and by virtue of the provision of section 10 of the Interpretation Act the Attorney General's view is that prior to 1 August couples were authorised to notify registrars of marriage of their intention to marry and registrars had power to receive the notices so given. The view of the Attorney General, with which I agree, is that there is no necessity for amending legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>It will be of interest to Deputies to know how section 32 has operated in practice.  Since we last debated the issue on Committee Stage I have consulted with my colleague, the Minister for Health, who has responsibility for the office of the General Registrar of Marriages regarding the day-to-day operation of the notification requirement under the Act.  He has informed me that up to 25 July last almost 7,000 notifications under section 32 had been received in respect of marriages to be solemnised in the months of August, September and October.  This compares with an annual marriage rate of less than 16,000.  He also informed me that while difficulties had been encountered in a number of isolated cases these were not specifically related to the provisions of the Act but were more of an administrative nature.  Of the total number of notifications received to date, difficulties have been encountered in only 19 cases, seven of these cases have been resolved and the remaining 12 are currently under examination.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on 25 July last my colleague, the Minister for Justice, also indicated that at that date 125 applications had been made to the courts under section 33 of the 1995 Act for exemption from the three months notice requirement under section 32 of the Act.  She indicated that of those applications the court had granted exemptions in 98 cases and the remaining 27 cases were, at that time, waiting to be heard.  Since then I have been given more up-to-date figures which I can give the House.  The position in respect of applications for <Col N="527" /> exemption prior to 1 August last is as follows: 149 applications were received, 138 were granted, none was refused, two were adjourned to other Circuit Courts and 11 were still to be heard.  The position post 1 August last is as follows: 12 applications were carried forward, 112 applications were received, 93 of these applications were granted, six were refused, eight were transferred to other Circuit Courts and 25 are still to be heard.</P>
    <P>Clearly the system is operating satisfactorily in practice and the exercise by the courts of jurisdiction under the Act is a further illustration that the provisions of sections 32 and 33 of the 1995 Act are sound.  I am happy to assure the House that there are no legal or constitutional difficulties with the operation of sections 32 and 33 of the 1995 Act. The system of notification and exemption provided for under these sections is operating perfectly satisfactorily on the ground and there is no necessity for amending legislation in this area. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to what the Minister has said, given that I am one of the people who first raised what was perceived to be a difficulty in this area.  I have always been of the view that what the Minister says in relation to notifications given prior to 1 August is open to two different legal interpretations. The interpretation given by the Minister is a valid interpretation, and my argument on that issue has always been that without a court decision there is still a matter of some legal uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's advice is from the Office of the Attorney General, but the office is not always correct.  I assume the Minister acted on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General during each Stage of the Bill and I presumed the Minister brought forward all the amendments deemed necessary on Committee Stage.  I am sure Members would have been informed if the office, <Col N="528" /> when going through the Bill with a fine tooth comb before Committee Stage, had reached the conclusion that other amendments were required.  However, the House is dealing with a plethora of amendments to other sections tabled by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Minister and I support the legislation.  I am anxious that it be passed.  The Office of the Attorney General and the departmental officials may have regarded it as the final version of the Bill, addressing all outstanding issues after Committee Stage, with the exception of a number of matters raised by Opposition Deputies which the Minister said he would reconsider. However, although it is being done properly and in good faith, amendments have been tabled to a series of sections which were not suggested previously.</P>
    <P>I have a greater degree of unease about the Circuit Court exemptions &mdash; perhaps the Minister will confirm they are Circuit Court rather than High Court exemptions &mdash; to the notification requirement granted prior to 1 August than about the giving of notification. The Minister's statistic that 148 applications were received prior to 1 August and 138 were granted is interesting.  The date 1 August is relevant because it is the date on which the Family Law Act came into force and I have a problem with the interpretation Act being relied on in this manner by the Circuit Court. It granted exemptions in circumstances where couples went before a Circuit Court judge in chambers and said they wanted the exemption and the judge wished to facilitate them.  There were no contests, hearings or teasing out of the legal principles applicable between contesting parties.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Act provided that the power conferred on the courts to exempt people from the notification requirement would come into operation when the Act was brought into force by ministerial order.  The order brought the Act into operation on 1 August.  There is express provision in the Act in terms of when it comes into operation. <Col N="529" /> However, the interpretation Act was relied on to allow the courts to grant exemptions before 1 August.  From memory, that provision in the interpretation Act is applicable save in so far as it is inconsistent with the wording of the Act to which it applies.</P>
    <P>This appears difficult and technical but, while I have some reservations about notifications given prior to 1 August, once they were given three months before a marriage there is a good case to suggest that the validity of the marriages will be accepted, although an argument can be made on the other side.  However, if 138 people are granted notification exemptions prior to 1 August and subsequently married on that basis.  I have great difficulty accepting the view, even if the Circuit Court made the decision, that the exemptions are valid.</P>
    <P>If some of the marriages of the 138 couples, who married pursuant to exemptions granted prior to 1 August, break down and there is a contest in the future, there is a real possibility that a court higher than the Circuit Court could declare the marriages null and void.  There is a serious likelihood of this scenario and I am most uneasy about the manner in which we are dealing with this aspect.  The people involved want to know if their marriages are valid.  Perhaps the Minister could consider a solution to this matter in the Seanad.  It is not unknown to include matters in legislation, even if they are considered unnecessary, to give people peace of mind.  The Minister may consider such a move is unnecessary but another provision in the Bill is equally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) provides that, for the avoidance of doubt, the grant of a decree of divorce shall not affect the right of the father and mother of an infant under section 6 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to be a guardian of the infant jointly.  There was never a doubt that, if a decree of divorce was granted, it could in any way affect the guardianship rights of a husband and wife.  This is clear, but for comfort because people were concerned about <Col N="530" /> the impact of divorce, section 8 (2), although unnecessary, is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is dealing with the Bill on the basis of advice received but I ask him to consider including a similar provision to section 8 (2) when the legislation is before the Seanad.  It could state that, for the avoidance of doubt, a notification to marry given prior to 1 August, or an exemption granted by the court of the need for such notification given prior to 1 August, is regarded as valid.  This would ensure a marriage cannot be impugned on the basis that either the notification was given or an exemption was granted prior to 1 August.  If the guardians of children are entitled to reassurance that the granting of a divorce will not affect their guardianship rights, couples who married during the summer pursuant to procedures put in place in recent months are entitled to equal assurance that their marriages are valid.  They should be facilitated in that regard.</P>
    <P>A simple mechanism could be used to deal with this matter which does not involve going against the advice of the Attorney General or loss of face. Nobody is trying to score political points.  It addresses an issue which could prove problematic in the future.  It will be a cause of litigation in the future and such a move should be taken if only to avoid unnecessary litigation.  It may be the case that, at the end of litigation between a couple whose marriage has broken down, the Attorney General's view on all the issues will be proved right.  However, why should a couple be put through the difficulty of dealing with this matter in the courts?  I urge the Minister to consider the solution he applied in relation to guardianship in section 8.</P>

      <P>I do not have specific information regarding the grounds on which they were refused.

      <P>The Minister gave us a good deal of information on up-to-date statistics which reveal that in the period prior to and after 1 August 261 couples applied for exemptions.  That number may increase.  We wanted to avoid circumstances in which large numbers of people would have to apply to the courts for exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Serious questions arise about the six refusals.  If it is the case that the people involved did not move quickly enough or were not careful enough when dealing with the matter, they should not have been refused exemptions.  We do not want the legislation to have that type of effect.  Perhaps the Minister will inform us at a later stage why those six cases were refused exemptions.  This has happened purely as a result of the 1995 legislation passed in this House.</P>
    <P>We tabled this amendment as one way of dealing with the matter and Deputy Shatter proposed another.  I do not mind which approach the Minister adopts, or even if he takes another approach.  I merely want him to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I fall into the same school as Deputy Shatter regarding Attorneys General. While the advice of Attorneys General has been generally sound and well respected over the years, nevertheless lawyers often differ and their differences tend to end up in court where a decision is made at a high level.  We do not want that to happen in this case. Like the Minister, I am an ordinary simple person and I do not want to create difficulties for people.  Why not use one of these remedies and put the matter beyond doubt?  As Deputy Shatter stated in regard to section 8 (2), for the avoidance of doubt these matters are regarded as valid.  Is it a case of pride or that once something is committed to paper it takes on a life of its own and cannot be changed?  This is where changes should be made.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the advice of the Attorney General, Members are practical and adopted a practical approach to this matter on Committee Stage.  We do not want to create difficulties in this area.  The notification rule is a new measure and of course some people will question why it is necessary to give three months notice.  We had a debate on that some time ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not disposed to accept this amendment.  He has taken a hard stand and his comments have been <Col N="533" /> brief.  Perhaps he is in a rush to go somewhere. The Ceann Comhairle offered him an opportunity to give a further explanation but he did not accept.  This matter should be resolved by accepting a simple amendment, following which it will not be necessary to ask questions. Perhaps some people will be critical of the change, but the Minister changed many items in the Bill today.  I am glad I was here late last night when he submitted those amendments.  Since the committee system was set up it appears to be the practice to submit ministerial amendments late at night.  Perhaps it is an attempt at one-upmanship or is it a case of not dealing with matters on time?  A further amendment was submitted this morning.  The Minister has a long list of amendments he wants to make on the advice of the Attorney General's office.  Why not make the little change we propose and put this matter beyond doubt?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> I agree with Deputy Shatter that the Attorney General may be correct in most cases, but there can be doubt and I do not want that to be the case.  The Minister should note the concerns expressed by Members from both sides on Committee Stage.  He has stated that a large number of people will have to go to court, but if the date were put back to 31 December, as suggested by us, the matter would be resolved.  If he is not disposed to doing that he should accept Deputy Shatter's suggestion and state that, for the avoidance of doubt, these cases will be regarded as valid.  I merely want the Minister to do something about the matter.  If he fails to do something now, will he at least reconsider the matter before the Bill is taken in the Seanad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Subsequent to a grant of divorce, or of an order for judicial separation made under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 if a non-custodial parent does not have or is not exercising a right of access to any child of the family, the parents of the non-custodial parent may apply to the court on notice to the custodial parent for an order granting a right of access to the child concerned for the purpose of maintaining the child's relationships with his or her extended family and the court may where it thinks appropriate grant such access having regard to the provisions of the Act of 1964.</P>
      <P>(4) Where parents of the non-custodial parent are dead or do not reside in this jurisdiction or are otherwise unable to make application under subsection (3) of this section, such application may be made by a brother or sister of the non-custodial parent.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the parents of the non-custodial parent and seeks to provide that they may apply to the court on notice to the custodial parent for an order granting a right of access to the child concerned.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the extended family and extended relationships in our society.  We have a good reputation, experience and tradition in the area of the extended family where brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and grandparents take an interest in the family at large.  When difficulties arise, such as marriage breakdown, where the non-custodial parent is not given custoday of the child because he or she is on <Col N="537" /> drugs or for some other good reason, the court, if it considers it appropriate, should be able to give a right of access to the parents of the non-custodial parent, the grandparents.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the protection of children from drugs.  We have heard a great deal in the House about meetings taking place in particular communities in Dublin where heroin is rampant. I am pleased that rehabilitative and other measures taken to address that problem in my community are working well.  One of the reasons for that is the young people affected tend to be older, ranging in age from 17 to 22.  In some communities young children ranging in age from 13 to 15 are affected by drugs and the difficulties in those areas are much greater.  We have seen television broadcasts of marches against drugs, but the television media missed one of biggest marches that took place on the north side of Dublin the night before last.  I attended that meeting but not the march that followed it.  In that area many of those affected by drugs are very young and many come from marriages that have broken down.</P>
    <P>The role of the grandparents in those circumstances is particularly important and that is not adequately recognised.  I am sure the report that will be published by the Commission on the Family &mdash; an interim report is due at the end of October &mdash; will highlight the role of the grandparents and the extended family in our society as one of our great traditions and strengths.  Since we value the protection of children and are greatly concerned about their development and given that caring, loving and sharing starts at the cradle and continues through the teenage years into adulthood, we must recognise that the grandparents on both sides can play a vital role.  Especially when a child feels isolated, bewildered and lacks self-esteem where there is conflict in a marriage.  If research on children from broken marriages and on children taking drugs is analysed, the lack of self esteem repeatedly occurs as an important factor.  The way to overcome this is to nurture, <Col N="538" /> develop and support children.  Many grandparents do this.  It is unrecognised but, nevertheless it is a very important contribution.</P>
    <P>We want to allow the courts to give a right of access to the parents of the non custodial parent, not necessarily as a guardian and not to interfere, but to be in a position to maintain the relationships. We are referring to a right of access which the court would consider to be appropriate.  At present it is exceptional to allow for a custody order without guardianship.  However, we are not referring to guardianship but to the normal relations which should be available to children and to building their self esteem which is so important to them in their development.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that we propose this amendment.  It is an important issue to consider at this stage, especially given the enactment of this legislation.  The provisions of the amendment are worth-while. It will be for the courts to make judgements in the different circumstances which arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There are fears that divorce will affect the family unit.  When considering the family unit we should think of the extended family, not just the nuclear family.  My children have the great benefit of having their grandparents, my parents, living with them.  It is wonderful for my parents.  It is a maintenance of the extended family unit.  There is great fear among many people that, in the event of divorce, grandparents especially will lose touch with their grandchildren, something none of us wants.</P>
      <P>When responding to this amendment on Committee Stage the Minister rightly acknowledged that it was desirable that grandparents, aunts or uncles should be able to apply to the court in their own right for access to a child.  However, he went on to say that the circumstances were difficult in this case and the matter could perhaps be dealt with within the framework of the proposed Children Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> I am disappointed he could not deal with the issue now.  It is pertinent to the issue of divorce and should be included within the framework of this Bill.  Will the Minister reconsider his decision?  It will be of benefit to children to ensure that their relatives, especially their grandparents, will have access as a right. This is not a question of guardianship; it is concerned with access.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to allow the parents, a brother or sister of a separated or divorced person in certain circumstances to apply to the court for access to that person's child.  The advice available to me is that since the constitutional rights of parents are wide ranging, several matters would require to be considered before provision of the kind proposed in this amendment could be acceptable.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that situations could arise whereby third parties would have the right to interfere in the affairs of a family unit recognised and protected by the Constitution.  However, where what is proposed is a relatively narrow right to apply for access only, a right that would not extend to other aspects of a child's welfare, such as custody, schooling and so on, the difficulties may be diminished.</P>
      <P>The legal issues are, nevertheless, being further examined and I am confident it may be possible to devise provisions which will contain appropriate safeguards and which will prove to be legally sound.  I am not in a position to bring forward those provisions in the context of this Bill, but I propose to do so, if found to be feasible, in the context of the proposed Children Bill.  I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept the amendment now but I assure the Deputy I am well disposed to the principle of the amendment and intend to do what I can about it in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comments but regret he is not in a <Col N="540" /> position to take the limited action proposed by this amendment.  It is directly relevant to this legislation and is a very narrow and restricted form of access. The point is well understood, but it is unfortunate and regrettable that it is not possible to include it in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments about including such a measure in the proposed Children Bill.  However, given its relevance to this legislation it would be preferable to deal with it here.  It would reassure the public.  When a referendum was decided upon we said if the people voted in favour of a divorce jurisdiction we would introduce safeguards with the necessary legislation.  It would, therefore, be more reassuring to have these safeguards included in this legislation, rather than saying, as we appear to repeatedly say, that it will be included with other measures.  We would keep faith with the public in a more direct and honest way by introducing these measures in conjunction with the legislation providing for divorce. While recognising the Minister's sympathetic approach, in this respect we shall have to await the forthcoming Children Bill.</P>

      <P>We proceed to amendment No. 5.  I observe that amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 10 to 13, <Col N="541" /> inclusive, are related and can be discussed together if that is satisfactory. Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 36, after &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and by a certificate signed by a person qualified to help to effect a reconciliation between the spouses, that the applicant has attended that person and has discussed the possibility of a reconciliation, and where appropriate a certificate signed by a person qualified to provide a mediation service, that the applicant has discussed with that person the possibility of engaging in mediation to help effect a separation (if the spouses are not separated) or a divorce on a basis agreed between the applicant and the other spouse.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This series of amendments deals with counselling and mediation to which we are very strongly committed.  We engaged in much research on the constitutional amendments put to the electorate by way of referendum.  Even before then we engaged in much research and constantly found that counselling and mediation were considered crucial.  While aware that the previous and present Governments invested greater funds for this purpose our difficulty arises from beginning from such a low base and moving suddenly into a divorce jurisdiction when events will happen quickly and large numbers of cases arise.  We are aware of that fact from the Legal Aid Board and those already legally separated who have indicated a wish to engage in divorce proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement for counselling and mediation incorporated in the Bill is of a token nature only.  In present circumstances a solicitor must merely inform a couple of the names of counsellors, presumably by showing them a list.  Other amendments have been tabled in relation to the preparation of such a list. We contend that that requirement is much too important and valuable not to <Col N="542" /> be mandatory.  Therefore, we propose that an obligation be placed on spouses in divorce proceedings to attend a counsellor and subsequently to present to their solicitor a certificate testifying that they have engaged in discussions and resorted to counselling before continuing with divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>My amendments place an obligation on spouses in divorce proceedings to authenticate attendance with a counsellor to discuss the possibility of reconciliation. In the event of such consultation proving unsuccessful, these amendments would place an obligation on couples to attend mediation discussions to help resolve disputes and conflicts arising from marital breakdown, separation or divorce.  We regard this requirement as very much better than that incorporated in the Bill.  While the Minister may well reply that this would mean that everybody must resort to counselling, that is exactly what we recommend. It is the advised course of action worldwide.</P>
    <P>The whole point of insisting on a four-year waiting period and the other clauses in the constitutional amendment was to allow for a lengthy interval between the initiation of conflict and finding a possible resolution.  During this time it is thought that a good deal of the bitterness and anger surrounding the conflict may well have waned, allowing couples an opportunity to reevaluate their overall position.  To allow this take place, we contend the Bill must stipulate a requirement on couples to engage in counselling.  Surveys undertaken over many years have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of couples who remarried later regretted the breakdown of their first marriage, feeling that insufficient had been done to attempt a reconciliation.  The constitutional requirement ensures a four-year interval, backed up by our requirement for counselling and, if necessary, mediation.</P>
    <P>In Australia the Family Law Act, 1975 established mandatory court-annexed counselling and concilation services, particularly for children and in <Col N="543" /> the case of property and other matters in dispute.  It will clearly be seen that there is a precedent for compulsory counselling and conciliation.  It was argued in Australia that such services should be provided separately from the courts.  Our amendments would ensure that.  In these cases there is always a question as to whether such counselling should be insisted upon.  All our research prior to the referendum indicated that counselling is vital.  Mediation services are particularly valuable but under the Bill they are only a token and we do not want that.  Amendment No. 5 adds a requirement that the solicitor must receive a certificate to make sure that the counselling actually takes place. I know it is not possible to ensure that the counselling is good or that those involved participate in the best possible way, but we can at least try to ensure in the legislation it takes place and see how we manage in practice after that.</P>
    <P>We all have the same objectives.  We want to save any marriages that can be saved and to bring about reconciliation where this can be done.  We want to see mediation rather than conflict.  Parental conflict causes the greatest damage to children.  In our survey on world-wide research on this problem, the need to avoid conflict between parents arose time and again.  If parents are to separate or divorce, so be it, but everything possible must be done to ensure that conflict is reduced.</P>
    <P>Mediation is one of the processes which reduces conflict.  Counselling is a very important process and if a couple decide to separate mediation becomes important.  If you can reduce conflict you have some chance of ensuring that the children will have a more normal upbringing.  If this is not done, children suffer more.  This is the area people were most worried about.  I said before the referendum that the result would be very close and the Minister knows that. I said that because people worry about the children.  Basically we have a good family structure and many people come back to Ireland to rear their children. <Col N="544" /> This measure would be helpful to children and that is why we propose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed views about the amendments we are discussing but, on balance it is right to support them. One could talk about taking a horse to water and not making it drink.  The objective of these amendments is not to insert a degree of compulsion but to ensure that mediation is part of the process as far as possible.  That will come about more easily if the route Deputy Woods has suggested is followed.</P>
      <P>Part of the debate we had on the referendum and the Bill centred around the importance of counselling and mediation, not only for the parties directly involved, but for children.  If we are to accept that mediation is part of the process, people should be able to embark upon such a process.  That would improve the Bill and the signals we send out about the importance of this legislation.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this before the referendum and on the Bill, we all considered that the decision of the people on divorce was very close.  I do not think Irish society is deeply divided on this issue.  I have said before and I repeat that I believe for many of us the decision was taken on balance.  We are very concerned about the family and do not want to do anything to disrupt the family unit but we want to show compassion and understanding for those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  We also want to recognise reality, so I do not see any difficulty whatsoever in adopting what might be described as a very conservative approach to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to approach this issue in the most reasonable manner possible and I do not think that what Deputy Woods is looking for is unreasonable.  I do not accept that it must be compulsory, but we must go as far as possible in ensuring that people do not embark upon this process lightly.  The Minister embarked on very conservative methodology on the divorce referendum itself, <Col N="545" /> one which is more conservative than the one I would have chosen, but he should continue along that line by accepting the amendments being put forward here.</P>
    <P>I proposed a subsequent amendment on the regulation of mediation counselling services.  We need to ensure that people are absolutely confident about the whole process.  For that reason, even though as I say it might be going a little further than might appear necessary, we should be open minded when looking at these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are replicas of amendments which were discussed in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  As I stated on Committee Stage, the amendments appear to serve no particular purpose in a context in which counselling and mediation, as in the case under the Bill, is envisaged as a process to be engaged in by parties on a voluntary basis.  I remain of the view that to require the provision of certificates from counsellors and mediators, as these amendments propose, would only have relevance in circumstances where parties are compelled to undergo counselling to effect a reconciliation and mediation.  I agree that ever effort should be made <Col N="546" /> by parties to effect a reconciliation and, failing that, to engage in mediation to settle terms of separation and divorce. These amendments, however, do not contribute to the reconciliation and mediation process but simply add an unnecessary process of certification. Accordingly, with regret, I oppose the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is meaningless simply to ask a solicitor to ensure that he or she informs people about counselling and counsellors and give them a list. That is merely a token.  We want to ensure that counselling takes place.  It is not possible to ensure the behaviour of people when they go to counselling, that is a matter for themselves, but at least as part of the process leading to divorce people should participate in counselling. is a matter for themselves, but at least as part of the process leading to divorce people should participate in counselling. For that reason, we wish to create an obligation to attend a counselling session.</P>
      <P>There is a difference of opinion on this issue.  What the Minister has suggested in the Bill is mere tokenism and that will be seen in time.  We suggest that there be a procedure which provides for counselling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 9, after line 47, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister may make regulations providing for the establishment of a register of persons qualified to help to effect a reconciliation between spouses who have become estranged or to provide a mediation service for spouses who have become estranged.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The issue of who is qualified in the area of mediation and counselling is extremely important.  The Bill before us places great emphasis on mediation and reconciliation but there is not any provision made for the regulation of those professions.  I ask the Minister to recognise this and make regulations in this area.  Obviously, in the long-term, more attention will have to be paid to the establishment of recognised training courses for mediators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply to the proposal on Committee Stage the Minister said it would be wrong to think he is in a position to regulate the certification of persons as counsellors or mediators and that the question of who is best qualified to act <Col N="549" /> as a counsellor is best answered by the organisations employing such persons. Unfortunately, the Minister is missing the point I am trying to make.  It is extremely important that the type of service provided is appropriate.  I have some knowledge of this area because in the distant past I was a career guidance counsellor and I know the problems that can arise if inappropriate guidance is given.  That is something to which any professional will admit, particularly those in the area of mediation.  It has been pointed out to me by one particular organisation that in some areas counselling is directed at one individual, but there is a danger that somebody operating under that ethic will impose it in mediation cases where it is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister may have misgivings about the appropriateness of his Department becoming involved in this area but the fact that large sums of money are channelled through his Department to various agencies underlines his responsibility in this regard.  To some extent we are only beginning to recognise the importance of mediation facilities but the Minister should deem it appropriate that regulations be put in place.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's response on Committee Stage.  I sympathise with his reluctance in this regard but as it is his responsibility to fund agencies it is not appropriate for him to simply say that the organisations employing these persons are best suited to decide whether the mediator or counsellor is the right person for the job. There should be a method of regulation to ensure that, in the first instance, the appropriate agencies are given mediation and counselling facilities.  If, at this late stage, the Minister is unwilling or unable to do anything about this issue, my party will table a similar amendment in the Seanad.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the proposal.</P>
    <P>We have already had a debate on the importance of counselling in general and we have voted on an amendment which seeks to ensure that people go <Col N="550" /> through that process, but once they are engaged in that process it is vital that it is appropriate to their particular circumstances. I ask the Minister to accept responsibility for this area.  If he does not agree it is appropriate to his Department, I ask him to ensure somebody takes responsibility for this area as it is too important to be left to the organisations involved.  Regulatory bodies exist in other areas and there is recognition of the expertise of professionals.  It is important, therefore, to have a similar attitude with regard to this area.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and come back with a more positive response than we had on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would allow the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to make regulations establishing a register of persons qualified in the fields of counselling and mediation. In effect, it suggests that I have a role in the regulation and certification of persons as counsellors or mediators.  While my Department has certain responsibilities which relate to the funding of marriage counselling organisations as well as the funding and administration of the family mediation service, I am unable to agree that it is or should be a function of my Department to establish a national register of persons who are deemed to be properly qualified to practise as family counsellors or mediators. I remain of the view that the question of who is or who is not qualified to act as a counsellor or as a mediator is best answered by the organisations which engage those persons.  I am aware that mediators, through the Mediators' Institute of Ireland, have set standards necessary for accreditation and training of mediators.  That is the best way to proceed.  Organisations involved in counselling and mediation are in the best position to set standards and qualifications for persons engaged in the provision of such services and I cannot accept there is a need for me, as Minister, to intervene in such a system.  With <Col N="551" /> regret, therefore, I must oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister is taking that approach to this issue.  I agree with him there are professional organisations who have provided certified lists of counsellors but there is a need to have a comprehensive register which covers all the people involved and the different organisations.  The Minister does not necessarily have to set the standards; these organisations will provide the relevant information in that regard.  There are various ways in which the Minister can deal with the issue without becoming too deeply involved in it.  It is crucial that there is a recognised register of duly accredited and qualified people to work as mediators and counsellors.  Without such a register we will be left with lists of various kinds but this matter is too important to be dealt with in that way.  I do not believe it would be a great burden on the Minister's Department to oversee the establishment of such a register.  Somebody will have to do it.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept part of what the Minister has said.  Deputy Woods is correct; I am not suggesting the Minister should be responsible for the evaluation of these persons but people who have embarked upon the type of course that is appropriate should be registered by his Department.  I am not asking that the Department be the examining body in this regard but that there should be a register of those people who are appropriately trained.  I have already made the point that some people might put themselves forward as being appropriately trained but that may not be the case.  The simplest way of dealing with this matter is to have a register of people who have attended the recognised course and achieved the appropriate standards.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 33, after &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and by a certificate signed by a person qualified to help to effect a reconciliation between the spouses, that the respondent has attended that person and has discussed the possibility of a reconciliation, and where appropriate a certificate signed by a person qualified to provide a mediation service, that the respondent has discussed with that person the possibility of engaging in mediation to help effect a separation (if the spouses are not separated) or a divorce on a basis agreed between the respondent and the other spouse&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where an application is made to the court for the grant of a decree of divorce, or prior to the hearing of such application, an application is made to the court for an order under Part III, the court may, if it thinks fit, inquire into the matters certified in accordance with section 5 (4) (a) or section 6 (4) (a); and if the court is not satisfied that the requirements of section 5 (2) and (3), or, as the case may be, section 6 (2) and (3) have not been adequately met, the court may adjourn the proceedings until such time as it is satisfied that those requirements have been met.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill require a <Col N="553" /> solicitor to certify that he or she has discussed with the client the possibility of reconciliation, the possibility of a mediated settlement and the possibility of effecting a separation by agreement and the alternative of a judicial separation. There is no mechanism for the court to satisfy itself that this has been adequately done.  Concerns have been expressed that these will be treated as a formality.  I am anxious to ensure that this does not happen.  The amendment proposes to empower the court to adjourn proceedings until such time as the requirements have been complied with.  It is a reasonable request and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to allow the court to adjourn divorce proceedings where the court is satisfied that a solicitor has not met the requirements in sections 5 and 6 which provide safeguards to ensure the awareness of the parties involved of alternatives to those proceedings.  The amendment is a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment.  In committee I indicated that the effect of sections 5 (4) (a) and 6 (4) (a) as they stand is that where a solicitor does not submit a certificate indicating that the requirements set down in sections 5 and 6 have been complied with, the court may adjourn the proceedings to enable the requirements of those sections to be met. Because the amendment did not appear to add anything to the operation of sections 5 and 6, I did not support it then.  I regret that, likewise, I cannot support it now.</P>

      <P>The Minister undertook on Committee Stage to look at the separation of the Church and State in this matter.  Perhaps it would be more fruitful at this stage if the Minister told us his conclusions, having looked at the question. As it stands the section is bald and unequivocal in its effect.  The Minister said he would see if it could be stated in any other way to make the position clear and avoid subsequent confusion. Perhaps it would be best to hear the Minister at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this amendment on Committee Stage, Deputy Woods indicated that the intention was to further underline the fact that the effect of the decree of divorce to be granted under the provisions in the Bill was to dissolve the civil aspects of a marriage.  I undertook to consider the <Col N="555" /> amendment further in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman.  On the basis of those consultations, I am satisfied that there is no need for the amendment. The Bill makes provision for the dissolution of civil marriages by our courts.  It does not concern itself with any other issues such as, for example, the validity or otherwise of marriages under Church law.  The purposes and effect of the Bill are, therefore, clear. Accordingly, I cannot support the suggested amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;In any proceedings brought under this Act which affect, or may affect, a child, the court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> where it is satisfied that it is in the child's interests and in the interests of justice to do so.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad we reached this amendment which is extremely important.  We must be aware of the needs of children and ensure that their rights are safeguarded as far as possible.  On Committee Stage the Minister very generously agreed to consider this amendment for Report Stage, I would remind the House the Law Reform Commission pointed out the need for this provision in many types of case.  In these circumstances, we should be guided by its words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court might be anxious to ascertain the child's preferences in a case where, although the child was not mature enough to instruct a solicitor directly, important evidence could be <Col N="556" /> introduced by a social worker who could gradually gain the child's confidence. There might be a need for an in-depth background report over and above that envisaged in section 47 of the Family Law Act.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i> is not a substitute for a legal representative but should be an option where the court considers that something more than the standard social report is required for its adjudication.  It is possible to establish an independant panel of social workers from which the court could appoint guardians <i>ad litem.</i>  It is very difficult to over-estimate the care we must take in these circumstances.  I will be very disappointed if the Minister does not take this on board.  I await his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. We attempted to have another amendment introduced but it was ruled out because some day a charge might arise for the State.  We would go further than this because we want a commissioner for children.  That has been ruled out of order because the Government does not want to include it and it would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  The purpose of a commissioner for children is not only to provide the support that would be given by a guardian <i>ad litem</i> but also to provide the resources to look after the children in cases involving marriage breakdown. This was one of the points in our five year plan to go with the referendum.  I am disappointed the Government is not taking it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Government will say it will do something about it on the health side later but I do not agree with that approach.  While a commissioner for children was clearly required to deal with the position of children involved in marriage breakdown, the commissioner should have been provided under this legislation.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i> is a lesser version.  This matter is put on the Order Paper because everybody knows the State has no resources for this area. That is hypocritical from the Government's point of view.  I would rather see <Col N="557" /> the Government proceed with the commissioner for children in the context of the referendum and this legislation.  We support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 which would give the court power to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> in divorce proceedings is a repeat of an amendment which was discussed by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security. I undertook to consider the amendment further in the period between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  To put matters into context I should point out that the welfare of children whose parents experience the trauma of marriage breakdown and who subsequently institute divorce proceedings is a fundamental concern which has been considered in the context of the introduction of divorce legislation.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the Constitution adopted by the people in November last and the Bill before the House are framed to ensure that the welfare of children on dissolution of marriage is protected.  The Bill contains a series of measures which allow the court to make financial, property and other ancillary orders in support of children and makes it plain that a court upon granting a decree of divorce is empowered, where appropriate, to give directions regarding the welfare, custody of or right of access to a child without a separate application having to be made under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. Our separation laws contain broadly similar provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The welfare of children is a major concern to the Government and I, as Minister with some responsibilities in that area, have initiated substantial legislative and administrative measures to deal with those concerns by way of the Maintenance Act, 1994, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, with extra funding for legal aid, counselling and mediation.  That work has not ceased.  A Bill is in the course of being drafted to update aspects of the law on guardianship and custody of and access to children and on <Col N="558" /> the giving of evidence by and in relation to children.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that the Family Law (Divorce) Bill has now been completed in Dáil Éireann and passes to Seanad Éireann for debate.  As Deputies will know the last decade has seen major reform in the area of family law here.  The Family Law (Divorce) Bill in many respects is the culmination of many years of reform.  It is major legislation which gives our courts all the necessary powers to settle the very complex legal matters arising on foot of marriage breakdown and divorce.</P>
      <P>I express my deep appreciation to Deputies on all sides for their many fine contributions.  All the contributions have been beneficial to the Bill.  I believe the Bill as it now stands is faithful to the decision of the people in the referendum and is fully in line with what they voted for last November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding I wish to refer again to the concerns expressed in the course of today's debate in relation to the provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995, regarding notification of intention <Col N="559" /> to marry.  While I dealt at some length with the matter in the debate it is important to dispel any doubts or concerns which may still exist.  I emphasise once again that there are no legal or constitutional difficulties with the operation of the provisions and the exercise by the courts of their jurisdiction under these provisions.  Its operation illustrates the soundness of those provisions and there is no necessity for amending legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>The Bill which was circulated before the referendum was broadly in line with it and was faithful to what went before the people.  Consequently we sought to strengthen the safeguards in this legislation, particularly in relation to children and to counselling and mediation and a number of other matters.  I thank the Minister for listening.  I am disappointed he did not agree with us on some of these issues, particularly on amendment No. 27 which we did not reach and which deals with value-added tax which the Government will charge on what is, in effect, human misery in marriage breakdown. We wanted him to waive it on Committee Stage but I had hoped he might do it here.  It will mean about £6 million on the first 10,000 to 15,000 people who come through the system.  It can now be used to improve the position for those who provide the services for people involved in marriage breakdown. <Col N="560" /> I thank the Minister for his replies and everybody involved.</P>

All parties co-operated in bringing this Bill through the Dáil.  I regret some of the amendments were not accepted but we will have another go at them in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the reality of marital breakdown is dealt with in a caring, professional and effective manner. The Bill recognises that marriage breakdown is a factor of Irish life and that the State must do all in its power to ensure that families suffering the trauma of breakdown and divorce are given every support.  This is why we sought to improve the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Family Law Courts are creaking at the seams and there are fears about the burden imminent divorce cases will impose on them.  We must be conscious of this and make provision for it.  I am glad we have passed the Bill which will now be sent to the Seanad.  I congratulate those members of the Minister's staff who worked so hard on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purposes of this Bill are to provide for the establishment of an independent regulator for the telecommunications sector and to enable the sale of equity in Telecom Éireann, thus allowing the formation of the equity based strategic alliance with the KPN/Telia consortium to be completed. These provisions represent significant <Col N="562" /> changes in the legislative base underpinning the telecommunications sector in Ireland and will have a major impact on its future development.  The Bill lays the foundation for the transition to open competitive markets in the provision of telecommunications services and enables Telecom Éireann to meet the challenges facing it in that new competitive environment.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the provisions of the Bill, I would like to explain the background to the legislative proposals contained in it in order that the significance of these proposals will be better appreciated.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications industry is a rapidly evolving sector throughout the world and it will have an increasingly important role to play in all aspects of modern society.  There are a number of forces driving this rapid change.  First, developments in technology are increasing capacity, reducing costs and extending the range of services on offer. Second, the growth of the services sector throughout the world requires more and more information transfers.  Third, communications are becoming a necessity in the modern world, not only for economic reasons but also for social, personal and leisure time purposes. These forces of change are calling into question the current structure of the telecommunications industry and are creating new opportunities and threats for all players in the industry.</P>
    <P>In the past, the most widespread organisational structure for telecommunications was an integrated State owned monopoly operating solely in the home market.  Arguably, this was the most efficient system available given the state of the technology, investment risk, resources available and the state of economic and market development at the time.  Now, new service providers have the technical and economic means to compete against the public telecommunications operator.  Alternative telecommunications networks can be developed and operated separately but be integrated with the public network: the globalisation of business requires <Col N="563" /> advanced international services and growing demand for telecommunications services requires speedy responses to customer needs.</P>
    <P>Governments throughout the world are responding to and facilitating these developments by liberalising the industry, involving the restructuring of the ownership and control of telecommunications operators and opening up the markets to competition.  All these developments are facilitating and are being facilitated by the development of the information society which will fundamentally transform major aspects of the modern world-work, lifestyles and Government services.  The information society is generating a wealth of debate and study worldwide.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the Information Society Steering Group appointed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is currently developing a proposed strategy for Ireland.  There are many uncer-currently developing a proposed strategy for Ireland.  There are many uncertainties about the nature of the evolution of the information society at present but it is clear that it will generate opportunities and threats for economies as well as telecommunications operators and it is important that Ireland seeks to maximise the opportunities presented by the information society and to minimise the threats. Another certainty about the information society is the requirement for a top class telecommunications sector if Ireland is to maximise the opportunities presented by it.</P>
    <P>The development of the telecommunications sector in Ireland takes place in the context of developments at EU level.  The European Commission has been the driving force behind the liberalisation of telecommunications in the European Union generally.  The process commenced in the second half of the 1980s when the Commission proposed, and the Council adopted, the first tentative step with the removal of monopoly rights in relation to the supply of terminal equipment.  However, political agreement on full liberalisation of services was not achieved until June <Col N="564" /> 1993 when the Council of Ministers agreed that the key voice telephony market would be opened to the full rigours of competition from 1 January 1998 in the EU generally but with scope for deferment for certain member states, including Ireland.  A further political agreement was reached in November 1994 on a similar timeframe for liberalisation of telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Commission has now adopted a series of directives which provide for the removal of monopoly and special rights in the sector on a phased basis.  Data and value added services were liberalised in 1990 while satellite and mobile telecommunications services were liberalised in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Provision has also been made to enable cable television network operators to provide services other than voice telephony over their networks.  Finally, a directive is now in place which obliges member states to implement full liberalisation by 1 January 1998 subject to the deferment provisions which apply to Ireland and others.</P>
    <P>The process of achieving the transition of the sector from the traditional monopoly structure to a competitive regime requires the development and implementation of a comprehensive regulatory package.  The task of developing the regulatory package to ensure that competition is effective and that regulatory measures are uniform throughout the Union falls to the Council and Parliament.  This package includes, in particular, measures to ensure new service providers have access to the networks of dominant market players, that is, generally speaking, the former monopoly operators.  It also includes a directive dealing with interconnection and universal service which seeks on the one hand to establish a framework for commercial agreements between competing operators to ensure interoperability of networks and services and, on the other, to ensure the provision of universal service on a clearly costed and transparent basis. Finally, a directive is proposed to ensure <Col N="565" /> a harmonised approach to the licensing of telecommunications services in order to ensure that there are no bureaucratic barriers to market access.  During the course of the Irish Presidency I am actively pursuing progress on these initiatives so that they can be adopted and transposed into national legislation before liberalisation.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the central economic importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy, condemns the Government for its failure to deal with the BSE crisis since 20 March last, deplores the failure of the Government to clarify Ireland's position in relation to the EU Commission's proposals to re-organise the beef regime under the Common Agricultural Policy and calls on the Government to defend and protect the interests of the Irish beef sector in the present negotiations before the viability of thousands of Irish farm families is fatally undermined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the House's first opportunity since the recess to debate the crisis affecting the country's biggest industry.  Since 20 March last BSE has been the most serious problem facing the Irish economy.  It has been serious for all economic sectors, but it has been a catastrophe for farming.  In the past six months the problem has worsened rather than diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> From the start of the BSE crisis, scientific evidence has been thrown around like snuff at a wake.  There is a clear, but as yet unanswered, need to collate the available scientific evidence in one authoritative forum.  This offers to the Irish Presidency an issue on which to achieve progress.  Inexplicably, the Minister has refused the opportunity. If a credible forum were in session, the Oxford study could not have been used recently as a spanner in the works by the UK.</P>
    <P>The Florence Summit of 21 June was the only occasion on which a coherent strategy emerged regarding the BSE crisis.  Agreement was reached after months of hesitancy and disagreement.  It was followed by a package of measures agreed by the farm Ministers in Luxembourg the next week.  In retrospect, the Florence Summit was the high point of the efforts of governments to forge a solution to the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>The package of measures agreed at Luxembourg, worth £70 million in the face of losses approaching £200 million, was inadequate.  It has since emerged that its administration has been blatantly unfair.  When one considers that farmers were suffering losses of over £200 a head, the suggestion that a top up suckler cow premium of £22.40 or a special beef premium of £15.08 would in some way render viable farmers who were losing their shirts at marts and meat factories throughout the country was just another attempt to turn an abysmal failure in negotiating terms into a success.</P>
    <P>When one considers that the £13 million discretionary grant given to the Minister, which was supposed to be targeted at those who suffered most, went to the wrong people, it gives an indication of the type of administrative chaos, political mismanagement and incompetence that lies at the heart of how the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Government has handled the issue.  While farmers sold cattle at marts, it was to dealers that the Minister, Deputy Yates, chose to direct the <Col N="567" /> discretionary funds.  It was always within the capacity of the Department to avoid that scenario and ICOS offered its logistical support to assist in making proper payments.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler's proposals were published at the end of July.  Apart from an unfulfilled promise to bring forward his own proposals, to date there has been no intelligible response to the proposals by the Minister, Deputy Yates, or the Government.  The only quoted response so far has been that the proposals are &ldquo;not radical enough&rdquo;.  The Minister should use this opportunity to state the Government's exact position in relation to the serious measures which emphasise the issue of controlling supply but which do not do enough regarding increasing consumption.</P>
    <P>At EU level it is a measure of the Minister's Presidency of the Council that he has proven totally unable to achieve a consensus of views on the action required to deal with BSE.  Having in the Presidency achieved the ultimate post of political responsibility, the Minister, Deputy Yates, failed in his fundamental political responsibility to forge a working agenda.  This failure was fully evident in Killarney earlier this week.  The Fischler proposals demonstrate the extent to which the Government has failed to impress on the Commission the special dependence of Ireland on beef, and the export of beef in particular.  The failure to date to make any cogent response to the proposals has allowed what is known as the herd option to gain ground.  This option, for the slaughter of calves, is equivalent to eating seed corn.  The beef sector would not be the main beneficiaries of compensation under such a policy initiative and it would undermine the cattle industry for years to come, having spent millions building up a suckler cow herd.</P>
    <P>There is a good news story about Irish beef which has not been told.  Ireland has an extensive grass-based industry, producing quality beef in an environmentally friendly manner.  The need to <Col N="568" /> secure recognition of our particular dependence on the beef sector and the extensive nature of that sector is an overriding policy imperative.  Some 94,000 Irish farmers qualify for extensification payments.  Just as BSE is not a problem of our making, intensive oversupply is not a feature of Irish farming.</P>
    <P>Ireland should also exploit the advantages enjoyed as a grass-based industry which produces a quality product in an environmentally friendly manner.  In the position paper on the reform of the beef regime, Commissioner Fischler put heavy emphasis on a future link between direct payments and environmental concerns.  The Government has failed to exploit Ireland's advantage on the quality environment issue.  If consumers are to be assured about the production process, cattle rearing across Europe must move to something closer to the Irish model.  Irish style non-intensive cattle production would do more for consumer confidence than the panic reaction control measures being mooted.</P>
    <P>The Minister assures farmers that nothing decided by the EU will hurt Irish farmers, yet in the same breath he wants farmers to take a beef price of 82p a pound.  If that is to be the price of beef, there must be full compensation measures for farmers.  I demand that the Minister spell out his bottom line.  If the price of beef is to be permanently positioned downwards, he must produce proposals for compensation.  Even the Minister's friends in the media are starting to wonder about the Minister's exact strategy.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out that in 1983 beef was £1 a pound.  There is no point in the Minister, Deputy Yates, wringing his hands, saying beef producers must learn to live with 82p pound and that nothing can be done about it.  They say much can be done about it because, as the Minister said, it is a managed market.  If it has been a managed market since our export market was closed because of the bungling of the UK position, why does the beef management committee not <Col N="569" /> appear to favour in any way Ireland's position in relation to price?</P>
    <P>As President of the Council of Ministers and the beef management committee, which has effectively decided the price of beef throughout Europe for the last six months, one would have expected some degree of Irish influence in terms of the type of price mechanisms it is suggesting at present.  A price of 82p a pound is way below anything suggested in the CAP reforms under the Fianna Fáil Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry.  When one takes into account the devaluation which has taken place since 1992, there is no question but that, at a minimum in a managed market, the price of processed beef should not be below 90-92p a pound.</P>
    <P>The Minister is representing our national interest at beef management committee meetings, presumably under political direction to fight Ireland's corner on behalf of the Government, but we have ended up with an uneconomic and non-viable price for Irish beef in a managed situation.  I call on the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Administration to start influencing what is happening at official level in Europe through the beef management committee. It is deciding the price of beef and putting an increasing number of farmers into a non-viable position to the extent that thousands of farmers and farm livelihoods are at risk as a result of the bureaucratic bungling which is ongoing in the managed market situation.</P>
    <P>The political failure of the Minister's Presidency of the Council goes beyond his failure to achieve any worth-while progress on that front.  On his watch, the Florence agreement unravelled. Incapable of any positive achievement, his resources were inadequate to shore up existing measures.  The failure to uphold, not to speak of enforce, the Florence agreement has ensured that no decisions have been taken to actively tackle the BSE crisis.  The Minister's statement that the agreed cull in the UK was a matter for them and that they were entitled to renege on the Florence <Col N="570" /> agreement was appalling political cowardice. When leadership was required all the Minister had to offer was damage limitation.</P>
    <P>The unravelling of the Florence agreement must also weigh heavily on the Taoiseach.  We were told the EU Presidency would help Irish agriculture, not hinder it.  The agreement was reached by the heads of Government and the Taoiseach took his full share of credit at the time.  It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach has not been involved in efforts to resolve the crisis. His recent reticence is only the latest in a series of no shows on the BSE crisis from either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the EU market for beef has contracted sharply because of BSE, the opportunity for exports to third countries has become a life and death issue for our cattle trade.  In the six months that have elapsed the Minister has made two forays.  He visited Russia where we have an operating market.  I am anxious to hear his prognosis of sales for Irish beef to Russia in the comming months.  The Minister's other trip was to Libya but, following a long delay, it transpired to be politically under-resourced.  He was unable to speak with authority on issues of interest to Libya, returned empty handed and his promise of future developments remains unfulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within three weeks of the BSE crisis erupting on 20 March, Fianna Fáil took the initiative and went to Iran to assist our beef exporters.  The Minister's spin doctors said our visit was unnecessary. He told the local and national media that the issues outstanding with Iran were minor and would be resolved within weeks.  That was the official line and I refer the Minister to news reports on television and radio while we were away.  However, those issues are still outstanding.  A ministerial visit to Iran has not taken place and there has not <Col N="571" /> been a meeting of the Joint Trade Commission, despite our advice to the Taoiseach on Question Time in the House. The record will show that I asked him to make sure that our visit would be followed up by a ministerial visit or by a meeting of the Joint Trade Commission which was set up under the direction of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to improve trade between Ireland and Iran, but nothing happened.  As the Tánaiste was not prepared to put the national interests before a concern about what people might think of him visiting Iran prior to holding the Presidency of the Council, I subsequently asked the Taoiseach to allow the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, meet Mr. Velayati's counterpart at junior Minister level so that a meeting of the Joint Trade Commission could take place.  Based on our face to face contacts over three days last Easter we knew that was the political response required to deal with the issues which, as the Minister had discovered, are not merely technical.</P>
    <P>On my return from Iran, the Minister told me these were technical matters. There are much more than technical issues involved and while Dr. Montelabi will be here next week to deal with those issues, that alone will not reopen the Iranian market for us.  Furthermore, as the most export-dependent beef sector in the European Union, it is appalling that the September contracts with Iran have been secured and, because we were not in the ballpark, we did not get any of them.  We did not make ministerial visits to Iran or hold Joint Trade Commission meetings, a reflection on the incompetence and complacency of this Administration.  Not only has Denmark, which was not in the ballpark last Easter secured a contract for 8,000 tonnes of beef, but New Zealand also secured a major contract with the Islamic Republic of Iran and we know they secured contracts for September and January.  September is almost over and the export of 40,000 cattle, which <Col N="572" /> could have been secured through processing factories here, to the Islamic Republic of Iran is no longer an option for us.  As one who visited Iran and, despite the Minister's attempts to portray otherwise, is seeking to assist the Irish cattle sector in its hour of need as this party has done previously from Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I know the Minister will have to sign more than a Protocol to open up the Iranian market.  The former Minister, Deputy Dukes, who appears to be able to get a half page in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as a sort of desk expert on what is happening, spoke about my naivety and noisy and futile trip.  Before he next goes to press in Independent House, he should telephone the Irish Meat Processors' Association to find out what it thought of Fianna Fáil's trip to clarify the confusion about a consignment of 10,000 tonnes of beef.  He should also ask it about the extent to which Fianna Fáil Members worked with the Iranian Ambassador to ensure payment was ultimately obtained for those consignments.  Furthermore, he should talk to the farm organisations that thanked this party for taking an initiative in the face of the greatest crisis facing our beef sector for more than two decades.  The noise in the wings is coming from Deputy Dukes's door and the futility of the Government to reopen the market with Iran is positive proof of this Administration's inability to deal with the magnitude of the crisis facing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that resolution of the technical issues alone will not make the Iranian market operational.  There must be political progress and, in particular, a meeting of the Joint Trade Commission. Fianna Fáil has repeatedly charged that the Government has failed miserably to act politically to maintain sales of Irish beef to third country markets.  I repeat that charge tonight.  The Minister's travelling circus that recently went around <Col N="573" /> the country creating a world of make-believe included claims from him that it was Government priority at ministerial and diplomatic level to reopen markets in Libya, Iran and Saudi Arabia.  The Minister's visit to Libya was the first diplomatic visit there in the lifetime of this Administration.  I did not conclude from my meeting with the Iranian Ambassador this morning that he believed that this Government considered the Iranian market as a priority. On a couple of occasions during Question Time the Minister queried, in a manner that was not commercially smart, the bona fides of that market.</P>
    <P>Our relations with third countries show the extent to which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have sat out the BSE crisis.  Flights from Farranfore can reach any global destination except a possible beef market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste prefers to carry on his grudge match with the beef trade rather than work in the national interest.  The Taoiseach, carefully handled in a minimalist style of Government, likewise has elected to stay above the fray.  His handlers cannot see any easy points for a budding statesman selling beef and he has been told to stay at home.  The Government's response to the BSE crisis has been minimal and the results have been nil.  Among the most disturbing aspects of the Government's response to the crisis has been the cynical news management from the Minister, who has repeatedly outlined an imminent doomsday scenario as the months of negotiations have passed.  His cynical tactic has been that anything short of catastrophe makes him look good.  By setting the bottom line so low, effectively he has been selling out the interests of our farmers.  The Minister's overarching concern is to avoid the possibility of a politically damaging defeat at any cost.  To serve this personal political strategy he has perfected to a fine art the tactic of avoiding meaningful political engagement.  Distancing <Col N="574" /> himself from Britain's decision to renege on the Florence agreement is a case in point.  He dumped the national interest and abdicated his responsibilities as President of the Council rather than risk his political capital.  Farmers are the pawns in the Minister's game. As we read in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> he has bigger ambitions but he will always be seen to look good.  Like pawns, they are of little value except for what they can achieve for more important protagonists like himself.</P>
      <P>The most disturbing and cynical of this Minister's pronouncements has been his almost casual prediction of a collapse of farm numbers after BSE.  His speech to the Agricultural Science Association, which was not circulated, stated that the number of full-time farmers could soon be down to 60,000. It was a chilling statement, bereft of any political philosophy worth the name. Not since former Commissioner Mansholt in the 1970s has any political figure suggested this scenario.</P>

      <P>Transforming Ireland from a land with 160,000 family farms to a mere 60,000 holdings may be the Minister's agenda but it is not mine and it is not this party's.  In his time in office his inaction has amounted to a campaign of attrition against small and marginal farms.  Investment schemes put in place to make a viable difference to small enterprises have been allowed wither or collapse.  Resources have been withheld from Teagasc to enable it to fulfil its mandate to smaller enterprises. It is as the Mansholt of the 1990s that the Minister seems to want to be remembered.  The difference is that <Col N="575" /> Mansholt was not allowed to get past talking about his apocalyptic vision for rural communities.  The Minister's handling of the BSE crisis, however, threatens to turn this most appalling of doomsday scenarios into a reality.</P>
      <P>Yesterday was probably the most patronising day of all; in Killarney, the Minister accused farmers of biting the hands that fed them.  They rained on his parade, perhaps, but they cannot be accused of the other offence in his case. In 1994, the last year for which full figures are available, 75,864 farmers received less than £3,000 each from all payments for headage, premia and arable aid.  Some 57,000 farmers received less than £40 per week in direct payments from the EU.  Yet the Minister accuses farmers of biting the hand that feeds them.  He has not been overly generous to many dry stock farmers whose average income is less than one-fifth of the bigger enterprise dairy farmers that the Minister has in mind on most occasions when he speaks about agriculture.  Thousands of dry stock farmers are suffering severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best year was 1995, as a result of the CAP reforms negotiated by Fianna Fáil and instigated and implemented by a Fianna Fáil Commissioner.  However, there were many differences within sectors. One arm of this Government seeks to stereotype the farming community as money grabbing social welfare recipients. These are hard working farm families, many of whom have an average income of £5,000 per annum but luckily having an off-farm income to supplement their holding as they could not rear their families if they were involved in agriculture full-time.  Some 48 per cent of the total number of farmers who received direct income payments when they were at their highest, in 1995, suffered a drop in income.  As I said, those payments are less than £40 per week for 57,000 farmers and for dry stock farmers, that cheque in the post represents 82 per cent of their total farm income, according to Teagasc.  That is how <Col N="576" /> important these issues are for the thousands of farmers throughout this country who are looking for leadership and political will to deal with a crisis of this magnitude.  It ill befits any Minister, particularly an Irish Minister responsible for agriculture, patronisingly to suggest on a plinth that people are biting the hand that feeds them.</P>
    <P>What we have achieved in CAP reform, in order eventually to reduce prices to world levels, is a slow process whereby investment in farming will make it more competitive.  It must be underpinned, however, by a political philosophy that is not as chilling as the one the Minister enunciated last Friday at the Agricultural Science Association. This party will fight tooth and nail to avoid the scenario that only 60,000 people in this country will be able to call themselves farmers.</P>
    <P>This party has been the bedrock in ensuring that small and medium sized enterprises have a prospect of viability and of rearing their families to continue in the tradition that has been dear to them for generations.  In the face of this crisis it does not befit the Minister to suggest that 30,000 farmers can be written off with a stroke of the pen.  That has nothing to do with political leadership; it is the antithesis of what politics is supposed to be about.  This party will stand for a philosophy far different from the Minister's throughout these negotiations and beyond.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has been in charge of the Department it has suffered more industrial chaos than under any of his predecessors.  His bungling, his incompetence and his view of what constitutes modern industrial relations is unbelievable. His description of his staff as &ldquo;opportunists in the extreme&rdquo; is an outrageous claim, even allowing for his personal familiarity with opportunism. He should not abuse hard pressed staff in his Department who are trying to keep the show on the road.  Unlike the Minister, I have spoken to staff members and met them in my home. They are reasonable and would like to resolve this matter with the Minister, if <Col N="577" /> they could speak to him, but not alone has he not done so, he has not spoken to the trade union IMPACT which represents 40 per cent of the Department's staff.</P>

      <P>Those people are trying to keep the intervention grading and carcass classification work going.  The Minister should meet and talk with them, because there is a solution.  The staff told me that at no time did the Minister or anyone with his authority suggest to them that they suspend their action on the basis of re-entering genuine talks.  Yesterday the Minister's spin doctors sought to suggest that informal talks were happening between the trade union and departmental officials but Mr. Paddy Keating of IMPACT had to deny that today.  This is further evidence of how out of touch the Minister is from the real position.</P>
      <P>Those officials get up at 5 a.m. and sometimes do not finish until 10 p.m., having inspected product lines at three or four factories in different locations to ensure processors' tenders are being honoured and steers, heifers and cattle are taken in.  In that section there are 12 vacancies which the Minister has been unable to fill.  It is time we had a realistic idea of what is required to ensure industiral peace so that farmers, who are anxious as we enter the autumn slaughtering season, are not left high and dry as a result of the Minister's administration of his Department.  As I said yesterday, it is time for the Minister to get real and cop himself on.</P>
      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General shows another example of the innovative musings of this Minister in paying last Christmas £600,000 in overtime payments in advance, which still has not been earned.  Instead of lecturing his staff the Minister should start taking lessons in modern industrial relations.  He should ditch his Neanderthal approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> As I pass over to the Leader of the Opposition, I will summarise.  The Council of Ministers has failed to speak with one voice, resulting in the continuation of this crisis, and has failed to satisfy consumers of the safety of beef. Co-ordinated strategies incorporating the scientific evidence have still not been pursued and compensation to date has been totally inadequate.  It is time the Minister stopped posturing as the Mansholt of the 1990s, stopped opening this appalling vista for rural communities and did his job.  The Tánaiste would not even take a question from Deputy Burke about what he as Minister for Foreign Affairs was doing about the Iranian question.  Let us hope there is a stop to this incompetence and that we get down to defending the interests of thousands of Irish livelihoods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will have an opportunity to speak later and we will take great interest in what he has to say.  I support the motion tabled by our agricultural spokesperson. Some of the important points made by Deputy Cowen in the last half hour deserve an answer during this debate, particularly the issues concerning Iran. How has the Government managed to avoid answering the serious questions raised by Deputy Cowen?  Is it not the case that we have lost major contracts in fish, beef and other areas during the past six months that could have been secured if the Government had moved to set up a meeting of the joint commission, which operated successfully for many years since 1980, particularly when Deputy Andrews was Minister for Foreign Affairs?  If nothing else emerges from this debate, I would like an answer from the Minister as to why he is refusing to hold a meeting of the joint commission and who is forcing him not to <Col N="579" /> hold it.  From reading the newspapers the Minister is as aware as I am that the French have gone solo; they are doing their own thing and he is being left behind.  He knows from his French colleague at the meetings yesterday that the French have decided to ignore the European Council Minister's decision and to actively spend their marketing budget to gain access to Middle East markets.  They do not give two damns about what is happening at the Council of Ministers meetings and when they drank the wine and enjoyed the Minister's hospitality, about which I do not have any great difficulty, the Minister allowed the French to make that decision.  We deserve an answer on this matter in this debate.</P>
      <P>BSE has created the worst crisis experienced by Irish farmers in over 20 years.  Nobody in the House disagrees with that because the Minister has talked it up all summer.  All over the country I and my colleagues, whose interest is this debate is evident, have spoken to farmers and farm leaders about what is happening.  They are facing the prospect of serious losses about which nobody disagrees and some farmers may be pushed over the edge.  While some limited measures have been put in place to alleviate the worst effects, the crisis still persists and may well get worse as autumn progresses.  Prices have dropped by at least 16 per cent across the European Union along with the drop in consumption and long-term confidence in the industry is severly affected.  As a country that exports 80 per cent of its beef, we are one of the most vulnerable and worst affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Butchers all over Europe hasten to assure their customers of the local provenance of their beef.  French customers want to eat French beef, Germans want to eat German beef, which in normal circumstances is not in the European spirit, but one can understand why they want to do that.  None of us can say how long this crisis will continue or whether it may be permanent or have permanent long-term effects.  The Minister has <Col N="580" /> access to An Bord Bia's records which show a continuing shift away from red meat.  This might lead to a long-term problem.</P>
    <P>The response at national and European levels has been inadequate and ineffective.  I am not surprised at the anger of Irish farmers yesterday because they have waited patiently for an adequate response for six months. Farmers face the same situation they faced many months ago.  They have put their case for six months, and waited for action, yet as autumn progresses they do not see any measures that will help them.  Very little has been decided and the decisions taken on the British beef cull have now unravelled &mdash; I am sure the Minister will explain the detail of that later.</P>
    <P>Farmers need to know quickly how much additional compensation they will receive.  We need firm decisions from the Council of Ministers so that farmers know the position they face and can make the best plans possible to deal with it.  Their banks are asking those questions and I am sure the Minister is aware of the position the banks are spelling out to farmers.  The Minister will also be aware that although there are many aspects of the economy, most of the key banking economists have been working on agricultural issues only since the summer, considering the position at first hand.  The Minister who is in the Chair needs to give decisive leadership and we will make that point strongly in this debate.</P>
    <P>Some Ministers appear primarily to be treating the Irish Presidency as if it were a tourism promotion or a constituency benefit.  While we would all agree that good hospitality should be provided for our European colleagues, the business in hand must come first and meetings should not be just an excuse for a lavish junket.  I am not referring only to the Council of Agricultural Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Government is doing all it can to open up third markets.  We have had a joint committee for some years and I wish the Minister to spell out the position in that regard. <Col N="581" /> I have made a point on that and I will not pursue the Minister further on it. The French Government decided to target the Middle East with a massive marketing budget and I want to hear the Minister's view on that.  As President of the Council of Ministers, in what way does he feel compelled to stay within the confines set?  On the day other Agricultural Ministers came for the informal council meeting the French, as reported in <i>Le Monde,</i> which I am aware officials in his Department were examining on Monday, acted against the principle of what the Minister was supposed to be trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>We have an independent foreign policy and we should not let anyone else dictate it for us.  Fianna Fáil-led Governments always had good relations with Middle Eastern countries, which helped underpin our beef exports.  Third country exports are vital to our farmers and the Government is not doing enough, presumably because of political difficulties or because somebody is on the telephone telling the Tánaiste not to move.  The position should be spelt out. Let us hear if that is the difficulty, if he is handcuffed or if there are some other inhibitions.  Let us hear why he is refusing to talk to the Iranians.  I gather that the Minister for Agriculture went to Libya a few weeks ago inadequately briefed. It was not his fault because the Department of Foreign Affairs held back on broader political issues on which he should have been able to speak with authority on behalf of the Irish Government.  Perhaps the Department asked him not to comment on matters that were holding up contracts.</P>
    <P>The market ought to some degree to be self-correcting.  If demand falls, retail prices should fall to the point where they begin to push up demand again. There has been a lack of vigour by the Government in encouraging beef promotions and ensuring the price reductions are passed on, if necessary by highlighting profiteering in the retail trade where it is occurring.  During most of the summer is has been left to <Col N="582" /> Members on this side of the House to try to do that.</P>
    <P>If one stands back from the present problem, the absurdity is clear.  There are many risks to life and health but, on present evidence, the chances of catching a new form of CJD is one of the least of them.  There are far more risks associated with smoking cigarettes or driving a car.  There is absolutely no solid evidence to support the theory that an incipient CJD mass epidemic is about to hit us.  It is a wise precaution to eliminate any risk of contaminated foodstuffs, though there are also other theories as to the cause of BSE, and to take measures to rapidly reduce its high incidence in the British herd, with a view to BSE elimination.  However, the positive health effects of eating meat should be highlighted and the fact that the human risk of CJD is statistically tiny.  On present evidence the CJD scare seems a nonsense and it is time to expose it.  Will the Minister explain why European Ministers cannot say that loudly and clearly?  Why keep beating about the bush when there has been only a handful of cases?  Why are we running scared of it?  Where is the evidence? I have tried to read every article written on it and I have listened to all the farming and medical groups.  More people have been shot by contract killers here than have suffered death as a result of contracting CJD.  The Minister should explain why all the European Agricultural Ministers duck the issue and do not put a strong case forward.</P>

      <P>This question has given an unwelcome boost to protectionism in Europe, which the Minister and his ministerial colleagues are allowing to happen under the Presidency.  We thought we had seen the end of protectionism in Europe, but it has re-emerged.  The vacillation of the British Government and its reluctance to keep its agreements are an added problem.  Firmness is required.  Uncertainty is always destructive of confidence.  If a strategy <Col N="583" /> were adhered to, the whole business would cease to occupy the front pages and public fears would recede, but there is no strategy.  That is why we and the Council of Ministers are experiencing deeper problems, not only here but elsewhere throughout the Community.</P>
      <P>Months ago, and long before the Minister took any apparent interest in the matter, I called for Northern Ireland to be treated separately from the UK. I welcome his interest in the plight of Northern farmers, however belated, and I am pleased that he now supports the position I expressed in this House before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>It is clear that as matters stand Irish farmers will lose several hundred million pounds this year with serious knockon effects for the entire Irish economy. If the crisis is prolonged it may be the final blow to the viability of many family farms.  Will the Minister indicate his plans for dealing with the crisis?  The purpose of this debate is to get answers.</P>
      <P>The Minister had an easy time over the MacSharry reforms as the subsidies negotiated by the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, reached their peak and the stringent health regime introduced by the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Senator O'Kennedy, following the wise counsel which he followed in 1988, saved the situation when the BSE crisis first arose.</P>
      <P>The Minister's tactics appear to be the same as the Tories in England: put the gloomiest face on the situation so that the credit may be claimed when matters turn out not quite so badly.</P>

Yesterday's decision amounted to little more than a <Col N="584" /> rearrangement of the deckchairs.  Farm Ministers are not making any serious financial commitments to tie over the difficulty.</P>
      <P>We know that the Minister can preside over good times.  Last year he spent the money that the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, had successfully negotiated. However, he is also good at spreading doom and gloom when the situation gets too much for him.  The BSE crisis is a test of the Minister's mettle.

      <P>The French Agriculture Minister has travelled to the Middle East on a marketing campaign that is contrary to the interests of Irish farmers.

      <P>What is the problem? Listening to the Deputies on the other side of the House, speaking with a degree of political opportunism, one would think that this was a political problem foisted on the farmers of Europe.  The reality is that the biggest single consumer scare on a product in the history of the CAP has occurred. There has been a price to pay for this because consumption has dropped by 16 per cent, not just in Ireland but across Europe.  This is not my fault, nor is it anybody's fault.  The reality is that we have a serious imbalance between production and consumption.  This is a consumer problem.</P>
      <P>I have a clear strategy.  The first step was to reassure people, through An Bord Bia, the diplomatic service, etc., as to the safety of Irish beef.  The next step was to realise that we had a fundamental problem if consumption dropped. When one is already 104 per cent self-sufficient and then becomes 120 per cent self-sufficient in beef in Europe &mdash; we are the biggest beef exporters in the northern hemisphere &mdash; one has a crisis on one's hands.</P>
      <P>The first thing I had to do was to ensure that a floor price was put in place and that a market was found for this beef to replace the consumers who had disappeared.  This is what I have achieved.  First, I have secured the restoration of intervention, which will take up to 1.2 million tonnes of European beef.  We have already taken in excess of 30,000 tonnes here.  Second, I secured a floor price for beef of 82p per lb.  Naturally I would have preferred if it was 92p per lb., but the reality is that it is a floor price above the safety net price &mdash; the 60 per cent of reference price &mdash; agreed by my predecessor under the CAP reform introduced by the former EU Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry.  I did not set the safety net price.  It was a price set by the then EU Council of Ministers and it is worth approximately 78p per lb. to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> I have obtained the agreement of the EU Commission that we will avoid the safety net at all costs.  In recent weeks I obtained a derogation on the weights. We are the only country that has a problem with the heaviest animals in Europe.  Carcase weights have increased by 10 per cent over the past nine years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  Farmers will have to change their breeding and slaughter policies because this is only a temporary derogation.  I have obtained a lifting of a grade restriction on 04 grades and an increase in the processors' margin.  I am hopeful that there will be further progress on these issues on Friday.  I have got the very short-term market managed in a very difficult environment when the EU Commission and others were making it clear that intervention was over.  If one reads over what Mr. MacSharry and others said, it is clear that intervention was to be a vehicle of the past.</P>
      <P>I do not object to Deputy Cowen asking me to clarify my position on the Fischler proposals because I will do so willingly.  However I must answer the question &mdash; what happens this time next year when the intervention stocks are 1.2 million tonnes &mdash; when we are up to the freezing capacity and when there is still over-production?  What will we do with the next million tonnes?  We must cut production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler has introduced proposals to prevent production occurring.  These include the killing of animals at a lighter weight, killing calves and preventing them from turning into adult animals.  This is something I support. I support the concept of cutting production.  However, there are elements of the Commissioner's proposals <i>vis-á-vis</i> extensification premiums and other changes where, following three six hour sessions, there emerged a total dichotomy of views in Europe between intensive and extensive <Col N="588" /> bull beef producers.  My job is to construct a qualified majority of 58 votes because there is a blocking majority in both directions.</P>
    <P>The biggest sufferer from a failure to cut production will be Ireland.  We produce 550,000 tonnes of beef and consume approximately 50,000 tonnes.  We are the European surplus.  Europe has 84 million bovine animals, three million too many.  They must be taken out of the system.</P>

      <P>This is an essential reality and the Deputy would be the first to criticise me if I failed to address these issues now.  I will be unrelenting in the pressure I put on my colleagues on the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers to bring this about.</P>
      <P>Given that there is an unavoidable price drop we have secured the first round of compensation &mdash; £70 million or 10 per cent of the compensation despite the fact that we have 7 per cent of the animals.  For the first time ever money is being paid on our animals exported live, on heifers and bulls.  I secured that compensation.  I am the first to admit there is no way Brussels or anybody else will come up with 7 billion ECUs of compensation for farmers.  The funds are not there.  Before this the total beef budget was 6.7 billion ECUs.  I cannot make money that is not there. especially as 1997 is the reference year for the Maastricht Treaty criteria and budget rebates have been agreed.  I obtained in Killarney £400 million that would have been sent back to member states, which will now be kept in a beef budget awaiting a decision on how it will be spent.  I obtained a raising of the intervention ceiling for an extra 100,000 tonnes of beef.  Allegations to the effect that no decisions were made in Killarney are extremely wide of the mark, as are reports of measures in relation to promotion funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much reference to third country markets.  I have absolutely <Col N="589" /> nothing to hide.  I will tell the House exactly as it is.  The position about Iran is that not a fortnight goes by without my talking to Minister Fooreesch or their ambassador here.  I did not disapprove of Deputy Cowen's trip in any way.  What I said was that to expect, as he appeared to indicate on return, that the Iranian problem would be resolved overnight, was not realistic.</P>

I might remind them that last week he had a lengthy detailed discussion with Minister Velayati about the beef position.  Dr. Montelabi, their chief veterinary officer, said directly to the Irish authorities that he will not lift the ban on Ireland, especially bearing in mind the extra number of cases of BSE.  Deputies opposite will be aware that the number of our animals affected has more than doubled and this, unfortunately, may increase to an even greater extent this year.  It is better to be transparent and eradicate the disease once and for all. Because of our tightly knit population I am very confident that we are in the final phase of eradication.</P>

I am doing everything possible and there is no political problem involved.</P>
      <P>Some of these countries are not democracies and we must remember the enormous responsibility on veterinary officers with regard to safeguarding human health.  Twice in the last three days I was in touch with Minister Faqih in relation to the very difficult position in Saudi Arabia.  France, ourselves and others are caught in a dairy and meat ban at present.  The issues are all technical. The questions they ask <i>via-á-vis</i> the cross-Border position are not political ones.</P>

    <P>I might move on now to the Russian market, the most important one.  I and the Minister of State at my Department have been there.  A veterinary delegation is due to revisit Russia, by far <Col N="591" /> our most important market to which I devote enormous attention.</P>

      <P>In relation to promotion at home, last week I launched a campaign by An Bord Bia costing £500,000 which will continue over the next three months.  The reason it was delayed was that beef consumption picks up in the winter months.  There is a seasonal factor, when children return to school and so on.  It is money well spent.</P>
      <P>Through Europe we give an almost 100 per cent-funded suckler cow premium, headage payments in disadvantaged areas, a ten month premium, a 22 month premium and DSP, which I have secured into the future, amounting to approximately £450 per animal.  Then we give an export subsidy of 64p per pound to get such an animal out to Egypt, which means we are giving over £1,000 for an animal which is worth some £200.  Given the realities of GATT, which stipulates a 21 per cent volume and a 36 per cent value cut in export refunds over a six-year period as negotiated by the Deputy's party in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have set out a clear strategy on the imperative need to cut production. I will take on all comers in so far as it is in the best interests of Irish farmers now and into the future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the detail of the Fischler proposals, I have no particular problem with the single premium.  I am opposed to one aspect of the amendment of the extensification premium.  In relation to the cut in the special beef premium quota, unlike other countries, this is unused quota in Ireland.  If we revert to one million head of cattle it will have been a totally painless cut for us.  In relation to both the calf slaughter and the weanling intervention, the only obligation will be on member states to make it available.  It will be entirely voluntary for farmers but the reality is that there may be many dairy farmers who will twist my arm to gain access to this scheme.  We are not prepared to agree to a price being set for both the weanling intervention and the GATT which would distort our market.  The availability of measures to cut production is not only imperative but is in the best interests of the largest country responsible for the surplus of beef production within the EU.</P>

I am glad Deputy Cowen did not peddle one of the myths he peddled during the summer which was to propose, as some farm organisations have done, that one of the ways of meeting the crisis is for us to begin incinerating culled cow beef.</P>

      <P>I was watching the Deputy speak from Tullamore on the 6.15 p.m. news last Friday.  I was unable to give the interview myself but the Deputy kindly obliged.  Whether or not the Deputy is in favour of this proposal, that we take out culled beef and incinerate it to restore consumer confidence and balance in the marketplace, the Commission is totally opposed to it.  Once one begins, one cannot stop.  People would want to know if beef was edible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cows that live that long without developing BSE are safer than any other animal.  It would be disastrous for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to advocate incinerating cow beef.  We could never sell cow beef again.  Converting culled cows into beef <Col N="594" /> does not solve anything, its removal from the food chain is how the production balance is affected.  Some two million tonnes of cow beef would have to be taken out of the food chain which would cost 3.6 billion ECU and this is totally unaffordable.  I am glad people have pulled back from that proposal.</P>
    <P>The future is about managing change, and that is my responsibility.  We do not have a collapse but the market requires restructuring.  Some three million animals out of 84 million animals is not an unmanageable problem, but we must have equilibrium when the short-term market management measures are no longer available.  This time next year the Russians will say they bought 110,000 tonnes of beef from Ireland worth 325,000 animals, but they may now buy it out of intervention.</P>
    <P>What will be done with this beef in intervention?  Given the GATT import requirement and so on, most of it will have to be put into transformed beef to undercut the imports.  It cannot form part of our GATT quota.  If Deputy Cowen and others know of better ways of cutting production, I am open to constructive suggestions.  I have seen a proposal from the Germans in the last few days in relation to the 500,000 to 1 million imported calves, that we slaughter them at source and pay for them.  We have to address the issue of cutting production when the stop gap measure of intervention, which will create an overhang in the market, is resolved.</P>
    <P>A number of permanent changes will come out of this crisis.  The first change will relate to lighter weights, the second to traceability.  The consumer will demand to know from what animal and farm the joint of meat came.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, since 16 September, I have put in place a new scheme whereby a female animal here cannot be slaughtered unless it can be traced back to the herd.  This is the first step in a detailed programme to have a complete animal passport and system of traceability.  I intend to put a Protocol in place in meat factories in due course. <Col N="595" /> I envisage that in the next three or four weeks the European Commission will publish a labelling directive which will deal with traceability and we will have to make the changes necessary, even though they are very unpopular with farmers and will involve bureaucracy for marts and so on.</P>
    <P>The third change will relate to the rendering industry.  The leader of the Opposition asked me the view on the link between CJD and BSE.  I am not a scientist, but if I was to say where we went wrong in this, I would say that we departed from nature by feeding to animals their own offals.  By next April I can see a new EU Directive being put in place that will mean those offals will have to be removed from the animal food chain.  This creates a major problem for Ireland, because unlike Holland, Britain and France which have national incinerators or a disposal system, we do not.  At the moment depopulated herds and herds which have been caught being smuggled across the Border have to be rendered into meat and bonemeal and stored.  We have no place to dump this at the moment, but I see that changing.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the increased number of BSE cases.  From 17 October next there will be additional controls on mammalian meat and bonemeal and animal feeds containing such meal.  This is set out in a new order under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  This supplements the existing ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to ruminant animals, which was introduced by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy O'Kennedy, in August 1990.  Having looked at the situation and at some of the cases of BSE, I feel this ban has not been properly implemented.  If it is left entirely up to people selling meat and bonemeal, it is not possible to guarantee they will observe the law.  We have records of people buying pig and poultry rations which have meat and bonemeal in them who do not keep pigs or poultry.  The new arrangements involve the introduction of extended controls at <Col N="596" /> various levels including the manufacture, retail and farm stages.</P>
    <P>At manufacturing level, a special licence will be required in future for the manufacture of meat and bonemeal as well as for those engaged in the manufacture of feeding stuffs containing meat and bonemeal intended for feeding to non-ruminant animals or poultry.  Strict controls on the possession of meat and bonemeal at feed manufacturing premises are being introduced and intend that, in future, mills producing feed for ruminants will not be permitted to have meat and bonemeal on their premises.</P>
    <P>A licence will also be required to purchase any such meat and bonemeal with the exception of packages less than 5 kg which would be for horticulture, flower fertiliser and so on.  A licence will not only be necessary to produce it, but to buy meat and bonemeal, which means such products will not be generally available.  Labelling requirements for such packages will be introduced with effect from 1 January 1997.  It will be an offence to sell meat and bonemeal to any person who does not hold a licence, unless it falls within the exception already outlined.</P>
    <P>Stricter controls will also be introduced at farm level.  It will be an offence to feed to a ruminant animal any animal feed which is intended for non ruminant animals or poultry.  Farmers who have cattle, deer, sheep or goats will also require a special licence to have on their land any meat and bonemeal or animal feed in which meat and bonemeal has been incorporated.  Persons who store or transport meat and bonemeal or any animal feed containing meat and bonemeal will be under a strict obligation to ensure that these products do not contaminate any other product so stored or transported.</P>
    <P>The granting of licences will be subject in all cases to requirements as regards the keeping of records which will enable the location and distribution of meat and bonemeal to be verified at all times.  Conditions will also be attached to such licences to ensure proper controls on meat and bonemeal. <Col N="597" /> Additional powers to enforce the terms of the order have been given to officials of the Department and the Garda.  I will make it an absolute priority to ensure that there will be strict compliance with the new controls.  Any person found to have contravened the order will be liable to prosecution and to have his licence revoked.</P>
    <P>Another area that concerns me in relation to the more than 30 cases we have at the moment is that I have heard rumours that an allegation is being made that BSE animals may in some way be traded.  I have no evidence of this, but even hearsay is enough to cause concern.  I am changing the depopulation compensation so that there will be no incentive for anyone to cull cows. Compensation will be not subject to voluntary depopulation negotiation.  Farmers will not have the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry over a barrel in regard to compensation. Depopulation will be compulsory in future.  I am determined to ensure that no question can be raised in that regard.</P>

      <P>A scare story was put out tonight and I would like to deal with it before it gains any credence.</P>
      <P>The IFA conference last Friday was on &ldquo;Irish Agriculture &mdash; Future Policy&rdquo;. I said that by the year 2006, some 60,000 farmers will be able to compete with anyone in the world.  They can produce milk or meat cheaper than anyone else. The rest of our farming population will require either social support or off farm income to survive.  These kind of predictions always involve a certain amount of crystal ball gazing.  The Cummins report made much more drastic predictions at an earlier date as to what would happen. These farmers will be able to compete with an economy of scale and an efficiency of operation as world prices increase and European prices decrease, which is the inevitable trend over the next 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the realities of BSE. The price of poultry and pigmeat, which <Col N="598" /> are more popular than beef, is 68p per pound.  Premiums, which were negotiated under the MacSharry reforms, are worth 26p per pound.  The floor price of beef was due to be decreased even if we never experienced BSE and the world price of beef is 42p per pound.</P>

      <P>The last time the crisis in the beef sector was on the agenda in this Chamber was mid-April.  On that occasion much helpful advice was given to the Minister by all sides of the House and the Minister gave undertakings which we expected would have far-reaching and more dramatic results than we have seen.  It is very interesting to read the Minister's April speech, particularly the amendment tabled by the Government at that time which states: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of the beef industry in Ireland and the essential national interest involved, commends the efforts of the Government to confront the crisis in the industry, to restore consumer confidence in Irish beef and to secure the reopening of vital export markets&rdquo;.  That more than any other statement underlines what the Government considered vitally necessary at the time, but it has sadly failed in that regard.  I will not embarrass the Minister by quoting other excerpts from his speech, which he has great difficulty in living up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> Farmers are looking for action and it is most worrying to hear the Minister engage in a congratulatory spiel which has no substance in terms of results. Irish farmers must accept £200 per head less on average for their animals than they had expected, and that trend seems set to continue.  It affects the ability of farmers to meet bank repayments and other financial obligations and to look after their families.  It is fundamental to farmers continuing in business.  This matter needs to be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>Great hope was placed in the Minister's role as chairman of the Council of Ministers.  He is now considered as a man who looks after the big farmers and he must work to change that perception. Farmers need him to deliver on their behalf.  Not enough attention is given to Ireland's dependence on beef exports. That is the nub of the Government's failure.  The Minister's announcement tonight underlines the wrong direction taken on this issue.  What the Minister should be saying and what can be argued at any forum is that Irish beef, which in the main is produced from grass, is of the highest quality and can be presented anywhere in the world. The Minister's approach suggests that things are still wrong in the Irish beef food chain.  He is continuing to undermine Irish beef here and abroad.</P>
    <P>There is grave concern among farmers &mdash; some of them have told the Minister so directly &mdash; at the cull proposal. They consider it a panic measure which has no short or medium-term benefit and which in the long term undermines the ability of farmers to make an income.  That proposal is doomed to failure.  A huge proportion of farmers' income comes from the EU.  The Minister is in a position to alleviate hardship by bringing forward payments.  That would have been difficult two years ago but the process has been set in train by which it can be done at relatively little cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a grave mistake by engaging in lecturing farmers on the bite-the-hand line, which has invited <Col N="600" /> them to accuse him of wining and dining at taxpayers' expense.  By that approach he has undermined our position in terms of the EU and certainly has not contributed to a united front on the part of farmers and the Department.</P>
    <P>There is grave disappointment that only £70 million of the £700 million compensation package is destined for Ireland and it is entirely the fault of the Minister and the Department that much of it has gone to dealers rather than farmers.  There is a fear that the £400 million in savings, referred to by the Minister, will be likewise divided, that Ireland will get a derisory share and that it will not be directed at those who most deserve it.  It is possible for the Minister and the Department to ensure that we get the greatest amount possible and that it is directed to the right people. Much of the solution to this crisis is in the hands of the Government.  Farmers have every right to be disappointed and feel let down at the manner in which the crisis has been handled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Cowen, Byrne, Nolan and Ellis for giving me the opportunity to contribute on this issue.  The beef crisis has not gone away.  It may have passed on to an extent from winter finishers to suckler cow farmers, but the result is the same &mdash; chronic hardship and serious losses for thousands of individuals and families. The only real answer that can be seen to be given is on the Border.  While the work is often long and tedious for gardaí on duty there, the Garda presence is very welcome and much appreciated, but it is not a long-term solution to the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consumer confidence must be restored and markets reopened.  We must be positive in terms of fully implementing the Abattoirs Act, 1988. We must put in place a full inspectorate to look at each animal entering the factory pre-slaughter, examine the carcase post-slaughter and confidently stamp our beef.  That should be done under the auspices of the local authority to ensure <Col N="601" /> jobs in smaller factories are safeguarded. We do not want a reduction in area aid.  If the £200 or so deficit from each animal is to be met, markets must be opened and consumer confidence restored.  Farmers have already been badly hit by this crisis and money should not be taken out of one pocket to put into another.</P>

If <Col N="602" /> the Minister considers that prime beef cattle are only worth £200 per head the industry is in a serious situation.</P>

      <P>Farmers are losing £300 per head compared with what they were getting in 1993.</P>
      <P>The Minister who has been in office for the past two years asked for suggestions. In Britain, where there is a traditional policy of cheap food, statements have been made which have not been substantiated or confirmed.  We are the victims.</P>
      <P>As President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers which regulates beef marketing in the European Union the Minister has a fundamental duty, irrespective of what happens in a particular member state, to ensure equality of opportunity and that incomes both here and in other member states are protected. He has not told us the whole story.  He has been told by his French and German colleagues on the Council of Ministers that they intend to take unilateral action to subsidise their farmers, irrespective of what decisions are taken at European Union level.  He has a fundamental duty, in the interests of the industry here and across Europe, to ensure that this does not happen.  There are ample resources available to the Commission to pay adequate compensation to those incurring losses.</P>
      <P>There are two issues which the Minister must address.  There must be an aggressive marketing campaign to reassure everybody not alone here but abroad, to maximise market share and ensure an increase in the consumption of beef so that we can continue, as a primary producer, to move animals out of the country.  The Minister must also ensure there is competition between the meat factories and exporters.  No matter what negotiations he enters into with third countries, unless there are adequate transport facilities we will go nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> Are the Government and the European Union committed to resolving this problem?  The Taoiseach, after the Minister, has the ultimate responsibility as head of Government to resolve this problem.  The Tánaiste has never liked the beef industry and has made no major effort to assist the Minister.  The Minister for the Marine has a key role to play in the area of transport and the Minister for Tourism and Trade in the area of marketing, as well as the relevant State agencies, including An Bórd Bia and An Bórd Trachtála, in offering their full support in promoting Irish beef which is the best in the world.  It is vital that money is spent at food fairs and festivals and in markets across the globe.  The industry which is grass based is producing prime steers without the use of additives.  There is no reason we cannot capitalise on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the rendering industry which is in a serious situation. I give him a firm warning that he will create a serious problem if he goes down that road.  In economic, industrial and environmental terms, the industry has a key role to play.  It is important that the Minister is not fooled by those who believe that by bringing in these new mechanisms the problems will be resolved.  If he fails to protect the industry we will be confronted with an environmental disaster.</P>
    <P>During the past year the Minister has advanced £600,000 in overtime payments to staff who have yet to earn it. If he felt duty bound to resolve a crisis for staff of his Department by advancing that sum, he has a moral obligation to pay immediately the premia, headage and other grants to which farmers are entitled.</P>

To ease the burden on farmers who have to meet bank commitments he needs to put cash <Col N="604" /> in their pockets and allow them time and space until we see what he can do within the Government to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>We have done our utmost in Opposition under the leadership of Deputy Bertie Ahern and Deputy Brian Cowen as part of a national effort to try to resolve this crisis.  We have taken and will continue to take a responsible attitude and will support any reasonable efforts to resolve it.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that his Government colleagues do what they can while we hold the Presidency of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Meetings have been held throughout the country.  As far as I am concerned, these were party political meetings.</P>

      <P>The Minister told farmers about a crisis to which he had no solution.  As primary producers, they are depending on the Government to resolve it in a reasonable way.  We are not on our own, we have the European Union behind us.  It is vitally important that a positive approach is taken within the European Union and the Commission to ensure the industry is not destroyed.  It is vitally important also that compensation is paid to farmers regardless of whether they slaughter their animals, sell them in marts or export them.  It should not be paid to any other group.  The Government has a fundamental duty to protect this vital national asset.  We do not want to destroy rural Ireland by driving more people out of the agriculture industry.  It is up to the Minister and his colleagues <Col N="605" /> in Government to ensure that markets are found for our beef to secure the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>There is an air of despondency in the Chamber.  Judging from the mood of the debate and from the Minister's point of view, we are witnessing the demise of the agriculture industry. Because of the way the BSE problem has been handled many beef producers are in a serious position.  Initially, the problem was confined to the 12,000 farmers involved in the finishing sector but down the production line those rearing store cattle or producing calves, be they dairy farmers or suckler cow producers, now find themselves in difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that by the year 2005 or 2006 there will be only 60,000 full-time farmers.</P>

      <P>There was a discussion on Second Stage between me and the Minister of a vigorous kind in relation to whether the relevant section of the amnesty Act permitted a taxpayer's affairs to be reopened if the statement by the person that the moneys in question were not unlawfully obtained by him was proven to be false. It seems to me that this section is to copperfasten that and to make it clear that <Col N="607" /> the waiver Act is to be amended to make it clear and explicit that that is now a ground on which an application can be made to the appeal commissioners to reopen a taxpayer's affairs.  On that understanding I welcome it because there was a possible loophole which ought to be securely closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy McDowell's contribution.  This amendment amends section 5 of the 1993 amnesty legislation, that is, the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act.  As Deputy McDowell has said, there was a vigorous discussion on Second Stage of the Bill on 25 July last. Deputy McDowell put forward a closely argued view of how section 5 of the 1993 Act would operate in relation to certain illegal proceeds.  As the Minister stated in his reply on Second Stage, the position needed to be clarified in view of the differences as to how to interpret the Act and detailed legal advice would be needed.</P>
      <P>Deputies can be assured that money from illegal sources is clearly outside the scope of the incentive amnesty under the 1993 Act.  There is no disagreement on this point.  The only question which arises relates to the procedure by which information or evidence of illegal source of funds is to be obtained.  Some evidence will be available from the Garda and from the operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  The new point, however, is whether the Revenue Commissioners can avail of the investigation procedure in section 5 of the amnesty legislation to secure evidence of illegal source of moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 provides that an inspector will be debarred from continuing an investigation into a taxpayer's affairs in respect of a pre-5 April 1991 period if the taxpayer concerned produces an amnesty certificate received from the chief special collector.  That barrier to the continuation of an investigation does not apply if the inspector can satisfy the appeal commissioners that <Col N="608" /> there are reasonable grounds which indicate that the declaration made by the taxpayer did not contain a full and true statement of the declared amounts.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell was concerned whether the section 5 procedure could apply when what was at issue was the source of the income rather than the amount declared.  The Minister has now received the further legal advice as promised.  The advice is that there is a difficulty with section 5 and the section should be amended.  The effect of the amendment is that there will not be a barrier to the pursuit of an investigation if the appeal commissioners are satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to show that the declaration regarding the source of amnesty funds made by a taxpayer to the chief special collector is false.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment which extends the compensation Act to cover the family of a bureau member and a bureau member who has retired or left the bureau.  An incident which occurred in my constituency of Dublin North-East last year is a classic indication of the necessity for this amendment.  In the estate in which I live indiscriminate gunfire was directed at the window of the home of a Garda inspector.  Fortunately, nobody was injured, but it could easily have caused death or injury to the garda or to a member of his family.  This outrage was linked to drug-related crime in another part of the area in which the garda <Col N="609" /> inspector worked.  He has since retired from the force.  Another amendment to this Bill will ensure that the protection of the Act will extend to former bureau members.</P>
      <P>This amendment also points to the ruthlessness and viciousness of the criminals who are involved in the drug trade &mdash; we have already seen the murder of a journalist.  I also welcome the extension of cover to solicitors in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</P>

It is now thought more appropriate to deal with the possibility of intimidation by introducing a specific subsection which is introduced in amendment No. 1d, which allows the Minister for Social Welfare to transfer cases where the <Col N="610" /> Minister has reasons to suspect that officers of that Department may be subject to intimidation of any kind.

      <P>&ldquo;14.  &mdash;(1) A judge of the District Court, on hearing evidence on oath given by a bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána, may, if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of or relating to assets or proceeds deriving from criminal activities, or to their identity or whereabouts, is to be found in any place, issue a warrant for the search of that place and any person found at that place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent may, subject to subsection (3), if he <Col N="614" /> or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of or relating to assets or proceeds deriving from criminal activities, or to their identity or whereabouts, is to be found in any place, issue a warrant for the search of that place and any person found at that place.</P>
    <P>(3) A bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent shall not issue a search warrant under this section unless he or she is satisfied that circumstances of urgency giving rise to the need for the immediate issue of the search warrant would render it impracticable to apply to a judge of the District Court under this section for a search warrant.</P>
    <P>(4) Subject to subsection (5), a warrant under this section shall be expressed to and shall operate to authorise a named bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána, accompanied by such other persons as the bureau officer thinks necessary, to enter, within one week of the date of issuing of the warrant (if necessary by the use of reasonable force), the place named in the warrant, and to search it and any person found at that place and seize and retain any material found at that place, or any material found in the possession of a person found present at that place at the time of the search, which the officer believes to be evidence of or relating to assets or proceeds deriving from criminal activities, or to their identity or whereabouts.</P>
    <P>(5) Notwithstanding subsection (4), a search warrant issued under subsection (3) shall cease to have effect after a period of 24 hours has elapsed from the time of the issue of the warrant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> (6) A bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána acting under the authority of a warrant under this section may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) require any person present at the place where the search is carried out to give to the officer the person's name and address, and</P>
    <P>(b) arrest without warrant any person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) obstructs or attempts to obstruct that officer or any person accompanying that officer in the carrying out of his or her duties,</P>
    <P>(ii)  fails to comply with a requirement under paragraph (a), or</P>
    <P>(iii) gives a name or address which the officer has reasonable cause for believing is false or misleading.</P>
    <P>(7) A person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct a person acting under the authority of a warrant under this section, who fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (6) (a) or who gives a false or misleading name or address to a bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500, or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 6 months, or to both.</P>
    <P>(8) The power to issue a warrant under this section is in addition to and not in substitution for any power to issue a warrant for the search of any place or person.</P>
    <P>(9) In this section, `place' includes a dwelling.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the bureau with an effective means of investigation into suspected criminal assets.  Clearly a great deal of the work of the bureau will involve complex and painstaking investigations to uncover the existence of criminal <Col N="616" /> assets and to gather sufficient evidence to support administrative proceedings in relation to them.  The circumstances in which funds of this nature are acquired are, particularly secretive, and the manner in which they are held is designed to avoid detection.  It is vital that the bureau should have adequate powers to investigate reasonable suspicions of the existence of criminal assets and to uncover financial trails of evidence leading to and from those assets.  This amendment, therefore, proposes in subsection (1) that a district judge on application from a garda who is a member of the bureau may issue a search warrant if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of or relating to assets or proceeds deriving from criminal activities or their identity or whereabouts is to be found in any place.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) contains an emergency provision similar to that provided for recently in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, permitting the issue of such a warrant by a garda in the bureau not below the rank of superintendent. This is strictly limited by subsection (3) to circumstances of urgency where a search warrant is needed immediately and it would not be practicable to apply to a district judge.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) sets out the effect of a search warrant which is that it allows a garda who is a member of the bureau, accompanied by other persons if necessary, to search the place named in the warrant and any person at the place at the time of the search.  The power in relation to the persons is important as, clearly, it would be self-defeating to allow a search to be frustrated by the simple expedient of a person putting a vital paper or computer disc in his or her pocket.  The garda would be permitted under subsection (4) to seize and retain any material found which he or she believes to be evidence of or relating to assets or proceeds deriving from criminal activities or to their identity or whereabouts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The normal life of a warrant will be one week, but warrants issued by superintendents will, under subsection (5), expire after 24 hours, to emphasise the strictly limited circumstances in which such warrants are contemplated.</P>
    <P>Subsections (6) and (7) provide for the effective execution of search warrants to make it an offence with a power of arrest without warrant for a person to obstruct a search under the warrant or to refuse to give his or her name and address or to give a false or misleading name and address.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) states, for the avoidance of any doubt, that the power to issue a search warrant under this section is in addition to any other search warrant provisions there may be.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) makes it clear, again for the avoidance of doubt, that a search warrant under this section can apply to a private dwelling.</P>

    <P>(2) A person who fails or refuses to give his or her name or address when required under this section or gives a name or address which is false or misleading, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment inserts into the Bill a new section relating to the powers of arrest.  The power of arrest will allow Garda bureau officers to make an arrest in the case of the obstruction, intimidation or assault of a bureau officer or staff member of the bureau.  The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, will provide a power of arrest in all offences where a prison term of at least five years is prescribed on indictment. This will apply to the majority of offences to which this new section applies.  However, it is considered appropriate to provide for the power of arrest in the bureau Bill itself, and this is what this does.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) gives to Garda members of the bureau power to arrest without warrant a person where there is a reasonable cause to suspect that the person has committed or is committing an offence.  Under sections 12, 13 or 14 of the Bill, namely, obstruction, intimidation or assault, or under section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983, namely, certain revenue offences such as knowingly or willingly delivering an incorrect tax return power is also given such that a person can be required to give his or her address to a garda and if the person refuses to do so or the garda reasonably suspects that the name or address is false or misleading, the person may be arrested without warrant.  Subsection (2) makes a refusal by a person to give his or her name and address or giving of a false or misleading name and address an offence in respect of which liability to a <Col N="619" /> fine not exceeding £1,500 arises on summary conviction.  I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I pointed out that I thought the power of arrest was a good idea for the offences under this Bill but I am slightly concerned that I heard the Minister refer to the power of arrest without warrant for somebody who is suspected of making a false tax return.  That is a fairly stringent power.  Whereas we are all for stringency, that is a very wide power. Perhaps the Minister will amplify her reply.  It seems strange that if one is suspected of making a false tax return that one can be arrested without warrant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.  &mdash;Where a person is charged with an offence under section 13 or 14, no further proceedings in the matter (other than any remand in custody or on bail) shall be taken except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment inserts a new section into the Bill.  On Committee Stage some concern was expressed that prosecution under sections 13 and 14 could arise in relation to an assault on or intimidation of a bureau member where there was not any connection between the assault or intimidation and the work of the bureau itself.  I understand that Deputy McDowell was particularly concerned about this.  It was suggested that the <Col N="620" /> consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be required for prosecution of offences under sections 13 and 14 of the Bill.  Those sections relate to assault or intimidation of bureau members or their family.  Because of the severe penalties provided for and the widely drawn nature of the sections it was considered by the committee that it would be a safeguard if the consent of the DPP was required for prosecution. This would ensure that prosecutions were only taken under these sections in respect of assaults on the member or on a bureau officer's family where such assaults were connected to the work of the bureau.  This suggestion of the committee is accepted and the amendment provides that the DPP's consent is required in order that a prosecution can be taken under sections 13 or 14.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;(1) Section 184 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3) (inserted by the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996) of that section:</P>
      <P>`(3)  In this section, &ldquo;information&rdquo; includes information received from a member of the Garda Síochána.'.</P>

    <P>`(b)  In this section, &ldquo;information&rdquo; includes information received from a member of the Garda Síochána.'.</P>
    <P>(3)  Paragraph (d) (inserted by the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996) of subsection (6) of section 12 of the Stamp Act, 1891, is hereby deleted.</P>
    <P>(4)  The proviso to subsection (7) (as amended by the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996) of section 39 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, is hereby deleted.</P>
    <P>(5)  Subsection (2) (as amended by the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996) of section 104 of the Finance Act, 1983, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following proviso for the proviso to that subsection:</P>
    <P>`Provided that the Commissioners may withdraw an assessment made under this subsection and make an assessment of the amount of tax payable on the basis of a return which, in their opinion, represents reasonable compliance with their requirements and which is delivered to the Commissioners within 30 days after the date of the assessment made by the Commissioners pursuant to this subsection.'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment in the form of a new section amends a number of tax provisions which had been amended earlier by sections 5 to 9 of the Disclosure of <Col N="623" /> Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996.  The Minister for Justice has asked that the provisions relating to the passing of Garda information to Revenue in that Act be amended.  The provisions introduced in the 1996 Act clarify that Revenue may use information received from the Garda in making assessments and provide that where Revenue uses such Garda information it may not reveal the Garda source of information except with the permission of the chief superintendent. The Minister for Justice is concerned with the latter provision.  Her concern is that the provisions in relation to the source of information may set an undesirable precedent in criminal justice legislation and undermine the generally accepted practice whereby the Garda can protect its sources.  Accordingly, it has been decided to delete all references to Garda sources introduced in the 1996 Act.  The Garda will introduce administrative procedures governing the level at which information is passed to the Revenue.</P>
    <P>This provision amends a number of taxation provisions relating to the making of assessments on foot of information received in the absence of a return.  Subsection (1) amends section 184 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in relation to the making of an assessment to income tax.  It removes the proviso inserted by the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, stipulating that the source of Garda information used in an assessment could only be released with the consent of the chief superintendent. However, it leaves intact the right of an inspector to use Garda information in making an assessment as provided for in the 1996 Act.  Subsections (2) and (5) make similar provision in the case of assessments relating to corporation tax. stamp duties, capital acquisitions tax and residential property tax respectively.</P>

It is one of the tools which many of us believe is required to get at the assets which criminals possess and may be a significant weapon in dealing with the drug barons.  Heretofore, we have failed, through lack of legislation or whatever, to get at the assets and create the massive disincentive that is necessary to run the drug <Col N="625" /> barons out of this country.  I sincerely hope the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill will make a significant contribution.  I ask the Minister to keep the Bill under review as it becomes operational.  Some amendments or additions may be necessary and if we identify any we will certainly urge the Government to bring them forward.  We urge that the Bill be signed and enacted into law as soon as possible so that the bureau will have the full weight of the law behind it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter.  While I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, I regret the Minister for Education who is directly involved in this matter is not present to hear my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July shockwaves ran through many families when they realised the Minister for Education had reversed her <Col N="626" /> stated policy on gaelscoileanna.  New schools in Ballybrack, Enniscorthy, Clones, Whitehall, Maynooth and Trim had been led by the Minister to expect a degree of flexibility in terms of the number of pupils registered per class. The Minister's eleventh hour change of mind excluded these schools from the official recognition they had expected by reference to both departmental precendent and the Minister's address to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Irish Language only a week previously. It is amazing and ridiculous that the Minister should make public statements supporting all-Irish education and then, practically in the next breath, turn around and deny recognition to these schools.  Saying one thing publicly and then applying different criteria has become the hallmark of the Labour Party in Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister left the parents and schools in an absolutely impossible position by informing them of her decision only a month before the start of the new school year.  Having spoken to representatives of the gaelscoileanna.  I do not underestimate the enormous anger and frustration felt by them at this decision. The sequence of events which has frustrated all those involved is as follows.  In 1986 the Department of Education announced that new all-Irish schools would no longer be recognised unless 20 or more pupils were enrolled in each case.  In 1987 it said that all-Irish schools would no longer be recognised unless 20 or more pupils who had not previously attended school were enrolled in each case.  However, the Minister is now insisting that the 20 new pupils must all enrol in the same year in the all-Irish school seeking recognition.  Up until this announcement the quota could be obtained by enrolment over two years. Schools, such as the one in Ballybrack, were led to believe that would apply in their case.  The Minister then turned this on its head, causing outrage among parents and confusion among children.</P>
    <P>The State is committed to promoting the Irish language and the Progressive <Col N="627" /> Democrats Party believes this promotion must be centred in gaelscoileanna and the education system generally. The parents should be assisted by the State and not thwarted in their efforts to provide their children with an all-Irish education.  My colleague, Deputy Molloy, said the Minister has shown herself to be blatantly anti the Irish language by her actions, and I agree with his sentiments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education's time in Marlborough Street will unfortunately be remembered for the litany of blunders over which she has presided and for which she is politically responsible. Where are the politics of inclusion which were advocated by her and her colleagues in the Labour Party?  I ask the Minister of State to bring these sentiments to the attention of the Minister for Education and to underscore the point that parents who wish their children to be educated in all-Irish schools are extremely angry and frustrated by her actions and by what they regard as a complete about-face on the promises she made to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This year a total of 14 applications were received in the Department for the establishment of new gaelscoileanna. These applications were in respect of Wicklow town; Sligo town; Ranelagh, Dublin; Cabra, Dublin; Knocklyon, Dublin; Trim, Meath; Waterford city; Whitehall, Dublin; Maynooth, Kildare; Ballinamore, Leitrim; Westport, Mayo; Enniscorthy, Wexford; Clones, Monaghan and Ballybrack, Dublin.  Based on the information submitted, six applications initially met the Department's criteria for recognition and were <Col N="628" /> approved.  These applications were for Wicklow town, Sligo town, Ranelagh, Cabra, Knocklyon and Westport.  The unsuccessful applicants appealed the decision and the additional information supplied by three of them resulted in the approval of their applications.  These applications were for Trim, Waterford city and Whitehall.  This brings the total number of new gaelscoileanna this year to nine, out of the 14 applications received.  The total number of gaelscoileanna is 95, 31 of which have been approved by the Minister.  The current position is that five of the proposed schools have not been granted recognition. The applications for gaelscoileanna in Ballinamore, Ballybrack, Clones and Enniscorthy could not be approved for the 1996-97 school year because they did not have 20 new junior infants starting in September 1996.</P>

      <P>However, these applications for recognition will be reconsidered for the school year 1997-98, early in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approval could not be given for a gaelscoil in Maynooth for 1996-97.  As well as satisfaction regarding future viability, the other long standing criterion has been the extent to which facilities already exist in a particular area for the provision of primary school education through Irish.  The proposed gaelscoil at Maynooth is located near an existing gaelscoil in Kilcock.  County Kildare.  More than 50 per cent of the enrolment in the Kilcock school come <Col N="629" /> from the Maynooth area and the Kilcock school strongly opposed the establishment of a gaelscoil in Maynooth.</P>
    <P>If the promoters of the school in Maynooth wish to renew their application for 1997-98, I will seek the co-operation of the local gaelscoileanna in the area and of the gaelscoileanna organisation at national level to plan the provision of all-Irish education.  It must be recognised that a successful gaelscoil depends on genuine parental demand; hence, there is a requirement that a gaelscoil should have at least 20 junior infants, who had not attended school previously, before recognition can be granted.  This is not a new condition; it has been in existence for a number of years.</P>

      <P>The Minister is fully aware of the effort and commitment which parents and others put into gaelscoileanna organisation.  The total number of primary gaelscoileanna is now 95 and a third of those have been approved by the current Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy.  However, this is the correct procedure for Adjournment matters and not the disgraceful manner in which it was taken earlier.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department to take a tough line with Semperit regarding the plant.  We are not supposed to discuss the IDA, but the Ministers are responsible for it and I intend to mention it.  A more robust line should be taken with Semperit in relation to the equipment at the factory and access to the plant for potential buyers.  The IDA has been taking it rather softly with Semperit and appears to agree the company will have the right to say who will set up instead of it, who will buy in and who will have access to the factory.</P>
      <P>I am most alarmed that the IDA more or less accepted without public complaint Semperit's decision not to leave the equipment and technology at the Ballyfermot plant.  I was even more outraged when I read at the weekend that Semperit refused access to the factory to a Korean company which expressed an interest in buying the Irish operation.  Semperit has a responsibility to Ireland.  It received millions of pounds in grants over the years and has a loyal workforce.  It has made millions of pounds in profits and it needs to be sharply reminded of this.  Since the IDA is not responsible to the House, I call on the Minister to ensure the IDA gets tough with Semperit, even at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taken aback at the line taken with regard to the IDA.  Its appears to accept as fact that it should allow Semperit away with its outrageous claim that it has full rights over what happens to the technology, who visits the factory and who takes over the operation.  How much IDA funding went into this technology? A visit by the Minister, Deputy <Col N="633" /> Richard Bruton, to Germany on the day he received the news that the factory was closing was a kick in the teeth for the Semperit workers.  Last May I stated here that I had heard, through trade union contacts, that plans were afoot to close Semperit.  I was not reassured by the Minister's answer and I have now discovered he did not visit the parent company until he ignominiously went to Germany when the closure was announced.  In contrast, the Austrian Government took a strong line and, while jobs were lost in its firm, it retained the open plant.  The Minister is at a disadvantage in negotiating our position.</P>
    <P>The millions of pounds Semperit received in aid from the IDA should be used as a lever to achieve access to the plant for potential buyers.  Despite the glamorous announcements the Government makes on a daily basis about the creation of new jobs and its talk of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, little attention is being paid to sustaining jobs at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for sharing time with me and I share her concern about the Government's inept preformance in this matter. It was generally known that moves were afoot in the Continental Group to close the Semperit plant in Ballyfermot.  It is deplorable that, having maximised support from the Government through IDA grants, it should now be in a position to locate a plant in eastern Europe and expect European taxpayers to purchase its products.  The plant made a profit of £5 million last year following rationalisation, redundancies, changed work practices and greater efficiencies on the part of the staff.  The workforce complied with all the requirements necessary to maintain their employment but, because the multinational behaved in a deplorable manner and the Government was not aware of what was happening until it was too late, they have <Col N="634" /> now lost their jobs.  It is deplorable that the company should dictate to the Government and that the plant cannot be saved.  I hope the Minister informs the House that nothing can, or will, be removed from the plant, that the IDA will purchase it and sell it on to a potential buyer rather than Continental keeping an oar in the water.  Will the Minister ensure that there is no impediment to the ongoing sale of the plant so that jobs can be saved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement by the Continental Group of its intention to close the Semperit plant in Ballyfermot has been devastating not only for the workers and families directly involved but for the wider community also.  The manner in which Continental handled the closure announcement was far from ideal.  In particular, the workers in Semperit deserved to receive reasonable advance notice of the closure announcement.</P>
      <P>Our efforts now must be geared to attracting a buyer who will continue to operate the plant and to offer employment to Semperit workers.  That must be, and is, our immediate and urgent priority.</P>
      <P>At his meeting on 18 September with Dr. von Grunberg, executive chairman of Continental AG, my ministerial colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, was given assurances that, in the event of the decision in relation to the plant not being favourable, there would be a phased wind down, discussions with staff representatives and the company would co-operate with IDA Ireland in its endeavours to secure a tyre manufacturer to purchase the plant.</P>
      <P>The Minister had flown to Germany on the first intimation that there might be an announcement of imminent closure. Unfortunately, we must all recognise that corporate decisions which impact on employment are decisions for companies over which we have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> Following the announcement of the closure of the plant, the Minister instructed IDA Ireland to step up its contact with companies which might have a possible interest in purchasing the Ballyfermot plant.  Accordingly, IDA Ireland is currently pursuing its programme of meetings with potential buyers for Semperit's plant in Ballyfermot. Meetings have been arranged with a number of potential buyers this week and it is hoped that site visits will be undertaken by some of these companies in the next fortnight.  The Minister is currently in the United States and is scheduled to meet a prospective purchaser there later this week.</P>
    <P>The Minister took a personal interest in Semperit for many months.  There were talks with both management and unions about the closure of the plant and the possibility of finding a buyer. My view is that the option which we are pursuing of trying to find a suitable buyer for the plant is the best one available. I ask for the co-operation of all concerned to facilitate our efforts to secure jobs in Ballyfermot and surrounding areas which are not without difficulty.  All these contacts are being pursued urgently and with utmost vigour.</P>
    <P>Continental Group AG, the Semperit (Ireland) parent, has promised to co-operate fully in endeavours to sell the plant.  The company confirmed these undertakings in a press release and Dr. von Grunberg has written to the Minister promising full co-operation with the IDA to find a purchaser.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the Government failed to take action in time in relation to the Semperit plant.  From the first warning signs, the Minister and the IDA sought as a first priority to facilitate securing the future of the Irish plant and failing that, under present ownership, to facilitate a sale as a going concern.</P>
    <P>The difficulties for the Ballyfermot plant had been signalled for some time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> In April 1996, the Irish management and unions had agreed on the implementation of a cost competitiveness plan.  A further cost reduction programme was being considered by management. In May 1996, the Minister was aware of reports that the parent company was considering the future of each of its plants in Europe.  At that stage there was not a specific threat to the Irish plant <i>per se.</i> Since then the Minister had a number of meetings with the management of the Irish company and with trade union representatives.  IDA Ireland also had a number of meetings with both the Irish and Continental management and with possible investors who might have been interested in buying the plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment's meeting with the chairman of the Continental Group in Frankfurt last week was a final &mdash; not a first, as implied by Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; attempt to persuade the Continental management to keep the plant open.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there will be difficulties in any negotiations about the price of the factory which is owned by Semperit and other issues such as proprietary equipment and technology to which both Deputies referred.  However, given a willing purchaser these can be overcome through discussion and negotiation and the company has made it clear that it is not vetoing any prospective buyer.</P>
    <P>I welcome that because I share Deputy Lawlor's concern that there should not be a veto on the prospect of a purchase by a suitable company, the least to which workers are entitled.  If there is a real prospect of an alternative purchaser &mdash; and I believe there is &mdash; the sale should be facilitated by the present owners.  If they want to restructure and get out of Ireland there is nothing we can, or would want to do to force them to stay.  However, we can exercise influence to require them to sell the plant as a going concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> The attractiveness of the company will be fully emphasised to prospective purchasers &mdash; it has a committed, flexible workforce, team workers, world class manufacturing techniques, ISO 9000 quality certification, gateway to European markets, 10 per cent corporation tax and so on.  The difficulties of selling the plant should not be underestimated, but no effort will be spared by the IDA, the Minister or myself in the task of finding a buyer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  While it was a happy occasion for you, a Cheann Comhairle, it was a disastrous week for the people of South Tipperary because two industries closed, the Tambrands factory in Tipperary town and the Schiesser factory in Carrick-on-Suir, and a number of jobs were lost in the Schiesser plant in Clonmel also.  I am particularly concerned about something which, as the Minister mentioned, also happened in regard to the closure of Semperit &mdash; no prior notice was given to the workers or unions in any of these factories.  This is a new phase of Irish industrial life and I am surprised, given that we have a left wing oriented Government, that this has not been corrected or stymied.  Workers were called in and told that jobs which they had for up to 30 years had gone.  It is not good enough to treat workers like that and, where industrial relations have been good for many years, it is not good enough to treat the unions in that way either.  They are the people who have to negotiate to ensure that the good relations built up over many years can be passed on to future industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> The total population of South Tipperary is 75,000, so the impact of these job losses is huge.  Tipperary town has also lost 300 jobs in Mass Mutual since last January.  Apart from the creamery and the Atari plant, the industrial base of that town has been wiped out.  To date the IDA has failed to find a replacement for Mass Mutual but one hopes it changes tactics and puts in new incentives for the Tambrands plant.</P>
    <P>Carrick-on-Suir has lost the Schiesser plant.  The closure of the tannery factory ended most of the male employment in that town, which made women the sole income earners in many households, but now their income is gone also.  Their future is uncertain and their confidence has been wrecked.  Schiesser was the main employer in that town and the two replacement industries employ 100 in one case and between 11 and 30 in the other.</P>
    <P>What efforts have the IDA and the Minister made to ensure that Schiesser does not move to somewhere more profitable like India or Bangladesh where it can pay labourers £40 a week to replace a solid consistent workforce here?  Only last year the workers in Schiesser were told they made an excellent product at an excellent production rate with good company relations, yet in a short period afterwards the company was gone.</P>
    <P>The other issues which concern the Government in this matter relate to confidence about investment in these towns.  The heritage centre in Tipperary town has not been supported by the Government to date.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has not given it any money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We await good news from the Government on its efforts in that regard.  I am especially concerned about replacement industries <Col N="639" /> being found because the workers and the unions, after a long period of good industrial relations, were treated with contempt.</P>

      <P>It has happened in the recent past but in retrospect it is practice which the Chair discountenances. I take the view that Ministers ought not share time.  The time available to a Minister or a Minister of State when replying to a Member in this House on a five minute Adjournment debate is limited enough without it being eroded by other Members expressing their views.  In the circumstances I find myself in an invidious position, with my Tipperary colleagues involved and a tragedy in industrial affairs in my constituency.  I will allow it for tonight but I want the House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to take note of my view on this matter. The practice is clearly, in my opinion, to the disadvantage of the Member who raised the issue and the limited time available to a Minister or Minister of State should not be eroded by any device.  Members of this House are entitled to the fullest possible information when they raise a matter by way of parliamentary question or Adjournment debate.  In the circumstances I will allow it but I will rule as I have outlined on the matter unless this House decides otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak and thank the Minister of State for allowing me a few moments.  I live in the town where the factory closed and represent the constituency in which all these jobs have been lost.  They were all <Col N="640" /> good employers who gave excellent employment to their workforce.  The workforce was excellent also, as has been recognised by the companies.  In the process of negotiating the redundancy package I call on both companies to be generous with these top-class workers.  One should also put on record the performance of the Minister and Minister of State on these issues when they were brought to their attention, the top priority given to South Tipperary because of the job losses and the setting up of the inter-agency group under the chairmanship of Mr. Barry Condren.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if those who have another agenda stopped running down the towns involved and calling them dead towns or ghost towns, we would be successful in ensuring that alternative investment is found.  It is already happening in the case of Tambrands and Mass Mutual in Tipperary town.  I hope it will also happen in the case of Schiesser and bear fruit.  We are anxious to promote all possible avenues for incoming industrialists.  I am making every effort in my contacts with the IDA and Ministers.  I am delighted with the results so far and we will continue to work with them.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your generosity, I appreciate the concerns you mentioned. I share the dismay expressed by Deputy Davern and Deputy Ferris about the extraordinary bad news for South Tipperary last week.  Nevertheless we should not further demoralise people who find themselves without employment by implying that replacement industries will not be found or that we are facing a hopeless position.  I was comforted by the positive response from the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, first in setting up the inter-agency group to promote South Tipperary for replacement industry and second in the assurance that, for him, South Tipperary is as <Col N="641" /> much a priority for replacement industry as anywhere else in the country.</P>
      <P>We fully appreciate that the employment base in Tipperary town has been shattered by the two closures.  The Minister should remember that Schiesser International employed a predominantly female workforce and I hope that their skills and expertise will be used in a replacement industry.  I will be optimistic and work with my colleagues to ensure Tipperary will remain a priority for replacement industry and that all the stops are pulled out to do this without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the serious social and economic problems arising in South Tipperary, especially from the pending closure of the Tambrands plant in Tipperary town and the Schiesser plant in Carrick-on-Suir with the loss of 370 jobs.  These serious job losses will undoubtedly have a significant adverse impact on the local economy and add to job losses earlier this year from the closure of the Mass Mutual health claims processing operations in Tipperary.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Tambrands plant, which is US owned, is a long established manufacturer of tampons in Tipperary town affording employment to 220 people.  The German Schiesser Group is also a long established clothing employer in Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel providing employment to 300 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plant closures and redundancies arise from world global restructuring in both cases because of market competitive pressures and also involve closures and substantial job losses in sister company plants overseas.  Despite our best endeavours at avoiding such job losses, <Col N="642" /> the responsibility in the final analysis for these decisions rests with the companies themselves.</P>
    <P>Top priority is being given by the industrial development agencies to finding replacement industries for Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir and the availability of existing factories for new industry will be marketed aggressively. The high quality workforces available should be a valuable asset in the industrial promotion campaign which is being vigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>As already announced, my ministerial colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, has established an inter-agency enterprise group to address urgently the problems arising from the plant closures in Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir and the need to attract replacement industries. The Minister referred specifically to the establishment of this group when he met a delegation from County Tipperary, comprising public representatives, trade union and local interests, last Saturday. He assured the delegation that the areas affected by the pending closures would receive top priority attention in the ongoing drive to attract new inward investment.</P>
    <P>The group, which had its first meeting on 20 September, will focus on ensuring that the plants are available for alternative industry, providing assistance for worker training and retraining opportunities and assisting workers interested in establishing new ventures.</P>
    <P>Local support is a key factor in addressing plant closures and redundancies; local community and business interest groups have an important role to play.  In this context, I am confident of full co-operation from public representatives, trade unions, business and other interests in supporting the inter-agency enterprise group and the development agencies in their challenging and difficult task of seeking alternative industry and jobs for the redundant workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The co-operative efforts of all interests concerned will facilitate the attraction of much needed investment and jobs to the South Tipperary area and thus help to ensure a brighter future for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the concerns articulated by Deputies representing the constituency, particularly Deputy Davern's point about the manner in which some closures were announced recently. Deputy O'Rourke may have been gilding the lily when she referred to the glamorous daily announcement of new job projects.  Fortunately we are in a position where, perhaps not daily but on a weekly basis, significant additions have been made to the jobs base here, but this peremptory pattern of withdrawal without any recognition of the long service of workers and good industrial relations at the Tambrands plant, in particular, is not acceptable and I would not like to see it become a pattern here.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply.  The decision by Irish Ferries to close the Rosslare to France shipping route from 3 November 1996 to 1 April 1997 &mdash; involving the loss of 400 staff on ship, 25-30 office workers and 20 people employed by the ship repair company &mdash; will have a devastating effect not only on the economy of Wexford but on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision has been taken because of non-profit making winter sailings.  It will mean that for six months of the year there will not be a passenger service from Ireland to the Continent and this will have a serious impact on our tourism industry not only in the south-east but across the country.  It is reckoned that even in the off peak season up to <Col N="644" /> 1,000 people per week travel here from France and further afield.</P>
    <P>Irish Ferries is the largest carrier of livestock and at a time when the farming community is up in arms about BSE and the need for live exports, this decision will seriously affect cattle prices here.  The impact of the decision on the tourism industry and the farming community will be a severe blow to the south-east economy.  The job losses will have a devastating impact on Wexford, in particular, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. As I said, the proposed job losses include 400 staff on ship, 25 to 30 office workers, 20 workers employed in a garage that repairs the ships.  Suppliers in the south-east, including suppliers of linen, clothing, food, duty free goods as well as the loss of business to bed and breakfast proprietors, hotels and restaurants and CIE workers who provide offshore services, will no longer be required.  Total job losses in the south-east region will be in the region of 600.</P>
    <P>The decision is a major blow to the people of Rosslare, the people in other parts of Wexford and successive Ministers who have invested substantial amounts in the development of Rosslare as a major Euro port.  It is one of the finest ports in Europe and the decision by Irish Ferries will undermine operations in it.</P>
    <P>Some of the reasons given for the proposed closure include the non-profit making sailings during the winter months.  Brittany Ferries is subsidised to the hilt by the French Government and the Channel Tunnel and air fares are undercutting its prices.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 April 1993 Eamon Rothwell, managing director of ICG, predicted the decision that has been taken unless subsidies were forthcoming from the Government of the day, he said that foreign crews, who would not have to be paid as high a wage, would have to be employed on ships owned by Irish Ferries if the company were to survive.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously investigate how this decision can be rescinded, <Col N="645" /> to ascertain the commitment of Irish Ferries to Rosslare because it is rumoured that there will be only one ship available for summer sailings, that the following year the company will review its operations and that in the following year it may withdraw its service altogether.  The position is very serious. The decsion to withdraw the service has been taken without very much communication with the workers.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he will investigate the possibility of the decision being rescinded in the interests of the workers, tourism and the livestock industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter which is of considerable concern to all of us, in particular those who live in County Wexford and other parts of the south-east.  I recently learnt with regret from Irish Ferries that the Company proposes to close down its routes between Rosslare and Le Havre-Cherbourg from November 1996 to Easter 1997.  I have arranged to meet with the company tomorrow to review all aspects of its decision in this regard, which of course was a commercial one taken by a privately owned firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has already advised me that in the past the profits which it made during the summer months on the route were sufficient to compensate for losses sustained over the winter months. Developments which have taken place during recent years, however, have put added pressure on the company in relation to the route.  The fares competition which has emerged on the English Channel due to the opening of the tunnel has diverted traffic through Britain and away from the direct continental route with adverse effects for the company. I am aware that Irish Ferries' main competitor on the continental route has been in receipt of substantial subsidies in recent years; also that <Col N="646" /> another of its competitors employs non-EU low-cost labour.</P>
    <P>I have been keenly aware of the importance of the shipping sector since assuming my present responsibility in the Department of the Marine.  Shipping is an international industry and as Irish Ferries is only too well aware individual companies can be affected by developments which occur at international level.  The problems which are being experienced by Irish Ferries and other Irish and EU companies were addressed by the EU Commission in the document <i>Towards a New Maritime Strategy</i> which was launched earlier this year by EU Commissioner Neil Kinnock.  The document acknowledged that competitiveness of EU shipping was of primary importance.  The Commission proposed the development of quality EU shipping, expansion of training for EU seafarers and the elimination of unsafe vessels. These are aspirations with which we can readily accord.  Ireland hopes to arrange for substantive discussion on the document to take place during the Transport Council in December next.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front, my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, and I are pleased to have been in a position to introduce shipboard training subsidies for students at Cork Regional Technical College this year. This will ensure that they secure the necessary international placements which are an integral part of training. Finance Act measures earlier this year should also facilitate the modernisation of our merchant fleet.  The Departments of the Marine and Finance have undertaken discussions with shipping interests with a view to ascertaining how the fleet and our marine economy and employment potential therein could be strengthened.  In particular, as already announced, discussions are taking place on how the taxation and PRSI regime applicable to seafarers on Irish ships might be modified to bring it into line <Col N="647" /> with the more favourable arrangements applicable elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important that Ireland as an island country should have effective, efficient and dependable sea links directly with the Continent as well as with Great Britain.  Irish Ferries' service to and from France is an important part of our trading service.  The loss of the Irish Ferries' winter service to France &mdash; three round trips per week &mdash; and the temporary lay-off of about 150 personnel is much to be regretted and this development has if anything hardened <Col N="648" /> our resolve to make progress at EU and international level to ensure that Irish operators and seafarers can compete on an equitable and level playing field in the future.  As I have already indicated, I will be meeting with the company at my request tomorrow and will be reviewing with them how the underlying factors which gave rise to their commercial decision in this case can be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 September 1996.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 3 July 1996, in announcing the publication of the report of the Constitution Review Group, also announced the establishment, following consultation with the leaders of the Opposition Parties, of an informal All-Party Committee to undertake a full review of the Constitution and to establish those areas where constitutional changes may be desirable or necessary.  Copies of the relevant press release which also set out <Col N="39" /> the membership and terms of reference of the committee, were placed in the Oireachtas Library.  In relation to reports of the all-party committee it has been agreed that the committee may bring forward an interim report on specific sections of the Constitution by early 1997 and a final report as soon as possible thereafter.  It is a matter for the committee to settle its own procedures, subject to the terms of reference already agreed.  Pending a report from the all-party committee it is premature to discuss what changes, if any, might be recommended by Government to the people in a referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.  The questions relate to the &ldquo;Study of the Difference between the Labour Force Survey (LFS) Estimates of Unemployment and the Live Register&rdquo; which the Central Statistics Office &mdash; CSO &mdash; published on Wednesday, 18 September. The CSO has continually monitored the increasing differences which have arisen since the late 1980s between the annual LFS estimates of unemployment and <Col N="40" /> the corresponding live register totals. While various reasons for the differences were identified, the available information was insufficient to allow them to be quantified.  The level of divergence reached 86,000 in April 1995 &mdash; a marked increase on the 1994 level.</P>
      <P>The Government established an interdepartmental group following the publication of the Labour Force Survey results last October.  The group was instructed, <i>inter alia,</i> to examine the reasons for the divergence between the two measures.  The CSO was asked to assist in this progress and the group supported the CSO's proposal to conduct a special study in conjunction with the April 1996 Labour Force Survey, to assess directly the reasons for the difference. This was the earliest opportunity to carry out such an exercise, which involved the inclusion in the LFS of a sample of about one per cent of the live register.  The Department of Social Welfare co-operated in the conduct of the study by providing a computer file covering the bulk of the live register, from which the 1 per cent sample was selected at random by the CSO.  The sample was therefore representative of the live register in all areas in the State. The study was purely a statistical exercise conducted by the CSO as a quality check on the LFS.  The names/addresses of those selected and their LFS responses are known only to the CSO; they are protected from disclosure under the 1993 Statistics Act which guarantees anonymity and confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the study received widespread publicity and a copy of the CSO's report is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The main findings of the CSO's sample survey of persons on the live register are: in 679 out of 2,414 cases, the person on the live register was not listed as a usual resident at the address given.  No specific conclusions can be drawn from this study about these persons and they have been excluded from the main results; in the main results, almost 44 per cent of the sample of persons on the live register <Col N="41" /> did not describe their status as unemployed in the LFS, according to the Principal Economic Status &mdash; PES &mdash; classification, in which people describe their own situation; using the ILO economic activity classification, which takes account of job-search and availability for work, 50 per cent were not classified as unemployed; 11 per cent of the sample said they had full-time jobs; 10 per cent said they were working part-time; almost 25 per cent of the sample were classified as &ldquo;others not economically active&rdquo; under the ILO classification and most of these indicated that they were neither looking for nor wanted work and just under 4 per cent described themselves as retired and a similar proportion as students.</P>
    <P>The results confirm that many persons who are not statistically classified as unemployed in the LFS are included in the live register total.  Conversely, taking account of the size of the gap between the LFS and live register sources, the results also indicate that there are unemployed persons, according to the LFS definitions who are not on the live register.</P>
    <P>Taken overall, the study shows that the most consistent estimates of unemployment are those derived from the LFS.  From the middle of 1997 onwards, this survey will be conducted by the CSO on a quarterly basis.</P>

The findings had been the subject of discussion between officers of the CSO and the Department of Social Welfare the previous afternoon.  It was always envisaged that the results of the survey would be published at the earliest opportunity.  In the event they were published by the CSO on 18 September.</P>

      <P>It has not proved possible to reach agreement on the original proposals for an EU tax on carbon/energy.  In March of this year, the ECO/FIN Council agreed to ask the Commission to bring forward revised proposals dealing with carbon/energy taxation.  It is expected that proposals will be presented by the Commission late in the year concerning energy taxation, probably as part of a comprehensive set of proposals relating to mineral oil excise.  It is possible that discussion of the excise proposals at working group level will only commence in December or January depending on the timing of the proposal from the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 59, 65 and 72 together.  The net income for an employed person, with a non-working spouse and four children, earning gross incomes at £1,000 intervals between £8,000 and £15,000 per annum is shown in table A which follows.  This table also sets out the additions to and deductions from gross income arising in arriving at levels of net income.  It is estimated that a family with no employed parent and four children would have a net income of £8,068 per annum when account it taken of all allowances, including secondary benefits, medical card, and the costs of local authority differential rent and work-seeking.  When this is compared with the information in the table, it is clear that, at all gross incomes between £8,000 and £15,000, this family's circumstances are better with one parent in employment.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy O'Malley's second question, table B sets out the position of an employed person, with a non-working spouse and four children earning gross incomes at £1,000 intervals between £6,000 and £15,000 per annum, inclusive of the additions to and deductions from gross income &mdash; and, in particular, the requirement of taking into account the effect of differential rent on a local authority home at £40 per week and the cost of getting to work at £10 per week &mdash; in arriving at levels of net income.  It should be noted that the differential rent of £40 per week is not representative of the present position with regard to such rents at these income levels.  However, even taking account of the effect of differential rent on a local authority home at a rate of £40 per week, the position is that, at all incomes between £6,000 and £15,000, a family of the type described is better off with one parent in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen from table A that the employed person in question faces a reduction in net income as gross earnings increase at certain levels of income. This phenomenon is known as the poverty trap which is a result of the impact <Col N="45" /> of the interaction of aspects of the taxation and welfare codes as they have evolved over a long period.  The number of people who potentially lose disposable income as gross pay increases is small. While not attempting to minimise the problem for those affected, it is necessary to put it into overall perspective and not to seek to represent as a general problem what is, in fact, an unusual and limited situation.  It was to address the various complexities involved in this whole area that the Expert Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare Systems was established.  The group <Col N="46" /> has concluded a detailed examination of the whole question of poverty and unemployment traps and its report was published last June.  The group's report is being examined carefully.  I do not expect a simple solution to the poverty trap problem; indeed, I know there is not one.  However, I am ever mindful of the necessity to minimise any adverse impact which future changes to the tax and social welfare systems have on the more vulnerable in the labour force and I can assure this House that steps will continue to be taken to remove such consequences.</P>

    <P>Notes on Table:</P>
    <P>1.  The main factors contributing to the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases are the withdrawal rate of family income supplement (60 per cent) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax (involving a 40 per cent tax rate).</P>
    <P>2.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing family income supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis.  Once awarded it will not be reduced/withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.</P>
    <P>3.  The numbers of people who potentially lose disposable income as gross pay increases are small.  In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax are the main elements of the poverty trap, the number of people affected is essentially a function of the numbers who both receive FIS and pay tax. It is estimated that the numbers both paying tax and receiving FIS are of the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this situation potentially &ldquo;applied to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>4.  Finally, the entitlement to a medical card applies up to a gross income of £9,646 in the case of a married couple with four children. However, persons who have been unemployed for at least one year will retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment.</P>

    <P>Notes on Table:</P>
    <P>1.  The main factors contributing to the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases are the withdrawal rate of family income supplement (60 per cent) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax (involving a 40 per cent tax rate) as well as the effect of differential rent on a local authority home at £40 per week.</P>
    <P>2.  It should be noted that the differential rent of £40 per week as stated in the question is not a representative figure at the income levels indicated. The actual rent payable at the various levels of earnings is set out at Table A above.</P>
    <P>3.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing family income supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis.  Once awarded it will not be reduced/withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> The Exchequer pay and pensions bill does not cover the local authorities. Local authority employees are however included in the public service employment numbers.  Decisions about public service numbers are based on the Government's assessment of staffing needs to ensure the most efficient delivery of programmes and services.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government examines public service recruitment very carefully to decide the appropriate levels for the delivery of those services.</P>

    <P>Painting and decoration works were also carried out by the Office of Public Works Building Maintenance Service at a cost of £50,800.  The areas redecoratted included the entrance hall and the Dáil stairs both of which had last been painted in 1982.  The total estimated cost of projects undertaken this year in Leinster House is therefore £940,361. Phase one of a major fire safety project was undertaken this summer.  This included the fitting of over 200 fire doors and the creation of new escape routes from Leinster House and the 1932 annex.  Next year work will involve upgrading the fire alarm system and new signage.</P>
    <P>The final phase of the restoration of the stonework on the Kildare Street facade has been largely completed.  Due to the shortening of the summer recess, work to the ground floor windows and door and tinting of the new stonework has been deferred until the Christmas recess.  The refurbishment of the bars forms the final phase of a three year programme of upgrading restaurant and bar facilities for Members, staff and visitors. Selective tendering is considered the most appropriate method of procurement in security sensitive areas such as Leinster House.  Accordingly, only specially selected contractors who have previously carried out work in security sensitive areas were invited to tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant information available on income tax receipts is in respect of the calendar years 1995 and 1996.  The percentage of the combined income tax receipt in 1995 from the PAYE, farming and other self-employed sectors as contributed by each sector was 86.6 per cent from PAYE, 1.7 per cent from farmers and 11.7 per cent from other self-employed. These figures do not take account of receipts of deposit interest retention tax for which a breakdown between particular classes of taxpayers cannot be ascertained.  The figure for PAYE covers more than tax on wages and salaries.  For example, tax paid by directors of close companies is included, as is the tax on other income of employees such as rent and other investment income.  After adjusting for these factors, tax on wages and salaries normally represents about 68 per cent of the take from income tax, excluding deposit interest retention tax.  The figure for PAYE also includes the tax paid on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure for other self-employed includes tax paid on income from trades and professions other than farming, together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes withholding tax on professional fees.  The yield in 1995 from this sector was reduced by approximately £52 million as a result of implementing a High Court ruling to the effect that withholding tax on professional fees should be allowable as a credit against income tax liability on a <Col N="56" /> current year basis.  The percentage figures given must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in each of the sectors mentioned, which are estimated for the income tax year 1995/96 to be 864,000 in PAYE, 31,000 farmers and 94,000 other self employed. The Post-Budget estimate of income tax receipts from these sectors in 1996 is £3,719 million from PAYE, £74 million from farmers and £432 million from other self-employed.</P>
    <P>The relevant information available on completed random audits relates to the position at 20 September 1996.  The random audit programme began in 1992. No new random cases were selected in 1993 for audit due to concentration of resources on work related to the tax amnesty and major restructuring of the audit programme.  The total number of random audits of tax returns from all self-employed persons and companies which were initiated in the years 1992, 1994 and 1995 was 370.  Some 237 of these have been completed up to 20 September 1996 in respect of all self-employed persons, including farmers, producing an additional tax liability of £478,029.  Information on random audits initiated in 1996 is not yet available.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of cases selected for audit are selected on the basis of perceived defects in their tax returns or supporting accounts and not on a random basis.  The total number of these comprehensive self-assessment audits initiated since inception in 1990 to the end of 1995 &mdash; excluding companies &mdash; was 12,589.  These are in addition to normal PAYE &mdash; employers &mdash; and VAT audits.  The purpose of the random element of the audit programme is to demonstrate to taxpayers that there is a risk of audit for every self assessing taxpayer even where incorrect returns have the appearance of being correct. However, experience suggests that taxpayer behaviour is influenced more by the perception of Revenue's ability to detect suspect tax returns in a systematic way, rather than by the risk of random selection of a return.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that all <Col N="57" /> their audit programmes, including the random programme, will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 77 together.  The relevant information available is by reference to the income tax years 1995/96 and 1996/97.  The information requested, in so far as it is available, is set out in the following table.  The projected increased costs for the personal allowances and the exemption limits/marginal relief are attributable to the increases in these allowances and exemption limits provided for in the Finance Act, 1996.  The year-on-year reduction in the costs for loan interest and medical insurance is attributed mainly to the phased impact of standard rating those reliefs which was introduced in the Finance Act, 1994, offset to some extent in the case of loan interest by an increase in loan amounts and the ongoing increase in numbers. The cost of the relief shown for 1995/96 in respect of rent paid in private tenancies reflects the information currently available for that year on take-up of the <Col N="58" /> relief provided for under section 5 of the Finance Act, 1995.  Corresponding information on take-up is not yet available for 1996/97 and the figure of cost included for this year is the full year cost of the relief estimated for the 1995 budget.  That estimate may require to be revised in the light of further information on take-up becoming available.</P>
      <P>Increases in the costs of other allowances are based largely on increased take-up.</P>

      <P>The Government established a Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment following publication of the Labour Force Survey &mdash; LFS &mdash; results last October. The group was asked, <i>inter alia,</i> to examine the reasons for the growing divergence between the live register and the LFS estimates of unemployment. During discussions of the options for <Col N="60" /> effective analysis of this divergence, the group supported a proposal by the Central Statistics Office &mdash; whose input had been requested by the group &mdash; to conduct a statistical exercise as a quality check of the LFS estimate of unemployment. This special study was to be conducted in conjunction with the April 1996 LFS and it aimed to assess more directly the reasons for the difference between the live register and LFS estimates of unemployment.  This was not a &ldquo;fraud survey&rdquo;.  The CSO presented an interim report on the study to the Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment on Wednesday, 11 September and published the main results of the study on Wednesday, 18 September.</P>
      <P>The final figures published by the CSO on 18 September differed from those presented in the interim report. This was because: the interim figures were unweighted sample results whereas the final figures were weighted to reflect the overall distribution of the live register between long-term and short-term claimants; some categories who are not part of the live register count &mdash; such as systematic short-time workers &mdash; were included in the interim analysis but were subsequently excluded from the final figures; and the final figure was also adjusted for an estimated small level of outflows from the live register between 19 April 1996 and the reference period of the LFS.  These refinements gave a more accurate assessment of the divergence between the LFS estimate of unemployment and the live register count.</P>

      <P>Under the 1996 scheme of special once-off grants for local development projects, grants were offered to the sponsers of 37 projects in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and <Col N="61" /> Dublin on 31 July 1996.  A significant number of these were in the Deputy's constituency.  The entire fund for 1996 of £250,000 has been allocated &mdash; so the question of reviewing any of the unsuccessful projects is not feasible.  There was a great deal of interest in the scheme due largely, I believe, to the excellent work being carried out currently at local level, in Ireland.  Unfortunately, the combination of the large number of applications received and the limited fund &mdash; £250,000 &mdash; meant that many groups around the country &mdash; including MACRO &mdash; were disappointed with the outcome.</P>

      <P>The report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development clearly identifies and addresses the long-term issues affecting the communities on our <Col N="64" /> offshore islands.  As chairman of the Co-ordinating Committee, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, has responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's response to the recommendations of the report. The report provides a strategic framework within which the various Departments and agencies involved can reexamine policies relating to the economic and social development of island communities, clarify objectives in relation to the services being provided to these communities and formulate new policies accordingly.</P>
      <P>Specific recommendations have been made in the report in relation to the essential services available on islands and the key sectors for island development. The essential services outlined in the report include access, infrastructure, education, health, energy supply and communications.  The key sectors identified include agriculture, fishing-aqua-culture, information technology and tourism.  The development of access services to offshore islands was identified in the report as the priority issue and the Government allocated an additional £1 million in 1996 specifically for this purpose.  Prioritised programmes of work submitted by the local authorities have been assessed by the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development and recommendations regarding funding were subsequently made.  Deputy Carey recently advised Galway, Donegal and Mayo County Councils of funding for projects submitted in their programmes of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the launch of the report earlier this year a number of specific recommendations have been implemented including: the accommodation of the interests of island communities in the proposed regional education boards structure, which is consistent with the aspirations of local empowerment outlined in the White Paper on Education <i>Charting our Education Future;</i> changes in the means test limit for the Department of Education's Remote Area Boarding Grant.  The limit has been substantially increased to a level in line <Col N="65" /> with third level education grants; the continuing development of the provision of services to island communities through the use of information technology; the development of three to five year infrastructural programmes of work by the local authorities and reports by both the North-Western and the Western Health Boards regarding the development of island services. Other recommendations in the report are being examined by the relevant Departments in conjunction with the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee. Full co-operation and support has been sought from relevant Departments and State agencies with a view to progressing the recommendations.</P>

I will however, be hosting two meetings of the European Council in Dublin Castle on 5 October 1996 and 13/14 December 1996 respectively. These meetings will be attended by the Heads of State and Foreign Ministers of the member states of the European Union.  The Heads of State and Foreign Ministers of the applicant countries from central and eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta will be invited to meet the European Council in December.

      <P>In 1995 my Department received an additional £3.5 million for Presidency preparations. This year, the allocation for the Presidency is £8.704 million.  Most of the <Col N="69" /> Presidency budget is being used to cover the cost of salaries for additional temporary staff, extra travel and subsistence expenses, additional accommodation, communications and IT expenses and additional expenditure on press and information activities.  The allocation for press and information services is being used by the relevant sections of my Department to produce information materials to promote Ireland's image and interests abroad and to provide services for the international media who are focusing on Ireland during our Presidency.  As part of a special information effort for the EU Presidency, the following material has been produced: a pamphlet outlining Ireland's Presidency responsibilities and priorities; an information sheet on <i>Ireland and the EU</i> setting out our experience of EU membership; a booklet on <i>The Economy</i> highlighting our economic achievements; and <i>Ireland in Brief,</i> published in a range of languages, which has factual information on all aspects of Irish life.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department has produced two booklets on <i>Pointers for the Irish Presidency,</i> and on <i>Common Foreign and Security Policy.</i> These publications are designed to serve the needs of participants in EU Presidency meetings, visiting delegations and the international media.  They are also distributed through Irish Missions abroad.  The final cost of these information materials is not yet available but is estimated at £100,000 approximately.</P>

      <P>The EU Council of Ministers is composed of Ministers from each member state meeting in various <Col N="70" /> formations, for example the General Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council and the ECOFIN &mdash; Economics and Finance &mdash; Council.  No one office bears exclusive responsibility for press and media arrangements for the Council of Ministers.  Rather, each Presidency takes responsibility for the handling of press issues.  The Presidency is assisted in this task by the Council of the European Union General Secretariat in Brussels, for example in the simultaneous issuing of press releases and in communicating information to the Brussels-based Press Corps.  In the case of the Irish Presidency, the press offices of the individual relevant Government Departments provide the appropriate services for the media.  These include issuing statements and press releases, giving press briefings, and making arrangements for the seven Informal Meetings of Ministers which are being held in Ireland during the six months of our Presidency.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to his previous written question on 23 March 1995 &mdash; Official Report, Vol. 451, No. 1, Question No. 28 &mdash; that the Irish Embassy in London has raised the situation of these two prisoners with the relevant British authorities on a previous occasion.  On my instructions, the Embassy has now raised the questions of the possible setting of a release date for the two prisoners with the relevant British authorities. Those authorities have advised that the next review of the two prisoners' cases by the parole board is scheduled to take place in 1998.  The first review was in 1992.  The British <Col N="71" /> authorities further advise that the prisoners will be informed before the end of this year if there is any change in the length of the tariff or penal element of their sentence.  As I have indicated before, the particular release arrangements in these cases is a matter to be pursued by the prisoners and their legal advisers.  As both prisoners have applied for transfer to prison in this jurisdiction under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, I would repeat that the Government stands ready to receive such prisoners.</P>

      <P>The office of the Tánaiste has been assigned responsibility, at central Government level, for co-ordinating action to deal with the problem of violence against women. The office has had discussions with relevant Government Departments and other interested groups on this issue. Arising from these contacts, it has been decided to establish a working group to develop a co-ordinated response and strategy on mental, physical or sexual violence against women &mdash; with a particular focus on domestic violence.  The group will: examine existing services and supports &mdash; emergency, interim and long-term &mdash; for women who have been subjected to violence; examine legislation dealing with the victims and perpetrators of domestic violence and make recommendations on how legislation, services and supports could be improved and made more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group will also examine the causes of violence against women (including if necessary, initiating research) and make recommendations <Col N="72" /> for a comprehensive preventative strategy as well as looking at rehabilitation programmes for perpetrators of such crimes.  Individual Government Departments and agencies will continue to be responsible for the actual development and delivery of services for women who have been the victims of violence.  Membership of the working group will be drawn from relevant Government Departments and State agencies.  It will also include individual experts and practitioners from relevant service delivery areas.  The group will be chaired by Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, Minister of State at the Office of the Tánaiste, and details of the composition of the group will be announced shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 99, 100 and 101 together.  The Law of the Sea Convention &mdash; LOSC &mdash; was done at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982 and entered into force internationally on 16 November 1994.  It deals comprehensively with a large number of maritime law issues and sets out an international legal regime on subjects which include the delimitation of the various maritime zones, the delimitation of the national continental shelf, the exploitation of the deep sea-bed and various issues of environmental concern.  It constitutes one of the most significant acts of consolidation of international law &mdash; that is, the setting out in convention form of hitherto dispersed and frequently unclear rules on a particular topic or set of topics &mdash; ever accomplished by the international community.  Ireland ratified the Convention earlier this year and has been bound by its provisions since 21 July 1996.  There are at present 104 States party to the Convention.  The advantages of a convention-based legal regime on the sea are universally recognised, and are particularly attractive for maritime countries such as Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Of relevance also is the fact that the European Union as such also intends to become a party to the Convention in the near future.</P>
      <P>The issue of Rockall has in the past been a source of some public legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Much of that controversy was due to unresolved fears on either side regarding the division as between the two countries in the sea area around that rock or skerry.  In particular, jurisdiction over Rockall &mdash; the claim by the United Kingdom which is contested by Ireland &mdash; was thought to be central to the mineral rights in the adjacent seabed, as well as to national fishing rights in the surrounding seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> This country has, over the past three decades, been involved in a process of clarification of these issues.  Article 121 (3) of the LOSC, which represents the view of the majority of the world's states as expressed either in negotiations at the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea &mdash; UNCLOS III &mdash; in the 1970s and/or by their subsequent signature and ratification of or accession to the Convention, states that:</P>
    <P>Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.</P>
    <P>Ireland has, by its signature and ratification of the Convention, formally accepted this as a statement of the international law on the matter.  The Anglo-Irish Continental Shelf Agreement of 7 November 1988, published in the Treaty Series as No. 1 of 1990, which sets out the agreed delimitation of the continental shelf as between Ireland and the United Kingdom, reflects this understanding of the law &mdash; that delimitation was agreed without reference to Rockall and without prejudice to this country's position on the jurisdictional question, including the issue of fishing rights.</P>
    <P>At present the United Kingdom claims a 12-mile territorial sea around Rockall, a claim which, depending as it does on jurisdiction over the rock, Ireland has likewise not accepted.  Both sides remain aware of the continuing position of their counterpart in the matter. Quite independently of these issues, it is a matter of public record and it continues to be my understanding that the British Government has been consistent in its support for the United Kingdom's becoming a party to the LOSC.  My attention has been drawn to exchanges on this matter in the House of Lords on 20 June and again on 5 July of this year, but nothing that was said at either time leads me to believe that there has been any fundamental revision of the British position and intentions towards the Convention as I understand them.  The issue central to those exchanges was one of the timing of British accession rather <Col N="75" /> than a change in the policy which is favourable to that accession.  Formally becoming a party to a wide range of international legal engagements such as is contained in the Convention is never a simple matter and the moment at which such a move is finally made is of course a matter solely for the relevant authorities in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>The situation in Burma is of great concern to the Council of the European Union and to the Government.  I am aware of the requests made by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy for the imposition of immediate trade and investment sanctions on Burma.  The Council of Ministers considered the matter of Burma on 15 July 1996.  The Council were deeply alarmed by the continuing deterioration of the political situation in Burma and urged the State Law and Order Restoration Council &mdash; SLORC &mdash; to restore democracy without delay and to respect the human rights of the people of Burma.  The Council reiterated the call for a full and satisfactory explanation from the Burmese authorities of the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death in custody, on 22 June 1996, of the late Mr. James Leander Nichols, who has served as Honorary Consul for several European States.  With this in mind, the Council invited the various instances of the European Union to consider possible further restrictive measures in co-operation with other countries concerned and is continuing to monitor developments in this matter closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then the Irish Presidency has also asked the UN Working Party on Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment, the UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar (Burma), and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate current aspects of the human rights' situation in Burma.  The European Union will devote the Eighth Meeting of the Committee for the Generalised System of Preferences on trade from 30 September to 2 October, entirely to the investigation of alleged practices of forced labour in Burma. When I represented the EU Presidency <Col N="77" /> as the ASEAN Regional Forum in Jakarta, I sought a meeting with the Foreign Minister of Burma, Mr. Ohn Gyaw. This was the first occasion since 1994 that such a high-level meeting has taken place between the EU and Burma.  I indicated in forthright terms to Mr. Ohn Gyaw that the European Union wished to see the immediate and unconditional release of those members of the National League for Democracy and all other political prisoners and for the SLORC to enter into meaningful dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other representatives of the pro-democracy groups to bring about national conciliation and democratic reform, respecting the aspirations of the Burmese people as expressed in the elections of 1990.  I shall pursue these concerns further when I lead the EU Ministerial Troika in a further meeting with Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw, in the margins of the current UN General Assembly, which is to take place in New York tomorrow.</P>

      <P>On 23 September 1996, I led the EU Ministerial Troika at a meeting in New York with the Chinese Vice-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Qian Qichen.  I availed of the opportunity to pursue the question of human rights in the People's Republic of China, which I have raised in previous meetings with the Vice Premier.  One of the matters I raised with him was the question of the continuation of the EU Troika/China Human Rights' Dialogue at expert level. This Dialogue was initiated in 1995 in order to discuss the whole spectrum of human rights issues in China.  The <Col N="78" /> inaugural meeting took place in Brussels in January 1995, while a second meeting &mdash; with participation from Ireland &mdash; was held in Beijing in January 1996.  The Chinese side indicated that they would like to study the matter further before agreeing to a continuation of the Dialogue.  I am anxious that an early agreement should be reached on this point and am hopeful that there will be a positive response from China.</P>
      <P>The position of the EU in relation to human rights in China is set out in its Memorandum to the 51st UN General Assembly, which accompanied the address I delivered on behalf of the Union at the General Assembly yesterday. A copy of the Memorandum is being placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The EU at the Florence European Council acknowledged the efforts and progress made by China in restructuring its economy and starting to develop the rule of law.  However the EU is looking for more committed respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  To improve its relations with China, the EU has implemented a political dialogue framework which provides for regular consultation at all levels.  In addition to the experts dialogue on human rights to which I have already referred, the human rights issue is also addressed at other political dialogue meetings.</P>
      <P>The EU is concerned about the human rights situation in China, including Tibet, and in particular the treatment of political dissidents and the fate of the Panchen Lama.  It has urged China to implement legislation and other positive measures in the human rights field, particularly the early accession to and ratification of the international convenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights.  The Irish Presidency is pursuing these concerns actively.</P>

      <P>Ireland and her partners in the European Union are continuing to monitor the progress which Crotia is making towards fulfilling the commitments it has given in connection with its membership application.  It is still too early to assess, in particular, the extent to which Croatia has honoured its obligations in relation to facilitating the proper conduct of elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Security Council of the United Nations on 20 September also considered it necessary to call on Croatia to fulfil its obligations towards the International Criminal Tribunal. The EU has therefore not yet arrived at a final view as to whether or not there is a need to seek a reconsideration by the Council of Europe of the decision to invite Croatia to become a member of that organisation.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of the conflict in Chechnya, the Government has been working to promote a peaceful negotiated solution to the situation there.  Through both bilateral contact with the Russian authorities and in Government statements we have called for urgent attention to be paid to the plight of the civilian population and stressed the need for an end to military action and the opening of political negotiations. We have also made clear our strongly held belief that the OSCE <Col N="83" /> Assistance Mission to Grozny can play a valuable role in the efforts to establish peace.  Together with EU partners we have reiterated this position in EU demarches to the Russian side and in EU declarations.  The latest peace accords signed between General Lebed and the Chechen separatists on 31 August hold out an important opportunity for peace.  In addition to the military issues involved, such as the questions of a ceasefire, troop withdrawals, joint commands and patrols, these accords, for the first time, have also dealt with the political issues surrounding the conflict in Chechnya by postponing, until 2001, consideration of the status of Chechnya and providing in the meantime for the holding of local elections and the establishment of a local coalition Government.  It is understood from the Russian authorities that President Yeltsin and the Government have endorsed these accords and that some of the provisions in relation to troop withdrawals, joint commands and joint patrols have already begun to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the ground in Chechnya the situation has improved considerably.  Most of the federal forces have been pulled back from Grozny, with a small number remaining to man joint patrols together with the separatists to maintain order. The humanitarian situation, while still very serious, has also begun to be addressed.  Ireland together with EU partners has welcomed the recent positive developments in Chechnya and in particular the resumption of dialogue between the parties.  However, important issues remain unresolved and difficulties have arisen in a number of areas.  It is clear, therefore, that continued efforts will have to be made by both sides if the opportunity for lasting peace presented by these accords is to be realised.  In our view the OSCE can make a constructive contribution in this regard.  Ireland together with EU partners will continue to follow closely developments in Chechnya and to give <Col N="84" /> every possible support to the efforts to arrive at a lasting peaceful settlement.</P>

      <P>The situation in Burundi has been a matter of ongoing deep concern to the Government and our EU partners.  That concern was heightened further by the July military coup which brought Major Pierre Buyoya to power.  Meanwhile, the killings have continued.  The circumstances of the murder of Archbishop Ruhana on 9 September were a source of particular revulsion.  Efforts to avert a further humanitarian crisis in Burundi must continue to focus on the creation of an appropriate framework which will enable a cease-fire to be put in place and meaningful dialogue to be organised without delay.  The EU considers such a dialogue essential, bringing together all of Burundi's political forces without exception, in order to negotiate a democratic, institutional consensus ensuring security for all.  In its Declaration of 19 August the EU has therefore urged all sides to the conflict in Burundi to refrain from violence and to commit themselves to, and work actively towards, a negotiated and peaceful resolution of the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A critical role is being played in this process by the regional leaders, the Organisation of African Unity and the former President of Tanzania, Mr. Julius Nyerere.  For several months they have been working to establish a process of mediation between the various factions, under Mr. Nyerere's chairmanship. They have taken a strong stand against the Buyoya coup, imposing stiff <Col N="85" /> economic sanctions.  One of the conditions for their lifting is the unconditional opening of inclusive negotiations. The European Union has expressed strong support for the regional leaders and Mr. Nyerere in their efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to the Burundian crisis.  The EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, is working actively with them in this regard.  Mr. Ajello has been liaising closely with the Irish Presidency in pursuing his work in the region and was in Dublin recently for consultations with myself and with Ms Joan Burton TD, The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In addition, the Irish Presidency recently arranged for a series of démarches by the Troika of Heads of Mission in the various regional capitals, including Bujumbura, to underline further the continued concerns of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Resolution 1072 adopted by the UN Security Council on 30 August have reinforced the very clear message of the EU and other members of the international community to the conflicting parties in Burundi that there must be an early end to all violence and an immediate commencement of dialogue.  Resolution 1072 provides for further possible measures, including the imposition of an arms embargo, if national dialogue does not being before 31 October.  It also provides for continued contingency planning by UN member states for an international presence and other initiatives to support and help consolidate a cessation of hostilities, as well as to make a rapid humanitarian response in the event of widespread violence or a serious deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Burundi.  From a humanitarian perspective, it is clear that the present situation is already deeply worrying.  A small number of UN agencies and NGOs have continued to supply relief aid to vunerable persons and displaced people in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  The recent decision <Col N="86" /> by the regional leaders to exempt certain classes of relief items from the sanctions on Burundi has allowed humanitarian agencies to import emergency medical and nutritional supplements for infants and hospital patients.  The UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs plan is in place and envisages a mobilisation of humanitarian resources regionally to bring relief aid to Burundians fleeing to neighbouring states from violence.</P>
    <P>The European Union continues to fund humanitarian relief by the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).  Last July, ECHO in consultation with member states, approved a further allocation of 36.5 million ECU for Rwandan and Burundian refugees and internally displaced persons.  In addition a major food aid programme valued at 110 million ECU in both Rwanda and Burundi is under way. Bilaterally, the Government remain seized of the critical need to continue to support humanitarian activities in Burundi.  Over £1 million has been spent this year on a range of actions in Burundi.  This has included some funding also for the efforts of Mr. Nyerere. We will continue to play our full part in the contingency planning in case of a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the country and my Department is engaged in active consultation with the UN agencies in New York and Geneva and with the European Commission in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, however, the solution to the situation in Burundi will be political and efforts in that regard are being intensified.  In New York this week, where I am attending the UN General Assembly, I met with Mr. Nyerere for discussions on the current situation and on the way forward.  I assured Mr. Nyerere of the EU's continued support for his work and that of the regional leaders.  There are hopes that a further regional Summit may take place shortly to review the prospects for the commencement of inclusive negotiations.  In addition, at the request of the Presidency and our EU partners, Special Envoy <Col N="87" /> Ajello is shortly to carry out an urgent new mission to the region on behalf of the EU.  During this round of contacts, he will visit several capitals to assist directly in the regional efforts to commence such a process of negotiations between the various Burundian parties. The United States is also working actively with all parties to the same end. Other options, such as an EU Ministerial Troika to Burundi, as suggested by the Deputy, will be kept under active review.  The situation will be assessed further by EU partners following completion of Mr. Ajello's mission.</P>

      <P>The recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina were a crucial step in the peace process.  The Irish Presidency, on behalf of the EU, welcomed the holding of these elections and the fact that they had taken place in a dignified and largely trouble-free manner, and paid tribute to the crucial contribution which was made to the effectiveness of the electoral process by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &mdash; OSCE &mdash; the High Representative, Carl Bildt, the international Implementation Force &mdash; IFOR &mdash; and the UN International Police Task Force &mdash; IPTF.  These elections pave the way for the full implementation of all provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina which ensures the continued existence of that State within its internationally recognised borders, and in particular for the establishment of the common institutions of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU has considered it important to await the decision of the Chairman of the Provisional Election Commission, <Col N="88" /> Ambassador Frowick, on the validity of the elections and on certification of the results.  The High Representative envisages convening the first official meeting of the collective Bosnian Presidency within 4 days of the certification of the election results, and the establishment of all the common institutions by the end of October.  Ireland and the European Union fully support the efforts of the High Representative to ensure a smooth and swift transition over the coming weeks and we have urged all parties to co-operate fully in these efforts.  The international community will maintain pressure on all sides to co-operate in this process, particularly through the International Contact Group for former Yugoslavia and the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council, in which Ireland, as Presidency of the European Union, participates. The need for international assistance for the process of establishing a self-sustaining stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue for a number of years.  The European Union is of the view that there is now a need for the international community to develop a strategy for a two-year peace consolidation period, covering such areas as the promotion of human rights, the return of refugees and displaced persons, economic reconstruction and reform, and arms control.  The EU is committed to continuing to make a major contribution to this international effort with the ultimate aim of developing conditions for lasting stability and economic prosperity in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 113 together. The Government has been deeply concerned at the recent escalation of tension in the Gulf area.  It has been working closely with its European partners so that the Union can exercise all its influence in order to ensure that international order and stability is maintained and calm is restored to the region.  I am satisfied that we achieved the highest possible degree of cohesion among our partners during our discussions on the crisis in the Gulf at the informal ministerial meeting which was held at Tralee on 7-8 September.  From that discussion certain general principles resulted which form the basis for a strong common policy in relation to Iraq.  All EU member states are committed to the maintenance of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the states in the region, including Iraq, while continuing to support a Kurdish enclave in Northern Iraq, and the continuation of the no-fly zone, which has played a major role in curbing the excesses of the Iraqi regime.  The Union is willing to pursue contacts with the neighbouring countries in the region with a view to de-escalating tensions in Northern Iraq.  We also agreed on the need to ensure that steps are taken to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi civilian population, and children in particular, through the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 986 which would allow the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for food and medical supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of practical action the Union, which has been providing substantial humanitarian assistance to the civilian population of Northern Iraq since the Gulf War, has agreed to respond, and is responding, to the present humanitarian plight of the <Col N="90" /> Kurdish population as generously as resources allow.  In its capacity as Presidency of the EU, Ireland has instructed the troika of Ambassadors in Ankara to request the Turkish authorities to remove recent administrative changes in respect of Non-Governmental aid agencies working from Turkey into Northern Iraq, so that they can be better placed to help the population affected by the latest hostilities.  Also on the instructions of the Irish Presidency, the Presidency's local representative in Ankara and the Commission representative both visited Northern Iraq last week to obtain assurances from Mr. Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party, regarding the safety of local aid workers employed on EU projects.  I am glad to report that these assurances were received.</P>
    <P>I believe that these elements, taken together, represent a commendable effort by the European Union to exert a positive and constructive influence on the situation in the Gulf.  The common foreign policies of the European Union are developed in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty on European Union and reflect the level of agreement attainable between the member states on the issues under consideration. As current Presidency, Ireland is seeking to ensure that the CFSP functions as effectively as possible on the basis of the existing Treaty provisions and that the Union makes the maximum possible contribution to the resolution of international issues, in particular those affecting peace and stability.  The Intergovernmental Conference is currently reviewing the operation of the CFSP and is considering how the present arrangements for EU foreign policy formulation can be improved.</P>

      <P>Provision was made in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 for financing of actions which come within the competence of the European Union under the Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; as defined in that Treaty.  Under the present Treaty, such expenditure may be financed either from the European Community budget or by national contributions from member states.  The Treaty provisions on the CFSP are currently under review at the Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; IGC &mdash; in accordance with the relevant provisions of Title V of the Maastricht Treaty.  There is a generally shared wish to improve the procedures for making funds available for CFSP measures so that these can be mobilised quickly once the Council has decided on a course of action.  In this context, the Irish Presidency has put forward a possible approach whereby operational CFSP expenditure could be charged to the Community budget subject to certain exceptions.  In particular, operational expenditure on matters involving the use of military means would not be charged to the Community budget.  At this stage, however, there is no agreement on any of the issues before the Conference and it is too early to predict the final outcome.  Any changes to the Treaty, of course, will require the unanimous approval of all member states.</P>

      <P>The European <Col N="92" /> Union has taken an active role in international fora in efforts to eliminate child labour and has supported efforts to give greater prominence to this issue.  A number of proposals have emerged in these fora to address the problem of child labour.  In particular, the International Labour Organisation &mdash; ILO &mdash; has an international programme for the elimination of child labour in place which the EU has actively supported. At an ILO conference in June 1996, the Government delegations of 13 member states of the EU, including Ireland, co-sponsored a resolution concerning the elimination of child labour.  This resolution welcomed the increased role of the ILO in the fight against child labour and the increased level of technical co-operation programmes being undertaken by the ILO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU sponsored an omnibus resolution on the Rights of the Child adopted at the Commission on Human Rights this spring.  This resolution which called for the elimination of exploitation of child labour and called upon all governments &ldquo;to take legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to ensure the protection of children from economic exploitation...&rdquo; was adopted by consensus on 24 April.  The EU has taken a number of measures relevant to this general issue.  First, special incentive arrangements under the EU Generalised System of Preferences shall be applied, with effect from 1998, to those countries which abide by ILO Conventions on, <i>inter alia,</i> the minimum age for entry into employment.  Second, all new EU agreements with third countries contain provisions committing both sides to respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the universal Declaration on Human Rights and containing measures, up to and including the suspension of the agreement, if such provisions are violated.  Third, the EU-US Joint Action Plan, signed in Madrid on 3 December 1995, commits both sides to work together &ldquo;in the WTO and other fora with a view to dissipating various misunderstandings and preoccupations <Col N="93" /> of trading partners regarding the relationship between trade and internationally recognised labour standards&rdquo;.</P>

I have been in touch with our Embassy in Moscow, which has been active in assisting people coming to Ireland under the Chernobyl children project, which enables thousands of children who were victims of Chernobyl to come to Ireland for holidays and necessary medical attention.  To date the Embassy has received no application for visas to come to Ireland from either of the families concerned.  Similarly, our Embassy in Prague, which is the accredited Embassy for the Ukraine, has to date received no application for entry visas from either of the families.  Any applications received will be considered in the normal way.  The Department of Health would then be consulted regarding the possibility of providing appropriate medical treatment.</P>

      <P>One of the issues which is under discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; IGC &mdash; is the possible incorporation of antidiscrimination provisions into the treaties. The Irish Presidency has tabled a possible approach in this area which is contained in the Presidency Introductory Note on Fundamental Rights dated 26 July 1996 which has been forwarded to the Oireachtas Library.  The Presidency Note, referred to above, deals in so far as discrimination is concerned, with two main possibilities: the incorporation of a non-discrimination clause in the Treaty (a supplement to Article F of the Treaty on European Union has been suggested) which would stipulate that discrimination shall be prohibited <Col N="95" /> on grounds of race, sex, national or ethnic origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion and social origin and the establishment of a legal basis in the Treaty (a new Article 6a in the Treaty establishing the European Communities has been suggested) which would permit the European Institutions to adopt appropriate legislative provisions in respect of discrimination.</P>
      <P>The Presidency Note also includes the possibility of an amendment to Article 100a with a view to ensuring that in drawing up internal market standards the Council shall take into account the needs of people with a disability.  In addition to the possible approach to discrimination outlined above, the Presidency Note on Fundamental Rights suggests the possibility of strengthening the principle of equality between men and women in other ways in the Treaty. While the initial reaction to the Presidency Note including the approach to discrimination and equality has, in broad terms, been reasonably positive, a key consideration is that all Treaty amendments must be approved unanimously by the member states.  It is too early to predict what the final outcome will be on any of the issues under consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case in question which has been raised on several occasions with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, including with regard to the circumstances of the conviction.  The British authorities have responded that, as <Col N="96" /> this case has been through the full judicial process of trial and appeal, the only course which now seems open is to ask the Secretary of State to exercise his statutory power to refer the case back to the court of appeal.  They note that the Secretary of State would expect to be satisfied that there is some new evidence or some other consideration of substance which had not previously been before the courts and which appears to cast doubt on the safety of the conviction.  I understand that legal representatives acting on behalf of the individual in question are pursuing inquiries which they hope may provide the necessary material for a successful petition to the Secretary of State.  I can assure you that my Department will continue to monitor this case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the case to which she refers has been closely monitored for some years.  I would refer her to my answer of 21 November 1995 &mdash; Official Report, Vol. 458, No. 5, Question No. 65 &mdash; regarding this case.  This prisoner who is categorised as &ldquo;exceptional risk&rdquo; category A is currently held in Belmarsh prison.  Court charges against him and several others arising out of an attempted escape from Whitemoor prison in September 1994 commenced on 16 September 1996.  These proceedings have since been adjourned until January 1997 on grounds of contempt of court resulting from possible prejudicial newspaper coverage.  The delay in proceeding with these charges was raised within <Col N="97" /> the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The Government has on a number of occasions raised concern about the particular conditions under which this prisoner and other are being held in the special secure unit at Belmarsh prison as well as the policy of closed visits which is currently in operation.  The British authorities have responded that categorisation of these prisoners is periodically reviewed.  Further to representations made by the Embassy in London regarding the restoration of this prisoner's pursuit of a legal studies course, the British authorities confirmed in April of this year that the British Prison Service had agreed to fund this prisoner's law course and that the prisoner is in possession of all the required textbooks.  I note that this prisoner has applied for transfer to this jurisdiction under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  I would like to reiterate that we stand ready to receive all prisoners who seek to transfer to this jurisdiction under the Convention.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Embassy in London, on my instructions, will continue to follow all aspects of this case closely.</P>

      <P>The issue of greater availability of RTÉ services throughout Northern Ireland is a source of on-going discussions between both Governments.  Reciprocal access to each other's broadcasting services can make an obvious contribution to better understanding between North and South and also indeed, between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland.  Our objective <Col N="98" /> of greater access to RTÉ television in Northern Ireland is shared by the British Government.  A bilateral broadcasting group comprising official and technical experts was set up by the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in 1994, to examine the issue of RTÉ reception in Northern Ireland.  A joint technical report on ways of overcoming any problems of interference which could arise from increasing the power northwards from Clermont Carn was recently agreed between the radio frequency management authorities in the Department of Transport.  Energy and Communications and their counterpart in the Radiocommunications Agency in London.  I understand that political agreement to a phased implementation of the proposed changes to the transmitter at Clermont Carn is now awaited.  This issue has been a regular items on the agenda of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference since July 1993, and most recently on 22 May this year.  I and my colleagues in the Government will continue to pursue this matter through the appropriate channels.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would enable the information requested to be provided on a regional basis.  The only relevant information available is on income tax receipts on farming profits for the whole country.</P>
      <P>The amounts of income tax paid on farming profits from 1991 to 1995 are estimated as follows: £36.0 million in 1991; £48.0 million in 1992; £55.0 million in 1993; £66.5 million in 1994; and £70.0 million in 1995.  The post-budget estimate for 1996 is £74.0 million.</P>
      <P>These figures reflect the tax take in respect of farming profits.  They do not include PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1992-93, the latest available, indicates that some £56 million in tax was paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
      <P>The figures for income tax yields do not include any yields in 1993 and 1994 under the 1993 tax amnesty.  Also excluded from the calculations are tax receipts from deposit interest retention tax because it is not possible to apportion that tax between particular classes of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they receive requests to change registration numbers for a wide variety of reasons.  To maintain the integrity of the register it has not been the practice to accede to such requests. It is understood that the practice of the previous registration authority, prior to 1993, was likewise.  There are no current proposals to introduce legislation to facilitate such changes.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works advise me that a new premises for a driving test centre has been leased at the Westside Shopping Centre, Galway. The agreement dates from 5 February 1966 and it is expected that the new space will be ready for occupation early in 1997.  This is the only accommodation in Galway for which the Commissioners are currently paying a rent in respect of the driver testers.  Space previously occupied by the driver testers at the Murrough has been allocated for other Civil Service accommodation.  The driver testers are currently accommodated in space leased by the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>Reliable figures are not available to estimate the number of parents who pay for baby minding services in official-registered creches or in informal arrangements. The cost of introducing an income tax allowance for such official arrangements depends on the exact terms of any scheme being considered. For example, it is tentatively estimated that if a tax allowance were introduced for the parents of children under 5 years to cover the cost of the registered child-care up to a maximum of £3,000 per annum, then the cost to the Exchequer would be £60 million.  Any proposals in this area will be considered in the context of the 1997 budget and the benefits of any such proposals will be considered in comparison to other possible tax reductions.</P>

      <P>With regard to the frequency of wages-salaries, Civil Service grades are paid weekly or fortnightly.  As regards general service grades, the clerical grades, service officers, paperkeepers and cleaners are paid weekly.  Staff officers and the executive and higher grades are paid fortnightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State Directory (Part 3) gives details of the rates of pay for the full <Col N="107" /> range of Civil Service.  Where a rate is shown there in pounds and pence, it is a weekly rate, and those grades are paid weekly.  The grades for whom an annual rate is shown are paid on a fortnightly basis, except for a very few isolated cases that are paid monthly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the frequency of payment of pensions, until now, Civil Service pensions have been paid monthly. From next month, payment will be changed to a fortnightly basis.  This has been agreed following representations made by the Retired Civil and Public Servants Association requesting that retired Civil Servants be given the option of having their pensions paid fortnightly.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to introduce an optional arrangement on an individual basis under the present payroll system used for paying pensions.  This system operates on a group basis and all pensioners in a particular group are tied to a common frequency of payment.  There are seven groups within the system, covering 15,000 pensioners.</P>
    <P>Weekly payment would involve a further doubling in volume of payment <Col N="108" /> transactions.  This would require extra staffing and other resources which are not available at present.  The new fortnightly system will commence on 17 October 1996.</P>

    <P>These units are used mainly to act on information received and to support the overall intelligence-gathering operation of the CNDT.  The semi-rigid inflatable craft involved are suitable only for inshore use or for use close to the shoreline. They are not suitable for and are not used as patrol craft.  Operations requiring sea patrol or surveillance beyond the coastline are carried out by the Naval Service which has always provided vital assistance on request.</P>
    <P>As these figures indicate, maritime units are concentrated primarily in the area of the south and west coast where most of their activities take place, reflecting the greater danger of drugs smuggling in that area.  A problem which has arisen in the staffing of the Dublin-based unit due to the departure of some trained and experienced staff led to that unit not being launched so far this year.  This problem is being addressed and it is expected that the unit will be fully operational again in the near future.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall drive to gather intelligence about drug sumuggling <Col N="109" /> activity and suspicious movement of yachts and other vessels, intelligence units of the CNDT operate along the entire coastline of the State.  This operation has been fully maintained throughout the period.  The CNDT has also enlisted the assistance of the general public through the Drugs Watch Programme by encouraging coastal communities and maritime personnel to report unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs.  This programme which was launched in 1994 has met with a very positive response.</P>
    <P>There is very close co-operation with the Garda authorities and the Naval Service in combating smuggling of drugs by sea and the CNDT maintains direct contact with Customs services in other countries with whom there is also intensive exchange of intelligence.</P>

      <P>As I announced in my budget speech last January, the modifications made in the section 35 relief for investment in films were designed to improve the targeting of the relief and to make it more cost-efficient from the point of view of the Exchequer.  The operation of the relief has been examined by an independent economic consultancy firm and this study estimated the annual benefit to the Exchequer at between £10.8 million and £13.5 million compared to an Exchequer cost of £19.4 million.  This meant that there was a net cost to the Exchequer of between £5.9 million to £8.6 million.  The study also found that a large part of the benefit of the relief <Col N="111" /> accrued to the investors and the intermediaries rather than to the film company itself.  Also, there was evidence of over-heating in the industry which manifested itself in the form of excessive wages being paid to film crews and to film personnel having to be brought in from abroad.  For all these reasons it was necessary to amend the section 35 relief and focus it better.  The changes made to the section 35 relief in the 1966 budget and Finance Act, therefore, targeted the relief at smaller film productions which would tend to have a greater level of Irish employment than the large-scale productions.</P>
      <P>My Department is not yet aware of any significant adverse effect on hotels or the other areas mentioned by the Deputy as a result of the changes in section 35 relief.  While assessments of the 1996 tourism year are obviously not yet to hand, there is every indication that 1996 will be another good tourist year, as reflected for example in the high accommodation levels achieved by hotels in the Dublin area.  As the Deputy will know, the Irish economy is having another good year and tourism growth is contributing to this.</P>
      <P>The question of any loss to Ireland of various film proposals is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who has the responsibility for certifying films for the section 35 relief.</P>

      <P>The home relocation scheme was set up as part of the Government's humanitarian assistance package for the victims of flooding to benefit people who were made effectively homeless as a consequence of the severe flooding that affected many parts of the country in 1995.</P>
      <P>The person referred to submitted an application for relocation which, following full consideration of the circumstances, was refused as the applicant failed to satisfy one of the basic qualification criteria for the scheme.  The home relocation scheme, devised in full consultation with representative groups of the victims, stipulates quite clearly that only owner occupiers would qualify for assistance.  In this particular instance the applicant was not in residence in the house at the time of the flooding &mdash; indeed, the house was never occupied by the applicant &mdash; and was, therefore, deemed not to qualify for assistance under the scheme.  She was informed of this decision.</P>

The arbitrator advised that the applicant &ldquo;... fails to meet the stipulated criteria of owner/occupier under the scheme and cannot properly be considered for inclusion as she does not meet the specific parameters stipulated within this scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The applicant's appeal was subsequently refused, she was informed of the decision and a copy of the arbitrator's advice was issued to her.  As the applicant has already been through the statutory appeals process, I feel there would be no benefit in a further review of the case.</P>

      <P>The 1994 Finance Act provided for this very generous stamp duty relief, which costs the Exchequer approximately £4 million annually, in respect of transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers.  The relief involves a two-thirds reduction in the stamp duty that would otherwise be payable, and applies in respect of transfers occurring between 7 January 1994 and 31 December 1996.  The relief has greatly improved the climate for land transfer, and complements the EU farmers retirement scheme in facilitating lifetime transfer to young farmers.</P>
      <P>However, a principal rationale for the relief is that it is a temporary measure designed to encourage early transfers of lands.  At this stage it is not intended, therefore, to extend the relief beyond the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Each Head of Department is fully aware of the Government policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities, which was reiterated in the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Civil Service, a copy of which is issued to all staff.  The code of practice calls on all Government Departments to continue to play their full part in employing people with disabilities.  In addition, since 1993, the Civil Service Commissioners have assigned a member of their staff as liaison officer for the recruitment of people with disabilities to the Civil Service to liaise with candidates, Departments and relevant specialised organisations.</P>
      <P>The quota of 3 per cent applies to the Civil Service as a whole, not to individual Departments or grades.  However, as can be seen from the list, the majority of Departments had 3 per cent or more disabled people on their staff as of 1 October 1995.</P>
      <P>While the matter is kept continuously under review, there are no plans at the moment to alter the 3 per cent quota. The priority at present is to ensure that (a) the quota is maintained; and (b) the working environment in the Civil Service is such that staff with disabilities can contribute to their full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is implemented by (a) from time to time holding competitions confined to people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the <Col N="115" /> National Rehabilitation Board as having a disability, (b) facilitating people with a disability when competing in open competitions not confined to people with a disability and (c) where possible, retaining staff who become disabled after their recruitment.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis for some time has been on the achievement of the target quota, it is also important to ensure equality of treatment between staff with and without disabilities once in employment. With this in mind, the code of practice drawn up in 1993 covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation and equipment and safety and evacuation procedures.  The ideas for the code of practice were developed in conjunction with the Civil Service unions, the relevant voluntary bodies and in consultation with staff with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for people with disabilities, which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>

      <P>Under section 3 of the Finance Act, 1983, payments made for the maintenance of a spouse are a deduction in computing the total income for tax purposes of the paying spouse and are therefore not liable for tax in the hands of that spouse.  Instead the payments, which are <Col N="118" /> payable gross, i.e. without deduction of tax, are liable to tax in the hands of the receiving spouse.  Maintenance payments in respect of children are paid out of after tax income.  Such payments are not taxable, therefore, in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, under section 4 of the Finance Act, 1983, separated couples, who both choose to do so, may opt to be treated as a married couple for income tax purposes.  In this case, the paying spouse will pay the tax attributable to the maintenance payments and will, if the other spouse has no income, be granted the married allowance and the double rate bands.  If the other spouse has other income such as a wage or salary, the tax assessed on the couple will then, under the mandatory separate assessment procedure, be apportioned between them so that the other spouse pays the tax appropriate to his/her other income but the tax referable to the maintenance payments will still be paid by the payer.</P>
      <P>A legally separated person may not claim a tax allowance in respect of a current partner.  In general, covenants are not tax effective.  However, when the tax advantages of covenants generally were phased out in 1995, special provision was made for a small number of preexisting covenants to be allowed continue tax relief until 1998.  These covenants are generally held by cohabiting couples rearing children.</P>

      <P>The widowed person's personal allowance currently stands at £3,150 compared to £2,650 for a single person.  An additional allowance of £2,150 is available to a widowed person who has dependent children.  The lone parent allowance available to other persons is £2,650.  This means that the personal allowances of both a widowed person with dependent children and other lone parents are currently £5,300, the same as the basic allowances for a married couple.  Lone parents and widowed persons (except in the year of bereavement) receive the single person's standard tax band, currently £9,400.</P>
      <P>Aside from the personal allowances, widowed persons enjoy some other special tax treatment over single persons, including lone parents.  In the year of bereavement a widowed person retains married tax treatment including double rate bands.  In addition, a special transitional allowance was introduced in 1991 for widowed parents with dependent children to operate for the first three years following bereavement.  This allowance, which is provided in addition to the above allowances, is £1,500 for the first tax year following bereavement, £1,000 for the second year and £500 for the third tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ceiling on mortgage interest relief for widowed persons currently stands at £3,600 as compared to £2,500 for a single person.  In addition, where a widowed person is in private rented <Col N="120" /> accommodation and is under 55 years of age, a tax free allowance of up to £750 per annum at the standard rate of tax is available, compared to £500 for a single person.  If the widowed person is aged 55 or over, the allowance is up to £1,500 per annum at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax, compared to £1,000 for a single person.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to widowed persons is that certain allowances are higher in recognition of the fact that widowed persons may have taken on extra responsibilities in marriage which do not necessarily cease upon the death of a spouse.  In addition, the extra allowances are granted on compassionate grounds.</P>
    <P>The tax treatment of widowed persons and lone parents has been reviewed on a number of occasions and the existing tax treatment is considered to be reasonable.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of each tax reform implemented since 1990; if he will give an explanation of the actual reform and the cost/benefit of each reform for each year since; the rationale for the reform; and his views on whether the reform produced the anticipated results.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A summary of the principal tax reform measures taken since 1990 follows.</P>
      <P>A cost-benefit analysis of each of these measures separately has not been undertaken.  However, the broad thrust has been to reduce the tax burden, broaden the tax base, and to subject tax reliefs to greater scrutiny from an employment generating perspective. While other factors have contributed, the programme of tax reform and reducing the burden of tax on employment in particular has played its part in the economic growth of the past few years.</P>
      <P>I would also draw to the Deputy's attention the fact that the average tax take, including PRSI and levies, from a married couple, one earner, two children, earning the average production wage, has fallen from 24.7 per cent in 1989-90 to an estimated 21.6 per cent in 1996-97.  For a single person on the same wage level, the average tax take has fallen from 33.3 per cent in 1989-90 to an estimated 28.75 per cent in 1996-97.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of years Ireland has been undergoing a programme of tax changes with a view to increasing competitiveness and growth, and thereby contributing to the maintenance and creation of sustainable employment. A key element in these changes, under successive Governments, has been to broaden the tax base and to seek to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues.  A number of allowances, reliefs and exemptions have been abolished, restricted or refocused across several tax heads.  These measures have enabled tax rates to be reduced and the proportion of earned income taken in tax to be lessened.</P>
      <P>Clearly, there is further scope for widening the tax base.  This is a matter which receives ongoing consideration each year prior to the budget and the Tax Strategy Group has on a number of occasions examined the issue of base broadening.  Apart from widening the scope of certain taxes, there is also the option of restricting or eliminating tax reliefs and allowances to make more resources available for tax reduction.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that all relevant base broadening options will be examined in the run-up to next year's budget.</P>

    <P>A large number of rates apply to Customs duties and an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer from applying a 1 per cent reduction to each rate could be supplied only at disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>The budget estimate for Customs duties in 1996 is £201 million and a decrease of 1 per cent on this basis would produce a fall in yield of £2 million. However, as 90 per cent of the Customs intake each year forms part of Ireland's contribution to EU own resources, only 10 per cent is retained here.  In the circumstances, the loss to the Irish Exchequer resulting from a 1 per cent cut in yield would amount to just £0.2 million.</P>

    <P>(5)  The figure of cost shown for stamp duties is based on reducing the current 6 per cent rate on property transfers to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>(6)  The figure of cost for capital acquisitions tax is based on reducing the 40 per cent rate to 39 per cent and includes the cost of reducing probate tax from 2 per cent to 1 per cent.  As data is not available to enable a reliable costing to be made, this figure is tentative.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The EU target to give 40 per cent of people with disabilities sheltered and supported employment <Col N="136" /> relates to the target for trainees with disabilities undergoing training under the Operational Programme for Human Resource Development 1994-99.</P>
      <P>At the outset of this programme, targets were established including a 40 per cent target for trainees progressing to sheltered or supported work.  The end of year 1995 figures indicate that almost half &mdash; 20 per cent &mdash; of this target has been reached after the first two years.</P>
      <P>My Department along with the National Rehabilitation Board, which administers ESF funding on behalf of my Department, are constantly looking at ways to ensure that trainees on completion of training achieve their fullest potential.  In this regard, it is essential that there are adequate sheltered/ supported employment opportunities available to meet this demand.  The report of the Review Group on Sensory and Physical Disability, which will be finalised shortly, will be making a number of recommendations in this area.  In addition, the National Advisory Committee on Training and Employment which was established by the NRB to advise on issues relating to the training and employment of people with disabilities set up a steering committee in 1996 to specifically examine the position in regard to sheltered-supported employment.  The NRB hopes to have the report of this committee in 1997 at which time it will be necessary to examine any gaps in service provision identified in the committee's report.</P>
      <P>I might also add that in the context of preparing a response to the ESF evaluation unit report on training for people with disabilities, which was published earlier this year, my Department will shortly be inviting submissions from service providers, people with disabilities and other interested parties regarding the provision of training.  One of the areas to be examined will be the outcomes of training.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of medical card eligibility is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  It was, therefore, necessary to discuss arrangements for implementation of this measure with the chief executive officers.  This led to a <Col N="138" /> slight delay in implementing the budget provision.  Arrangements were agreed with the chief executive officers in July to enable persons who have been unemployed for at least one year to retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment, as announced in the budget.  This measure is effective from the date of the budget.</P>
      <P>The information the Deputy has requested regarding the number of persons who have benefited from the 1996 budget provision is not available at present.  The budget provision enables persons unemployed for at least 12 months who are taking up employment to retain their medical card.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 190, 198, 201, 211 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed to me by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistance service to enable people with disabilities to live independently in the community. The development of a personal assistance service was examined by the Advisory Group on Personal Assistance. While it did not recommend the establishment of an independent living fund, it recommended that funding of a personal assistance service should be considered in the context of the development of support services generally for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have informed the centre that this issue is being addressed by the Review Group on Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities whose report is expected very shortly at which time I will make a decision about the personal assistance service as part of my overall policy for the appropriate <Col N="140" /> development of support services for people with disabilities.  In the meantime, I intend to continue the current level of funding for the existing personal assistance service.</P>
    <P>The provision of personal assistance services to the seven students of the National College of Industrial Relations disabilities studies course was funded by FÁS and the European Social Fund. This course has now ended.  Four of the seven who participated in this course currently have a personal assistance service. In relation to the other three, where vacancies arise in the existing service these are filled on the basis of need.</P>
    <P>The cost-benefit analysis referred to is a cost-benefit study of personal assistance services.  This study, which was completed last year, was commissioned by the Advisory Group on Personal Assistance Services to help establish the total costs of personal assistance services and to assess their total benefits. The study arose solely in the context of providing the group with background research data on this services to enable it to reach the decisions in its report.  It was not intended by the group to publish it separately.</P>

      <P>In line with a recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women arrangements have been put in place to ensure that secure multi-annual funding is now provided through health boards to rape crisis and sexual abuse counselling centres-services nationwide.

      <P>The Western Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health services in its functional area, which includes County Mayo, and has provided statutory funding of £20,000 in 1996 to the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre towards the provision of its services.</P>
      <P>I understand that the centre has made an application to the board for additional funds totalling approximately £28,000 for 1996 and that the board is in discussion with representatives of the centre regarding this application.</P>

    <P>Statistics are not readily available which would indicate the average length of waiting time in each of the last five years for people in the Dublin metropolitan area.  However, the following would be indicative of waiting times in the Dublin area.  The average waiting time for a kidney transplant is about ten months while the waiting time for a hip replacement at present can be as short as three months and would average out at 12 months.</P>
    <P>The scheduling of people for cardiac surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  However, non-urgent cases for cardiac surgery can be on the waiting list for a considerable time and I have indicated to the House that I intend to tackle this problem.  For a successful transplantation it is essential that a suitable matching donor organ is available.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of services for people with AIDS in the Southern Health Board area is a matter for the board in the first instance.  The board adopted a comprehensive five year HIV/AIDS strategy in May, 1993. Under the strategy the following developments have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two outreach workers have been appointed, one in collaboration with Gay Information Cork and one attached to Cork AIDS Alliance.  In addition, the staff at the board's sexually transmissible diseases clinic play a major role in sexual health education, both at the <Col N="145" /> clinic and at other venues in the Southern Health Board area.  Staff placements and participation in specialised courses are used as a means of gaining practical experience in the care of HIV/AIDS patients.  The board is also engaged in targeted programmes for second level schools and health professionals and informal outreach at third level and community group level is under way.</P>
    <P>Information and education are available to general practice trainees.  The development of programmes of education and training to assist individual general practice and primary health care teams in the context of HIV/AIDS is also being considered.</P>
    <P>Clinical investigation and management of persons with HIV/AIDS is the responsibility of the physician to whom patients present.  The majority of HIV/AIDS patients in the region requiring hospital treatment are referred to Cork University Hospital. Arrangements are made for access to specialised HIV/AIDS services in St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, when required.</P>
    <P>The STD clinic provides a specialised STD and HIV service with medical assessment, counselling and social support services.  The medical service is provided by doctors who are trained in public health.</P>
    <P>Domiciliary services are provided by area public health nurses and general practitioners.  A twenty-four hour home nursing service is available, where medically indicated.  Recently, a community liaison service was set up for the region. The provision of respite care and hospice care are under consideration.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the board's AIDS strategy was the appointment of a consultant in infectious diseases.  This appointment has been approved by my Department and Comhairle na nOspidéal and has been advertised recently.</P>

This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme.  The long-term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition, such as ME/CFS, can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long-term illness book and are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement of prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drug refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long-term medical condition these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: Myalgic encephalomyelitis &mdash; also known as chronic fatigue syndrome and in popular discourse as &ldquo;yuppie flu&rdquo;&mdash; is a chronic debilitating disease that is marked in the majority of cases by sudden onset of fatigue and flu like symptoms.  Symptoms subsequently relapse and remit and may persist for years.  Physical examination may reveal little by way of clinical symptoms except for minor and non-specific abnormalities in an apparently well patient.  The syndrome tends to affect previously fit adults between 20 and 40 years but no age is excluded.  The treatment for the <Col N="149" /> condition is non-specific and is aimed at alleviating symptoms and helping patients to adjust to the chronic nature of the illness.  People with ME/CFS can avail of services provided in the normal course of health service provision through the health boards.</P>
      <P>Last year officials of my Department met representatives of the Irish ME Trust regarding their concerns relating to increasing awareness of ME.  As agreed at that meeting my Department gave detailed information on ME provided by the ME Trust to the Irish College of General Practitioners for circulation to its members.  Greater awareness of the condition should lead to faster diagnosis and more effective treatment.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The dental health action plan provides for the extension of eligibility for dental services to children up to 16 years of age.  I am implementing the action plan on a phased basis and I have already extended eligibility for dental services to children after they leave national school up to their fourteenth birthday.  In addition, emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is currently available to children aged 14 years and over who are dependants of medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Routine dental treatment will be provided by health boards to children up to 14 years of age by extending the targeted approach which is currently used in the national schools.  Children who have left national school will be <Col N="156" /> recalled, as appropriate, screened and provided with appropriate preventive and primary care dental care treatment for any defects noted in the course of screening.  These children will be provided with emergency treatment to relieve pain on demand.  I have requested each health board to implement the extension as soon as possible having regard to the resources available to the boards.</P>
    <P>Under the dental health action plan an additional £3 million is now part of the health boards' annual allocation for the consolidation and extension of routine dental services to children.  This represents an extra 100 full-time dental staff.</P>

The current agreement, which came into effect from 1 August 1993, provided for a reduction of 3 per cent in the price of <Col N="158" /> such medicines with effect from that date and a subsequent price freeze.</P>
      <P>The company originally responsible for the supply of Triptafen and Fentazin products in this country transferred the responsibility for the supply of the products to another company which has informed the Department that it is no longer in a position to supply the Irish market with these products under the terms and conditions of the current pricing agreement.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: Medicinal products are provided free of charge to persons covered by medical cards under the general medical services scheme.  Products included in the scheme must conform to certain published criteria.  A key criterion is that the product must be the subject of a current product authorisation. The granting and continuation in force of such an authorisation indicates that the Irish Medicines Board has been satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product concerned.</P>
      <P>Optimax, which contains L-tryptophan has been on the Irish market since 1971 as an antidepressant.  However, in 1989, a serious life threatening condition &mdash; Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome &mdash; was reported in association with the use of oral L-tryptohan containing products.  Most of these reports came from the United States and Germany. Although there has been no reports of EMS in Ireland, the then National Drugs Advisory Board recommended that Optimax should remain available to those named patients already on the medication.  In July 1993, the manufacturer concerned failed to renew the product authorisation which would be essential if the product were to continue to be marketed in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Because of the unlicensed status of this drug, it is considered inappropriate to include Optimax for reimbursement under any of the community drug schemes.  I understand, however, that it remains available on a &ldquo;named patient&rdquo; basis to those for whom the product is deemed essential.</P>

These arrangements were put in place for the convenience of patients and to ensure a professional pharmacy input into patients' medicine therapy. The manner in which these schemes operate, including payment arrangements, are subject to negotiation and agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union which represents community pharmacists.  Arising from these negotiations, different payment arrangements apply in respect of the GMS <Col N="161" /> scheme and the various community drug schemes.  Payment in respect of the GMS scheme is based on reimbursement of the ingredient cost of the drug plus a dispensing fee.  Payment arrangements in respect of the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the long-term illness scheme are based on reimbursement of the ingredient cost of the drug, a pharmacy mark-up and dispensing fee.</P>
      <P>New arrangements have recently been agreed regarding the supply and dispensing of certain high tech-high cost medicinal products.  These products will be dispensed by community pharmacists under a different payment system involving a patient care fee to the pharmacist for professional services provided in dispensing these medicines.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the South-Eastern Health Board concerning this case and have been informed that the application was unsuccessful as the person's income was well above the standard income guidelines normally used to assist in determining eligibility. I have been assured that the health board has considered the application on the basis of hardship and has recently decided that the applicant would not be entitled to a medical card on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are of course entitled to out-patient services free of charge and all in-patient public hospital services are subject only to modest statutory charges.  They are also covered by a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.  Under the long-term illness scheme persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition.  Persons who do not qualify for the long-term illness scheme and who are certified as having a long-term medical condition <Col N="164" /> with a regular and ongoing requirement of prescribed drugs and medicines do not have to pay more than £32 in any month at the pharmacy counter under the drug cost subsidisation scheme. Under the drugs refund scheme persons are entitled to a refund of expenditure (including that of dependants) over £90 per calendar quarter on prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must, of course, receive one and I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>With regard to seasonal bed closures, the suspension from use of some hospital beds over the summer months has been characteristic of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country for many years. Such closures are usually planned to coincide with a period when staff are on annual leave and when the level of activity has traditionally declined.  In addition, this period is often used as an opportunity to refurbish wards or carry out minor capital works.  All emergency and urgent services, of course, continue to be provided during this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> Any decision on the level of bed closures during the summer months is a matter for the health boards and hospitals concerned in the first instance. However, as in other years officials of my Department have reviewed the summer bed closures and I can confirm that the average number of beds closed in the Dublin area from June to September 1996 was 141, which is the equivalent of 2.6 per cent of the total bed complement.</P>
    <P>A further review of the projected bed closures between now and the end of the year is being carried out by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: It is not the normal practice to give capital allocations to health boards or voluntary hospitals, other than in respect of urgent fire precaution and maintenance works.  The capital commitments arising each year generally arise from decisions on individual projects, many of which involve expenditure over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I am setting out in the following statement, for the Deputy's information, the capital funding for each hospital, which was made available by my Department to finance expenditure on the major developments and the principal minor capital requirements included in the health capital programme for the years 1993 to 1995.  The expenditure figures for 1996 will not be available until the end of the year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: Dermatology is primarily an outpatient service.  The service is currently provided for the Louth area on a four weekly basis both at Louth County Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda by a consultant-led outreach service from Beaumont Hospital.  This service provides treatment for approximately 600 patients each year.  In addition, in 1995 and 1996, my Department made waiting list initiative funds available to allow the purchase of additional outpatient dermatology sessions in the North-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the North-Eastern Health Board adopted a policy in 1995 for the development of a consultant-led dermatology service for the region.  This proposal is being considered in my Department in the context of available resources and the priorities of the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I presume the Deputy is referring to the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) <Col N="173" /> Regulations, 1996, which were recently introduced.</P>
      <P>The new regulations clarify the position with regard to the supply of medicinal products by registered nurses in the course of a service provided by a hospital providing community mental health services to patients.  The supply is restricted to a quantity sufficient for a period of treatment not exceeding three days in accordance with the written directions of a registered medical practitioner of that service.</P>
      <P>An Bord Altranais, the nursing regulatory body, issued its Guidance to Nurses and Midwives on the administration of Medical Preparations in 1995.  Concern had been expressed to me regarding the impact of the application of the guidance notes on the mental health services at local level. While the regulations seek to address these concerns, my Department is in on-going consultation with An Bord Altranais on the matter.</P>
      <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed by hospital pharmacists regarding the inclusion of this new provision in the regulations.  I believe this concern is unfounded having regard to the fact that the situation now provided for is more restrictive than that which existed under the former regulations.  In any event the controls now provided for in no way alter the role of the pharmacist in the overall control and supervision of medicines dispensed in hospitals.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 June 1996 is in the range of £202.88-£214.79 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services to group 1 non-officer grades.  The scale applies throughout the country and is increased <Col N="174" /> from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
      <P>With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  There is no formal limit to the number of hours allowed each week for home help.  It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE system.  Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help &mdash; or the spouse of a part-time home help &mdash; is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>In response to previous questions in this House I stated that my Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
      <P>A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officer group formed the basis for this examination.  Following on from these discussions, I have decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help service carried out by an independent body which will advise on measures to ensure the equity and high quality of the service in respect of both providers and recipients. I am pleased to say that my Department has invited tenders for this review.  It is expected that the review should be completed in three to four months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 228, 229 and 230 together. Agreement was reached earlier this year with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union which is the negotiating body for community pharmacists, on a package of measures for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Acts.  The main purpose of the agreement is to enhance the professional role of the community pharmacist and to improve the quality of services provided to the public.  The main features of this package are a new contract for the provision of all community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970 which is pro-active in promoting a quality driven and cost effective service for patients; the introduction of appropriate accountability arrangements in the operation of the community drugs schemes; a new more effective and safer arrangement for the dispensing of high-tech drugs through community pharmacies; a programme of continuing education to improve standards and an upgrading of information technology to improve efficiency in community pharmacies and communication between pharmacies, health boards and the GMS (Payments) Board <Col N="178" /> and a system of regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria which will facilitate better patient access to pharmacy services and improve standards by maintaining viability.</P>
      <P>As indicated earlier, the IPU, which is the recognised negotiating body on behalf of community pharmacists, has accepted this agreement.  The new contract, which forms part of the agreement, is currently in the process of being signed by contract holders.  The Department is not aware of any difficulty in relation to the acceptance of the new contract by individual contract holders. Accordingly, the question of the viability of the new contract or the operation of two systems of pharmacy reimbursement is not expected to become an issue.</P>
      <P>An integral feature of the overall package agreed with the IPU was the introduction of new Regulations under section 59 (4) of the Health Act, 1970 regulating the issue of new contracts for the provision of pharmacy services under the Act.  The reasons for this are primarily twofold, namely (i) to maintain the viability of existing pharmacies in order to enable them to meet the increased requirements of the new contract in regard to the provision of a professional, quality-driven and accountable community pharmacy service and (ii) to bring the regulation of community pharmacy contracts in Ireland into line with other EU/EEA member states where such controls exist in one form or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pharmacists will be able to apply for a new contract in accordance with the regulations.  In this regard it should be noted that the regulations contain a &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; clause which provides that a contract will be granted where an application is made before 1 January 1997 and the applicant can show that he/she had, in the twelve months prior to the making of the regulations, entered into a financial commitment for the procurement of a premises for the <Col N="179" /> specific purpose of opening a community pharmacy.  In addition the regulations do not preclude employee pharmacists from taking over existing contracts, from the management of existing pharmacies or from applying for a new contract.  Furthermore, the increased requirements of the new contract in regard to the provision of an improved community pharmacy service will require a greater professional input by pharmacists thereby increasing the job opportunities for community pharmacists.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the ownership of pharmacies, as provided for in the Pharmacy Acts, is that pharmacies can be owned only by a pharmacist or a company.  However, all pharmacies, whether owned by a company or a pharmacist must be managed by a registered pharmaceutical chemist and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions must be carried out by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the requisite level of professional control and supervision is available in all pharmacies.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The provision of treatment and rehabilitation services for drug misusers is a matter for health boards in the first instance.  Drug misuse <Col N="180" /> in this country takes two forms, the misuse of so-called &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy, which is prevalent throughout the country, and the misuse of heroin, which is confined mainly to certain parts of Dublin.  In the case of cannabis and ecstasy what is needed is education and prevention campaigns to discourage young people from becoming involved with such drugs and in addition, harm reduction messages for those who are already using these drugs.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in February of this year to implement a range of measures aimed at reducing the demand for drugs.  These included provision for a media campaign aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of drugs. This campaign was run initially on radio and television during July and a further burst is being run currently.  A drug information line was set up in association with the campaign in July.  In addition, each health board has been instructed to put in place structures which will enable it to respond to drug misuse problems which may arise.</P>
      <P>Included in these are the establishment of regional co-ordinating committees to monitor the extent of the problem and to advise on the development of education and prevention measures.</P>
      <P>The problem of heroin misuse in certain parts of Dublin requires a different response.  There are no hard data available on the numbers involved, but the Health Research Board has provided information on persons treated for drug misuse in the Dublin area as follows:</P>

    <P>The Government decision in February 1996, referred to above, made provision for the implementation by the Eastern Health Board of a range of measures in response to the growing threat posed by heroin misuse.  These <Col N="181" /> are as follows: locally based drug treatment facilities in Dublin will be extended, in consultation with local communities; general practitioners will play a wider role in the ongoing maintenance on methadone of persons who have been stabilised in the treatment centres; rehabilitation and support services will be further developed; special attention will be given to the problems of persons who smoke heroin; a contact service, which will provide information, advice and assistance on drugs to the public, will be established by each health board; there will be external evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of services in the Eastern Health Board area; the nuisance which drug misusers can cause in the vicinity of treatment centres and other locations will be alleviated by arrangements to be agreed between the Eastern Health Board and the Garda and the co-ordination of detoxification facilities will be improved.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 500 persons awaiting treatment for drug misuse in the Dublin area.  The Eastern Health Board is confident that the implementation of the measures outlined above should result in the waiting list being cleared.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the expansion of services which is under way in health boards, and particularly in the Eastern Health Board, together with the Department of Justice measures announced by my colleague the Minister for Justice, will make a significant contribution to addressing the drugs problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 to 244, inclusive, 246 and 278 to 282, inclusive, together</P>
      <P>The clinical waste disposal system which is currently being operated by the waste management contractor to the Southern Health Board is being used at various locations outside Ireland, including sites in Scotland, England and the United States.  This contractor was employed following public tendering procedures, and the contract was awarded in May 1996.  The contractor uses somewhat different technology from that previously used.  There were teething problems with the commissioning of the new equipment and as a result there was a backlog of waste requiring treatment.  This backlog has now been substantially cleared.  I understand that the technology has been subjected to rigorous approval procedures.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board and the Eastern Health Board are employing contractors who use a shredding and decontamination method of treatment of clinical waste.  The other health boards are using contractors who export the waste for treatment in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The detailed information sought in relation to permits, quantities of waste being stored by health boards, contingency plans, etc., is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The tendering process for the transportation, treatment and disposal of clinical waste involves a joint approach to the market with the Northern Ireland Department of Health.  It is based on the assumption of centralised treatment in order to maximise quality and minimise cost.  A short list of tenderers is at present being prepared.  A total of 41 requests for tender application forms were received; 23 completed forms were returned and the number selected to tender will be between five and eight, as stated in the advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Tenders are due in by mid-November and it is expected that a contractor will be selected by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> I raised the matter of the continued export to the United Kingdom, on a temporary basis, of healthcare risk waste arising in Ireland, with the Secretary of State for Health in the United Kingdom, when I met with him last June in the context of the EU Presidency.  I understand my colleague the Minister for the Environment, in reply to a similar question today, will also be adverting to representations made by his Department to the United Kingdom Department of the Environment in the matter.</P>
    <P>The estimates of quantities of waste which were included in the waste disposal tender documents are based on waste disposal records and on surveys carried out in a number of hospitals.  My Department has not received an audit for quantities of medical waste from the Eastern Health Board, and the quantities specified in the tender documents are considered a reasonable basis on which to plan.</P>
    <P>The arrangements currently in place for the disposal of clinical waste are not ideal in all cases, and I am satisfied that the new arrangements due to come into force in 1997 will represent a big improvement.</P>

The Deputy will wish to know that my Department has now conveyed formal approval to a capital grant towards the replacement of this priority equipment, subject to compliance with standard Department procedures for purchasing equipment.  In the interim, arrangements are being made to treat Bantry patients at Cork University Hospital.</P>

    <P>Funding under this scheme is distributed by boards subject to the following conditions: grants may be allocated to community based projects under the headings: mental handicap services, physical disability services, psychiatric services, child care services, women's refuges, personal social services &mdash; including information and counselling services; at least 80 per cent of the block grant should be allocated to local voluntary groups; grants from the block allocation should not be used in substitution for section 65 grants and particular care should be taken to ensure that grants are made available only to viable schemes which will be completed within a reasonable period and, in determining priority of schemes, an assessment should be made of any ongoing revenue implications. Priority should be given to once-off projects which would have no ongoing revenue implications for health boards.</P>

        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 261, 262 and 263 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the existence of the condition referred to as the &ldquo;late effects of polio&rdquo; LEP or post-polio syndrome which has been reported among people who suffered in the past from acute poliomyelitis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People suffering from post-polio syndrome have reported a range of physical problems such as respiratory or speech difficulties, unusual fatigue and pain in muscles and joints.  The management of these symptoms is possible through health services available for people with disabilities such as orthotic services, physiotherapy, occupational therapy <Col N="197" /> and speech and language therapy services, as well as home based services such as home help and aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>LEP sufferers are entitled to apply for assistance under a wide range of schemes which are available to all people with disabilities.  In addition, patients with post-polio syndrome can be assessed and their condition monitored by a neuromuscular neurologist with experience in LEP at the neuromuscular clinic in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Post-Polio Support Group was in contact with both myself and the Minister of State concerning the establishment of a trust fund for sufferers of post-polio syndrome.  I wrote to the Post-Polio Support Group last May giving details of the wide range of schemes available to its members.  In the circumstances special arrangements are not necessary to secure proper care.</P>
    <P>Currently available statistics on the number of admissions of post-polio sufferers to hospital are gathered by the hospital in-patient inquiry &mdash; HIPE &mdash; data.  This indicated that there were 26 &mdash; 14 male and 12 female &mdash; people with post-polio syndrome admitted as inpatients to acute hospitals in 1995.</P>
    <P>As entitlement to assistance under medical schemes operated by health boards is not confined to any specific illness or disability, information is not available on the numbers of post-polio sufferers availing of such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I propose taking Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.</P>
      <P>As applications for funding for medical research are not normally received in my Department, information is not collected and readily available to allow a comprehensive answer to be provided to the Deputy in the manner in which the question was set.  However, based on the information available, the position is as follows.</P>
      <P>The Health Research Board is the main mechanism through which State funding is channelled to medical and related research.  The board is funded by an annual grant from the Health Vote though it also receives some funding from other sources &mdash; mainly bequests or interest from bequests which have been invested.  The Health Research Board was established on 1 January 1987 following the amalgamation of the Medical Research Council and the Medico-Social Research Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's primary function is to promote, assist, commission or conduct <Col N="203" /> medical, health and health services research and such epidemiological research as may appropriately be carried out at national level.  In addition the board assists and supports other health agencies in promoting or conducting epidemiological research and liaises and co-operates with other research bodies in Ireland or elsewhere in promoting, commissioning or conducting relevant research.  The board is also the co-ordinating body in Ireland for the EU's main initiative in the health research area, the BIOMED-2 Programme.  This is part of the EU's Fourth Framework Programme for research and technology. There are no national allocations under this programme and initial applications are currently being processed.</P>
    <P>The annual grant to the Health Research Board in 1996 is £2.79 million. In addition there is a specific allocation to the board of £100,000 to conduct research into the area of hepatitis C. The board considers all applications for funding and allocates funding to projects on a competitive basis subject to the board's peer review process whereby experts in the field assess the merits of each individual project.</P>
    <P>The principal funding mechanisms utilised by the board relate to (i) research units, (ii) research project grants.  As regards research units, a two stage application procedure is utilised &mdash; outline proposals are first invited and those short-listed are invited to make full proposals.  The most recent competition for research units resulted as follows:</P>

    </table>
    <P>The average funding for a unit grant is £75,000 per annum for a maximum period of five years.  Processing of research unit applications takes on average six months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> As regards research project grants, in 1996, 161 applications were received of which five were deemed ineligible.  The remaining 156 were assessed by the board's research committees and 60 new projects were recommended for funding with the total cost for the first year being £592,035.  The average funding per project is £10,000 and the overall success rate is better than 1 in 3.</P>
    <P>In the current year, the closing date for receipt of research project grant applications was 1 March 1996 and funding decisions were taken at the board's meeting of 15 May 1996.  It should also be noted that decisions on the funding of hepatitis C projects will be taken in October 1996.</P>
    <P>While the main publicly funded health research effort is channelled through the HRB, my Department also funds a number of other research initiatives as follows.  Since 1990 the Department of Health has paid the Health Research Board to carry out the National Psychiatric In-Patient Reporting System (NIPRS) on its behalf.  The cost of this system to the Department was £7,289 in 1995 and 1996 costs are expected to be in the region of £82,000; the Economic and Social Research Institute assumed responsibility for the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) scheme in 1990. The cost of this scheme to the Department in 1995 was £312,602 and the estimated cost in 1996 is expected to be £300,000; though not specifically identified as such, the allocation for teaching hospitals includes an element of research funding.  This encompasses the routine science and technology activities of radiologists, pathologists, biochemists, physicists, computer and related paramedical (e.g. laboratory) staff; my Department's health promotion unit has a budget for 1996 in excess of £2.8 million. In addition, the HPU funds a Chair of Health Promotion at University College, Galway at an annual cost of £50,000.  Though not specifically designated as medical research, the HPU's activities represent a considerable element of research and consultancy in <Col N="205" /> the health field; the National Cancer Registry Board was established in 1991. The functions of the board are to identify, collect, classify, record, store and analyse information relating to the incidence and prevalence of cancer and related tumours in Ireland; to collect, classify, record and store information in relation to each newly diagnosed individual cancer patient and in relation to each tumour which occurs; to promote and facilitate the use of data thus collected in approved research projects and in the planning and management of services and to publish an annual report based on the activities of the Registry. The NCRB is funded by the Exchequer and in 1996 the annual grant to the board was £490,000; and a number of other research projects are funded from time to time from my Department's consultancy subhead.  Currently a pregnancy research project is being conducted by the Department of Social Studies at Trinity College, Dublin.  In 1995 a sum of £50,000 was allocated to this proposed to fund an autism study from this subhead to be conducted by the Irish Society for Autism at an estimated cost of £20,000.</P>
    <P>The Health Research Board will continue to be the main mechanism through which publicly funded health research is conducted in Ireland.  The work of the National Cancer Registry Board is also an area of high priority and upon taking office I set as a priority within my Department the development of services to combat cancer.  My Department is fully aware of the importance of medical research in the area of public health.  Our goal will be to develop a public health research strategy which will both respect the need for high quality research and fit public health policy objectives.  These objectives were outlined in the Department of Health's four year action plan <i>Shaping a Healthier Future &mdash; A Strategy for Effective Healthcare in the 1990's</i> and were given further shape in my Department's document <i>A Health Promotion Strategy.</i> The <Col N="206" /> significant features of the strategy are to encourage people to take responsibility for their own health and to provide the environmental support necessary to achieve this; and to provide a high quality health service underpinned by the three principles of equity, quality and accountability.</P>

This year, the hospital submitted a list of priority posts which included a consultant radiologist for its CT scanning service.  This post has now been approved by my Department and it is the responsibility of the hospital to make an application for the above post to Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body charged with responsibility for the regulation of consultant appointments. In the interim, I understand that the hospital has been actively pursuing the recruitment of a temporary consultant radiologist in order to provide this service.</P>

      <P>My Department is actively involved in promoting leisure activities, including fishing along the canals.  In August, local anglers requested my Department to provide fish swims from Newcomen Bridge to Russell Street Bridge, as they planned to hold a fishing competition on 17 August.</P>
      <P>My Department is pleased to facilitate events such as this, which were also recommended by the Royal Canal Corridor Study.  Accordingly, arrangements were made for sections of the reed fringe along the canal bank to be cut back to provide fishermen with the opportunity to attract fish close to the canal bank.  Indeed, it is planned to have further discussions with local angling interests with a view to fostering and promoting fishing in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the year, a contract was placed for the maintenance of the banks along the Royal Canal in the Dublin area.  This involves grass cutting, litter collection, and rubbish removal.  This is an on-going programme and one which <Col N="218" /> is designed to ensure that the canal banks are cleaned on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, a weed cutting machine was brought into the area in July to assist in the removal of weeds which grow at a prolific rate in the summer months.  At present it is not proposed to carry out any further cleaning works in this area using the weed cutting machine.  However, maintainance of the canal banks will continue as usual under the existing maintenance contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that, notwithstanding the fact that section 35 was due to expire this year, the revised section 35 package which was provided for under the Finance Act.  1996, ensures that a system of tax incentives for film-making in Ireland is now assured up to 1999.  The Deputy will appreciate that this positive outcome of the review of section 35 will facilitate producers to exploit the incentives over the next three years with the security of knowing that they will remain in place over that period.</P>
      <P>Films locate in different countries for a wide variety of reasons, both objective and subjective.  Accordingly, it is inevitable that some projects for which Ireland may have been shortlisted, will not end up being made here.  Factors such as location, personal preference of the director, local and national incentives being offered in the contending countries, and the availability of key creative personnel, all contribute to the outcome.  For this reason it is not possible to assign a single cause for decisions as to whether or not to locate a film in Ireland, nor can I comment as to whether film personnel have been lost to Ireland as a result of the revised package.</P>
      <P>I believe that the revision of the section 35 scheme has had a number of effects.  In line with the December 1995, analysis of the economic consultants INDECON, the new scheme involves less costs to the Exchequer; it places a particular and welcome emphasis on indigenous production; it has increased the potential investor pool in the State; it still provides a substantial incentive for bigger budget films; and it includes an incentive for production in off-peak periods during the months of October to February inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a shift towards indigenous production will result in reductions in gross budgets, the ratio of Irish spend &mdash; including, critically, Irish labour content <Col N="221" />&mdash; to total spend can be expected to improve, as will the economic benefits relative to the Exchequer costs of section 35.  We are now moving to a situation where expressly Irish stories involving Irish creative input are attracting substantial international investment covering the non-section 35 elements of film budgets.  It is films such as these that will play the greatest promotional role for Ireland because they are not merely using Ireland for tax reasons or because of Ireland's film-friendly approach but, rather, they are telling Irish stories to national and international audiences in an increasingly skilful and attractive way.</P>
    <P>I am happy to assure the Deputy that Irish indigenous film production is in a very healthy condition, with many promising projects at various stages of development and production.  This fact is perhaps illustrated most forcefully by the fact that, for the first time ever, Irish films are being selected for exhibition and competition at prestigious film festivals, including Cannes, Berlin, Venice, Edinburgh and Toronto.  In many cases. Irish films have secured major awards at such festivals.  This is the best testimony of the success of the Government's strategy to develop a soundly based indigenous industry and I am happy to assure the Deputy that I am confident that the revised section 35 package will continue to facilitate this process.</P>

      <P>The inventory of the post-1700 AD architectural heritage is being undertaken by the National Monuments and Historic Properties Service of my Department. Work on this inventory is on-going and its results will be assimilated into the proposed national inventory of architecture as recommended in the recently published report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on the Protection of the Architectural Heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> Since the inception of the inventory of the post-1700 AD architectural heritage, there has been an average of one full-time member of staff at architect level and three part-time members at senior architect, higher executive officer and clerical officer levels, assigned to the project.  The total expenditure on the project for the years 1991-95 amounted to £608,000 made up as follows: 1991, £30,000; 1992, £102,000; 1993, £130,000; 1994, £121,000; 1995, £225,000.</P>
    <P>Most of the expenditure is attributable to the cost of employing consultants to carry out the necessary field survey work and related research but some costs also arise from associated mapping and computerisation.</P>
    <P>The budget for 1996 is £200,000. Further progress will of course, be dependent on the level of funding made available but this will be reviewed in the context of Government consideration of the working group's report and recommendations.</P>

      <P>The National Inventory of the post-1700 AD Architectural Heritage which was piloted in 1991 with a survey of Carlow town, has continued to concentrate on surveys of the historic centres of the country's main towns.  The following 24 cities-towns have since been surveyed and are at present the subject of on-going field survey work: Athlone, Athy, Ballina, Carrick-on-Shannon, Castlebar, Cavan, Cork, Clonmel, Dundalk, Ennis, <Col N="224" /> Galway, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Longford, Monaghan, Portlaoise, Roscommon, Roscrea, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.</P>

Progress on the inventory will depend on the level of funding made available but the Interdepartmental Working Group on Strengthening of the Architectural Heritage has suggested 25 years as a reasonable completion date for recording the inventory's estimated complements of one million buildings.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310, 364 and 365 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the stated policy of <Col N="228" /> Government that the Environmental Protection Agency's integrated pollution control licensing function should operate on a self-financing basis.  The fees provided for under the Environmental Protection Agency (Licensing Fees) (Amendment) Regulations, 1996, are designed to recover the costs to the agency of processing applications for licences, reviews of licences or revised licences; they also reflect the need to maintain equity between different classes of licensable activity and to avoid placing an undue burden on small scale enterprises.  I am satisfied that these objectives are currently being met. The regulations also enable the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce, refund or waive fees in individual cases.</P>
    <P>In the case of the pig and poultry sectors, many smaller units will be exempt from Environmental Protection Agency licensing.  For those which are licensable and defined as small activities for the purposes of the fees regulations, a fee substantially lower than those applying in respect of small activities in all other sectors has been set.</P>
    <P>The integrated pollution control licensing system has been in operation since May 1994.  In the light of the progressive expansion of the licensing system and the experience gained by the Environmental Protection Agency, I am keeping the level of application fees under review in terms of both the self-financing and equity objectives.</P>
    <P>Annual compliance monitoring fees for activities licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency are a matter for the agency to determine on the basis of its costs, and to recover directly from the licensed activities.  All licensing fees payable to the Environmental Protection Agency are subject to independent audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General so as to ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> that the self-financing objective is fully and fairly achieved.</P>

      <P>Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 (as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987) empowers prescribed local authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption.  Such directions may specify matters such as the times at which road works are to be carried out, the period within which road works must be completed, the manner in which works are to be carried out, and requirements in relation to the control of traffic in the vicinity of road works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1992, following consultation with local authorities, regulations <Col N="230" /> were made prescribing the main urban authorities &mdash; Dublin Corporation, the then Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation, Cork Corporation, Limerick Corporation, Waterford Corporation and Galway Corporation &mdash; as authorities which may exercise these powers.  The majority of road openings by statutory undertakers occur in the areas of these authorities but the question of prescribing additional local authorities will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for water quality in Lough Derg and implementation of appropriate measures to deal with pollution is a matter primarily for the local authorities concerned and the Environmental Protection Agency in so far as activities licensable by the agency may be involved.  Extensive statutory powers are available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990, and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to support these bodies in their roles.  These have been complemented by the recent enactment of the Waste Management Act, 1996, and by a new provision allowing local authorities to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans, where warranted, in the interests of restoring or protecting water quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July, I jointly launched with the <Col N="233" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry a code of good agricultural practice aimed at protecting water from pollution. I have asked local authorities to actively promote the code and to distribute it widely among farmers so as to increase environmental awareness and encourage the adoption of sustainable farming practices with benefits for Lough Derg and waters generally.</P>
    <P>My Department, with EU assistance, is providing funding to Clare, Galway and Tipperary NR County Councils for a phased investment programme with a total estimated cost of £50 million to upgrade sewerage treatment arrangements within the lake catchment, including provision for nutrient reduction facilities, where required.</P>
    <P>EU approvals for the catchment also provide for the funding of a water quality management system.  This will assess existing water quality, determine sources of pollution and impacts, and provide a management tool for local authorities in devising and implementing strategies to protect Lough Derg.  My Department is working closely with the local authorities concerned to advance the development of this system and I anticipate that the project will be activated later this year.</P>

      <P>Monitoring of groundwaters by local authorities has been generally in the context of the implementation of Council Directives 80/778/EEC and 91/676/EEC dealing respectively with the quality of drinking water and the pollution of waters by nitrates from agriculture.  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has recently commenced a programme of monitoring to obtain representative data on a national basis which will be used to <Col N="234" /> define the state of groundwater, to detect trends in groundwater quality and to assess the causes of any changes observed.  The Environmental Protection Agency has selected a network of almost 300 groundwater abstraction points, taking account of hydrogeological and other relevant conditions, for this purpose.  The agency, acting in collaboration with local authorities, will sample twice yearly for a range of water quality parameters.</P>
      <P>Relevant results from these monitoring efforts are incorporated in the agency's annual reports on the quality of drinking water in Ireland and are reflected in the State of the Environment in Ireland.  The results of the agency's recently commenced representative monitoring programme for groundwater will be presented separately when sufficient data become available.</P>
      <P>Data on groundwater resources, including the mapping and characterisation of aquifers and quality aspects, is also maintained by the Geological Survey of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The available information indicates that groundwaters in Ireland are generally of a high quality, although localised contamination has occurred in some areas due mainly to pollution from farmyards and septic tank systems. There is also evidence of increased nitrate concentrations above background levels in intensively farmed areas due to the application of fertilisers. However, these levels do not at present pose a serious threat to the quality of drinking water abstracted from groundwater.  Farmers can help reduce nitrate levels by observing the code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates which I launched, jointly with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, last July.</P>

      <P>Local authorities continue to have responsibility for the monitoring of all building works, including extensions, in relation to compliance with planning <Col N="238" /> law and with building regulations. Under the building regulations, a local authority must be informed by way of a commencement notice prior to the carrying out of works which are not classified as exempted development under the planning system and local authorities may carry out inspections to check compliance in such cases.</P>
      <P>Where a development that is not exempted has been carried out without planning permission, or where development does not comply with the conditions of a planning permission, planning authorities have a range of enforcement actions available to them. In addition, it is open to any individual or group to take action in the courts in such circumstances under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.</P>

      <P>My Department earlier this year published the findings of a national litter survey conducted to establish a detailed breakdown of the composition of litter and to identify and classify typical types of littered locations.  Litter associated with the operation of fast-food outlets was most commonly found to be the main source of litter on streets.  This finding accords with local authority observations reported generally in recent years to my Department.  Other types of littered locations were also identified in the survey.  As previously indicated, I intend shortly to introduce a new Litter Pollution Bill which will replace the Litter Act, 1982.  The Bill will include provisions to allow local authorities to take more effective enforcement action against occupiers of particular classes of premises whose activities have a particular propensity to create, or lead to the creation of, litter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 372 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to my replies to Questions Nos. 2 and 40 of 13 June 1996 and 388 of 25 July 1996, and the reply of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to Questions Nos. 30, 402 and 403 of 2 July 1996.  These set out the position on the matters being pursued by Departments concerned within the remit of the ministerial committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea.  The committee met on 26 April 31 May and 13 September 1995 and established the parameters for the on-going work of Ministers and their <Col N="242" /> Departments on commitments in the programme A Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>Areas in which there have been development since the replies previously mentioned include a Department of Transport.  Energy and Communications request that the EU Commission carry out inspections and verification of the radioactive monitoring facilities of Magnox reactors in the UK under Article 35 of the EURATOM Treaty to ensure that they are in compliance with EU standards; the submission by the Irish delegation at the current Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) of a discussion document on the possibility of strengthening nuclear safety provisions of the EURATOM Treaty in the context of the further enlargement of the Union: raising Ireland's concerns in relation to nuclear power and, in particular, the safety of the British nuclear industry and the reprocessing of, and transport and storage of nuclear materials, at the IAEA Annual General Conference, held in Vienna from 16-20 September 1996. Ireland has urged that the entire question of reprocessing and management of surplus plutonium stocks should be examined urgently; requests to the Oslo/Paris Commissions and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD for a thorough technical review and assessment of both the reprocessing and non-reprocessing options for spent nuclear fuel management, as well as their impact on radioactive discharges into the marine environment; work is under way on these matters; Ireland's ratification of the Nuclear Safety Convention in July 1996 and our efforts to have all member states of the EU and the International Atomic Energy Agency do so as soon as possible and the active promotion by Ireland of a new global convention on radioactive waste management on which negotiations are proceeding in Vienna.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given to the possibilities for legal action against the Sellafield/Thorp facilities and the position remains under review. At present, a judgement which may be <Col N="243" /> significant in this regard is awaited from the Supreme Court in the case brought by four Dundalk residents in their action against BNFL.  Consideration is being given to the scope for action under the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources and the more recent Ospar Convention which Ireland intends to ratify later this year.</P>

The existence of this procedure does not, however, entitle a person to proceed with development without the necessary permission, and an application for retention of an unauthorised development does not, in law, prevent a planning authority from taking enforcement action.

      <P>Section 45 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that roads in builtup areas, other than motorways, are subject to a speed limit of 30 mph. However, local authorities have power to apply a higher speed limit to particular roads where they deem it appropriate. My approval is not required for decisions of this kind.</P>
      <P>Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act. 1994, provides that road authorities may, in the interests of the safety and convenience of road users, provide such traffic calming measures as they consider desirable for public roads in their charge.  Guidance notes on the implementation of these provisions were issued by my Department to road authorities in 1994; they outline measures for urban, residential and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In addition to the requirement that a driver must obey a speed limit, there is a general obligation on all drivers not to drive at a speed exceeding that which will enable them to halt their vehicles within the distance they can see to be clear.  Drivers are constantly reminded of the need to avoid excessive speed through the promotional campaigns of the National Safety Council.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of the law as it applies to speed is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  To assist in this respect, and to provide for a more immediate deterrent, I intend to make regulations next month introducing an &ldquo;on-the-spot&rdquo; fine for speeding offences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 and 374 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> The Government announced on 9 July last that legislation to address the problem of anti-social behaviour in local authority housing areas would be presented to the Dáil as soon as possible. It is intended that the term &ldquo;anti-social behaviour&rdquo; will be carefully defined for this purpose so as to focus especially on drug pushing and related activity.</P>
    <P>The Bill is aimed primarily at providing necessary legislative support to strengthen the capacity of housing authorities to deal with anti-social behaviour as one element in the management of their housing estates.  However, it is envisaged that the Bill will also provide discretion, in certain circumstances, for health boards to refuse or withdraw assistance under the SWA scheme towards rent or mortgage costs of private housing.</P>
    <P>The Bill is being drafted as a matter of urgency.  In addition to the normal process of consultation with the Attorney General's Office and with other Departments concerned, consultations have taken place with relevant local authorities, including members of Dublin Corporation, and with representatives of Threshold.  A meeting has been arranged with representatives of the County and City Managers' Association and written submissions have been received from the Irish Council for Social Housing and a number of public representatives.</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated (in reply to Questions Nos. 8, 18, 25, 36, 40, 54 and 146 of 7 November 1995), waste incineration is used extensively within the OECD countries and is regulated by a number of EU Directives.  Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act. 1992, provides for the licensing of waste incineration activities on the basis of best practicable standards, including relevant EU requirements.  Licences for both industrial and hospital waste incineration have been granted by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

The unit is staffed by an assistant principal officer, a staff officer and a clerical assistant/typist.  In addition, assistance is provided by the Department's Environment inspectorate and by other staff of the Department on an ongoing basis as required.

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, which is operated through the vocational education committees, was established in 1989 to cater for long-term unemployed people.  It was on this basis that EU structural fund support was obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> The scheme was broadened in 1993 to include (i) lone parents, (ii) disabled people in receipt of invalidity and disability pensions who are considered by the vocational education committees to be financially disadvantaged, (iii) spouses of eligible disabled people in respect of whom adult dependant allowances are paid, and (iv) spouses of eligible unemployed people for whom dependant means-tested allowances are paid.  People in these categories may not fill more than 10 per cent of the number of VTOS places allocated to any vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>A vocational education committee is allowed to adopt a flexible approach to the filling of places in individual schools in its area provided that not more than 10 per cent of its overall allocation of places are filled by the additional categories.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the VTOS is to provide a second-chance education opportunity for long-term unemployed persons who have demonstrated through the signing-on process that they are unemployed and seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Because of the focus of VTOS on employment, my Department is not in a position to abolish or raise the 10 per cent quota in order to accommodate more lone parents or disabled people even where schools fail to fill the number of VTOS places allocated to them.</P>
    <P>The position regarding eligibility for the scheme is kept under continual review.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the effort and commitment which parents and other interested parties put into the organisation and management of gaelscoileanna and I would be anxious to ensure that applications received in my Department for the recognition of such schools are considered as objectively as possible, subject to certain conditions being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> The position with regard to Gaelscoil Eois is that the school's application for recognition in 1996 was refused as the promoters were unable to satisfy one of the main conditions as set down by my Department, that is that there should be an enrolment of at least 20 first-time school-goers who had not attended national school previously.</P>
    <P>The successful development of a new school depends on a minimum level of parental demand, hence there is a requirement that such a school would have at least twenty new junior infants before recognition is granted.  This is considered to be a basic requirement to ensure longer-term viability.</P>
    <P>I would be happy to consider an application for recognition of Gaelscoil Eois for the 1997-98 school year, early in 1997.</P>

      <P>The school bus service in question has not been removed but has been changed.</P>
      <P>A school transport contractor in the Louisburgh area has resigned and has not been replaced due to a reduction in numbers requiring transport from the area west of Louisburgh.  Instead the remaining four school buses for this area have been reorganised resulting in a larger capacity vehicle being allocated to one of the routes, with a resultant change in its operating times.</P>
      <P>The pupils in question are picked-up at 7.55 a.m. and set-down at 16.50 p.m. Because the bus contractor involved lives in the locality the pupils are picked up over a mile nearer to their homes, but at an earlier time.  The set down time is also later than in previous years.</P>
      <P>When establishing school transport services, routes are planned in such a way as to ensure as far as possible that travelling and waiting times do not exceed three hours for post-primary pupils.  The pupils in question are considered to have a reasonable and adequate level of service in the context of the general operation of the school transport scheme.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, schools have been selected for support in the disadvantaged areas scheme by reference to a range of socio-economic criteria which were agreed some years ago between my Department, school management authorities and the INTO. Based on these criteria, 16 of the primary schools in the area referred to by the Deputy are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In addition, 14 of these schools have the services of a home-school-community liaison co-ordinator and two of the schools have early start classes.  Also, 15 of the schools have the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Arising from studies carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>All of the schools which fell within the scope of the new initiative were invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion in the scheme. Schools have been selected for support under &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative by reference to new selection criteria, developed by the Education Research Centre, and based on the data submitted by the schools.</P>

    <P>I recently announced the names of the 25 schools which have been selected for inclusion in the urban phase of the initiative.

      <P>The free fees initiative and the third level student support schemes facilitate students with limited means who wish to progress to third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised, however, that ensuring greater access to third level by students from disadvanaged backgrounds is not solely a matter of costs at third level.  Fuller participation in third level depends on ensuring retention of students in full-time education up to the age of 18.  To achieve this I have taken a range of initiatives.  These include targeting of resources at first and second level in disadvantaged areas; the provision of educational support services for first and second level students including psychological and guidance <Col N="283" /> services, career guidance and remedial teachers; the continuing development of the home-school links programme; a major re-structuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt them to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle and the introduction of alternative pathways for students to progress to post-second-level education and training.</P>
    <P>I have also supported the development of links between disadvantaged schools and third level institutions. These links are in line with the commitment in the White Paper which indicates that, &ldquo;Each third level institution will be encouraged to develop links with designated second level schools, building on existing good practice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Proposals specifically relating to disadvantaged students have been received from the university sector by the Higher Education Authority and discussions are taking place with a view to initiating a number of projects in the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance levels in line with inflation.  However, in 1996 I increased the maintenance grant by 5 per cent which is over twice the rate of inflation.</P>

      <P>I have made significant improvements in these grants since the commencement of my term in office.  The standard capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from £33 in the 1992-93 school year to £45 in the 1995-96 school year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be <Col N="292" /> aware that, arising from studies carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>This &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative seeks to discriminate positively in favour of schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concerntrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative, a new targeted programme of supports is being made available to selected schools in large urban areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In addition, 25 clusters of small schools and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage are being selected to receive a targeted programme of supports.  Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers, including the school mentioned by the Deputy, were invited by the Education Research Centre to apply for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The relative need of all applicants has been assessed by the Education Research Centre on the basis of data submitted by schools under objective criteria which were devised by the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the names of the 25 schools selected for inclusion in the urban phase of the scheme.  I also announced the names of a further eight associated schools which serve the same general populations and have been included to ensure consistency and continuity of support for the families in question.</P>
      <P>The process of selecting schools for inclusion in the rural phase of the scheme is now nearing completion.  I expect to be in a position to announce the names of these schools shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 428 and 442 together.</P>
      <P>Schools are targeted for special supports under the disadvantaged areas schemes on the basis of their having high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their soci-economic background.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, primary schools have been selected for support by reference to a range of socio-economic criteria which were agreed some years ago between my Department, school managerial authorities and the INTO.  The criteria in question took into account such factors as the incidence of unemployment, medical card holding and local authority housing occupancy, among the parents of children attending the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools securing disadvantaged status are allocated a special supplementary capitation allowance.  The staffing allocation made to each school is set at a level which enables the school authorities to ensure that no class will have more than 29 pupils.  Prior to 1994, the <Col N="300" /> schools in question also received a concessionary teaching post.</P>
    <P>For the current school year, the schools in the scheme will receive a supplementary capitation payment amounting to £30 per pupil.</P>
    <P>In addition, each school is entitled to the following supports: refund of television licence fee, 95 per cent building grant, grants to provide aid for school books for needy pupils, specifically to aid in the establishment of loan-rental schemes and grants to assist certain schools experiencing current financial difficulties.  In addition, schools with an enrolment of 200 or more may also receive a grant of £15 per pupil in respect of clerical-caretaking services, subject to a maximum of 500 pupils.</P>
    <P>A total of 309 primary schools involving 81,000 pupils are currently covered by the disadvantaged areas scheme, 179 of these schools also benefit from inclusion in the home school community liaison scheme.</P>
    <P>Arising from studies carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Under this initiative, a new targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in large urban areas of particular disadvantage and also a further eight associated schools which serve the same general populations and which have been included in this initiative to ensure consistency and continuity of support for the families in question.  In addition to continuing to receive the supports referred to above, these schools are being allocated additional teaching staff to significantly reduce pupil numbers in junior classes.  A curriculum co-ordinator has been appointed to oversee the programme in the selected urban schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> Also as part of the initiative, 25 clusters of small schools and particularly those in rural areas which have high levels of disadvantage are being selected to receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers were eligible to apply for inclusion in this element of the initiative.  A co-ordinator will be appointed to serve each cluster in this initiative.  I expect to be in a position to announce shortly the names of the schools selected.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second level sector, criteria similar to those at primary level were used to select the schools for support.  These criteria were agreed between my Department, the managerial authorities and the teacher unions at second level and parents.</P>
    <P>At present 190 second level schools are designated as disadvantaged.  These schools are allocated an additional exquota teaching post and 84 of the schools also avail of the home school community liaison scheme.  An additional £30 capitation grant, in addition to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant, was introduced in 1994 for schools which were designated as disadvantaged. This brings the total capitation funding for second level schools designated as disadvantaged to £207 per pupil in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 438 and 446 together.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate resource or remedial teacher posts in any year is determined by resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  As Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs, including resource and remedial teacher needs.</P>
      <P>The process of determining the number of additional posts available for allocation to special needs areas for the current school year has only recently been finalised.  This is because the determination in question needed to have regard to the needs of pupils enrolled in September, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of assessing needs and selecting schools for receipt of these posts is now at an advanced stage.  The outcome is likely to include schools serving children with disabilities on a fully integrated basis for whom a resource teacher allocation would be <Col N="308" /> the most appropriate response. However, in view of the significant increase in remedial teacher allocations of recent years, it is not my intention to allocate remedial teachers to primary schools in the current school year.</P>
    <P>The precise number of resource teacher posts involved will be determined by an assessment of need at individual school level.  Current indications suggest that in the order of ten such posts will be involved.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to announce precise details of post allocations to special needs pupils shortly.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any serious frustration concerning the in-career development in accounting for teachers, which will take place during the period 14 to 25 October, 1996.</P>
      <P>Notification of this programme issued to schools last May, following consultation with the education partners, management representatives, teacher unions, parents representatives.  The programme is a continuation of in-career development for accounting teachers, the first phase of which commenced in 1995 with an extensive programme of two-day seminars for teachers, held in September and October of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the best timing of the second phase, account was taken of the generally held view that the period leading up to the certificate examinations is <Col N="309" /> not a good time to run major in-career programmes.  It is not feasible to run major in-career programmes of the type in question during the summer holiday period, as inevitably, numbers of teachers would not be in a position to attend.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is highly desirable that all accounting teachers should attend the complete programme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the topics to be covered in the forthcoming phase are those which will be of most relevance to teachers in delivering the second year of the revised leaving certificate accounting course.  Accordingly, the timing of the forthcoming phase is appropriate as far as the effective delivery of the revised accounting syllabus is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would add that in addition to the in-career development programme referred to, a freephone helpline is being established for operation from Monday 30 September to Friday 11 October to assist teachers who may have queries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> The programme, which will be delivered at a vocational training centre located in the COPE complex, offers a continuation of the services which this person received at St. Paul's and aims at building on the progress he has made over the past number of years.  The programme includes: physiotherapy, music therapy, exercises to develop visual motor/visual discrimination skills, sensory integration, conductive education, hydrotherapy and communication skills.</P>
    <P>My Department has sanctioned a full-time instructor for the person in question and one other student who will comprise the initial enrolment at the centre.  In addition, my Department has undertaken that, as was the case in St. Paul's, the instructor to student ratio will not exceed 6:1.</P>
    <P>Both my Department's inspectorate and the authorities at the COPE Foundation are satisfied that, given this person's age, placement in the vocational training centre represents the most appropriate response to his needs at this stage.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to allow a further extension to permit this young man to continue attending his former school.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there was a series of burglaries in the Blackrock area during July and August although there has not been any <Col N="325" /> increase in the overall number of burglaries compared with recent years.  The Garda have identified a number of persons responsible for some of these burglaries and investigations are continuing in the other cases.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the local Garda response to this activity has been saisfactory and the question of organisational changes does not arise.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to post mortems which a coroner has caused to be carried out in exercise of his or her powers under the Coroners Act, 1962. On this basis, the information requested is set out in the following tabular statement. Where two or more coroners hold office in any county, the table includes the details for those coronerships.</P>

      <P>In the period of 1 January 1995 to date, 38 persons have been naturalised on foot of their investments in the State.  In the case of ten of these persons, their applications had been approved in early 1994 by my predecessor before the then Government decided that all investment based naturalisation applications should be assessed by an inter-departmental advisory group operating within terms of reference.  I authorised the release of their certificates of naturalisation when my Department was satisfied that the persons in question had made their investments, purchasd residences and complied with the requirements then in force.</P>
      <P>In relation to the remaining 28 cases, 17 in 1995 and 11 to date in 1996, their applications for naturalisation were assessed in accordance with the terms of reference of the scheme by the advisory group and following recommendations by the advisory group to me, the investors in question were naturalised.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the scheme stipulate that, <i>inter alia,</i> each applicant must invest a minimum of £1 million for the purpose of either saving existing jobs or for creating new jobs.  These requirements, together with the other requirements of the scheme, were met in all of these 28 cases.</P>

      <P>The appointment of coroners is the <Col N="332" /> responsibility of the relevant local authority under Section 8 (2) of the Coroners, Act, 1962.  I was, however, very concerned about the recent difficulties that arose in County Louth concerning the holding of post mortems following the resignation of the Louth Coroner on 7 August and the Deputy Coroner on 27 August.</P>
      <P>Following the resignation of the deputy coroner, my Department was in communication with Louth County Council and the Garda Síochána with a view to minimising the effect of any delays in carrying out post mortems.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that a coroner was appointed by Louth County Council on a temporary basis with effect from 28 August 1996, and I would like to inform the Deputy that the Civil Service Commission has recently advertised for the filling of the permanent post of Coroner for County Louth by Louth County Council.</P>
      <P>Apart from the appointment of corners, the payment and fixing of their salaries is also primarily the responsibility of the local authority and is governed by Section 9 of the Coroners Act, 1962. This provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the salary of each coroner shall be fixed by the local authority by whom the coroner is appointed, with the approval of the Minister for Justice and after consultation with the Minister for the Environment. I can inform the Deputy that my Department is in correspondence with the Department of the Environment in relation to a review of coroners' remuneration.</P>

      <P>I would like to stress at the outset that I have no function in relation to the enforcement of individual Court Orders.</P>
      <P>Under the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts, 1926 to 1940 and Rules of Court made under these Acts, the Sheriff or County Registrar acting as Sheriff, who is a Statutory Officer and is independent in the exercise of his functions, is responsible for the enforcement of Court Orders.  These orders are a direction by the court to the sheriff, or county registrar commanding him or her to seize whatever goods are within his or her bailiwick belonging to the judgment debtor and to produce the sum due to the judgment creditor out of their sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in view of the public concern about the reported use of balaclavas by one or more individuals in the recent seizure which took place in Donegal, I have asked the County <Col N="334" /> Registrar, who is also the Sheriff for County Donegal, for a report on this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 484, 485, 486 and 487 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply to a question from the Deputy on 21 May 1996, I indicated that a full Garda investigation into the events at the Point Theatre on Saturday, 11 May 1996, was being undertaken and that this Garda investigation would include the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  The preparation of a comphrehensive report to the city coroner into the death of a young woman.</P>
      <P>(b)  Whether a breach of the criminal law has occurred and that if such a breach had occurred a file would be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision as to whether or not to prosecute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that a comprehensive investigation file into the death was completed by the Superintendent, Store Street Garda Station, on 21 August 1996.  As there was no evidence of a criminal nature in the investigation file, the report was not referred by the Garda Síochána to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>A copy of the investigation file was sent to the city coroner and I am informed by the Garda authorities that the city coroner has fixed 8 October 1996 as the date for the holding of the inquest into the death of the young woman.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that the gardaí were in regular communication with the young woman's family during the course of the Garda investigation.  On 22 August 1996, the detective inspector in charge of the investigation informed the mother of the deceased of the inquest date by phone.  I understand that in the course of that telephone conversation, the mother of the deceased inquired if the file had been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  She was informed that the file would not be sent forward as the evidence gathered did not disclose the commission of a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>An article which purported to refer to the alleged findings of the Garda investigation was published in the media on 22 July 1996.  As I have already indicated, the investigation had not been completed at that time and I can very much understand the consequent distress caused to the family.  A preliminary report from the Garda authorities indicates that no information was made available by the Garda to the media.  I will be asking the Commissioner to furnish me with a final report in the matter.</P>
    <P>Further comment on the detail of the report on the events in the Point Theatre would not be appropriate in view of the forthcoming coroner's inquest.</P>
    <P>As I have previously announced, the recently enacted Criminal Justice (Drug <Col N="340" /> Trafficking) Act, 1996, contains a significant amendment to the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, to allow a member of the Garda, whether in uniform or not, to enter any place where a public dancing licence is in force for the purposes of investigating suspected drug trafficking offences.  Prior to this amendment, there was a requirement that the Garda be in uniform, which was clearly unhelpful in the investigation of drug trafficking offences.  Other aspects of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, and related legislation are under consideration in my Department.  Any proposals for change in this regard will be announced in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 513 together.</P>
      <P>Two adults and three children in transit from Cuba to the Ukraine approached immigration officers at Shannon Airport on 5 September and sought &ldquo;ecological asylum&rdquo; as the Ukraine was ecologically polluted due to the chernobyl disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When interviewed, with the assistance of a Ukrainian interpreter, the adults <Col N="343" /> explained that they had been in Cuba for the previous two years where their children had been receiving medical treatment.  It was explained to the individuals that they required visas to enter the State and they were advised to continue their journey to Kiev and to apply to come to Ireland in the normal manner. They were also advised of the fact that many children are brought to Ireland each year under a special &ldquo;Chernobyl project&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They declined to accept the advice offered them, and then indicated that they were seeking &ldquo;political asylum&rdquo; on the grounds that their government could not guarantee proper medical care for their children.</P>
    <P>The two families were than put up in local bed and breakfast accommodation, with the assistance of the Red Cross, pending a decision on their cases.  The immigration officers dealing with the case consulted with officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>While the persons concerned used the expression &ldquo;political asylum&rdquo; after it had been made clear that they could not be allowed to remain in the State by reference to the ecological concerns they had expressed, it was evident that the grounds advanced by them for political asylum were not encompassed within the internationally recognised meaning of that expression.  Accordingly the immigration officers at Shannon were instructed to set in motion the normal processes applying to persons entering the State illegally.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, 7 September, the individuals in question left the State &mdash; they were not allowed to remain as they were in breach of Irish law.</P>
    <P>When they were formally refused leave to land they were advised of the reasons, as required by law, and of the proper procedures for entering the State.  They were again advised of the Chernobyl project.  While they were naturally displeased with the decision, they raised no objections to the course of action being taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> There is no doubt that in many immigration/asylum cases decision-making can present considerable difficulties and there have been many examples of such cases over the years.  The problem about treating any application as an exception is that it leaves immigration/asylum law generally open to challenge by parties who believe that their cases also merit exceptional treatment.</P>
    <P>The issue which gave rise to the possibility of exceptional treatment, in this case, was the suggestion that a child's health would be put at risk if permission to land were refused.  This was a matter for medical assessment and in fact the applicants had access to medical advice. The adults mentioned that they had been in Cuba for medical reasons but there was never any indication that there was any particular medical emergency or that any urgent treatment was required.  I understand that the doctor who attended the child during his time in this country was required only to administer one of a regular series of injections; the child had his own supply of the required medication.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly understandable that individuals looking for permission to land and remain in the State would advance a variety of arguments in support of their applications &mdash; and a variety of arguments are in fact advanced.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate, however, that if this country were to accept that the asylum process should automatically be set in motion once an applicant, having landed illegally, raises concern about the possible health risks associated with residing in particular parts of the world, this would represent a fundamental departure by the State from international law and practice in this area.</P>
    <P>Having explained that basis for not granting permission to land in this case, I want to emphasise that if these families seek to enter the State legally for medical attention and recuperation their applications will be examined sympathetically as is the case with applications from the Chernobyl area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Finally I should say that the Government has demonstrated its concern to update the law and improve procedures in relation to refuges.  Deputies will be aware that the Refugee Act, 1996, became law on 26 June 1996.  The necessary arrangements to implement the provisions of this Act are currently in hand in my Department.  I have no proposals at this time to introduce further legislation to amend the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; which is provided for at section 2 of the Act.</P>

      <P>Consultations are on-going between my Department, the Department of the Environment and Dublin Corporation in regard to the transfer of the traffic warden service and the fines-on-the-spot office to Dublin Corporation.  A date has not yet been fixed for the transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that consultants appointed by the Minister for the Environment are currently undertaking a <Col N="347" /> study to define the organisational structures required to ensure that the director of traffic can fully and efficiently discharge his/her functions and that the new unit within Dublin Corporation will have optimum operational capacity, functional independence, and self-financing capability.</P>
    <P>Preliminary discussions have been held with the unions in relation to the proposed transfer and further meetings will be held prior to the transfer.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the enforcement of road traffic legislation in relation to speeding is given high priority by the Garda and the Garda are adequately resourced and have the most up-to-date speed detection equipment available for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The main equipment used by the Garda at present are hand held radar and in car video units.  The Garda also recently acquired the GATSO system which is a sophisticated combined camera/radar/computer speed detection unit.  It is the most advanced technology in speeding detection equipment available to the Garda Síochána.  It is programmed to record the location, speed and registration numbers of the offending vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí have mounted 28 speed traps during the past three years on Strand Road, Sandymount.  A number of prosecutions have been initiated as a result of these checks.  I also understand that Dublin Corporation agreed to provide a continuous white line on a <Col N="348" /> portion of the roadway to deter vehicles from overtaking.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted all persons in the State may claim in respect of their injuries.  The scheme already allows for the payment of <i>ex gratia</i> compensation in the form of certain out of pocket expenses and medical expenses: (a) in respect of personal injury where the injury is directly attributable to a crime of violence, or (b) in circumstances arising from the action of the victim in assisting or attempting to assist the prevention of crime or the saving of human life.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> includes a commitment to review the criminal injuries compensation scheme.</P>
      <P>The review, which has involved research into other compensation schemes both in this jurisdiction and abroad, is well advanced in my Department and I expect to receive shortly a report which will set out the options open to the Government.</P>
      <P>Any proposals which I might have, following detailed examination of these matters, will have to be considered and approved by the Government.</P>

      <P>There is a commitment in the Government policy agreement to reform the law relating to administration and regulation of charities along the lines of the report of the committee on fundraising activities for charitable and other purposes, the Costello report, which included recommendations in relation to professional fundraisers and consultants. Work on the preparation of this legislation is proceeding and it is hoped to introduce the legislation early next year.  To assist this process the Minister of State, Deputy Joan Burton, established an advisory group on charities comprising representatives of a number of organisations working in this area.  It is expected that the group's report will be available shortly and at that stage it is proposed to refer the report to the <Col N="350" /> legislation and security committee for their consideration.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are not aware of any increased abuse in the area of professional collectors for charity. However, any abuse which comes to the notice of the Garda is fully investigated and prosecuted where warranted.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Síochána that, on foot of complaints received, they have been giving special attention to this area by means of foot and mobile patrols.  No arrests have been made to date but the area will continue under surveillance.</P>
      <P>I should say that there seems to be a general perception that this kind of activity is widespread throughout the city and that the Garda are not doing anything about it.  I am satisfied from information I have received from the Garda authorities that this perception is misplaced.  The Garda are actively addressing the problem, but of necessity, the response is often covert in nature and, therefore, not obvious to the public.  I can nevertheless, appreciate the general concerns which are being continually expressed about this activity and I intend to keep the matter under review in my regular contracts with the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, strengthens the capacity of the Garda to deal with situations where public drinking or intoxication leads to disorderly behaviour.  Provisional figures for 1995 show that proceedings were instituted in respect of 10,209 offences under that Act.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas. On receipt of the correspondence <Col N="353" /> referred to by the Deputy, I requested a detailed report from them on the policing arrangements for Arva.</P>
      <P>They have informed me that the present strength of Arva Garda station is one sergeant and one garda.  They patrol the area at intervals between 10 a.m. and 2 a.m.  These patrols are augmented by mobile patrols from the district headquarters at Cavan which regularly patrol the area on a 24 hour basis.  The station at Arva is open for sufficient time to allow normal administrative business to be done.  When it is closed there is a direct communications link from it to Cavan which can be used by the public.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present deployment of personnel and resources in the area is adequate to meet the policing requirements of the area.  There would be no policing advantage in opening Arva station for longer hours &mdash; in fact, to do so would be more likely to reduce the effective level of policing in the area as a whole.</P>

      <P>I intend to host one Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting and one associated dinner function in Ireland for the EU Council of Ministers in the context <Col N="356" /> of Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  The Council meeting will take place in Dublin Castle conference centre.</P>
      <P>Malahide Castle will be the venue for the dinner and the number attending will be approximately 60.  The venue was chosen because of its suitability for such a function where privacy and security can be provided.  It should be noted that this venue was also used during the 1990 Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal practice, dinner will also be provided, at another venue, for officials who will be attending the Council meeting.  The number involved is approx 150 of whom about 120 will be visiting officials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Government,</i> the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, introduced measures to tackle the problem of delays by providing for an increase in the maximum number of judges of all courts and also introduced administrative and procedural reforms which have simplified and speeded up the processing of cases through the courts which will, in due course, enhance the overall efficiency of the courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the 1995 Act does away with the automatic right of transfer of criminal cases from provincial Circuit Courts to Dublin.  Such transfers had exacerbated delays in the hearing of <Col N="357" /> criminal cases in Dublin and had also proven very costly in terms of transporting gardaí and witnesses.  It is also very possible that the incentive to transfer these cases was often nothing more than a wish to have the hearing of the case delayed.  There can, of course, be legitimate grounds for such transfers and, therefore, the Act provides that an application to transfer a trial to Dublin will only be granted where the judge is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so.  Since the implementation of the Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995, undue delays in the hearing of cases in the Dublin Circuit Court have been very substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the 1995 Act, three additional High Court judges and seven additional Circuit Court judges were appointed last July.  Also, I have obtained Government approval for the appointment of three additional judges to the District Court and I have asked the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to make submissions to me regarding the filling of these additional posts.  In addition, I have provided in the Courts Act, 1996, for a further increase, by three, in the maximum number of circuit court judges.</P>
    <P>This summer I obtained the agreement of the Presidents of the High and Circuit Courts respectively for additional sittings of the Central Criminal Court in Dublin and the Circuit Court around the country and in Dublin. These extra sittings were for three additional weeks commencing on 16 September.</P>
    <P>The position, generally, in regard to criminal cases in both the Circuit and District Courts is that it takes about three months for the case to progress to a hearing &mdash; where a case arises at the start of the vacation it may take a little longer.  However, this time approximates generally with the time needed for both the defence and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prepare their files.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently <Col N="358" /> before the House contains measures to streamline court procedures including a provision which will extend the existing statutory limit for remanding an accused person in custody from eight days to a maximum of 15 days on a second or subsequent appearance of the accused in court.  This will mean less frequent remand hearings and, as a result, less frequent court attendances by the prosecuting Garda.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Forensic Science Laboratory, in July this year the Government approved an increase in the overall level of the staff of the laboratory by four forensic scientists and two laboratory technicians.  Procedures for filling of these new posts are at an advanced stage and these new positions will be taken up shortly.  The laboratory has been provided with a range of new equipment this year to enable it to carry out the testing of seized materials as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government approved in January and July 1996 my proposals for the provision of additional prison spaces.  Resulting from the Government's January decision, 30 places have been provided in St. Patrick's Institution and 38 places in the health care unit in Mountjoy up to June of this year.</P>
      <P>In order to accelerate the programme agreed in July, Deputy Coveney, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, was requested to oversee the expanded prison building programme and to accelerate the various projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, have been progressing the various works since July as follows: The main construction work on the 25 places in the Castlerea special unit is due to conclude in October and it should be ready for occupation in November. Construction work is ongoing on the 68 places in the Curragh prison and is scheduled to conclude by the end of October and it should be ready for <Col N="366" /> occupation in November or early December.  Detailed design work is under way on the 55 places in Limerick Prison, D wing.  Tenders for construction will be invited in October.  The design and layout of the 60 places in the new woman's prison has been agreed and observations arising from planning consultation are being examined.  The design and layout of the approximately 125 places in Castlerea main prison has been agreed.  Work is progressing on outline drawings, and the preparation of tender documents will be concluded by the end of October.  A detailed brief has been prepared by my Department for the approximately 400 places in Wheatfield Prison and is now being examined in the Office of Public Works.  Target dates have been set for each project and all projects are running fairly well on time.</P>
    <P>Following a newspaper advertisement, a sizeable number of proposals have been received from the private sector for the construction of the remand prison at Wheatfield.  Those proposals are being examined and evaluated and I expect to have a report and recommendations soon.</P>
    <P>When all these projects are completed it should be noted that there will be approximately 800 additional places over today's 2,250 places.  I am satisfied that the programme to provide the additional prison places is making solid progress.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 749 of 25 July 1996, to his colleague, Deputy Martin. <Col N="367" /> This refers to an information leaflet which summarises the main themes and challenges facing the Irish Presidency of the European Union and sets out the main social welfare issues and events during these six months.  A total of 8,000 leaflets have been produced at a cost of £2,850.</P>
      <P>My Department is also sharing the cost equally, with the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, and Equality and Law Reform, of the brochure &ldquo;Action on Employment and Social Policy: Objectives of the Irish Presidency&rdquo;.  To date, the design costs are £2,044.90, of which the cost to my Department is one third.  Final details of the printing costs have yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>Other publications arising from my Department's work programme under the EU Presidency are, for example, conference brochures for, or reports on, forthcoming events in October and November 1996.  It is estimated that these will cost £18,500, the bulk of which relates to the publication of a report on the contributions to the conference &ldquo;Beyond Equal Treatment: Social Security in a Changing Europe&rdquo;, which will take place from 10-12 October 1996. This conference is being grant-aided by the European Commission to approximately 70 per cent of the overall cost.</P>
      <P>The cost incurred by the Department of Social Welfare in relation to Ireland's Presidency of the EU has been estimated at £300,000 and it is expected that spending will be within this figure.  With regard to the major items of expense, these relate generally to the costs of hosting conferences and include, for instance, travel and accommodation for conference delegates.  However, full and final details of these costs are not, at present, available.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 527 and 544 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low incomes who live with and look after <Col N="369" /> certain people who need full-time care and attention.  The allowance is paid directly to the carer.  At the end of July this year a total of 7,951 people were in receipt of the allowance from my Department.</P>
    <P>The person being cared for must be at least 66 years of age or aged under 66 and getting a blind person's pension or an invalidity pension from my Department, disabled person's maintenance allowance, from a health board or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EU regulations or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
    <P>The question of further extending the carer's allowance scheme to allow for carers who are looking after categories such as recipients of a survivor's contributory pension and aged under 66, would have cost implications which would have to be examined in a budgetary context and in the light of the resources available.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of a private pension who is looking after a sick or elderly person may qualify for the carer's allowance in the same manner as any other applicant for the allowance.  Their status as private pensioners does not influence their eligibility and they are subject to the same means test as all other applicants.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 528 and 529 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has a requirement to assess the impact of year 2000 and the introduction of the single European currency, EURO, on its computer systems.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare relies heavily on information technology, IT, for its day to day business. The IT infrastructure supporting the Department's administration is a comlex one, comprising central and local processors, a nationwide telecommunications network linking some 225 offices and customised applications with several millions of lines of computer code.  Given the nature of social welfare business, the computer systems make extensive use of dates and monetary amounts for calculation of entitlement to various benefits.</P>
      <P>The problems associated with the year 2000 affect the whole computer industry and many organisations, particularly those in the financial sector.  Like these organisations, the Department needs to ensure that its various computer systems can adequately cater for the processing of dates at the end of the century.  This requires a very detailed examination of the computer code for each system to identify the changes needed.</P>
      <P>The proposed introduction of a single European currency will also require changes to the Department's computer systems.  It will be necessary to build currency conversion routines into the payment calculation systems.  The Department calculates payments many months in advance to produce books of payable orders for a variety of pensioners and child benefit recipients and the computer systems will have to handle two currency types for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department will shortly begin a three month impact assessment study which will identify what changes must be made to cater for these changes. <Col N="371" /> Consultants with specialist skills and software tools are being engaged to assist the Department in this assessment. This impact assessment study is at an operational and technical level and some aspects of the results may be of assistance to other Government Departments.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 15 July 1994.  She was paid at the personal rate on the basis of details supplied by her which did not include an application for an increase in respect of a child dependant. While the child was born in May 1994, an application for an increase in benefit was not received until 11 July 1996.  The rate of disability benefit payable was increased to include half rate child dependant effective from 11 July 1996.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, retrospective payment of child dependant increases is limited to a period of six months prior to the date of receipt of application.  Accordingly, payment was authorised for a six month period from 11 January 1996 to 10 July 1996.  A cheque amounting to £172.70 was issued on 17 July 1996.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of a widow's contributory pension since 1965.  She applied for an old age contributory pension on 15 March 1988, although she was 66 years of age in March 1979.  This pension was awarded with effect from 11 December 1987, three months prior to the date of claim receipt, which was the maximum period of backdating allowed under legislation at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent further review of her case has shown that the person concerned had written to the UK Department of Social Security, DSS, in 1985 to see if she had any entitlement to a UK pension.  The DSS in turn wrote to this Department <Col N="373" /> in August 1985 to check her Irish social insurance situation.</P>
    <P>Under EU Regulations, a claim to pension in the UK may be treated as a claim to pension in Ireland.  On this basis, the Department is now in a position to backdate her entitlement to old age contributory pension to 1 February 1985, six months prior to the first contact with the Department by the UK Department of Social Security on 1 August 1985.  Arrangements have been made to issue a pension arrears payment of £199.90 to the person concerned within the next week.  This represents the difference between the rate of old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension paid for the period 1 February 1985 and 10 December 1987.</P>

      <P>The category of payment to which the Deputy refers can be classified as an exceptional needs payment, ENP.  The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  There is not an automatic or statutory right of entitlement to an ENP.  Furthermore, the legislation does not allow me to prescribe either the circumstances, or the nature of the need, in respect of which a payment may be made.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> In the interest of equity and transparency, my Department undertook to publish all guidance relating to the SWA scheme.</P>
    <P>The guidelines on ENPS were published in October 1995.  In so far as it is possible, these guidelines are intended to ensure equitable treatment for all applicants and consistency in discretionary decision making both within and between the health boards.  If a claimant is dissatisfied with the decision of the board, he has the right to appeal.  Copies of the guidelines can be obtained from SWA Section, AMD, Store Street, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 535, 539 and 557 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme will transfer from the health boards to this Department on 2 October 1996 and will be renamed disability allowance. Payment will be made by personalised payable order books cashable at post offices.  A person may appoint an agent to cash the payment on their behalf if they are unable to do so.</P>
      <P>A letter issued to all current recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance on 18 September to remind them of the transfer and of their post office of payment.  Payable order books will be available in the post offices from 25 September for collection and the first payment date is 2 October.</P>
      <P>The present arrangements for payments of disabled person's maintenance allowance vary as between health boards.  In some cases payment is by cheque, in other cases by payable orders at post offices.  The pensions payment system, which will be used for payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance, is based on the use of payable orders.  I am conscious that, where people were previously on another system of payments, the change may cause some initial difficulties.  However each recipient of disabled person's maintenance allowance has been offered the opportunity to change their nominated post office of payment and many have done so.  They also have the facility to appoint somebody to collect their payment on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I accept, however, the need for alternative methods of payment to be made available and arrangements to do so will be put in place as soon as practicable after the transfer of the scheme has been finalised and the new arrangements are working satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>No decision has yet been taken with regard to the future of the branch offices.  Any such decision will be fully discussed with the branch managers who are represented in negotiations with the Department by the branch managers' association under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which covers them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, is designed <Col N="377" /> to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear.  Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must satisfy a means test.  The means test takes account of any income over and above the appropriate rate of survivor's (widow's and widower's) contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple.  Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>
      <P>This year the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is paid on an age related basis.  The rates of allowance payable have been increased by £3.  This means that under the 1996 scheme, an allowance of £43 is payable in respect of children from two to 11 years of age and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 21 years of age.  I have extended the scheme to recipients of unemployability supplement who satisfy the means assessment.</P>
      <P>Orphan's pension is not considered to be a qualifying payment under the terms of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme.  The orphan's pension, which is a basic social welfare payment, is payable to the guardian and is intended to cover the child's cost of living, including food and clothing.  Eligible applicants will receive either a contributory or non-contributory orphan's pension of up to £42.60 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparison, the allowance paid in respect of dependent children with other social welfare or health board payments is either £13.20 of £15.20 per week.  The higher rate of orphan's pension, as compared with the child dependant allowance rate, means that the guardian receives an additional <Col N="378" /> income of up to £1,528 per annum in respect of the orphaned child.</P>
    <P>With reference to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, the orphan's guardians are in receipt of an orphan's pension.  In addition, they are both in employment and their earnings substantially exceed the limit for their family size for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>
    <P>Some 280,000 pupils will benefit under the scheme this year at a cost of approximately £13.8 million.  The scheme opens for applications in all health boards from June each year.  This is to allow adequate time to process the large number of applications.</P>

      <P>A widow's contributory pension may be paid on the basis of the insurance record either of the widow or of her late husband.  Where a widow remarries, her widow's pension entitlement ceases.  Should she become a widow a second time, title to pension is based on either her own social insurance, or that of her second husband, at the time.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of a widow's contributory pension until she remarried abroad by civil registration ceremony in 1971.  This marriage broke up after a short period and she returned to Ireland and married again in 1972 in an Irish church ceremony. When her partner of that church marriage died in 1990 it was decided that she was not entitled to a widow's pension as their marriage could not be recognised by the State for legal or pension purposes, and as her legal husband was apparently still alive.  She appealed this but the independent social welfare appeals officer confirmed the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> She was awarded a lone parent's allowance in 1990.  However, her entitlement to that allowance ceased on 19 September 1996, as she no longer has qualified dependent children residing with her.  Arrangements have been made to pay her a deserted wife's allowance of £6.50 per week instead, with effect from 26 September 1996.  This reduced rate takes account of a separate local authority pension she is receiving as well.  She will also receive a fuel allowance of £8 a week from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    <P>In her particular marital circumstances, there is no legal basis on which the person concerned can be reconsidered for a widow's contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is 62 years old and in receipt of a widow's contributory pension and free electricity allowance.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to a free telephone rental allowance for a widow aged between 60 and 65 is that her late husband must have been in receipt of this allowance prior to his death.  This condition, introduced in 1994, is intended to provide continuity of existing free scheme entitlements for a widow or widower under pension age following the death of their pensioner spouse.</P>
      <P>Since her late husband was not in receipt of a free telephone rental allowance, the person concerned is not entitled to this allowance at present.  She will qualify for the allowance in her own right when she reaches 66 years of age and should apply nearer that time so that the allowance may be applied to her telephone account.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 542 and 552 together.</P>
      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years, or over, and also to certain disabled people under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>Last July, the free schemes of telephone rental allowance, electricity allowance and colour television licence were extended to low income pensioners who did not previously qualify because they did not get a social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>Applicants for these schemes are deemed to satisfy the living alone condition if they are residing alone or only with certain excepted people, for example, dependent spouses or children. The extension of the residence condition to allow for the inclusion of other categories in the household, such as non-dependent children, would have substantial cost implications which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain incapacitated people who are medically unfit to travel alone may be <Col N="381" /> eligible for a companion free travel pass.  This pass allows the holder to have a person over age 16 accompany him or her free of charge when travelling.  Last July, the free travel companion pass was extended to blind and visually impaired children.  This measure is of particular benefit to children attending special schools and who have to commute on a daily or weekly basis, by allowing them have a person of their choice travel free with them on their journey.</P>
    <P>However, the question of extending the free travel scheme in general to include all permanently severely handicapped persons under 16 years of age would have cost implications which, again, would have to be examined in a budgetary context and in the light of the resources available.</P>

      <Quest>the reason persons who had reached the age 63 years on the introduction of the self-employed PRSI in 1988 and who could not accumulate 156 contributions before reaching the age of 66 to qualify for widow's-widower's pensions, are not entitled to receive a refund of all of their contributions rather than 53 per cent.</Quest>

      <P>Self employed persons became insured under the social insurance system with effect from 6 April 1988, the commencement of the 1988-89 contribution year.  Contributions at the class S rate are payable by this group and provide cover for old age (contributory) and widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age (contributory) pension element of the class S contribution, i.e. 53 per cent, under the Social Welfare (Contributions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1990 [S.I. No. 264 of 1990], may be made to those who fail to qualify for a pension, either contributory or non contributory, and who satisfy the relevant conditions governing refunds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> However, there is no provision in the legislation for refund of the widow's or widower's contributory pension element as entitlement can be based on either the applicant's own or their late spouse's social insurance record. Accordingly the fact that a person was over 63 in 1988 would not necessarily mean that they could not qualify for a widow's or widower's contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The work required to ensure the smooth transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the health boards to my Department is continuing and arrangements are currently being finalised for the takeover on 2 October.  I am confident that the scheme, to be renamed disability allowance, will provide a streamlined and efficient service to people with disabilities and that the transfer will take place with the minimum inconvenience to recipients of the allowance.</P>
      <P>As part of the arrangements for the transfer, a comprehensive information and communications strategy was devised to ensure that all persons currently in receipt of the allowance and other interested parties would be kept informed of the process and the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A letter was issued by the health boards in June to persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance advising them of the transfer.  This was followed in mid-July by a detailed letter from this Department outlining the transfer arrangements including the payment method, the post office of payment nominated for the person and the <Col N="383" /> weekly payment amount.  This letter offered persons the opportunity to change the post office of payment if the nominated office was unsuitable and to appoint a person to collect the payment on their behalf if they were unable to do so.</P>
    <P>A fact sheet was also produced outlining the principal implications of the transfer and this issued to a wide audience including all TDs, relevant departmental and health board staff, organisations representing people with disabilities and community information centres.</P>
    <P>National organisations representing people with disabilities were also consulted during the transfer process and a number of meetings were held to keep them informed of arrangements and to obtain their views on issues and matters of concern.</P>
    <P>A further letter issued to persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance on 18 September to remind them of the transfer and of their post office of payment.  A media campaign has also commenced to inform people of the new arrangements and this will cover both national and local press and radio.  A freephone number is now available to provide assistance with queries and this has been notified to each client and is listed in the advertising material.  A comprehensive information leaflet outlining the provisions of the scheme will be available at social welfare offices from October.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this communications strategy has been effective in providing information and reassurance to people regarding the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to treatment benefit vary depending on the age of the insured person.  Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Finally, persons aged 66 or over are required to have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching age 66 of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>The PRSI contribution conditions for treatment benefit are generally in line with those applying to other contributory benefit schemes.  These conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme by directing limited resources towards those in greatest need, including dependent spouses of insured workers.  They also ensure a realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record.  While I have no plans to change these contribution conditions, the conditions of all schemes are kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 548 and 555 together.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and up to age 19 in respect of children who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally handicapped.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is currently being paid at double the normal rate in respect of 140 sets of triplets and six sets of quadruplets, at an annual cost of almost £170,000.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is payable to some 12,500 sets of twins and the estimated additional annual cost of paying the benefit at double the normal rate in respect of twins is in the region of £9 million.</P>
      <P>A special once-off grant of £300 is payable on the birth of triplets and £400 where four or more children are born together.  These arrangements were extended to include the birth of twins in 1993 when the grant of £200 was introduced. In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, I made provision in the 1996 budget for an increase in the grant payable on the birth of twins from £200 to £500 and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12 years.  The improved arrangements for the payment of grants in respect of twins were brought into effect from 1 January 1996.  To date some 1,400 sets of twins have benefited at a cost of almost £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the improved grants, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 budget, these rates represent an increase of 45 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 36 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of other children.  Any further improvements in child benefit must be <Col N="387" /> considered in the light of available resources and within a budgetary context.</P>

    <P>Meetings with the German Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, the German Minister of State for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, and the UK Secretary of State for Social Security are being arranged for dates yet to be confirmed.  It is not possible, at this point, to give details of the total cost involved.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, our social protection systems are facing a time of unprecedented pressure and change. The purpose of these visits is to further the social welfare priorities of this Government, in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the EU, and to build on the consensus achieved at the informal meeting of EU Ministers for Social Protection on 10-11 July 1996 &mdash; namely, the need to ensure that social protection systems contribute positively and actively to the fight against unemployment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 550 and 559 together.</P>
      <P>Experience in Ireland and internationally shows that it is very difficult to estimate the overall level of social welfare fraud at any time.  However, the levels of detected abuse with their resultant overpayments of benefit and underpayments of PRSI show that there is a continual level of abuse perpetrated by a minority of claimants and employers on the social welfare system. This can range from minor short-term irregularities to very serious deliberate fraud of the system.</P>
      <P>The day-to-day management of new claims for payments and their subsequent review incorporates a developed structure of measures, tried and tested over many years, designed to prevent and to detect cases of abuse and fraud.  These procedures and practices consist of general checking of applications and claims in payment, and targeted inspections of certain high-risk categories and groups of claimants.</P>
      <P>The Department has always been aware of the need to control fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and such activity has always formed an integral part of its operations.  Five hundred and seventy staff are engaged specifically on control activities and means-testing at local, regional and national levels.  The estimated savings from these activities was of the order of £124 million in 1995 and up to the end of August this year we had identified £91 million.  These various measures are reviewed and refined continuously to ensure that they remain effective and new approaches and measures are being constantly identified and adopted.</P>
      <P>In view of the recent attention and concerns about the level of fraud and abuse in the unemployment payments area, I have received Government approval to introduce an enhanced programme of systematic controls to ensure that only those who are genuinely eligible receive unemployment payments. These measures are being put in place immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> I am determined to stamp out fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to apply the full rigours of the law to those who defraud the system.  This applies not just to fraudulent claimants but also to those employers who collude in such practices and those who do not pay the PRSI contributions which are legally due, or fail to comply with the requirement to notify the Department of Social Welfare of new employees.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am having a more fundamental examination carried out of all control procedures and anti-abuse measures.  It is my intention to seek expert assistance as necessary with this task.  One of the areas that will be specifically examined will be a better assessment of the actual overall level of fraud and abuse which was last done in 1987.</P>

      <P>On 10-11 July last, I hosted an informal Council meeting of EU Ministers for social protection in Dublin Castle.  This was attended by 92 delegates, including my ministerial colleague, Deputy Durkan, Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, who led the Irish delegation, other EU ministerial colleagues, Commissioner Flynn and representatives from the social partners at EU level.  A dinner that evening was held in St. Patrick's Hall, State Apartments, Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This meeting was held back-to-back with that of the informal meeting of EU Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs, <Col N="391" /> hosted by my colleague, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment. The main theme of both meetings was &ldquo;Long-Term Unemployment&rdquo;, which was examined from the perspective of social protection policy on 10-11 July and labour market policy on 11-12 July.  A joint discussion document, produced by both Departments, served as the basis for the deliberations of the delegates, some of whom were common to both meetings.</P>
    <P>In view of the communal arrangements applicable to both meetings, Dublin Castle was chosen as the most suitable venue, with regard to cost, its facilities and accessibility.</P>
    <P>I am also holding, as part of my programme of work in the context of the EU Presidency, two major conferences in conjunction with the institutions of the European Union.  The first &ldquo;Beyond Equal Treatment: Social Security in a Changing Europe&rdquo; takes place from 10-12 October 1996.  Approximately 200 participants are expected to attend and the conference will be located in Dublin Castle.  A conference dinner will take place in St. Patrick's Hall, State Apartments, Dublin Castle, on 11 October 1996.</P>
    <P>The second conference, &ldquo;New Directions in Social Welfare&rdquo;, will be held on 14-16 November 1996 and is being co-hosted with and co-funded by the European Foundation for the Improvement <Col N="392" /> of Living and Working Conditions. Attended by some 120 delegates, it, too, will be based in Dublin Castle, with a conference dinner in St. Patrick's Hall, State Apartments, Dublin Castle on 15 November 1996.</P>
    <P>I have also arranged for a meeting of officials to take place in Blarney, Cork, from 17-20 October next.  I will be hosting a dinner for approximately 50 delegates in the Jameson Heritage Centre, Midleton.  I was eager to ensure from the outset that this event would be held outside Dublin.  Blarney was chosen as a venue on the basis of suitability, cost and access to Cork International Airport. MISSOC, the Mutual Information System on Social Protection, is a network set up by the European Commission in 1990 and consists of officials from each member state.  The main function of the network is to publish, annually, comparative tables setting out each member state's social protection system.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the court orders applying in the various legal proceedings taken in relation to the payment of equal treatment arrears, my Department will, in accordance with normal legal practice in such circumstances, meet the plaintiffs' legal costs. The costs which solicitors are entitled to recover from my Department are those costs which are known as party and party costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there may be separate solicitor and client costs which are directed at the client.  As these costs are entirely a matter between the solicitor and the client, the question of an agreement regarding solicitor and client costs is a matter for the individual clients and their solicitors.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office has advised my Department that where a solicitor presents such a client bill of costs, the client can refer <Col N="394" /> the matter for taxation by signing a requisition to tax, which the solicitor lodges in the Taxing Master's Court together with a copy of the solicitor client bill of costs.</P>
    <P>When taxing the solicitor client bill of costs, the Taxing Master takes into account the amount agreed or taxed in the party and party bill of costs, i.e. the Department of Social Welfare and solicitor.</P>
    <P>Women who approach my Department regarding solicitor client costs are being advised of their right to have such costs adjudicated by the Taxing Master. Where any woman is of the opinion that she has been overcharged by her solicitor, she can also make a complaint to the Law Society who will investigate the complaint in accordance with the provisions of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>

      <Quest>the reason an inequality exists in relation to the scheme run by the community of religious in Ireland known as the part-time job opportunities programme, whereby a married man loses all the benefits he has when going on the scheme, whereas a lone parent would lose only 20 per cent of his/her benefit; the plans, if any, he has to eliminate this inequality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The part-time job opportunities programme is a pilot programme with 1,000 places out of the total provision of places for the community employment programme and operating as a sub-group within that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social Welfare legislation precludes any person from receiving an unemployment payment or signing for credits during any week in which he or she is employed under the part-time job opportunities programme.  A person <Col N="395" /> participating on the programme is deemed to be employed, and therefore does not meet the statutory conditions for receipt of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The programme pays the &ldquo;going rate for the job&rdquo;.  A person on the pilot programme may also engage in other part-time work or activities outside of the time spent on the project.  In addition, the personal allowance payable on the pilot programme is approximately £20 higher than that which obtains on an unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>Eligibility conditions for lone parent's allowance payable to both men and women differ from those for unemployment payments.  A person may continue to claim lone parent allowance while working, subject to a means assessment. There is no disqualification from receipt of lone parent allowance while participating on the pilot programme.  This is in recognition of the special difficulties faced by a lone parent bringing up a child or children without the support of a spouse or partner, and the extra expenses incurred, such as child-minding expenses where there is no spouse or partner to mind the children when the parent is working.</P>
    <P>The means test for lone parent's allowance allows for an earnings disregard of £24, travel expenses of up to £10, and childminding expenses of up to £30 per week for one child, which means that a lone parent may retain a part of the allowance while participating on the programme.  Secondary benefits, such as fuel allowance and Christmas bonus are retained by both lone parent's allowance recipients and persons who were in receipt of an unemployment payment prior to participation in the part-time job opportunities programme.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will be made for an independent evaluation of the programme to be carried out in 1997 when the pilot is due to finish.</P>

      <P>My Department has carried out a number of surveys over the past two years with representative samples of people across the various schemes. The objective of these surveys is to obtain feedback on the services provided so as to ensure that, in delivering these services, the Department continues to be responsive to the needs of customers.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1995, the Department commissioned and independent survey of social welfare customers and of the general public to assess the level of service provided and highlight areas where improvements might be made and, among the general public, to determine their levels of knowledge of and attitudes towards the Department and its services.  Reactions and perceptions were sought across a wide range of issues which included customer service, attitudes to fraud, the question of identity cards and the issue of information dissemination regarding social welfare matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> The findings of this independent research, have given an insight into the perceptions held by members of the public towards the services of the Department of Social Welfare.  The first part of the survey which covered the attitudes and perceptions of people receiving social welfare payments, was published at the end of May 1996. Analysis of the second part which addresses the image and impact of the Department among the general public is almost complete and will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Bord Tráchtála trade mission which I led to Finland on 4 June of this year.  This trade mission was part of Bord Tráchtála's ongoing Opportunity Europe '96 programmes of increasing indigenous Irish exports to Europe.  Eleven industrial supplier companies took part in the mission along with five consultancy companies.  Our main aim for the industrial companies was to promote Ireland as a quality source of subcontract supply for Finland's strong base of international manufacturers such as Nokia, Kone, Valmet and ICL.  For the services companies, the aim was to try to establish a partnership approach to bring together the complementary strengths of Irish and Finnish companies in tendering for internationally-funded development projects in the Baltic region and the Russian Federation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the mission achieved substantial benefits for the participants both in terms of strengthening existing business relationships and in developing worthwhile new business opportunities.

      <P>Following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, I have been pursuing since January last, as recommended by the independent product development management board, an alternative strategy for a major international conference centre under the current tourism operational programme or OP, 1994-99.  In accordance with this strategy, Bord Fáilte, under the aegis of the aforementioned product board, has been examining an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under the OP for public and similar bodies.  The RDS has been advised <i>inter alia</i> that its proposed centre would have to operate without annual operating subsidy from the State or revenue from casino gaming.</P>
      <P>The possibility of a second proposal, involving a public-private joint venture, was also explored during the year but the promoters were not in a position to submit the necessary outline details within deadlines set to allow assessment of suitability for inclusion in the alternative strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and the product board have now completed their examination of the RDS proposal and have recommended a separate independent cost-benefit analysis.  This analysis is being undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm, selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure, which is expected to report next month.  Once available, I will consider their findings, along with those of the product board, with a view to referring the RDS proposal, if appropriate, for decision by Government as a possible <Col N="404" /> submission to the European Commission which must individually approve major projects of this magnitude under the OP.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar Dáil questions, the rapid expansion of the tourism sector in recent years has seen a proportionate increase in the number of tourists with disabilities.  This has led to an increasing level of inquiries from tourists and potential tourists about accessibility of tourist facilities in Ireland, making it clear that this is a very valuable potential market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the commitment of both the Government and the European Commission to improve the position of the socially disadvantaged, the operational programme for tourism 1994-99, which is the main vehicle for tourism development in Ireland up to the end of this decade, makes support available to hotel proprietors to help meet the additional costs of providing suitable access-friendly accommodation and <Col N="405" /> related facilities for the disabled in existing hotel premises, and to assist hotels and the major public and private sector visitor centres to provide access for the disabled, where this can be provided on a cost-effective basis.  Furthermore, in interdepartmental discussions aimed at ensuring consistency and complementarity between the tourism and other operational programmes, my Department has stressed the importance of improved access for disabled tourists.</P>
    <P>There is a growing awareness in the tourism industry of the importance of the disabled holiday market.  Ultimately, of course, the industry must adapt its facilities and product if it is to appeal to this market and avail of the sales opportunities which it offers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 573, 583, 585, 588 and 593 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions No. 81 in this House on 25 January 1996, as reported in Volume 460, No. 5, columns 1395 and 1396, my reply to Question No. 22 in this House on 28 February 1996, as reported in volume 462 No. 3, at columns 741 and 742, and my reply to Question No. 287 in this House on 18 June 1963, as reported in Volume 467, No. 1, column 221.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation dealing with credit unions, which dates in some cases from 1893, are well advanced.  The scope of the Bill has <Col N="408" /> necessarily required detailed attention on the part both of my Department and the Attorney General's Office. However, I am pleased to be able to tell Deputies that a first draft of the Bill, which involves up to 200 sections, has recently been received from the parliamentary draftsman, and it is presently being examined in detail by my Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of credit unions.  The Bill will be finalised in conjunction with the parliamentary draftsman in the coming weeks, after which Government approval will be sought.</P>
    <P>The Credit Unions Bill is my priority for legislative action, and while I am not able to give a precise date for publication or enactment at present, I can assure Deputies that every effort is being made to have the Bill published within the next three months, in order that it be considered during the current Dáil session.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Credit Union Movement.</P>
    <P>81.  Nr. N. Treacy asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the reason he has not brought forward amending legislation to ensure that the Credit Union movement can operate in the same financial environment as other institutions; the reason for the delay in introducting this legislation; when he proposes to make the necessary changes, including the publication of the proposed Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [1610/96]</P>
    <P>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton): I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 164 on 5 December 1995 as reported in Volume 459, No. 3, columns 449-450).</P>
    <P>The Government's legislation programme, published regularly, includes a Credit Union Bill among those being actively worked on and to be published as soon as the necessary consultative, drafting and other procedures allow.  Proposals for the updating and consolidation of the body of legislation (1893 to 1978) dealing with credit unions are still with the Parliamentary Draftsman.  In the course of the development of these proposals by my Department and the Registrar of Friendly Societies, there has been extensive consultation with interested parties, including the <Col N="409" /> Irish credit union movement itself.  Unfortunately, these various processes took much longer than originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>As indicated in reply to previous questions, it would not be in order to formally anticipate the content of the proposals that might eventually emanate from the drafting process. Apropos the Deputy's reference to the financial environment for credit unions and other institutions, I take it that he is aware of the particular ethos of the credit union movement which differentiates it from banks and building societies.  It was never proposed to breach that ethos.</P>
    <P>I wish to again confirm my intention to introduce the Bill as soon as possible after the drafting processes are complete and I have had an opportunity to put the Draft Bill before my cabinet colleagues.  I have previously signified that interested parties will then have another opportunity to review my proposals before they are considered by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX 2.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Credit Union Regulations.</P>
    <P>22.  Mr. E. Byrne asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the progress, if any, made in revising the regulations governing credit unions; when he intends bringing forward legislation in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [4517/96]</P>
    <P>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton): I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 81 on Thursday 25 January 1996,  Volume 460, No. 5, columns 1395-6.</P>
    <P>I would also say that the publication of this Bill at the earliest possible date is a high priority with me.  It is a priority because of the importance of the credit union movement in our society.  The movement is all-Ireland with more than 500 individual credit unions, four-fifths of them in the Republic.  Total membership is in the order of one and three-quarter million people and membership in recent years has been growing at around 10 per cent per annum on average.  The credit unions' combined loan book in 1994 was estimated at £1.3 billion and lending was growing at something in the order of 20 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>All of this has been achieved by a movement based on notions of voluntarism, the common bond, community, and self-help.  It is a movement that has created a very significant financial services organisation that commands the loyalty of its members, delivers service and value and does all of this outside the framework of private ownership and the profit motive.  I value all of this and what it has contributed to local, family, personal and social development on this island.  North and South.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> The movement is now well-placed to grow in significance and to add enormously to the range of services is provides to its members. This will provide strong competition for the privately owned for-profit credit institutions in particular segments of financial services. This is all for the good of our society and economy.</P>
    <P>However, if all of this is to happen, the legal framework, the supervisory and regularity regime within which the movement operates will need significant updating.  That is the purpose of the Bill now in preparation.  I see this Bill as a radical measure.  It will consolidate and update legislation, and it will provide the framework for the expansion of the credit unions into new areas of service to their members.  That is why I attach such high priority to the completion of the drafting of the Bill and I look forward to introducing the Bill to this House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 574, 575, 576 and 605 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies are already aware of my serious concerns regarding the recent announcement of the pending closures of the Semperit tyre factory at Ballyfermot, the Tambrands factory in Tipperary Town and the Schiesser plant at Carrick-on-Suir.  I have asked IDA Ireland and the other development <Col N="412" /> agencies to make intensive and determined efforts to find replacement industries for these locations.</P>
    <P>As regards Semperit, the priority is to find a buyer for the plant and IDA Ireland is currently pursuing a programme of meetings with potential buyers. Meetings have been arranged with a number of potential buyers this week and it is hoped that site visits will be undertaken by some of these companies in the near future.  Some of the companies have visited the plant already.</P>
    <P>I have taken a personal interest in Semperit for the past six months and I am currently in the process of meeting with a possible potential buyer for the plant in the United States.  I had talks with both management and unions on the closure of the plant and the possibility of finding a buyer.  I consider that the approach which we are pursuing of trying to find a suitable buyer for the plant is the best possible option.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Tambrands and Schiesser plants, I have established an inter-agency enterprise group to address urgently the problems arising from their pending closure and the need to attract replacement industries to Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir.  I referred specifically to the establishment of this group when I recently met a delegation from County Tipperary, comprising public representatives, trade union and local interests. I assured the delegation these locations would receive top priority in the ongoing drive to attract new inward investment.</P>
    <P>The inter agency group is being chaired by IDA Ireland's regional director for the area.  Forbairt, Shannon Development, FÁS and the South Tipperary county enterprise board are also represented in the group.  It will focus on ensuring that the Tambrands and Schiesser plants can be made available for alternative investment purposes; assisting employees with training and retraining opportunities, and assisting workers who wish to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in their own right.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of this group took place on 20 September 1996 when a <Col N="413" /> strategy was formulated to promote both locations to potential investors and identify new training needs, outplacement and other job opportunities.  The group will liaise closely with unions, workers, public representatives and local interests such as the Chamber of Commerce, to ensure that every opportunity can be exploited to the maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>The key ingredients to find replacement industry is the availability of a quality workforce with a proven track record and the availability of quality factory space at competitive rates. Ballyfermot, Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir are well suited in these respects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I have indicated in response to recent representations I can assure the Deputy that I am concious this ia a difficult time for Irish timber processors.  Expansion of production capacity over a number of years has resulted in an overcapacity situation in the sawmilling industry putting pressure on limited supplies of logs and forcing prices up.</P>
      <P>The question of log supply and pricing has been the subject of discussions between all the parties concerned and a framework for a new timber sales regime has been drawn up to address the issue.  This framework was agreed between Coillte and the Irish Timber Council in March 1996.  Since then, various meetings have taken place to have the new system agreed by the end of 1996.  I understand that satisfactory progress is being made in this regard.</P>
      <P>The current weakness in the price of sawn timber is a real difficulty for the sawmilling sector throughout Europe. This has been caused by an over supply from Scandinavia and slack demand in the European construction industry resulting in increased competition in the marketplace and falling prices.</P>
      <P>As announced by the Minister for Tourism and Trade in Dáil Éireann on 25 July 1996, Bord Tráchtála has established a sterling market task force to help companies with a substantial UK dependency.  I have asked that the difficulties being experienced by the sawmilling sector be taken into account by the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decline in the price of sawmill residues has been provoked by a fall in the international market for paper pulp. This fall has resulted in a sympathetic decline in the market for sawmill residues, creating a problem for Irish producers who have traditionally exported their residues.  I have, however, been advised by Forbairt that they anticipate there will be a significant improvement in residue prices in the medium term. <Col N="415" /> The recently opened Louisiana Pacific Coillte oriented strand board plant at Bellview near Waterford is increasing its consumption of pulpwood and the Masonite door skin plant in County Leitrim will commence production next year.  Both of these plants will create significant new markets for Irish pulpwood and sawmill residues.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is also encouraging sawmilling companies to initiate new product development projects with a view to improving the prospects for the sector and to put the industry on a secure growth path into the next decade.  Grant assistance is available for research and development projects and for feasibility studies to explore new product and new market opportunities.  I have asked Forbairt to continue its efforts in this regard.  The Deputies may be assured that I will keep developments in the industry under review.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of recent reports concerning possible increases in motor insurance premia by individual insurance companies.  The Deputy may recall that reductions in motor insurance premia were announced by certain Irish insurers in 1995 and 1996 on the basis of improved underwriting performance.  The escalation of road accidents in the course of 1996 has caused the motor insurance industry to anticipate a rise in the number and cost of claims and to make provision to meet this rising cost by increasing premia.</P>

      <P>Article 6 of the directive provides that the average weekly working time of employees should not exceed 48 hours. The directive allows for weekly working hours to be averaged over a period four months or, in particular circumstances, over a period of 12 months by agreement between the two sides of industry.

The projected take up rate for the programme is set at between 1,200 and 1,500 before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The standards-based apprenticeship system which is operated by FÁS was introduced in September 1993, and includes 25 trades at present.  The duration of an apprenticeship is now four years, approximately, and there are seven phases in all &mdash; four on-the-job with the employer and three off-the-job in a FÁS training centre or an educational college.  I understand there are currently 4,994 apprentices in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the industrial action which took place in FÁS from late 1995 to March 1996, delays have occurred in calling apprentices for their phase 2 training courses in the FÁS training centres.  I am informed by FÁS that there are 1,373 apprentices who have completed their first phase of training with an employer and are awaiting a call from FÁS to enter the second phase of off-the-job training.  I believe the situation which arose primarily as a result of the industrial action has been exacerbated by restricted capacity in training centres for some trades such as cabinet maker, wood machinist, construction plant fitter, etc., coupled with increased recruitment in these trades during the last year.  The fact that in some trades employers, for example, those of agricultural mechanic and the so called &ldquo;wet trades&rdquo;, find it difficult to release apprentices to the off-the-job phase at <Col N="422" /> certain times of the year and the significant increase in apprenticeship in the larger trades such as electrician, carpenter-joiner and metal fabricator, have combined to create an unsatisfactory situation in the apprenticeship area at present.</P>
    <P>FÁS has advised me that it is making strenuous efforts to increase apprenticeship capacity where possible, but is constrained by a number of factors, particularly the need to ensure that, so far as possible, major expenditure is not incurred for what is likely to be a temporary situation.  I am advised by FÁS that it has provided an additional 48 apprenticeship places, with a further 150 extra places planned for the near future. FÁS is also negotiating with SIPTU on the employment of temporary instructors to help alleviate the current difficulty. However, negotiations to date have not been fruitful and the matter is scheduled for a hearing of the Labour Court today.</P>
    <P>FÁS is confident that the action taken, combined with the other initiatives planned should enable them to make significant inroads into the backlog in the near future.</P>

    <P>However, the Deputy may be referring to the fact that lone parents are allowed retain a portion of their social welfare entitlement on a means tested basis by the Department of Social Welfare, when they participate in CE or obtain mainstream employment.  This of course is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The number of lone parents on CE at the end of August 1996 was 5,087 and represents 13 per cent of the total number of participants as against 4 per cent at the end of 1994.  The main reasons for the growth in the number of lone parents on CE would be as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash; lone parents only became eligible for participation in CE in April 1994.</P>
    <P>&mdash; There has been a significant rise in the number of lone parents between April 1994 and August 1996.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Sponsors such as lone parents network groups etc. have become more successful with the passage of time in putting together projects suitable for take-up by lone <Col N="427" /> parents, many of which would incorporate a child minding facility.</P>

      <P>A number of programmes and initiatives operated by the industrial development agencies, my Department and the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs and Environment are designed to improve the infrastructure of the Border area and to attract and encourage an increase in employment in overseas and indigenous industry in the region.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland have developed the following programme for the Border region:</P>
      <P>&mdash; The provision of a private finance factory in Dundalk.  It is expected that planning permission will be applied for shortly for a 28,000 square foot unit in Finnabair Industrial Park. This unit will be available for occupation in mid-1997.</P>
      <P>&mdash; A range of options is being considered in conjunction with the local authority to provide a 50 acre land bank in the Drogheda area.  To date the combined efforts of the local authority and IDA Ireland have not resulted in the identification of property which can be purchased at realistic and competitive prices. This task is ongoing.</P>

    <P>&mdash; Agreement has been reached between a Sligo based private developer, Rhodaville Ltd., and IDA Ireland for the provision of a 20,000 square foot advance factory at Finisklin Industrial Estate, Sligo.  The developer has recently applied for planning permission.  These premises on completion will be marketed by IDA Ireland to enhance the attractiveness of the area to potential mobile investors. Additional land at Finisklin Industrial Estate, Sligo is being purchased and planning permission is being sought.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Agreement has recently been reached with Donegal County Council on the provision of land at Lisnennan, Letterkenny and together IDA Ireland and the county council propose to develop a Business Park in Letterkenny to assist County Donegal in competing for inward investment in manufacturing and international services.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that IDA Ireland will seek a private developer to provide an advance factory of 20,000 square feet on this site as an initial development.  When completed, IDA Ireland will actively market this building to suitable overseas clients</P>
    <P>Forbairt is actively promoting its total range of programmes and initiatives in the Border region and has been working closely with firms in the region with a view to increasing their sales and employment levels.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Washington Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland, Forbairt has assisted the US <Col N="429" /> Embassy in arranging a programme for 16 US companies to visit Northern Ireland and the Border region.  Approximately 78 appointments were arranged for companies in the Border counties and other parts of Ireland.  Negotiations on new business partnerships have take place as a result and are still ongoing.</P>
    <P>A number of pan Atlantic partnership programmes have been funded through the US Department of Commerce, the International Fund for Ireland and Forbairt with the objective of helping Irish firms, particularly in the Border counties, to grow through technology acquisition and-or strategic alliance with US partners.</P>
    <P>The programmes, which include the Forbairt-IFI North American Partnership Programme, the Forbairt Small Business Administration (US) Partnership Programme and the American Management and Business Internship Programme (AMBIT) were all launched during 1995.  I anticipate that they will contribute to the growth of participating companies from the Border region in the medium to long-term. Under the North American Partnership, the first phase of which was launched in April 1995, it is expected that 900 new high tech jobs will be created from the nine partnerships already formed.  It is anticipated that 10 companies per annum from the Border counties will participate in the AMBIT programme over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards from the six Border counties have approved 682 projects worth £6 million in grants of which almost £3 million was drawn down by the end of 1995.  A further 81 projects worth £648,526 in grants were approved to July 1996.</P>
    <P>In addition to its Structural Funds support for activities outlined above, the EU also supports the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme. Out of a total of £96 million available to Irish Border counties, £36 million has been specifically earmarked for the Department of Environment to part fund the provision-improvement of roads and water and sewage works.  The <Col N="430" /> improvement of such basic infrastructure is a prerequisite for the expansion of industrial development in the Border counties as industrialists are most likely to choose to locate in areas where good infrastructural facilities exist.</P>
    <P>Additional funds have also been made available under the EU programme for peace and reconciliation for the provision of suitable industrial infrastructure. The administration of these funds is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I would refer the Deputy to the response given to a parliamentary question from Deputy O'Hanlon by the Minister for Finance on 21 May in this respect.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am aware that the International Fund for Ireland has contributed to the provision of community and workspace in the Border region. Administration of these funds is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>Grants to voluntary/community bodies who sponsor community employment in respect of overhead costs are paid on a sliding scale based on the number of participants in an individual project.  Such grants, however, are not intended to cover total costs but rather a portion of same with the balance being raised locally.  The reasoning behind this policy <Col N="431" /> is that sponsors of projects obtain valuable secondary benefits from sponsoring a project and as such it is felt that they should make some contribution from their own resources towards the cost of the project.</P>

      <P>The Forfás report <i>Job Losses Arising from Closures and Contractions</i> examines data in this regard over the period 1991 to 1995. Among the report's key findings is the decline of company closures and contractions in the period and the fact that contractions were more than twice as significant than closures as explanations for permanent job losses.  The report points out, moreover, that this is in line with the present experience of industry across Europe and is due to competitive responses &mdash; increased productivity, rationalisation and market responses &mdash; on the one hand, and competitive difficulties &mdash; inability to compete with low cost producers, difficulties in raising finance, management deficiencies and the <Col N="433" /> weakness of sterling &mdash; on the other hand.</P>
      <P>Traditional industrial sectors, such as clothing and footwear, and the manufacturer of computer peripherals are the most exposed in terms of competitive difficulties and the report offers no immediately actionable solutions to the global problems in those areas. However, a number of initiatives under the industrial development programme, the human resources programme and the small business programme will contribute to significant change in the capability of Irish industry to adjust to new market realities, compete more vigorously on world markets, raise the necessary finance and manage the process of industrial change more effectively. Moreover, I will be publishing a major statement on enterprise strategy before the end of the year which will set out, in particular, the future shape and direction of policy and action on the needs of Irish indigenous industry.  Part of the focus of the new approach will be closer attention by Forbairt to the adjustment needs of firms facing the most intense competition and the consolidation of assistance around key problems of competitiveness such as those identified in the Forfás report.</P>

      <P>In the time available the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to give a detailed account of the extent to which each and every recommendation in the nine NESF reports published to date has been implemented or addressed.  However, I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is given to all reports produced by the Forum, particularly those which address issues of direct concern <Col N="434" /> to my Department.  The analysis and recommendations offered by the Forum obviously have an influence on our on-going strategy in the areas of promoting employment, labour market operation. service sector development etc.</P>
      <P>However, there have been a number of significant developments to which I should draw the Deputy's attention. The Forum's report on <i>Ending Long-Term Unemployment,</i> together with the report of the <i>Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment</i> have had a key influence on my Department's recently published strategy paper on the labour market, <i>Growing and Sharing our Employment.</i>  In particular, the strategy paper, which has full employment over time as its over-riding goal, adopted and built on the Forum's recommended objectives of employment opportunities for all who want them and the elimination of long-term unemployment.  The strategies to improve employment growth and the affirmative action strategy for improved access to jobs set out in the strategy paper are consistent with and reflect the Forum's recommendations.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently finalising proposals in the area of work sharing which I will be bringing to Cabinet shortly.  These proposals draw from and develop on the work of the Forum in their ninth report on the <i>Jobs Potential of Work Sharing.</i></P>
      <P>I plan to publish a services policy statement shortly which will take into account the NESF recommendations on the development of the services sector. This policy document is currently being finalised within my Department in consultation with the industrial development agencies.</P>
      <P>The local employment service, which has its origins in NESF Report No. 4, on <i>Ending Long-term Unemployment</i>, is now under way in fourteen key areas. Consideration is being given to extending the service to other areas on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will of course, be aware that in its first periodic report, No. 8 &mdash; May 1995, the Forum assessed <Col N="435" /> the impact of the main recommendations contained in their first five reports and declared, <i>inter alia,</i> that they were pleased with the Government's responses to date to their recommendations.</P>

      <P Just="Center">Imported Magazine Prices.</P>
      <P>27.  Mrs. O'Rourke asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the outcome of his meeting with the magazine distributors, Newspread and Easons; the measures, if any, he now proposes to take to rectify the current overcharging for magazines, books and compact discs imported from Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [9939/96]</P>
      <P>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton): Previous statements by me in this House and in particular my reply to a relevant question on 17 April 1996 (columns 119-122) made it clear that the investigation recently undertaken by the Director of Consumer Affairs related solely to the prices of magazines imported from the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology published the report of the director on 22 April.  The principal findings of the report was that: 1.  The importation and distribution of magazines in Ireland are controlled by Easons and Newspread. 2.  The prices of UK magazines are different to most other imported goods of UK origin because the sterling price is readily visible to Irish consumers. 3.  Both importers operate a system of forward buying of sterling four times a year at or about the same time.  4.  As magazines are subject to value added tax at the rate of 21 per cent in Ireland, whereas they are zero rated in the UK, the Irish cover price will always exceed the indicated UK price, unless there is to be an extraordinary depreciation of sterling <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Irish pound. 5.  Whilst the benefit of the Irish pound's appreciation <Col N="437" /> against sterling has been passed onto consumers, it was not possible to establish, in the time available, the speed at which the reluctantly favourable price reductions occurred. 6. In order to cover the costs associated with distribution throughout Ireland, the importers take a margin, additional to the normal importers' margin, known as an &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; which was agreed with the National Prices Commission in 1983 at 5 per cent and is now almost 10 per cent. 7.  The most disturbing aspect of the complex pricing arrangements operated by the importers derive from the practice of distributing ready reckoners to newsagents which give the same Irish retail price for the same UK cover price, a situation the director comments could not happen by accident.</P>
    <P>Thus in the director's view the matter justifies an investigation by the Director of Competition Enforcement to be appointed under the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology felt it important that the wholesalers and retailers should be given the opportunity to offer their views on the director's findings.  Accordingly the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology discussed the findings of the director's report with representatives of Newspread on 3 May 1996, Easons on 10 May 1996, and National Federation of Retail Newsagents on 14 May 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister also plans to hold discussions with the Irish Retail Newsagents Associatioin on 20 May 1996.</P>
    <P>Both Easons and Newspread contended that, in addition to the imposition of VAT at 21 per cent here compared with zero in the UK, magazine prices were more expensive here because of the costly nationwide distribution system arising from the large number of small newsagents, the population spread and density.  In some instances, they say that both supply the same shops with same magazines. They emphasised that their aim was to achieve price uniformity, a situation which is common in other European countries.  The issue of the ready reckoner facilitated the achievement of price uniformity.  They also stated that they compete aggressively against each other in the efficiency and nature of service provided to retailers, including financial arrangements for magazine returns.  Each of them in their turn, claimed that their monetary margin were declining in recent years and that the benefit of the appreciation of the pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling was being passed onto consumers.</P>
    <P>For their part the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, referred to the imposition by the importers of a weekly service charge which has seriously eroded their margins and were not being reflected in increased magazine prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister is yet to be satisfied that the present distribution and pricing arrangements serve the best interests of consumers. <Col N="438" /> However, since the Minister has not yet concluded the round of discussions with the interested parties, if would be inappropriate to indicate at this stage what further action will be taken.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, price control on and the associated investigations of petroleum products were discontinued in 1991.  In the meantime, the objective and thrust of public policy have been to promote fair and increased competition in all sectors of the economy.  The Competition Acts 1991-96 outlaw concerted practices, such as price-fixing, and the abuse of a dominant position which could impact adversely on the price and supply of goods.</P>
      <P>In order to give further impetus to competition policy, the process of appointing a Director of Enforcement of Competition, as provided for in the 1996 Act, is currently in train.</P>
      <P>With regard to the display of motor fuel prices, I intend to amend the Retail Prices (Petrol) Display Order, 1986. dealing with the display of actual prices of motor fuels and to make a new Order under section 11 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 dealing with advertisements relating to a reduction in the price of motor fuels.  I am consulting the Director of Consumer Affairs on the proposed Orders and on the more rigorous enforcement of the Orders.</P>
      <P>Before finally making the Orders, I intend consulting Motor Fuel Distributors Ltd, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the Automobile Association and the Consumers' Association of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 609 and 632 together.</P>
      <P>The hardship being experienced by the beef producers at present is a result of the BSE crisis which arose last March following the announcement in the House of Commons of a possible link between BSE disease and the human disease CJD.  This announcement led to an immediate and dramatic fall in consumption across Europe and difficulties in some markets in third countries. Cattle prices in all member states, including Ireland, have fallen as a result of these developments in spite of the introduction of emergency intervention in early April and the purchasing of substantial quantities of beef into intervention since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> I am satisfied that my efforts and the actions taken by the European Union have helped to stabilise produce price and to alleviate the difficulties being experienced by producers as a result of the crisis.  Apart from the emergency intervention measures to which I have referred, the European Union adopted a BSE compensation package worth 850 MECU in June for the producers for income losses incurred as a result of the crisis.  The package, which was worth £70 million to Irish producers, provides for a top-up of £22.40 million in the suckler cow premium and £15.08 in the special beef premium.  In addition, the package includes a special allocation of £13.3 million to compensate those producers who were most seriously affected by the crisis.  I have decided to use this additional package to compensate producers who sold (i) steers or bulls for slaughter or for live export to third countries between 25 March and 9 June and (ii) heifers for slaughter between 25 March and 29 June.  Payment of this package will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that, in the context of the agreement on the compensation package, I succeeded in securing important amendments to the deseasonalisation premium in order to guarantee its application in Ireland in 1997.  This premium is worth some £16 million to Ireland and will make a valuable contribution to producers' incomes in 1997.</P>
    <P>Apart from these measures, I have recently secured amendments to the intervention system in order to permit heavy carcases to be sold into intervention and to provide for an increase in the processors' margin on sales of beef into intervention.  In addition, I am pursuing the possibility of further compensation to be made available for producers who have suffered income losses as a result of the crisis.  I am also pursuing with the Commission the possibility of a vigorous EU wide promotion campaign in order to restore consumer confidence in beef, and, thereby, bring about an increase in beef consumption.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of effort has been devoted to protecting our position <Col N="441" /> in third country markets.  The diplomatic service and Bord Bia have been fully involved and I have visited a number of markets as well as having direct contact at ministerial level.</P>

      <P>The sale of timber is a matter for Coillte Teoranta in the context of its legislative mandate, as contained in the 1988 Forestry Act and is not, therefore, one in which it would be appropriate for me to intervene.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Irish sawmilling sector in general is experiencing difficulty at present in the light of an adverse international market situation for pulpwood, residues, chips and sawdust. Intake of these sawmilling products by the traditional users in the panel board sector has fallen, which in addition to reduced prices, is having an adverse impact on sawmillers' returns.</P>
      <P>All sawmills purchase their timber from Coillte through its tender system. The price derived from the tender process is to a large extent, therefore, set by sawmills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework for a new timber sales <Col N="444" /> regime has been agreed between Coillte Teoranta and the Irish Timber Council. This will be an auction-based, market-related, system which will improve transparency and avail of the opportunity offered by new technology.  Discussions between the parties on the detailed implementation of the new regime are under way and I understand that good progress is being made.  I continue to impress on both parties the importance which I attach to a speedy and successful conclusion to their deliberations. It is intended to have most, if not all, of the elements of the new regime in place by end-1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 619, 641 and 651 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the closure of pig slaughtering plants in the Border region.  The ceasing of operations has been on the basis of commercial decisions taken by management.</P>
      <P>Before the closures my Department had been in contact with management at two of the plants about deficiencies existing there.  Slaughtering plants must operate to the standards set down in EU regulations, and the two plants concerned fell short of these standards. They were not willing to invest the capital necessary to rectify the deficiencies, and so they decided to close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the other plant, management decided to cease operations, <Col N="448" /> citing the high cost of buying pigs as the main reasons for closure.  Forbairt have been involved with management at the plants with a view to a resumption of operations.  It is Forbairt's intention to actively pursue initiatives to bring viable processing capacity in the North-East region to a satisfactory level.  My Department is liaising with Forbairt and is monitoring the situation.</P>
    <P>Pig prices have risen substantially since the beginning of the year, and are now some 15 per cent higher than at this time last year.  National slaughtering capacity is under-utilised and is currently running at about 75 per cent of capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general conditions for designation of areas as less-favoured are laid down in Council Directive 75/268/EEC of 28 April 1975. The specific conditions relating to Ireland are set out in Council Directive 75/272/EEC of 28 April 1975, as <Col N="449" /> amended by Council Directive 85/350/EEC of 27 June 1985.</P>
      <P>Areas which satisfy the criteria as specified in the above Directives may be designated as less favoured.  These areas are classified as less severely handicapped, and farmers in the areas qualify for payments as laid down in various headage schemes.</P>
      <P>However, member states are authorised, under Article 7 of 75/268/EEC, to vary the conditions of headage schemes depending on the severity of the permanent natural handicap affecting farming activities.  Ireland has used this authority to classify certain areas as more severely handicapped, and farmers in these areas can qualify for higher payments. Additional categories of animals also attract payments in these areas.</P>
      <P>Between 1975 and 1985, areas for reclassification as more severely handicapped were generally identified by the poor nature of the land and the observed difficulties for farming.  All mountainous and peatland areas in the west were included, as were most of the higher mountainous areas in the midlands and east.  However, there were also areas of poor quality land which did not fit into these categories, so for the Fourth Review of disadvantaged areas (1989-1991), specific criteria were established to aid in identifying these areas. The criteria which applied in 1989-91 were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; The income should be no higher than 40 per cent of the national average, compared with 80 per cent for less severely handicapped areas;</P>
      <P>&mdash; The percentage of the workforce engaged in agriculture should be at least 40 per cent of the total workforce, compared with 30 per cent in less severely handicapped areas;</P>
      <P>&mdash; The land quality index should indicate the poor nature of the land;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" />&mdash; The proposed areas must be contiguous to the existing or proposed more severely handicapped area boundary.</P>
    <P>For the Fifth Review (1992-1995), it was agreed that the above conditions would be modified, as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; Income of an area must not exceed 60 per cent of the National Average Income;</P>
    <P>&mdash; Land Quality must not exceed 4 on the land assessment scale of 0 to 9.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the area must form a homogenous block and be contiguous to an existing more severely handicapped area OR if not contiguous, form a homogenous block of at least 15,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that while a member state can set the criteria by which areas are identified as suffering a higher degree of handicap than others, EU Commission approval is required before these areas can be reclassified.  The Commission must be satisfied that these criteria accurately identify such areas, and that the areas meet the criteria, before they will approve requests for reclassification.</P>

      <P>The remaining three scheduled meetings of the Council of Agriculture Ministers during the Irish Presidency which I shall be chairing, will take place in Luxembourg (October) and Brussels (November and December).  I also plan to attend, as President of the Agriculture Council, the World Food Summit in Rome in November.  Of course, my duties as President of the Council may require <Col N="456" /> me to undertake other visits, as yet unplanned, particularly to other member states' capitals.  The cost of each visit will depend on factors which are unknown at this stage, such as the duration and the number of officials attending.</P>

      <P>It is normal practice for the member state holding the Presidency of the European Union to hold an informal meeting of the Agriculture Council on its territory.  During the current Irish Presidency, this meeting and associated programme took place in Killarney from 22-25 September 1996.  The programme included a presentation on the Irish food industry and an information visit to a farm.  Hospitality was provided mainly in Killarney but also in other locations in County Kerry during the visit.  A formal meeting of the Special Committee on Agriculture and associated programme also took place over the same period.  The total number involved including accompanying guests was 188.</P>
      <P>County Kerry was chosen as the venue for the programme because it allowed the difficulties of farming in less-favoured agricultural areas to be demonstrated to our visitors and because of the availability of a local airport and of adequately sized hotel accommodation and the beauty of the landscape.</P>

      <P>A proposal for reclassification of areas to a new category of extremely disadvantaged will shortly be submitted to the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The criteria used for the selection of areas include the presence of a high proportion of extremely poor land which could be described as rough grazing land, and the presence of excessive climatic conditions such as higher levels of rainfall and windspeed than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The selection of the specific areas was facilitated by the use of satellite imagery, by which the boundaries of rough grazing land can be clearly defined.</P>
      <P>The Commission will need time to examine the proposal before commencing the approval procedures, but I would expect that the areas will be announced in time for the 1997 headage schemes.</P>
      <P>A sum of approximately £3 million will be available to fund increases in payments to farmers in the new areas for each year from 1997 to 1999, after which the total amount for compensatory allowances falls to be renegotiated.</P>
      <P>I cannot comment on specific areas which may or may not be in the proposal in advance of approval by the Commission.</P>

      <P>Payment of the special top-up in respect of the 1995 ewe premium as agreed in principle at the EU Council meeting in December 1995 and formally adopted by the Council in late July last commenced on 9 August 1996.  With a few exceptions all payments that have so far issued were made on that date.</P>
      <P>To date almost £5.8 million has been paid to over 9,000 farmers which represents 98 per cent of all applicants in the non-disadvantaged areas.  Those cases still unpaid are the subject of ongoing queries and as these are resolved payments will issue without delay where appropriate.</P>

    <P>I have not given an undertaking under section 13 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, to grant a State mining lease over any of the areas in question and no such undertaking has <Col N="476" /> been sought from me.  I might add that it would be premature to give such an undertaking having regard to the fact that, while the existence of mineralisation has been confirmed, a considerable amount of work remains to be done to confirm its extent and the commercial viability of mining it.</P>
    <P>If the holders of the prospecting licences continue to comply with the terms of their licence and have good grounds to make application to me for a State mining lease in due course, I would of course consider their application. No mining could proceed in any of the areas in question until after the necessary planning permission, Environmental Protection Agency licence and State mining lease had been granted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add, however, that as regards a co-operation agreement between Euratom and third countries, Ireland's general position is to give priority to improvements in nuclear safety and liability, radiation protection and the strengthening of the effectiveness and the efficiency of arrangements to prevent proliferation in the use of <Col N="477" /> nuclear weapons, i.e. the safeguards system. The eventual mandate given to the Commission in respect of negotiations of this nature would normally strike an appropriate balance between the divergent views of EU member states in the nuclear industry.</P>

      <P>Bord na Móna is a statutory corporation established under the Turf Development Act, 1946 with a duty to develop and market peat and peat products.  While the board is the biggest single owner of bogs in Ireland, it owns no more than 9 per cent of the total peatland in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early 1980s, the then Government recognised the need for the development of the private peat sector. A private bog development grant <Col N="478" /> scheme was introduced under the Turf Development Act, 1981 to encourage the development of the sector through the provision of grant aid towards the development of privately owned bogs. Although the scheme was terminated in 1987, grant aid continued to be paid through to 1995 in respect of works which had been approved but had not been completed at the time of termination of the scheme.  During this period over £8 million was paid by my Department in grant-aid to private peat producers. The scheme proved to be a success as private peat production increased to approximately 1.5 million tonnes per annum from a previous low base.  The scheme has achieved its objectives and there are no plans to reintroduce a new scheme.</P>
    <P>The proposed equity injection into Bord na Mona will not disadvantage private peat producers.  The injection will have a cash-neutral effect on Bord na Mona as it will be accompanied by a substantial reduction in the price of milled peat sold to ESB.</P>

      <P>I am kept informed and advised on relevant and substantive issues relating to earthquake potential and risk in Ireland and Britain by the Geological Survey of Ireland, a division of my Department.</P>
      <P>The issue of seismic (earthquake) hazard has been fully taken into account, wherever relevant, in all representations regarding British nuclear installations, both existing facilities and the proposed underground radioactive waste storage facility in Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the recent articles in <Col N="480" /> the Irish media, particularly the article in the Irish edition of the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 15 September 1996 on which others were apparently based.  The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) has been in contact both with the British Geological Survey (BGS) and Professor Jacob of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies who are referred to in the article.</P>
    <P>The GSI has advised me that the article is very speculative, alarmist, inaccurate and technically unsound.  The references to Ireland are particularly misleading.</P>
    <P>The BGS has prepared a report on seismic risk in the UK in relation to building regulations but it has not been published and is not officially in the public domain.  So there is no new published report or assessment by BGS as the wording and timing of the <i>Sunday Times</i> article would imply.</P>
    <P>Whereas earthquake prediction is inherently difficult, particularly over long time spans, seismicity in Britain and Ireland is continuously monitored and expertly assessed and prudent allowance for seismic hazard is taken into account in building and other construction regulations, including UK nuclear installations.  Although the <i>Sunday Times</i> article seeks to convey that the British Geological Survey's assessment of earthquake risk in the UK and Ireland is substantially worse than was previously thought, in fact, the reverse is true.  The present assessment is lower than it used to be.</P>

      <P>At the general level, the obligation to comply <Col N="483" /> with best international practice in relation to emissions of electromagnetic radiation from communications masts is included in licences issued by me to the operators.</P>
      <P>This best practice is laid down by the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) in their 1988 guidelines. These guidelines were recently endorsed in a review of all relevant research on the subject by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), an international and well respected group of experts in the area of non-ionising radiation.  The review states that there is no substantive evidence that adverse health effects can occur in people exposed to levels of non-ionising radiation at or below those energy levels considered to be safely tolerated 24 hours a day.  Compliance with these guidelines ensures that no member of the public is exposed to unacceptable levels of emissions and independent tests carried out at a number of locations show that the levels in this country are well within the guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation which will be established following the enactment of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996 will be responsible for arranging further monitoring of emissions in order to ensure compliance with the guidelines.</P>
      <P>I have no function at the planning stage in relation to particular masts, including the one mentioned by the Deputy.  This is a matter for decision by the local planning authority and, on appeal, An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>The introduction of improvements in the accessibility of transport services is essentially a matter for transport providers and others directly involved in the transport chain rather than for my Department.  The transport industry is aware that it is my policy that it should seek to achieve the highest degree of accessibility possible within available resources.  An Inter-Departmental Transport Accessibility Committee chaired by my Department exists to facilitate the implementation of that policy, and I have given the House an indication of progress to date on a number of occasions, most recently in my Question No. 40 on 28 May 1996.</P>

    <P>Additional costs are also being incurred by the Department of Defence during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the area of security and in the use of an air taxi service to meet additional <Col N="485" /> transport requirements of Ministers during the period.  The cost of the air taxi service will be dependent on the number of flying hours involved.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the question of the inclusion of Military Service Allowances (MSA) in Defence Forces' pensions.</P>
      <P>In its report dated 31 July 1990, the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission) recommended that MSA should be made pensionable.  On foot of this recommendations, an addition to Defence Forces' service pensions in respect of MSA was introduced and applies, subject to certain conditions, to personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, i.e. the day following publication of the Gleeson report.</P>
      <P>MSA has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified retired personnel.  However, having regard to established superannuation practice in other areas of the public service and the cost involved I regret to say that the extension of the measure to personnel who retired prior to 1 August 1990 cannot be undertaken.</P>

    <P>The Fisheries Surveillance Programme provides for an EU contribution of 50 per cent (less National taxes) towards certain expenditure association with the protection of salmon stocks.  Three new fisheries protection vessels were acquired under the 1994 and 1995 programmes at a total cost of over almost £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism provides for total investment of almost £19 million in the development of the tourism angling product.  The main beneficiaries under this Measure include the Fisheries Boards, Angling Clubs, private fisheries owners, the Marine Institute, the Salmon Research Agency and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Measures of the INTERREG II Programme provide for total investment of £2.5 million in the protection, conservation and development of fisheries in the Border Region. The first project to be approved for funding under these Measures, the £1.7 million Erne Salmon Rehabilitation Programme, was announced within recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The table below shows the amount of money allocated to the Central Fisheries Board and each Regional Board in 1994 and 1995 under the Fisheries Surveillance Programme and the Tourism Angling Measure:</P>

      <P>The decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels established last year provided for the payment of premia to fishing vessel owners volunteering to decommission their boats.</P>
      <P>Many of the boats decommissioned under the scheme were mainly engaged in part-time fishing, predominantly during the summer months and would not, therefore, have offered their crews full time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of decommissioning, some fishermen may have to consider seeking alternative employment.  Under the PESCA Community Initiative, funding is also available to assist fishermen to respond to changes in the sector and to diversify into other activities.  Earlier this year I announced a further round of 45 PESCA projects representing total funding support of £2 million for alternative economic activities right around <Col N="502" /> the coast.  I will also continue to encourage the EU Commission to explore the scope for funding an early retirement scheme for fishermen which was agreed by the Council last year but for which there was no additional funding provided by the EU.</P>
    <P>It is the case that where redundancies occur, those fishermen who avail of the special social welfare insurance scheme will have unemployment cover as well as certain other benefits.  While the matter of social insurance provision for fishermen is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for social welfare I can advise that the Department of Social Welfare is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the position of fishermen under the Social Insurance system.  The review is being fully informed by discussions with my Department and by extensive consultations with the fishing industry.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the small catch allowed to Irish fishermen of all the main species of fish; if his attention has further been drawn to the proposal to decommission Irish fishing trawlers with a consequent loss of tonnage to the Irish fleet; the way in which this will effect the economy; if he will ensure that there are no further losses to the allowable catch to Irish fishermen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fish stock levels are assessed annually by EU and international fisheries scientists. On the basis of this advice the Commission draws up annual proposals for total allowable catches (TACs) for the various stocks for decision by the Council of Fisheries Ministers each December.  TACs are divided into national quotas allocated to member states in proportion to their relative historic catches prior to the introduction of the quota systems.  The case for an increase in those quota allocations to Ireland is longstanding and remains on the table within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.  In the overall context, however, of serious declines in EU fish stocks, the challenge of setting sustainable overall total allowable catches to allow stocks to build back up or even to prevent collapse has to be addressed together with the need to achieve a balance between fishing effort and fish resources through improved conservation and control and tackling global overcapacity in the European fleet.  The action required must be fully proportionate and fully effective.  My overall objective is to maximise fishing possibilities for Ireland while ensuring that conservation objectives are met and taking full account of the socio economic consequences for areas especially dependent on fishing.  I have stated on many occasions that the Commission's current proposals on fleet capacity cuts are not acceptable in so far as they apply to Ireland's specific situation. That remains my position and I am working to ensure that the longstanding EU acknowledgement of the special needs and position of the Irish fishing industry is fully reflected in fisheries policy instruments including fleet policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 678, 679 and 680 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> I announced on 2 August 1996 that the Government had approved the award of a contract to Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Ltd., for the provision of a marine emergency helicopter including search and rescue based at Shannon Airport.  The contract will commence on 1 January 1997, on the expiry of the existing contract with Irish Helicopters Ltd., and will be for a minimum period of two and a half years with an option to extend for up to five years.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the contract a fully equipped Sikorsky S61N helicopter incorporating an auto-hover system must be operational before 28 February 1997.  In the interim the service will be provided by a helicopter without an auto-hover system but otherwise fully equipped for 24 hour search and rescue operations with effect from 1 January 1997.</P>
    <P>The contract helicopter will be fitted with the SN501 auto-hover system whereas the current contract helicopter is fitted with the LN400/450 version.</P>
    <P>The contractor is obliged to comply with the regulatory requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>Helicopters are just one of a range of resources available for marine search and rescue purposes.  In co-ordinating rescues at sea and along the shore the Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of my Department draws on many declared resources including the IMES Coastal Units, the Community Inshore Rescue Service units, the many purpose-built lifeboats operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the light load carrying air corps helicopters based at Baldonnel and Finner and the medium load carrying helicopter based at Shannon.  I must add that there has been a significant upgrading of marine search and rescue facilities and the marine communications network under the direction of IMES since it was established in 1991.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to host any collective meetings or dinner functions in Ireland for EU Ministers during Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  I hosted a dinner function on 23 September in connection with an EU/G7 countries conference on MARIS (Maritime Information Society initiative) co-sponsored by the Marine Institute and the European Commission in Dublin on 24 September.  I have had a series of bilateral meetings with Ministers from other member states at my offices in Dublin and in EU capitals. Further such bilateral meetings will take place in order to progress Presidency business.</P>
