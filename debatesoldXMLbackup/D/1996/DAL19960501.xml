      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to forward to the Fianna Fáil Party the composition and the terms of reference of the action group to deal with the jobs crisis in Tallaght arising from the proposed closure of Packard.  I assume it is available as there will be as a meeting of the action group later today.  May I ask the Taoiseach also if an interdepartmental group, which was part of an early warning system for industries facing difficulties, is still in existence and if it still meets monthly as it did for several years?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be happy to furnish the information about the composition of the task force to both Opposition parties.  So far as the other matter is concerned, there is an ongoing mechanism for monitoring the difficulties of firms.  The problem in this case did not relate to advance warning, it is related to other problems inherent in the marketplace. It is important that we should be realistic about what actually happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I be misunderstood, I said I did not believe it was relevant to Tallaght but the early warning system has worked well for industries.  It was set up ten years ago or more.  Companies should remember to report to that group.  In this instance, if the management had done what was expected of it by the political system, then it would have been a relevant committee.  I am saying this in the context of industries generally.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware I have been supportive of the efforts of the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputies Richard Bruton and Rabbitte, in relation to Packard Electric.  I appeal to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, not to falsely raise the hopes of the Packard workers that the plant can be saved.  While I welcome the task force, it is not sufficient. I would like to see a greater input from the private sector into the membership of that task force.  I call on the Taoiseach to re-examine the membership of the task force with a view to extending it.  I have some suggestions if the Ministers wish to talk to me about it.</P>

      <P>There are other difficulties in the constituency in relation to jobs at Airmotive, Baldonnel.  Given that this constituency has two seats at the Cabinet table we need a more thorough response from the Government than merely a task force.  In particular, we need to know what the Government intends to do to change our anti-work <Col N="1708" /> tax system which is contributing to many of the problems in industry.</P>

It is a sad reflection on our society that the elderly in my area are placed in this position.</P>

      <P>My approach to amendments Nos. 3, 5, and 6 to 11, inclusive, is similar to my approach to amendment No. 1.

I do not intend to press it to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is in my name.  These amendments relate to the same area of activity, which is to increase the exemption limits as they currently apply.  There are several exemption limits within the tax code. From the point of view of simplicity and good administration I suggested to the Minister last year, and suggest again this year, that there should be a single exemption limit.  There is a total income exemption limit when one reaches the age of 65, another when one is 75 and there are some limits relating to people over 80 years of age.  In the interests of good administration I suggest that there should be a single exemption limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, many taxpayers in that age group are quite amazed to find that they have a tax liability post the end of the tax year.  This usually arises in the case of people with a small income, usually from a former employment, which, when added to the State social welfare old age or retirement pension, brings them into the tax net and over the exemption limit.  This would apply mainly to former employees of local authorities.  In my constituency there are also former employees of Bórd na Móna <Col N="1718" /> or the ESB.  Such people generally do not return their P60s at the end of the tax year and after a few years receive a balancing statement from the Inspector of Taxes which shows that they have some liability.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the Revenue Commissioners adopt a pragmatic and humane approach to those who may be in arrears through no fault of their own.  However, some people find it difficult to understand how their very low incomes when added to their pensions from their former employments and their few pounds invested in institutions can result in their having tax liabilities. A straightforward approach would be to introduce a single higher exemption limit.  I am well aware that increasing the exemption limits will affect Exchequer finances, but an overall exemption limit would limit that effect. While an exemption limit at age 65 would be considered a lower one, now that people are living longer a more realistic exemption limit at age 70 has much to commend it.  People who live to that age are entitled to whatever benefits accrued from longevity.  Given the type of lifestyle the Minister of Finance and I live, we will probably never see ripe old age.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy concludes and in case there is any doubt or ambiguity about the procedure at this time, while we are discussing amendment No. 1 let us not forget that amendments Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, are being debated.  I remind the Deputy of that because of the formality that applies.  Members may speak once only on Report Stage with the exception of the mover of the motion, in this case Deputy Molloy, who has the right of reply at the end of the debate.

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what the previous two speakers have said, particularly my party colleague.  I have had experience of this point lately.  My aunt's husband died suddenly.  When everything was sorted out my aunt, who is aged 72 or 73 years, was left with a pension and a small yearly income of approximately £1,500.  It was traumatic for her to discover that she was put into the tax net for a small tax liability.  I discussed the matter with officials in local Revenue office, but the bottom line was that she had a small tax liability.  As I said on many occasions, I do not believe we or the State want to penalise people of that age with a small income who have worked all their lives and made a substantial contribution to society.  It is not right that they should be in the tax net.  We must find some way to deal with the matter.  I appreciate that some people of that age may be very wealthy and have large incomes, but that is a separate matter.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is not the ambition of the State to use its long arm to take £2 or £3 a week from elderly people on low incomes.  The single rate at a higher level proposed by Deputy McCreevy <Col N="1720" /> would move some way towards addressing the problem.  The Minister should consider the amendment in that spirit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be understood that what we are talking about here is the taxation of income above certain thresholds, irrespective of age.  Deputy Cullen made the observation that some elderly people are quite wealthy and I do not believe he was making a case for those people.  We are dealing with exemption limits that take people out of the tax net irrespective of the source of their income or, in most cases, the age at which they derive or earn it or, in the case of retired people, whether it is derived from a pension.  It must be understood that the 1996 budget and the provisions of this Bill give exemption limits which in a full year cost will amount to £25 million.  The additional full year cost of what is proposed is approximately £6.7 million.  On budgetary provision grounds alone I am not prepared to agree to the amendments because we have made a fairly substantial and generous provision, but self-evidently one can never be generous enough.  Taking account of exemption limits, the relative increase takes most people above what they would derive from a normal social welfare income. People with the relatively small pensions to which Deputies McCreevy and Cullen referred should be outside the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A two-tiered exemption limit applies <Col N="1721" /> because the social welfare system provides for an additional increase in pension for people over the age of 80.  It is recognised that people over the age of 75 have associated costs.  That is recognised in the social welfare code and should be reflected in the income taxation system also.  I do not accept the arguments proposed by Deputy McCreevy and I am not prepared to accept amendment No. 1 or the ten other amendments being discussed with it.</P>

    <P>This amendment sets out a five year programme of tax reform under which rates would be progressively reduced so that there would be a basic rate of 20 per cent and higher rate of 35 per cent. It also proposes that the bands should be increased from £9,400 to £15,000 for a single person and to £30,000 for a married couple.  This proposal, which would cost £200 million-£300 million annually, could be funded by the application of firm discipline to public spending.  The present economic climate presents a unique opportunity to achieve major reforms in the tax system.  It would not have been possible eight years ago to implement a major tax reform programme without substantially reducing public expenditure, in other words implementing cutbacks.  When my party previously published policy documents on how to achieve tax reform, which included major reductions in the levels of personal income tax and bands, it identified areas where expenditure could be reduced and cutbacks implemented in order to achieve the level of savings necessary to reduce the rates of taxation.</P>
    <P>The huge burden of personal taxation has been identified on many occasions as a major obstacle to job creation.  As a result two separate societies are being developed, one of which is being guided towards dependency on the State for themselves and their children with very little prospects of moving into the real economy and sharing in its success.  This horrific prospect did not emerge over a short period; rather it had been signalled for a long time.  All the major studies and reports undertaken by the Government and private outside agencies have identified the necessity of implementing radical taxation reform so as to increase the opportunities for investment which will result in an increase in employment and give people a greater opportunity to play a part in the economy.  It is astonishing that the Government has made no major effort to deal with the calamitous situation in which more than 350,000 people find themselves.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity to reform the tax system through the control of public expenditure rather than having to go through the painful exercise of implementing cutbacks or eliminating services.  In recent days the Minister for Finance has sought to scare people about my party's proposals in regard to tax reform by stating that if we were in Government hospitals would be closed.  A senior member of the Government who tells such a lie is beneath contempt.  It is a distortion of the truth and I find is extraordinary that a man of his intelligence, ability and experience should seek to fool people about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am commenting on the <Col N="1729" /> amendment which sets out a five year programme of tax reform which can be achieved as a result of the levels of growth in the economy, an achievement that has been greatly helped by the continued massive European Union transfers to this country and which can reasonably be expected to continue after the current operational programme expires in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>While we have a unique opportunity to make this transfer, thus benefiting more people within our economy, the Government has refused to avail of it. The only opportunity open to my party to promote its implementation statutorily is through this Bill because, at any other time of the year, we would be deemed to be adding to public expenditure and ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>That is the basis on which my party's amendment has been tabled &mdash; to demonstrate that there is another way, that the discipline of having our figures included statutorily possibly constitutes the best manner in which these levels of changes in the taxation system can be achieved.  When in Government previously with Fianna Fáil, my party included targets in regard to taxation changes in its programme for Government. Had such proposals not been advanced, it is indeed doubtful that the reductions in personal income tax rates implemented within that period would have been attained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of discipline that will reap results which will benefit people generally.  The alternative is that this Government's high spending-high taxation policy will continue, with excuses being advanced that nothing can be done.  The growth of £2.2 billion in public expenditure between the years 1992 and 1995, over which the Minister and his predecessor presided, with inflation accounting for some £0.6 billion of that overall rate of growth, meant that this Government was afforded a unique opportunity to effect reductions in taxation. The Government had the opportunity to maintain State expenditure at a reasonable level <i>vis-à-vis</i> the prevailing <Col N="1730" /> rate of inflation, now at its lowest for a long time, but has not availed of it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could accept this amendment we would be on the road to major economic recovery, and people would eventually be given an opportunity of participating in our improved economic performance.  Its purpose is clear and was expounded by Deputy Michael McDowell in the course of a Private Members' motion last evening and in the course of our Committee Stage debate on this Bill.  We want to merely incorporate in statutory form what all the major economic commentators have been saying in recent years but whose comments have been totally ignored by successive Ministers for Finance since 1992 when tax reform ceased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach adopted in this amendment would be agreed by any prudent administration. It specifies appropriate levels of taxation over ensuing years.  However, in implementing any such approach one must also agree overall levels of public exenditure for the same period.</P>
      <P>In the past decade or so people have become sufficiently wise and realise there is a direct correlation between levels of taxation and public expenditure. They know that to reduce taxation levels, the Government must also reduce levels of public expenditure.  The crunch arises whenever a Minister for Finance attempts to put a ceiling on the levels of public expenditure to be incurred by other Government Departments, when those affected &mdash; more often than not including one's political supporters &mdash; begin to shout &ldquo;foul&rdquo;. Always the problem has been to endeavour to control public expenditure while simultaneously attempting to reduce taxation.</P>
      <P>In reply to parliamentary questions and in a speech last week, the Minister said he will go along with the idea of multi-annual budgeting, of a three-year type, which will allow him to plan tax reductions.  In the last couple of national agreements such tax reductions had been signalled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, signalled but not specified which, if one can agree multi-annual budgeting, is a logical step. Everybody wants public expenditure cuts but not effected on their doorstep.</P>
      <P>On how any Government and Minister for Finance should control public expenditure, I have had experience on the Opposition Benches over many years and was part of an Administration so that I was enabled to view the matter from both sides.  Irrespective of their best intentions, I have come to the conclusion that, any Government or Minister for Finance, finds controlling expenditure an impossible task.  At the beginning of the year the Department of Finance specifies what it considers to be appropriate levels of public expenditure. In July, the Minister for Finance issues a circular to all other Government Departments, informing them that they must maintain their current levels of expenditure in line with the preceding year's policy decisions.  The Minister and his departmental officials should not bother to issue such a circular as it is generally ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of a 2 per cent increase in public expenditure being agreed, each Government Department contends it must not be allocated an increase of less than that amount, otherwise its schemes will have to be abolished and, more importantly, its political head will appear stupid.  It has become almost a badge of honour for stupid political commentators to suggest a person is a great Minister because of his or her ability to wheedle 6 per cent out of the Minister for Finance whereas another Minister may have had to accept a reduction in his departmental allocation. All Ministers and their Departments fight their case on that basis. Rather than commenting that a Minister was good at reducing some departmental expenditure such a reduction will be used as a political stick with which to beat him for being weak.  Not only do <Col N="1732" /> politicians engage in such practice but so also do civil servants.</P>
    <P>Having perceived that practice from the outside and inside, I suggest the total public expenditure and finances of the preceding year should be aggregated. Some group, led by the Minister for Finance should early in the year agree on priorities in terms of Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister's multi-annual budgetary proposals are increased, say, between 2 and 4 per cent, it must be borne in mind that nobody representing the State will have begun from the wrong base.  As the Minister and others will agree, because any changes in our taxation system will have knock-on effects on 90 per cent of the myriad schemes of relief, concessions, exemptions and tax breaks the task is impossible. The same principle applies to controlling public expenditure.  If the Minister gets his way with multi-annual budgeting, representing some improvement, it will not work effectively unless my suggested approach is adopted. Experience has taught me that.  I was a Minister in two Departments but I did not adopt the approach of seeking the statutory increase and I got considerable brickbats for trying to control expenditure in a Department without much pushing from the Department of Finance.  I thought the Department of Finance was right about one of the Departments because expenditure could have been curtailed and spent more effectively.  Multi-annual budgeting will not work effectively unless that approach is taken.  Successive Ministers for Finance have the same intentions but it is most frustrating that even though a letter countersigned by the Taoiseach is usually sent out in the months of June and July, it is blindly ignored by Departments.  It is a waste of time and paper.  The only ones making money from it are the paper manufacturers because everyone ignores it.  It is taken seriously only by officials in the Department of Finance who believe in their innocence that others will give credence to it.  The document is often <Col N="1733" /> leaked to newspapers to show that the Minister for Finance is really getting tough.  It is a sort of plea from the Minister for Finance to Departments to control themselves but the problem is that each Department will go along on its own.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell proposes to set a tax rate for a number of years and the obverse is to set out the expenditure thresholds for a number of years as well.  Deputy McDowell has set out that in another document but as Deputy Molloy will know, having been in Government, unless some action is taken on the lines I suggest it will not work effectively.</P>
    <P>As I said last night during the debate on the Private Members' motion the bulk of Government spending is predetermined. The cost of servicing the national debt, £2,200 million, public service pay and pensions which come to nearly £5,000 million and gross social welfare expenditure which is in the region of £4,500 million, make up the bulk of Government expenditure.  Ministers for Finance spend all their time trying to skim £2 million, £4 million and £500,000 from here and there but an organisation in the private sector would start by cutting back on the largest item of expenditure.  There must be a realisation in those three areas.  Social Welfare payments are the demand-led schemes; for example if people get sick they will be paid their entitlement, the 800 workers in Tallaght who will be laid off will be entitled to unemployment benefit and they will be paid.  One does not know at the start of the year the exigencies that may arise but everyone will be paid.  That is predetermined expenditure which the Government can do nothing about.  The Government can do little about the cost of the national debt.  Who would suggest that we renege on the cost of servicing the national debt?  That is another area that we cannot do anything about.  However, the Minister for Finance does have control of public service pay and pensions because he is dealing with the employees of the organisation. <Col N="1734" /> In the private sector, employers make deals with the employees' trade unions. They know their cost base and their output so they know what they can afford. I have had consistent doubts about national wage agreements as they relate to the public service because effectively the public service is negotiating with itself.  This has been a problem for successive Governments and I am not too sure what the answer is.  I suggested a formula last night which might go some way to dealing with it but it is not an easy matter to resolve.  The Government effectively is negotiating with itself.  If the employer gives in to the demands of private sector workers who look for higher wages, he gets over the problem by increasing the cost of his product or reducing the number of staff.  The Government does not have that luxury in that it does not have a product to sell. This is the dilemma which has bedevilled national agreements and the negotiating process between the Government and its own employees for a long time.</P>
    <P>Last night I suggested that a possible way out of the dilemma is to allow the private sector to negotiate pay levels and then import them into the public service.  The danger in negotiating national wage agreements is that the public sector unions carry an inordinate amount of clout in deciding the vote of the trade union movement because of strength of numbers.  We might as well face up to this reality whether it is popular or not.</P>
    <P>Pay and pensions this year will amount to nearly £5,000 million.  The total gross State expenditure will be about £14,000 million and that gives some idea of what we are facing. Whereas Deputy McDowell's motion relates to setting tax rates as objectives, we cannot do it honestly and openly unless we are prepared to look at the expenditure side.  In fairness to the Deputy he has addressed that problem in another document but he has not said how he would actually do it.  I am putting forward proposals from my limited experience which I think are the only <Col N="1735" /> way forward.  How does a Government get over the problem if, in European speak, an asymmetric shock hits the system and it may have to adjust some of the expenditure targets?  At least it would be an improvement if we moved in that direction.</P>
    <P>I have adopted a consistent approach to the levels of taxation.  I have always linked expenditure to taxation and I have always said I am not in favour of a society that has low rates of taxation, because I do not want a society that does not make provision for those in need.  The United States is always held out as a great example, but if one gets sick there one has to sell one's house. About eight or ten years ago a young fellow in the construction business with whom I was friendly decided to go to America for a few months.  To my surprise about two months later I met him in Naas and both his arms were in slings. I had thought he was in America, where he had been until the previous Friday. He had fallen from a roof and could not afford to go into hospital there.  He was an illegal immigrant and had to fly home to be treated in hospital here. That is a reality of life in the United States.</P>
    <P>My view is that we have to decide as a society the level of services we are prepared to pay for.  A society may take a democratic decision that it is not prepared to pay for services for the old, sick, the unemployed, but I do not believe Irish society wants to be like that and I have never supported that. On the other hand I have consistently said that we can only pay for a level of services we can afford as a society. There is no point thinking we have the same level of income as Germany when we do not.  Chancellor Kohl is in some difficulty because changes will have to be made in the German welfare system. He is getting flak because he is putting forward proposals for change in that area.</P>

      <P>It was.  This amendment which sets out the levels of taxation to which Deputy McDowell aspires cannot be taken in isolation because one cannot decide on levels of taxation without also setting the other fiscal parameters.  We should espouse the view that it would be more economically beneficial to the country if people had more money.  I have always subscribed to the view that people are entitled to decide how they should spend their money, be it on health, education and so on, with the State providing services for those who cannot afford to pay for them.</P>
      <P>I know of no better way than providing people with an incentive.  I do not think there is another economy where the state takes more than half of earned income in taxation and levies.  We must lower levels of taxation on the premise that it would be better economically in the longer term if everybody was better off as there would be more money available to provide services for the underprivileged and other groups in society whom we must look after.  I support the amendment on that basis.</P>

      <P>I presume what we have in front of us is PD policy.  It becomes more radical by the minute, certainly by the week.  I have a copy of their policy document An End to Tax and Spend which proposes phased reductions in taxation in the period 1996-2000.  A basic rate of 26 per cent and a top rate of 46 per cent is proposed.  However, the rates proposed in the amendment are 25 per cent and 45 per cent.  There is, therefore, an extra percentage point of radicalism in the space of one or two months since the publication of its policy document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> Deputy McCreevy made an interesting contribution in which he made a number of useful and important points.  What is being proposed would result in the order of £300 million being taken from the budget figures.  This begs the question of what would be cut back. It is not acceptable to propose such cutbacks without first saying where they would fall.</P>
    <P>Let us give a favour of what would be involved.  Under the agreement reached with teachers £67 million is available while £40 million is available for the package offered to nurses.  According to reports in the newspapers this morning, this is not acceptable.  How can one reconcile this proposal with the demands that have been made?  People, such as the Progressive Democrats, have to level with the public because, unfortunately, two plus two will continue to make four.  This proposal is highly dangerous to the extent that it gives people the impression there can be reductions in taxation and they can have more money in their pockets without cutting back on services.  It is inevitable that reductions in taxation will be followed by cutbacks in services, as happened in the 1980s.  When the public were appalled at standards in the health service which it considered unacceptable it voted for change.</P>
    <P>The general idea behind the five year plan proposed is a good one, but if one works through the figures, in the order of £1 billion, at present day values, would be taken from the budget figures. How would we be able to cope with this type of change?  As Deputy McCreevy said, we are stuck with the national debt and significant expenditure of £4.5 billion on welfare and the public sector pay bill.  The scope for change is limited. As a consequence, this proposal is unrealistic.  The public would recoil from its full implications.</P>
    <P>In many ways this plan is similar to what was proposed by Mrs. Thatcher in Britain which was turned into a squalid society made up of individuals who think only of themselves.  I am opposed to the concept of a society made up of <Col N="1738" /> people who only think of themselves with little or no regard for the rest of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the inevitable consequence of what is being proposed. A sum of £1 billion, at present day values, would be taken from budget figures by the year 2000.  This would give rise to social mayhem.  How would teachers and others in the public sector be paid?</P>
      <P>It is assumed also in the Progressive Democrats policy document, which I carry around with me more or less all of the time as it makes wonderful reading, that cutting taxes would lead to a reduction in the number on the dole.  It states that a fall of 50,000 in the live register would result in £175 million being saved in unemployment compensation. It does not state, however, that Progressive Democrats policies would result in a fall of 50,000 in the live register as this would present an enormous challenge given that in the short-term a significant number will join the jobs market and will have to be catered for.</P>
      <P>A plan such as this has superficial appeal, but is highly dangerous.  I caution against going down this road as two or three moves on cutbacks would again have to be made as happened in the late 1980s.  I do not want to visit this on the public.</P>

      <P>I remind Deputy Upton that the Labour Party in Britain has proposed a tax rate of 20 per cent.  It seems it is not satisfied that the Tory Party went far enough.  Most of its counterparts throughout the world are among the greatest proponents of low tax rates. This is not peculiar to any particular philosophy.  It is accepted nowadays that people should have more control over <Col N="1739" /> the way they spend their incomes.  This is not an ideological hang-up, but a fact of life.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As we live in a market economy, the more control people have over the way they spend their income the better.  The notion put forward by the Deputy that the State should always be responsible for making decisions and for providing the full range of services is incorrect and one to which I do not subscribe.  I agree with Deputy McCreevy that there should be a floor, set at the proper level, in terms of the services that should be provided by the State for those who cannot afford to pay for them.</P>
      <P>This amendment outlines a set of tax rates over a period of years to which we would all like to subscribe.  In opposing it the Minister forgets that it does not have to be done by way of cuts.  One issue that has not been addressed is curtailing the level of growth in Government spending.  Since 1987 there has been much change in the levels of taxation but it happened over such a long period of time that people have not felt its benefit in increased disposable income.  However, it was achieved and in difficult circumstances.  Coupled with that was a change in attitude towards public expenditure.</P>
      <P>The argument now is that, as a result of the economic growth achieved after the hard work of the last few years, the Minister is in a better position than previous holders of that office to bring about the necessary changes in tax rates. I subscribe to the view that people should have more money in their pockets and in a position to decide how to spend it.  We must control public expenditure but this does not mean, as the Minister said, cutting back all the time. It involves adopting a new approach to handling growth in public expenditure in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inflow from taxation to the <Col N="1740" /> Government coffers this year is extraordinary. I did not expect the same kind of inflow as we had in 1994 and 1995. While inflows to the Government have increased substantially tax breaks have not been given, particularly to the PAYE sector.  Such workers are frustrated. They gave the productivity demanded of them, curtailed income growth and accepted a reasonable increase in salaries.  However, the failure of successive plans, as they perceive it, is that their efforts have not been rewarded and they do not see the benefits in their take-home pay.  The Government does not face up to that.</P>
    <P>We can argue about the figures in Deputy McDowell's amendment but we should have a strategy which would form a central part of any successor to <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> If it does not form part of any future negotiations with the social partners we will not have an agreement. Instead of increased wage rates we should concentrate on securing substantial reductions in personal taxation and in the cost to an employer of giving employment.  While there has been growth in employment we have not done anything to reduce unemployment levels.</P>
    <P>The amendment is useful as it is clear the Government has not addressed this area.  We need lower rates of taxation and far better control of public expenditure but we must not go down the road of high public expenditure as the Government has been tempted to do. The wrong choices were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had extensive discussion of a comprehensive amendment. Underpinning that is a comprehensive policy position enunciated by the Progressive Democrats.  I support the idea of multi-annual planning and accept the desirability of having three, four and five years planning.  It can be argued that the concept of trying to plan an economy flies in the face of the free market thinking normally associated with the Right.  Therefore, from our political and ideological vantage point, <Col N="1741" /> planning and managing an economy, even an open market one such as ours, is desirable and, if properly handled, as in French planning in the 1950s and the 1960s in marked contrast to what happened in the United Kingdom, can deliver substantial economic gain. Deputy McCreevy is correct when he says we must plan both sides of the equation, that is, expenditure and tax reduction.</P>
      <P>While I accept the concept behind the idea of multi-annual planning from the point of view of finance and specifically in relation to a phased reduction in current levels of personal income tax, that cannot be done unless the expenditure side is right, which cannot be achieved until there is a multi-annual budgeting process in place.  That is what we are now doing.  I remind the House that the colleague on whose behalf Deputy Molloy is now speaking entertained us to an ideological rant last night and a subdued version of the same song during the Committee Stage discussion of the Bill as to the culpability of the Labour Party in the failure to introduce tax reform.</P>
      <P>The State was founded just over 70 years ago.  As a party we have had control over the Department of Finance for less than 18 months.  In that time we introduced a commitment to the multi-annual budgeting process, to which the Opposition is now committed.  We also provided for consolidation of the income tax Bill which will simplify the process considerably.  Most importantly of all, we introduced a policy of numbers in terms of fixing the establishment size of the Civil Service.  That has been agreed at Government and will be announced in due course.  Within that we will fix establishment sizes for each of the Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was restrained in the comments I made to Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage because he was on the sideline, if not on the benches as a reserve, while his colleagues were in Government. Deputies Molloy, O'Malley and Harney as Minister of State were in a Government that presided over an annual net increase of 3,500 people in <Col N="1742" /> the public service, between the public sector and the Civil Service, from 1989-92. At an average cost of £20,000, which is the unit cost currently applied by the Department of Finance, we are talking about £70 million gross per annum.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy is correct when he says that the room for manoeuvre in budgeting is limited.  There are certain fixed given costs: social welfare demanded driven costs of £4.5 billion, the wage bill which is numbers driven and statutory obligations, such as interest payments and so on.  The amount of discretionary money in the national budget is limited.  For the Progressive Democrats to suggest that we could finance a massive reduction in personal income tax without reducing public services but merely by prudent management or curtailing growth, is fiction. Deputy Upton is correct to challenge the Progressive Democrats.  What hospital, school or Department would it close because that is what it would amount to?  The scale of numbers implicit in achieving these kinds of expenditure reductions or savings on the income tax side is of that order unless we want to go over the Maastricht 3 per cent reference value.  I presume that is not the case.  There was a ceiling when we went into Government with Fianna Fáil in 1992 but because the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration reneged on its promises under <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its pay commitments we had no option but to introduce the 1 per cent levy as a temporary measure to meet the pay agreements which Deputies Molloy and O'Malley, as representatives of the Progressive Democrats Party in Government, entered into and at the same time meet the Maastricht reference value of 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the 18 months we have been in the Department of Finance we have decided to address the questions of multi-annual budgeting and numbers. We have also engaged in a process which, if we are successful, will allow us <Col N="1743" /> to say to a specific Department that the size of its team is 15 players and if it wants to improve the game or the delivery of the services it is charged with delivering to the public, it will have to do so, not with 17 or 19 players, but with the same 15.  Every company and organisation is learning to do that.  The Revenue Commissioners have set an example for the rest of the public service in the way they have improved the quality of their service, but not without considerable number gains as well. There has been a relaxation in relation to some numbers but only because there have been changes in the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, introduced a three year administrative budget procedure, designed by the Department of Finance but signed off by the Minister responsible, which was so incapable of managing control in Departments that this time last year we did not know how many civil servants were on the payroll. Secretaries in various Departments continued to hire people after they had received the type of letters from the Department of Finance, to which Deputy McCreevy referred.</P>
    <P>The internal control systems are not there, but I propose to change that.  If we want to put a multi-annual budgeting process in place and make people accountable, then the Secretary and the Minister of each Department must be accountable for its administrative budget.  They will have a salary allocation in terms of numbers and they must decide what type of team they want.  They can either have one extra principal officer or four clerical officers, or they can arrange the team in terms of the level of skills and activity required. However, if they do not meet that budget, two things will happen.  They will not get any extra money, which is happening at present in that certain Departments have been bailed out, and the Secretary of that Department will be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Committee <Col N="1744" /> of Public Accounts.  They will have to state why they did not manage their Department within the budget parameters set for them.</P>
    <P>For too long we have been obsessed with people accounting for the honest, not the efficient and effective disbursal of money.  We have been blessed &mdash; I do not take it for granted &mdash; with an extraordinarily honest public service relative to other European countries.  However, that blessing has obscured the fact that its scrupulousness as regards accounting for the disbursal of money has, perhaps, blinded them to the need to be efficient in its dispersal as well.  The changes we are making will allow Secretaries of every Department to be brought before the Committee of Public Accounts, if necessary, to account for why they did not manage their budgets on the personnel side so as to stay within the existing parameters.</P>
    <P>We will not be able to curtail public expenditure or to achieve the consequent improvements desired by everybody unless we introduce such management changes.  The Labour Party, despite protestations by the Progressive Democrats, has not been in the Department of Finance for more than 18 months.  We are in the process of putting these common sense management mechanisms in place which will enable us to do what should have been done many years ago.</P>
    <P>On the bias implicit in the way the proposed reduction in taxes would impact on our society, we would all like to pay less income tax.  However, the bias in the schedules set out by Deputy Michael McDowell and endorsed by Deputy Molloy today means that the reduction in tax would favour the rich. That is the niche from which the Progressive Democrats come and at which that party has decided to toss its cap. However, to suggest that reducing tax levels would benefit the 280,000 unemployed and not the 350,000 to which Deputy Molloy referred is misleading. All the studies of long-term unemployment show that we must deal with the <Col N="1745" /> tax wedge for the long-term unemployed where it impacts, not at the 48 per cent rate.  Deputy Michael McDowell's mantra on Committee Stage was that if an average industrial worker works overtime on a Saturday and gets £10, the State would take £5.70.  I stated last night in the House that a single industrial worker pays a total of 30 per cent tax relative to what they earn.</P>
    <P>If we want to deliver a system which favours helping the long-term unemployed back into the workplace or, alternatively, ensures that low paid workers do not lose their jobs or that they retain more of what they earn, we must, as I have done in my last two budgets, address the issue in the non-sheltered side of the Irish economy &mdash; the class A PRSI contributors.  We provided an exemption for the first £50 of income last year and we raised that by £30 to £80 this year.  Somebody does not pay PRSI in that sector which he or she paid before.</P>
    <P>While I accept the desirability of such five year planning comes naturally from someone from a socialist background who believes that any economy is capable of being managed, even a market economy, it cannot be planned in the way that people tried in the United States or in Britain during the war.  A social market economy can be planned and managed in a coherent way.  Part of that is to balance the two sides of the equation so that we can get the type of commitments required and the projections on which to base our figures.  In that context, there are political and ideological choices about social prioritisation. It is clear from the detailed analysis of the impact which the Progressive Democrats' tax reductions would have on the labour market and on take home pay that their bias is unashamedly in favour of the rich retaining a larger percentage of their money.  It would do nothing for the long-term unemployed unless the rich decided unilaterally to employ some of those people.</P>
    <P>We have been down this road before of throwing money at the economy in <Col N="1746" /> an effort to create jobs &mdash; the scatter-gun approach to managing a market economy.  It suggests that if we pour enough cash into the economy, it will generate so much activity that people will buy and trade and this will create jobs.  In 1987 it created many jobs in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and anywhere else where consumer durables were produced and which the Irish taxpayer subsequently bought.  It also happened in Britain.  It is the curse of conservative economics which is not thought our properly and which suggests that money should be thrown at people, which they will spend and which will then create jobs.  It is like sending an assassin to take out a specific distant target with a blunderbuss.  It is guaranteed to fail and it is a costly failure.  It happened in the French economy when the socialists took power in 1981.  They ran amok with spending and three devaluations later they had to change it.  They created many jobs in Italy, Germany and any other place where the French consumer spent their new found wealth.</P>
    <P>I reject the Progressive Democrats' proposal on two grounds, while accepting the idea of multi-annual planning. It is biased in favour of the rich and it is dishonest to suggest that it would have a positive effect on long-term unemployment because it will not. By contrast, the Progessive Democrates have frequently made reference to the fact that tax reforms stopped in 1992. What do they call the changes in the capital acquisition tax for small business? If they are in any doubt about it I suggest they get a view from the Small Firms Association or ISME.  What do they call the changes in corporation tax? If they are in doubt I suggest they consult the business associations.  The former leader of the Progressive Democrats, who was also its founder, was the longest serving Minister for Industry and Commerce, yet at that time small businesses felt they had no voice and were not being heard.  When the new Department of Enterprise and Employment was established &mdash; I had the honour to serve in it for two years &mdash; for <Col N="1747" /> the first time small businesses were asked what they wanted and when they made their request through a task force of 14 small business practitioners, it was delivered.  Deputies should not take my word but should ask those people how they feel about it.</P>
    <P>We have had a long, discursive debate on this issue.  The amendment is economically flawed, ideologically biased, politically misleading and does not recognise the changes that have taken place in tax reform, including personal income tax reductions.  None of us is talking any more about tax reform but about reducing the rates of taxation where possible and fine tuning their focus and application.  This amendment in its present form would result in the closing of hospitals or in blowing us out of the water in terms of the 3 per cent Maastricht figure.  It would be an unmitigated disaster for working people because it would increase the income of those who already have a lot of money.</P>

I have heard before from the Labour benches about what cannot be done.  They seek to create images about the disaster that would befall this country if a major <Col N="1748" /> move was made to reduce the burden of personal taxation on the workers.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister ever looked at the major economies across the world?  Is it not clear in economies where there are low levels of personal taxation there are also low levels of unemployment and that in general those with high levels of personal taxation have high levels of unemployment?  We are classically one of those countries with a high level of unemployment, and the figure is not 250,000 as mentioned by the Minister; the real figure is closer to 350,000 taking into account those who have been steered into artificial employment schemes to keep them off the official register of unemployed.</P>

Up to 350,000 people are being denied the opportunity to participate in the economy, to go out every morning to work at a satisfying job and bring home a decent disposable income.</P>
      <P>To seek to stand up here and say that my party is interested only in benefiting the rich people is ridiculous.  Who are the rich people?  That kind of propaganda from the Labour Party has been rejected across Europe, including Eastern Europe.  It has been rejected in the socialist states where people are beginning to see through it.  The number of rich people here can be counted on very few hands.  Most people are struggling, even those in employment because they have mortgages and, therefore, have very little disposable income.  They find it extremely difficult to provide for their families, to educate, clothe and feed them and give them a reasonable standard of living.  All parents are under constant pressure to provide sufficient funds to meet the demands of their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> That is the concern among the general community and what concerns the Progressive Democrats.  We are not concerned about the few rich people.  They are so well able to look after themselves that they do not even have to pay tax &mdash; they organised various schemes to avoid it and the Government also introduced schemes which benefit them.  Rich people avoid their duty and liability to income tax under Government-sponsored schemes.  I and my party are concerned about the ordinary worker regardless of his or her level of income and about those who have no job.  The broad-sweep propaganda that hospitals will close and that a great disaster will befall us if we seek to reduce the size of the State sector to relieve the burden is false and will not be accepted by the people.  The Minister is ignoring the reality in economies throughout the world.  Countries who have achieved growth and rewarded investment are those with very low levels of unemployment, but for some strange reason the Labour Party seems happy in the knowledge that the greater the number of people on unemployment benefit and dependent on the State, the more votes it will get.</P>

      <P>The day will come, however, when people will wake up and realise that the party that is driving them to unemployment is Labour, the party that has largely influenced coalition Governments in which it has participated to maintain a certain level of spending, with the consequent results.  It is depressing and sad to listen to the denials of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in seeking to create fears among people who want to free themselves from the burden of the State and who look to other countries where that has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister looks at left wing parties in other countries he will realise that they are changing their attitudes and approach to these matters.  We have only to look across the Irish Sea to see <Col N="1750" /> what is happening to his colleagues in the British House of Commons as a result of the policies they are adopting. Why should the Labour Party continue to live in the dim and distant past and allow this country to struggle, with many people burdened by the shackles of maintaining a large State sector and high levels of unemployment?  We must break out of that cycle, and the only way to do so is to lay down the discipline of reducing the burden over a period of years.  We are in the unique position where we have an opportunity to do that based on the levels of growth in the economy and forecasts of growth for the next five years.  The levels of growth are encouraging but should not be exaggerated &mdash; some people mentioned 9 per cent, but our figures are based on a growth of approximately 3.5 per cent. We have seen a huge increase in State expenditure &mdash; £2.2 billion &mdash; since the 1992 election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister made little reference to all the major studies and reports that have been carried out over the past five to seven years which have identified clearly the need to tackle this area of the economy.  He is throwing out all these reports and rubbishing and ignoring them.  He is continuing the Labour Party policy of high expenditure.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy Michael McDowell.  I observe that amendment No. 17 is related and I suggest, therefore, we discuss amendments Nos. 13 and 17 together.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  &mdash;The Revenue Commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from time to time make regulations for the purpose of exempting persons resident within the State from liability to taxation and levies in respect of earnings from employment in Northern Ireland to such extent as, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is reasonably necessary to create equal treatment as between such persons and other persons resident in the State and liable to taxation and levies on similar incomes earned in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the Revenue Commissiones may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from time to time make regulations for the purpose of bringing about equality between taxpayers resident in this State, some of whom work in Northern Ireland and some of whom work in this State.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the Revenue Commissioners be allowed to relieve any taxpayer liable to a greater amount of tax by virtue of the fact that he or she is earning outside the State on any given income compared with a similar income being earned by a taxpayer within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in my amendment is a modest one because, as the Minister pointed out on Committee Stage, gross wages for comparable work in Northern <Col N="1756" /> Ireland are substantially lower in many cases than in the Republic.  Therefore, those who cross the Border to work are, in fact, working for lower nominal wages in Northern Ireland when compared with similar jobs in the Republic. I cannot, by way of any proposal, try to equalise that position.  One must bear in mind that, under the next British Government the tax rate on earnings in Northern Ireland is likely to be reduced to 20 per cent.  In those circumstances, the difference between gross wages and the tax wedge north and south of the Border is likely to expand, especially if the tax policies pursued by the Government continues into next year.</P>
    <P>Many people in this State are adversely affected by our tax regime being applied to Northern earnings and are demanding justice.  Members who think those people's just claims can be ignored will learn to their cost at the next election that those people will not tolerate continuing injustice of the kind they are now experiencing.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment, modest as it is, and to begin to address the grievances of those people.  After all &mdash; this point arose on Committee Stage &mdash; Northern Ireland is supposed to be part of this State <i>de jure,</i> we are supposed to be involved in trying to increase cross-Border co-operation and EU policy encourages and facilitates the migration of workers.  Irish men and women, who live not merely in counties adjacent to Northern Ireland but some distance further away &mdash; some people travel from even south of Dublin to work in Northern Ireland &mdash; are entitled to elementary justice.  The first degree, and by no means the entirety, of elementary justice is that somebody who earns £100 in Northern Ireland should pay no more tax on his earnings because he works in Northern Ireland and resides in this State than he would if the same gross amount was given to him by way of remuneration for a job in this State.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to accept this modest proposal which would go some <Col N="1757" /> way towards addressing the injustice being done to these people.</P>
    <P>I support amendment No. 17, in the name of Deputy McCreevy, which deals with a different aspect and approaches the matter from a different perspective. Both amendments are clearly concerned with bringing about some kind of elementary justice for people who are being treated most unjustly by the State for no particular reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That would be a problem for her.</P>
      <P>Many people are affected by the regulations. The issue has bedevilled successive administrations which have tried to bring about an equitable solution.  I have tried, when dealing with members of the Fianna Fáil Party over the past 14 or 15 months since I was made spokesperson on Finance, to take a balanced view of the issue because if one was not careful one could easily create another set of anomalies for workers in the Republic <i>vis-à-vis</i> those who live beside them in the same street or townland and work in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>My amendment goes some way towards addressing that problem and takes a provision from the 1994 Act, which the Minister could consider.  In the 1994 Act, we recognised the position of employees within the State who spend a considerable amount of time abroad.  When I was Minister for Tourism and Trade I met many such people who work for Irish companies abroad and are, frequently out of the country for a considerable period.  Other workers would also be affected by the measure but the 1994 Act effectively put into operation a scheme which recognises the amount of time these people spend abroad with their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> This is the same amendment that I tabled to last year's Bill.  In the amendment I am attempting to use the provision in the 1994 Act to recognise the cross-Border workers' anomalies.  As a result of his meetings in Donegal, and with Deputies from Border constituencies particularly those of the Minister's party, the Minister is aware that this issue will not go away.  Therefore, it is worth considering this amendment.</P>
    <P>Some complications would arise, however, because under double tax treaties it would be normal for the Minister to state that there is nothing unusual about this and successive Ministers have advanced this theory. Workers who work in Germany and live outside that country are in exactly the same position as these workers. However, there is a great difference due to the partitioning of our country more than 70 years ago and that unusual aspect does not affect other countries to the same degree.</P>
    <P>People from Inishowen, County Donegal, where I canvassed during the by-election, must pass through Northern Ireland to go to other parts of the Republic and many of them work in Northern Ireland.  The Minister should consider my amendment which suggests a reasonably balanced approach.  It will not solve all the problems of cross-Border workers but, in the main, it will relieve the majority of them from any punishment they suffer at present.</P>
    <P>I have been informed of cases and have met persons who have received huge tax bills and I do not know what their position will be.  I appreciate that the Minister set up an interdepartmental committee after this was discussed on Committee Stage last year.  Its report resulted in some changes being made to the levies, but they did not go far enough.  My amendment seeks to create a reasonable balance.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider Deputy McDowell's amendment which would allow the Revenue Commissioners to adopt that approach &mdash; it is another way of addressing the same problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> I am convinced that if some realistic changes are made, there will be a spin-off, that is, a net gain, to the Exchequer because many cross-Border workers are outside the tax net.  One of the advantages of canvassing and spending time in an area is that you hear what is going on.  Perhaps you need to speak to lobby groups or TDs if you are not conversant with the problem.  However, I am certain that the net gain to the Exchequer would compensate for any loss.  I am convinced that the numbers are far in excess of the estimates of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.  It was an eye opener for me.</P>

      <P>I will leave this matter to my Border colleagues who are in the front line.  I had been involved with this matter for a number of years and I know the Minister has been trying to deal with it.  I support everything Deputy McCreevy stated.  However, I wish to stress his last point.  When I examined this issue &mdash; I am sure it was the same with the Minister &mdash; I looked at it purely in the context of cash flows North and South and South and North and from the point of view of the white economy.  There is no doubt that in the past year, not just in Donegal &mdash; I am not saying anything against the individuals concerned &mdash; people in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth have been living in a fool's paradise.  An alternative economy has built up around it.</P>

      <P>In both the Minister's and my constituency we had the problem in the construction programmes. Clearly, if we do nothing about this issue people will find another way round it and that is what is happening.  I have seen this in all counties since last September. Some people would probably advise us that there are not many involved but that is not the case.  I have <Col N="1760" /> seen it at first-hand.  It is no good arguing that if it is all right there is no need to fix it.  It is not all right, it is inherently bad.  I have done a lot over the years to try to make people tax compliant and to close loopholes but this one is being openly flouted.  As Deputy McCreevy said, many of the people who were almost agitating for it are outside the net but many are uncomfortable because of the fear that some day they will be caught.  Out success rate in catching people along the Border is not as good as in other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>The argument that it would cost much or involve great difficulty is irrelevant as we cannot continue the present system.  People in the legitimate economy have a good case and what irritates them more than anything is watching people who have adopted an alternative resolution.  I urge the Minister either to accept this amendment or to suggest an alternative scheme to deal with the real problem, involving a great number of people in every village.  I have great sympathy for people who are genuinely paying their taxes.  As Deputy McCreevy said when one examines the figures, as I have done, particularly in Donegal but also in Deputy Dermot Ahern's constituency where I met some of the groups and analysed the figures, they have a good argument.  When as legislators we fail within the revenue system to find a law to deal with it people find their own solution to deal with it which undermines the whole system. I urge the Minister to deal with this matter.  I support the amendment and thank my Border colleagues for allowing me to contribute to this debate.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, said I could not go home unless I spoke on this issue. As a cross-Border worker I do not need any gun to be put to my head.  I understand the position and I do not need pressure from any side to stress my point.  Tax is a major problem for the whole country but it is worse for cross-frontier workers.  Most of the arguments can be presented about the whole of Ireland but we are talking about a specific group of people.  Unemployment in Donegal has increased by 1,100 in the past year.  If we do not address unemployment by job creation within our own area we have to go where the work is available.  That is the position at present: people are going where the work is.  Because of our membership of the European Union we have freedom of movement and the right to go here, there or anywhere.  Thousands of people cross the Border every day.  How do we reward their initiative of looking for work?  We do not give equal pay for equal work.  People will say you cannot expect a person in Germany to get the same amount of money as a person in Cork.  We are not talking about a paper exercise here, we are talking about, for example, a person in Strabane who earns 20 per cent less when he or she moves to Lifford which is only half a mile away.  In some Border counties there is not even a half mile from one place to another.  In my area people come from Derry to Muff, a distance of about three miles, where they immediately experience a huge difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not giving anybody an incentive to work.  As jobs are scarce we should try to encourage people as much as possible to work wherever it is available. In the year 2002 the Euro will probably be our form of currency.  As cross-Border workers we work with two different monetary systems and we pay a big penalty because the punt is worth more than the pound sterling.  As well as a 20 per cent wages deficit we also pay a penalty when we change the money into punts.  When you buy your car in the Republic you pay extra and <Col N="1762" /> then drive into the North every day. Petrol prices are increased in the budget so that one is paying more to get to work.</P>
    <P>We are facing problems such as rural depopulation.  Young single people who have no ties are going to Northern Ireland where they will stay.  They will ask why they should leave an area where the tax is 25 per cent in favour of an area where the rate is 48 per cent?  I am not saying that to knock our system but people must appreciate what is happening. As one who lives in the area, I know this is a major problem for everyone. If we continue to allow people to move away from our own area shops and schools will close and services will be torn apart.  We will have mass rural depopulation and unemployment for those remaining.  I am asking for parity. As Deputy McCreevy said, the spin-off economically could be substantial.  I do not believe it would cost much to examine this issue seriously.  The spin-offs down the line would be more substantial than any loss.  I support both amendments.</P>

      <P>It had been responsible for the Department of Finance for only 18 months.  With respect to the Minister, while the Labour Party served a good apprenticeship with Fianna Fáil, it was not ready to take over that Department. A Minister normally likes to be remembered for something he or she did while in office.  This is a golden opportunity for the Minister to be remembered as the Minister who did something for cross-Border workers.  I have been involved in many heated debates on this matter and the Minister is not the most popular man in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the run-up to the by-election <Col N="1763" /> Deputy McCreevy and I met representatives of cross-Border workers who told us that Deputy McCreevy's proposal would be acceptable.  The Minister should put this matter to rest once and for all.  I acknowledge that he set up a committee and carried out investigations into the matter and I did not believe an acceptable solution could be found.  However, the workers have said they would accept Deputy McCreevy's adjunct to the 1994 amendment.  This is a golden opportunity for the Minister. In the run-up to the by-election the Minister's colleagues raised expectations in the Border region, many of them behaved like Deputies in Opposition. The Minister is aware of the problem and I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <P>I understand a once off deal was worked out by the late Deputy Colley in 1978 for cross-Border workers and I think Deputy McDowell's amendment is similar to that.  While I support his amendment, I would be concerned that future Ministers for Finance could be forced to make similar once-off deals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I put my name to amendment No. 17 because, on the advice of an expert group associated with my party, we tabled a similar amendment to last year's Finance Bill. A number of Border Deputies from my party and people from outside the House tried to resolve this problem and the Minister acknowledged that.  Last year he undertook to examine the matter and, while I appreciate what he has done in the Finance Bill, it is disappointing that he was unable to go the whole way.  Research indicates that it would cost in the region of £12 million in a year.  What is the Minister's view on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) (i) of amendment No. 17 proposes the insertion of &ldquo;5 consecutive days&rdquo; as the length of time required for a person to work abroad to qualify for tax relief.  This would take into account that cross-Border workers are generally out of the State for five <Col N="1764" /> days per week.  Paragraph (a) (ii) proposes to remove the requirement that to qualify for tax relief a person should be regarded as being abroad for a day.  This amendment proposes the insertion of &ldquo;eight consecutive hours during the day&rdquo; which would mean the person would not stay overnight in the North. Paragraph (b) proposes that a person should not be considered to be abroad for tax relief purposes if he or she is working in Northern Ireland.  This would not alter matters for United Kingdom residents but it would include in our tax provisions people from the Republic who are employed in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These amendments propose that residents working in Northern Ireland should be exempt from paying tax here. The paragraph that proposes the substitution of &ldquo;5 consecutive days&rdquo; for &ldquo;14 consecutive days&rdquo; would mean that people who work in the Republic for the remainder of the week could be taxed at the normal rate here.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the working group met on numerous occasions to examine this matter, we are disappointed the Minister did not accept our Committee Stage amendment and I am sure he will not accept this one.  I urge him to fine tune the tax system to take account of cross-Border workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree this is a matter of concern for many people in Border counties.  As chairman of the Labour Party Parliamentary Party, I welcome the new Deputy from Donegal.  I wish her every success and congratulate her on a fine performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies from the Border area, I have been in touch with the Minister on numerous occasions about this matter.  I am pleased he addressed it in the budget and I look forward to his response.  The accumulation of tax arrears forces many people, particularly those in the building sector, to operate in the black economy.  Many people receive social welfare in the North while earning money in the South but they do not pay tax.  This is a major problem in <Col N="1765" /> the Border area.  It is not what we are talking about, but it is linked, because it is forcing people to break the law not alone in Northern Ireland but in the Republic.  Perhaps the Minister would bear that in mind in dealing with this very sensitive question of accumulation of arrears of tax and PRSI.</P>
    <P>I would like also to ask whether it is possible to deal with this very difficult problem in the context of the development of the Euro-currency &mdash; it is hoped that Great Britain will relent and that a new Labour Government there will change the policy of the present Conservative Government so that we can have overall agreement on a Euro-currency. The Minister is very well aware of it.  It has been raised at our parliamentary party meetings by Senators and Deputies representing the Border region.  Perhaps some relief could be given, particularly on accumulated tax arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this problem. Donegal North-East was an intensive re-education, but it was not the first time the matter was brought to my attention.  The matter surfaced in my first Finance Bill last year.  I apologise to Deputy McDaid that my apprenticeship has been so inadequate to the task.  I will try harder.  As to this being a golden opportunity to go down in history, I am amazed that Deputy Ahern did not seize it when he was Minister for Finance, or Deputy Reynolds or Mr. Haughey when they were Ministers for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is so concerned about my place in history, let us proceed.  Regarding what Deputy Bell has said about the problem of accumulated taxation arrears, I am prepared to enter into discussions with the Revenue Commissioners to see what can be done. Some of the people I met would not be able to address that issue with any degree of comfort.  We can recognise <Col N="1766" /> that as a problem from the past and, without any commitment other than what I have just said, see if it can be dealt with in a positive and humane manner within the framework of the existing legislation.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to the first amendment which proposes quite extraordinary powers of discretion for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners comes from Tralee and the Secretary of the Department of Finance comes from Lisnaskea in County Fermanagh.  I have to speculate, without in any way casting aspersions on the personalities of the two people involved, that were their places of origin and their roles changed, their attitude to this matter might be very much transformed.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell is trying to be helpful in giving discretion to the Revenue Commissiones, but the scale of discretion is enormous.  No sooner would they begin to exercise it than the same Deputy McDowell would be in court on behalf of litigants demanding under the Constitution that this discretion, exercised with judicious wisdom by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of one group of citizens, should also be applied to the citizens of Dublin-South East.  It is not just a gateway, it is a series of broad factory doors through which not only a coach and four could be driven but an entire cavalry, with devastating effects upon the Revenue Copmmissioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would take a brief, nevertheless, if he were asked. The Fianna Fáil amendment is more focused.  In deference to the seniority of the party members opposite who spoke on this, let me first address the comments made by its leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  There is a problem with the black economy, and with moving from the black economy into the legitimate or white economy.  There are distortions north and south of the Border.  Citizens living in the Republic of Ireland go to <Col N="1767" /> Northern Ireland and rip off the taxpayer in the North and <i>vice versa.</i> In the Finance Bill already introduced, there has been an attempt to address that issue, but we need much more co-operation between North and South in regard to people abusing their relative mobility to defraud taxpayers North and South.  I suggest that we do it at official level between the Revenue Commissioners on our side and the appropriate bodies on the UK side.  I suggest also that parties on all sides of this House raise this matter in the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier because this is a matter of concern to everybody.  That is a related but separate issue and should be addressed independently of what we do here.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Fianna Fáil amendment because it is not capable of being ring-fenced exclusively to people in Northern Ireland.  Notwithstanding the extraordinary linguistic dexterity of Articles 2 and 3, when we come to the hard reality of law we cannot separate Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.  For the purposes of legality and the application of law they are one entity.  Therefore, any concession we would give to somebody living in Lifford and working in Strabane would have to be given to somebody living in Dublin and working in Liverpool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overnights concession is a distinct and different type of concession given to workers who are, for a period of time, discommoded by being away from the comforts of home and all that goes with that, as opposed to people who drive across the Border to work and come home, in some cases for lunch but certainly for their evening meal, and sleep in their own bed.  Most modern states have a tax system that recognises that dimension when one is away from one's family support system in the full sense of that word.  We cannot distort that very clear principle and apply it to people who are commuting from Inishowen to Derry.  It would turn logic on its head.  We have a written Constitution with access to the courts, and that <Col N="1768" /> nonsensical logic would be torn apart by way of a carefully selected case.</P>
    <P>What we can try to do &mdash; I referred to this on Committee Stage &mdash; is to see if under Article 18 of the tax treaty between our two countries we can restore the position that existed for public sector employees in Northern Ireland who were deemed there to be Government employees and treated differently for tax purposes.  That will address some of the problem.  I do not know the answer to the problem, but I am prepared to sit down and discuss it with Deputies and perhaps set up an all-party committee to examine the problem.  I appreciate the point made by Deputy Dermot Ahern that Fianna Fáil got expert advice on this and is now proposing it.  I cannot but make the point that the Deputy had many opportunities when there was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in office but his argument seems to have fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become a more loudly articulated issue.  The issue became acute when the interpretation of Article 19 was changed by the British authorities in relation to some workers. I will defer to the wisdom and experience of Deputies Keaveney and McDaid in this regard.  With respect to Deputy Ahern, the problem is not as acute in County Louth as it is in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some familiarity with that area.  My father's family come from Newry and my mother's family from Dundalk.  Maximising Border opportunities is something I grew up with from day one.  What we are hearing is the negative side of this.  There would <Col N="1769" /> be no issue if things were going the other way.  If the rate of tax in Derry was higher than the rate of tax in Letterkenny there would be no procession of people volunteering to equalise in the interest of justice because they felt aggrieved and somewhat guilty about living in the Republic of Ireland and getting services and paying less tax than they would be paying if they were living in Northern Ireland where they were earning their money and that maybe they should cough up and pay the Republic of Ireland the money they would otherwise pay to Her Majesty's revenue service.</P>
      <P>Of course, that silence is stunning. For a long time people working across the Border reaped advantages on the other side.  Deputy Keaveney spoke about the problem of paying for petrol. There was not a word to be heard from anybody when petrol was cheaper north of the Border or, in the case of Deputy Dermot Ahern, east of the Border. These advantages and disadvantages flow in different directions but we hear about them only when the wind is blowing in our faces.  In this instance the wind is blowing in our faces and it appears it will persist for some time.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept Deputy McDowell's amendment, I think Deputy Dermot Ahern anticipated my reluctance to do so &mdash; we do not know what it would cost.  The Deputy gave a figure of £12 million.  We do not know the full extent of the numbers of people working; let us assume it is of that order.  It is not that we could actually ring-fence its cost but legally speaking, we could not draw a distinction between Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  That is my present advice and I doubt it will change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are other ways of equalising or addressing this issue, I am not closed to examining them; on the contrary, I am open to doing so.  A working party of technical specialists have been working on the matter and recommended the abolition of the health, employment and training levies which, in the case of somebody with an annual income of £15,000, would mean £340 back into <Col N="1770" /> their pocket, not a lot of money but more than they were receiving two years ago.  If there are other methods by which we can deal with this, I am prepared to examine them.</P>
    <P>If the two Deputies opposite, with some Border Deputies and Senators, wish to establish a small working group to examine this in the context of next year's budget, I am prepared to facilitate them, on the basis that these would be all-party discussions.  I will make technical assistance from the Revenue Commissioners and my Department available to them but that is as far as I can go on the matter.</P>
    <P>Having personally met some such people, I know there is great anguish and worry about accumulated tax bills, the amnesty in respect of which has been extended to 31 May.  In this respect I will enter into discussions with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners an independent, autonomous body charged with the collection of taxes due, it is not for me as Minister to interfere in that process &mdash; on foot of the representations made to me from all sides of the House to ascertain what can be done in respect of historic accumulated tax debts in respect of some, from what I saw, the prospect of recovery is remote.  All one would do would be to drive people across the Border permanently with all the anguish associated therewith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's attitude is over-relaxed because the black economy is very substantial, assisted by the very existence of the Border.  I hope my next remark will not be regarded as flippant but, perhaps if we took a different attitude to the previous amendment on which Deputy Molloy called a vote and actually did something about our tax rates, this problem could be avoided.  If we sat down and addressed that issue, we would be getting somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely saying the Minister appears to have a very relaxed attitude to this matter, not one about which many people would be relaxed.  I know of one solicitor, who briefs me, who lives in Northern Ireland and practises in the South.  I never asked him why but it occurs to me there must be some legitimate advantages to be gained from doing so.</P>
      <P>Deputies McCreevy and Dermot Ahern are right, our Exchequer will probably end up losing right across the board because of the inequalities in the taxation treatments north and south of the Border.  When one adds it all up, failing to grasp this issue and deal with it probably impoverishes this State rather than the other, driving people into the black economy, persuading them to suppress their real place of residence.  As Deputy Keaveney said, people now move across the Border to avail of the more benign fiscal climate there.  On every front we are paying a high price for our high taxation system.</P>
      <P>I must revert to the point &mdash; that if Packard had been located in Newry or Dundalk its annual profits would have been approximately £500,000 greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably, but it would have been approximately £500,000 more profitable annually.  The peace dividend will not transpire to be a positive advantage for the Irish Republic while this inequality of tax treatment prevails north and south of the Border.  As Deputy McCreevy said on Committee Stage, people behave rationally, as do economic entities such as companies and employers.  They spend much time weighing up the precise implications of where to invest in employment-intensive industry.  Therefore, as a society in the South, we must face up to these serious problems and the injustice suffered by cross-Border workers is one aspect only of a major problem for the Irish Exchequer caused by the differing tax systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> The Minister seemed to suggest that the lower gross incomes in Northern Ireland result from the many years of Tory rule.  However, lower gross incomes in Northern Ireland yield higher take-home pay, which is what ordinary people care about.  One of our problems here is that we have higher gross incomes and lower take-home pay in comparison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland.  Frankly, I salute the Tories on that achievement.</P>

      <P>I salute their achievement and am glad to note that the British Labour Party whose followers are increasing promises to reduce the standard rate of taxation even further after the next general election there.  That is the kind of politics the Labour Party in New Zealand and in Britain have engaged in &mdash; the Labour Party knows what to do with an economy.  It is an awful pity that the Irish Labour Party does not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Presidency involves a heavier load of responsibility on the Government in terms of having <Col N="1774" /> to manage the entire European agenda on an intensive basis, including issues, for example, such as Mediterranean policy, which would not normally occupy a large amount of our time.  However, when we hold the Presidency we have to be more expert on them than some of the Mediterranean countries.  Obviously there is a requirement of that nature. Equally, there is an event management function that needs to be performed during the Presidency, by event I mean every Council of Ministers' meeting, every meeting of senior officials is an event, the logistics of which have to be arranged to ensure that problems of a practical or housekeeping nature do not prevent people from doing the political or administrative work that needs to be done.  There are greater staff demands and political demands on the Government of the day during the Presidency than at any other time.  The most appropriate way of dealing with that is by temporary appointments as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have imagined that the Department of Foreign Affairs has a great deal of expertise in matters relating to the Mediterranean and other areas and they have already indicated they are taking on three extra staff. What staff does the Taoiseach intend to employ in his office for the duration of the Presidency and what will be the cost of the Presidency to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two extra staff being taken on in the press office to deal with press related matters arising from the Presidency and they are being recruited from a panel which had been constituted for filling an earlier vacancy. Consideration is being given to the recruitment of some extra staff in the European affairs division of my Department. The Deputy may recognise that my Department has a very substantial European affairs function separate from, though complementary to, the functions performed by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  These are particularly related to summit meetings and <Col N="1775" /> meetings that take place at prime ministerial and Head of Government level. There may be a requirement to have additional staff recruited for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is not critical of the idea of recruiting extra staff for this purpose.  It is quite obvious to anybody who thinks about it that the Presidency involves extra work and the implication of any suggestion that people should not be taken on for extra work would lead one to suggest that the people who are working in the years we do not hold the Presidency are not fully extended.  As far as my Department is concerned that is not the case.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that his Department, not the Tánaiste and Department of Foreign Affairs is co-ordinating the work of the Presidency?  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that a very important matter in trying to deal with the Presidency is the relationship with Parliament.  During the last time Ireland held the Presidency six years ago we recruited someone in Brussels and Strasbourg to develop the relationship with Parliament and I assume the Taoiseach is following that wise judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember experiencing the hospitality of the gentleman in question when I was a member of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, but I am not sure I was supposed to.  The same practice will be followed as previously in regard to the coordination of the Presidency and there is no change in the position.  A large part of the work is co-ordinated in the normal course by the Department of Foreign Affairs but the overall management and objective setting for the Presidency is done by an inter-ministerial group, of which I am chairperson, which meets regularly and will meet frequently during the Presidency.  Of course, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is a very important participant in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> We have not come to a decision on whether to appoint someone in Strasbourg, and I cannot say whether we will or not, but it is certainly an idea I will consider favourably.  I agree it is very important for each Minister to spend a great deal of time preparing for his or her appearance before Parliament during the Presidency.  Parliament is a great deal more powerful now in the scheme of things in Europe than it was during the last Irish Presidency.  Arrangements that might have been good and sufficient then are not necessarily good and sufficient now.  It is very important that appearances by Ministers before Parliament are treated with immense care and that immense preparation is put into them because the people who will question the Minister are experts in their field.  They have no other responsibilities except to become experts in the field of questioning to which they will subject the Minister, whereas the Ministers have other responsibilities.  It is very important to be very well prepared but whether that requires a resident person in Strasbourg or in Brussels or whether it can be handled in other ways is something I will consider carefully.  However, the overall thrust of Deputy Ahern's question is valid.</P>

During the last Presidency the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister responsible for co-ordinating matters within the Taoiseach's Department, the former Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, spent a week a month in Parliament during the Presidency and we had a representative resident there.  Given that Ireland will take over the Presidency in two months' time, the Taoiseach will have to tie down matters quickly having regard to the demands of parliamentary performance and associated committees, sub committees and delegations.  At a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges later today we will support Minister Quinn's initiative to use Leinster House and its precincts for the ECOFIN Council.  Will this House be used by other Ministers to hold meetings during the Presidency?</P>

      <P>On foot of the recommendations of the report, which were agreed by the Government, relevant local authority islands committees, in consultation with islanders and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, are preparing a programme of works to bring the level of access services to the offshore islands up to a socially desirable minimum standard. The programmes of work will reflect the priority needs of the islands concerned and will be submitted to the interdepartmental committee for consideration.</P>

Deputy McDowell can read all the details about offshore islands in the magnificent report which was recently published. However, I can give him a short summary. There are 42 offshore islands, 22 of which are inhabited and form part of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann.  This is the group recognised in the report and it has worked in partnership with the Department of the Taoiseach and the local authorities.  Great progress has been made since I became involved.</P>

Inishbofin Island in County Galway is part of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann and while it has excellent pier and berthing facilities the pier on the mainland which services the island from a passenger, mail, post and cargo point of view is in an appalling condition.

One of <Col N="1784" /> the first steps to be taken is that the Galway County Council island committee, which includes people from Inishbofin and the other island communities off the Galway coast, will prioritise the works which need to be undertaken this year to ensure safe access.  I am concerned about Inishbofin and have received a request to do something about the air services to the island.  This matter will also be looked at while the condition of Cleggan Pier will be favourably considered by the interdepartmental committee, assuming it is given priority by the Galway County Council island committee in the first instance.  During the dire winter of 1995 we gave the inhabitants of Inishbofin £30,000 to continue work on the community hall.  We are not unaware of the difficulties being experienced by these people.</P>

If one was not bound by constitutional impartiality one might ask, &ldquo;what is new?&rdquo; At the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs I said that there were two houses open on the island, which is totally different from two residents.  The more the population is reduced the more threatened it is and the more need there is to provide incentives to keep the inhabitants there.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5, 13 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> The matters which form the substance of these questions are the subject of a number of cases which are currently before the High Court and I, as Minister for Health, am one of the defendants.  I understand that on Friday last the President of the High Court fixed 8 October as the commencement date for the hearing of one of these cases.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is not a court of law and it would be inappropriate for it to encroach on the functions of the courts or the Judiciary.  As one of the defendants in these legal actions I am particularly constrained in what I can say to the House.  The legal rights of the plaintiff and the defendants in any legal action must be respected and there is an onus on me and all Members of the House to avoid comment which might prejudice the outcome of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I wish to refute the allegations that my colleague, Deputy O'Shea, Minister of State at the Department of Health, misled the Dáil in responding to a Dáil adjournment debate on 28 March 1996. In my press statement of 17 April 1996, I reiterated that there was no contradiction between his statement to the Dáil and the report of the expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I confirm that there is no such contradiction.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of confusion and misunderstanding in relation to the terms &ldquo;infective hepatitis&rdquo; and &ldquo;jaundice&rdquo;. On 25 February 1994 the Blood Transfusion Service Board informed the Department of Health in writing that the board had</P>
    <P>...been informed that the patient had an episode of jaundice early in the course of her treatment which led to an initial investigation of her hepatitis B status.</P>
    <P>The fact that this was the first time that my Department had been informed that a donor to the plasma pool used for the manufacture of the anti-D product had had an episode of jaundice was one of <Col N="1788" /> the principal reasons a decision was made by the then Minister for Health to establish on 4 March 1994 an expert group with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>(I)  To examine and report to the Minister for Health on the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)  all the circumstances surrounding the infection of the anti-D immunoglobulin product manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>(b)  the systems and standards in place for donor selection, the manufacturing process and use of the anti-D immunoglobulin produced by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>(II)  To make recommendations to the Minister for Health on the above matters and any other matters relating to the Blood Transfusion Service Board which the group consider necessary.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group was published by the Government on 5 April 1995.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, one of the principal reasons for establishing the expert group was the information given by the BTSB to the Department of Health in a letter of 25 February 1994.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that, at the time of the establishment of the expert group, that the Department of Health, the then Minister for Health and the members of the expert group were in no doubt that the donor to the plasma pool for the anti-D product had an episode of infective hepatitis.  If the donor's episode of jaundice was not related to infectious causes i.e. not infective hepatitis, it may not have been necessary for the expert group to consider this matter. Blood donors with a history of jaundice not related to infectious causes could be accepted as donors.  However, it must be pointed out that the diagnosis of the patient as &ldquo;infective hepatitis&rdquo; in November 1976 was a clinical diagnosis, i.e. <Col N="1789" /> an observational diagnosis.  Following this clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis, the BTSB sent samples of the donor's plasma to the UCD virology department and Middlesex Hospital, London for laboratory tests.  At the time, 1976-77, there was no routine test available for hepatitis A.  A routine test for hepatitis A was introduced in the virus reference laboratory at UCD in March 1981.  The hepatitis C virus was not described until 1989 and routine testing for hepatitis C was introduced by the BTSB in October 1991 when a scientifically reliable test was available.</P>
    <P>The donor's plasma tested negative for hepatitis B in both laboratories. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis was not confirmed by the laboratory tests.  However, while the BTSB, stopped using the donor's plasma following the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis, the board decided to resume using her plasma having apparently concluded that the jaundice/hepatitis was due to environmental factors.  I have been advised that the term &ldquo;jaundice related to environmental factors&rdquo; would generally be interpreted as meaning that the jaundice was caused, not by a blood borne virus, but rather by one of a number of factors such as poor hygiene or consumption of contaminated food or drink.</P>
    <P>The expert group at paragraph 6.11 in its report concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>In 1977, the BTSB had clear standards governing the selection of donors for (a) ordinary blood donors and (b) the male donor panel for anti-D production.  In both categories, the BTSB's standards prohibited the use of donors with a history of infectious hepatitis or jaundice of unknown origin. We consider that the BTSB should have applied those same standards to the 1976/77 female plasma exchange patient.  Her plasma would not have been accepted under the standards set down for the other categories of donor, and should not, we <Col N="1790" /> believe, have been used in the production of anti-D in 1976/77 after she had become jaundiced.</P>
    <P>The expert group on the BTSB carried out its work by meeting relevant individuals and groups and by requesting relevant documentation.  It requested meetings with interested parties and, in a small number of instances, individuals approached the group for a meeting.  In addition, it wrote on a number of occasions to the then chief medical consultant and the then chief executive officer of the BTSB for information on specific issues.  Where additional queries arose, the group invited individuals for further discussions.  The expert group did not seek each and every document in the BTSB.  It held its meetings and examined documentation between March 1994 and early January 1995.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, High Court proceedings have been initiated against the BTSB and others.  The file referred to by the Deputies is a BTSB internal file which was disclosed to the plaintiff by the BTSB in accordance with a High Court order.  The BTSB at no time forwarded any internal file to the Department of Health.  I would like to state unequivocally that there are no BTSB files in my Department.</P>
    <P>I understand, however, that attached to the affidavit sworn by the plaintiff's solicitors on 22 March, 1996, are Crumlin Hospital standard laboratory test request forms indicating the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis in November/December 1976.  As I have already mentioned, my Department and the expert group knew before the establishment of the expert group on 4 March 1994 that there was a clinical diagnosis for this donor of infective hepatitis in November 1976.  While the Crumlin Hospital standard laboratory test request forms attached to the affidavit sworn by the plaintiff's solicitors on 22 March 1996 were not seen by the expert group, it and the Department of Health were aware of the clinical diagnosis and the outcome of the subsequent laboratory tests, as I have <Col N="1791" /> already outlined.  When the information on the clinical diagnosis was given to my Department and to the expert group, documentary evidence in this regard was not sought or required for their purposes.</P>
    <P>In the light of the details which I have set out, I will deal now with the alleged contradictions between statements made by me and the Minister of State Deputy O'Shea, and reports in the media in recent days following the attendance of the chief executive of the BTSB at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday, 25 April. My officials have been in contact with the chief executive of the BTSB and the following is the position.</P>
    <P>The allegations in the media are to the effect that the expert group did not see a particular file and, therefore, were not fully informed on the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis of the donor to the plasma pool used in the manufacture of the anti-D product in 1976-77 and that the Minister of State had been presented with this file before he spoke in the Dáil on 28 March.</P>
    <P>While the file referred to by the chief executive officer of the BTSB at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts was not seen by the expert group, I reiterate that the expert group was fully informed and fully aware from the outset of its work of the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis in the light of the BTSB's letter of 25 February 1994 to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I understand that the chief executive officer of the BTSB told the Committee of Public Accounts that he was of the view that the Minister of State would have been aware of the existence of the file in question.  The fact is that the Minister of State, while aware of the existence of the file, had not seen the file.</P>
    <P>I outlined earlier in this reply that no internal file of the BTSB was ever forwarded to my Department.  However, as I have already mentioned there were a number of Crumlin Hospital standard laboratory test request forms attached <Col N="1792" /> to the affidavit sworn by the plaintiff's solicitors on 22 March 1996 and they form part of the current court proceedings. I have now been informed that these standard laboratory test request forms relating to the plasma donor form part of a particular file which has been discovered to the plaintiff's solicitors as part of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The expert group on the BTSB investigated fully the circumstances surrounding the contamination of the anti-D product.  The High Court proceedings which are fixed to commence on 8 October next will involve a judicial examination of and determination on this matter.  In the circumstances, to establish a special judicial inquiry would serve no useful purpose and would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to publish the papers which form the basis of the expert group report.  These documents are, for the greater part, documents from the BTSB to the expert group and were forwarded on a confidential basis.  They have, however, been disclosed in accordance with a High Court order in the course of the proceedings before the High Court.  Documents discovered in compliance with a court order can only be used by the parties to the proceedings for the purpose of the legal proceedings before the court.</P>
    <P>I have placed no restrictions on the members of the expert group to make public comments.  It would be inappropriate for me to do so.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, to date the compensation tribunal has received 342 applications and since its commencement has heard 44 cases.  The awards made to date by the tribunal range from £20,000 to £324,321 and no tribunal award has been rejected.  I understand that approximately £4.5 million has been awarded to date by the compensation tribunal.  The tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently as I had envisaged.  The closing date for applications is 17 June 1996.  The tribunal <Col N="1793" /> has hearing dates arranged until 18 June 1996.</P>

      <P>Much of what the Minister said was extraordinary, but one sentence in particular, &ldquo;While aware of the existence of the particular file, the Minister of State had not seen it&rdquo;.  I doubt if any other issue has received as much publicity and been the subject of as much questioning as this one.  It is extraordinary that a Minister would be aware of the existence of a file and not ask to see it.  Is it not a fact that the file would never have come to light were it not for the fact that the Roe case is before the courts?  Why was the expert group not given every document relating to the 1976 case?  Who made it aware that the woman in question had been clinically diagnosed with infective hepatitis?  Does the Minister regard jaundice as being the same as hepatitis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East</i>): The courts will hear the case on the initial plaintiff on 8 October.  There is a statement of claim of which the Deputy is well aware as she quoted extensively from it during the Adjournment Debate to which the Minister of State replied.  It seems that, in parallel to running the case in the courts on 8 October, an attempt is being made to run it in the media also.  That puts me in a difficult position because I am not commenting on third party activities, but a defendant in the case.  That is the context in which I am replying.</P>
      <P>As to definitions, as I understand it, there is hepatitis A, B and C, all of which are mentioned in the report.  In more recent years it has run further up the alphabet.  In the 1970s there was a test for hepatitis B which is transmitted through blood.  Consequently, if a person had hepatitis B, blood was not taken or given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hepatitis A, on the other hand, is contracted, for example, by children in school if they do not wash their hands after being to the bathroom or eat contaminated food.  The symptoms include <Col N="1794" /> diahorrea.  It is not transmitted through blood, but environmentally from one to the other on touch or contact.</P>
    <P>Jaundice is a symptom of both, when there is a liver problem, and can occur for a variety of causes.  As I understand it, it is and was the practice in the 1970s to talk in terms of hepatitis A and environmental jaundice as being synonymous. They were also called infective or infectious hepatitis.  Hepatitis B was the one everyone was looking out and testing for.  It was also called infective hepatitis.</P>
    <P>What happened was that a woman was seen in Crumlin Hospital suffering from particular ailments.  Her plasma could have been used in the manufacture of the anti-D product.  Her clinician made a clinical diagnosis that because she had jaundice it was infective hepatitis. Blood samples were taken and sent to the viral laboratory in UCD and Middlesex Hospital and found to be negative.  Rightly or wrongly, it seems that the Blood Transfusion Service Board concluded, by a process of exclusion, that since it was not hepatitis B it was hepatitis A, also called environmental jaundice.</P>
    <P>In its prudence, Middlesex Hospital kept archive samples of everything that had been sent to it for testing, including the samples from Dublin.  In 1989, hepatitis C was established as a separate strain under laboratory conditions. There was no routine test available until later.  In 1991 the Blood Transfusion Service Board began to use a routine test to exclude any donor who had contracted it.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report, the key element is that Middlesex Hospital retested the archive samples and wrote back to the chief medical consultant of the Blood Transfusion Service Board stating that it had solved the mystery of 1976-77 &mdash; it was hepatitis C.  The Deputy is aware of the sequence and what the report concludes on that aspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> The charge being laid at the Minister of State who does not have responsibility for this area in the Department &mdash; he filled in for me on the night by reading out a script &mdash; is that because the dockets from Crumlin Hospital, which the solicitors have attached to the affidavit, were not seen by the expert group, it did not know what it was doing.  It had full and complete knowledge that it was infective hepatitis and that it was, as it thought from the letter it was studying, the hepatitis B status of the woman concerned that was in question. If the Deputy reads the report carefully, she will see that it does not draw conclusions.</P>
    <P>I think everybody knows that unless liability is established before the courts damages will not be paid and unless negligence is proved there is no liability. I object strongly to this being run in the media to establish a certain atmosphere rather than allowing the courts to examine every aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware of the existence of a file in the way the public is aware of it.  The solicitors running the action looked for a change in the statement of claim.  They could quite easily have written a letter to the Chief State Solicitor and secured it by agreement, but decided instead to turn it into a media occasion.  We read in the newspapers that there was a new file of some significance, but all it contains are test dockets from Crumlin Hospital which state that the clinical diagnosis was infective hepatitis.  It seems that the samples were sent from Crumlin Hospital to the Blood Transfusion Service Board for testing.</P>
    <P>The essential point is that the expert group, under Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien, had all the information available. The Deputy is aware of this because she was a member of the Cabinet at the time.  During the 12 months Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien and the expert group examined the matter my colleague and the Deputy's former colleague, Deputy Howlin, then Minister for Health, kept the Cabinet briefed.  It <Col N="1796" /> is wrong to suggest that anyone was kept in the dark.</P>
    <P>All the documents were not provided to the expert group because that was not the way it proceeded.  It was an informal group which proceeded informally as it did not have judicial authority or anything like it.  It started to ask questions and interviewed people around at the time.  It also asked to see relevant documents, but the event which triggered the inquiry was the letter, dated 25 February 1994, from the Blood Transfusion Service Board to the Department of Health.  That letter which stated, &ldquo;being informed that the patient had an episode of jaundice early in the course of her treatment&rdquo;, led to an official investigation of hepatitis B status.  That is why the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, went into Cabinet and sought an inquiry.  There is no question of anybody fooling anyone. There are thousands of documents in this case, affidavits in the court and discovered documents.  This file came up as a result of a discovery of documents. The new people I appointed to the Blood Transfusion Service Board, and the chairman of the board, said they did not know about the file when they got it, so they sent it off with the rest of the documents.  The solicitors for the plaintiffs have it and any other relevant person can get it by application.</P>
    <P>We should not attempt to try this matter here nor should we try to accuse the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea, of a coverup or of scandalous behavour.  This is a dreadful situation for the people involved and for the victims.  It is difficult to deal with it but we are trying to do so as sympathetically and fairly as possible.  However, I cannot do the work of the High Court here; it must be done in the High Court.  Anything I say here today will be used as evidence on 8 October and anything Deputies say they know could result in them being called as witnesses.  There is an attempt to run this matter in a couple of locations, but I am happy to let it run in the High Court.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we would not have known about the clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis but for the court proceedings? Despite the fact that the Minister set up an inquiry to look into this matter, the important fact that donor X had infectious hepatitis would not have been revealed to the public but for the legal discovery of documents.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to suggest there was some confusion about the difference between jaundice and infective hepatitis.  I remind the Minister that the expert group consisted of a professor of haematology, a lecturer in microbiology and Dr. Hederman O'Brien.  Would the Minister not accept that had they seen this file and strong documentary evidence of infectious hepatitis in donor X, their conclusion would have been different? They could not have concluded, as they did, that the infection was due to jaundice by environmental factors. Their conclusion is flawed because information was withheld from them. The Minister said they were aware of it. How were they aware of it if they did not see documentary evidence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East</i>): If Deputies read the report in full, they will see that its conclusion is that the woman had hepatitis C in 1976.  They do not suggest the consequences of that; the report speaks for itself.  It is not true that the conclusion is that it was environmental jaundice.  The people in the Blood Transfusion Service Board arrived at that conclusion in the 1970s. It was a wrong conclusion because when the test results came through in 1989-90, <Col N="1798" /> it was clear it was hepatitis C.  There is no problem about it.  They knew they were dealing with infective hepatitis. One of the documents they had was the letter from the Blood Transfusion Service Board to the Department of Health, which triggered the inquiry and the investigation of the hepatitis B status &mdash; that is, infective hepatitis.  If they are called as witnesses, I have no doubt they will say they knew exactly what they were dealing with and that they were not relying on the documents from the Crumlin hospital.</P>
      <P>A clinical diagnosis arises from a doctor looking at somebody.  Many doctors make clinical diagnoses and they are proved wrong when tested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East</i>): I will explain that statement; I am not making a charge.  The doctor said he looked at the woman who had jaundice and concluded it was infective hepatitis.  Tests for infective hepatitis B, proved negative. They concluded by exclusion that it was environmental jaundice, also called hepatitis A.  However, they were wrong because, as is shown in the report, it was hepatitis C which caused all the problems.</P>
      <P>People are trying to lay charges against us on the basis that there is new information which would have changed the conclusions of the expert group. Anybody who reads the report of the expert group knows they were talking about an investigation into infective hepatitis.  They do not conclude erroneously that it was jaundice; they described the conclusion arrived at by the BTSB at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not say there was any confusion about the terms.  There are various forms of hepatitis.  Hepatitis B was being tested for in the 1970s as a matter of course by all blood services and it was known that it was transferred through blood.  Any donor would be excluded if they had had it and blood would be <Col N="1799" /> excluded if it was infected.  All blood services look at the case history of a donor and if the donor says he had hepatitis A, he is excluded.  However, they do not test for it as a matter of routine because it is not passed through the blood and it clears the system in a couple of days.  There were no routine tests for hepatitis A until 1981.  Hepatitis C was not established until 1989 and there was no routine test until 1991.</P>
    <P>I have explained the situation as well as I can, but I cannot try the High Court case here.  Many allegations will be made.  A statement of claim is innumerable allegations and they will be defended by the defendants in court, but they will not be defended in public before the case arrives in court.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on the continued use of the product after 1991?  If the Minister was infected with hepatitis and he <Col N="1800" /> now had a life threatening disease and severe liver damage, would he not want to know, and would it not be proper for him to be told, from where the infection came, who was told about the blood product, what standards were involved to prevent this happening, were they applied and by whom and, if they were not applied, why?  Would he not be entitled to get every piece of information relating to his health and to the fact that a State company infected him with a life threatening disease?  If I was infected with hepatitis C, I would want to know that.</P>
      <P>Since the Dr. Hederman-O'Brien report was published, we have had questions on Question Time, special notice questions, questions on the Adjournment and questions before the Select Committee on Social Affairs.

There is no jury in this case and, therefore, we will not influence a member of the public who might be a juror.  We are entitled to the fullest, frankest and most open information from the Minister.  All the men, women and children who are the victims of hepatitis C must be told the facts relating to it.  I presume the Minister will have no difficulty with the fact that we will be inviting Dr. Hederman-O'Brien and the members of her expert group to come before the Select Committee on Social Affairs to establish the facts as between Mr. Dunbar's evidence before the committee, what was stated in this House recently and today and what Dr. Hederman-O'Brien was shown when a member of the expert group.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): The first part of the question presents the difficulty.  The Deputy is asking me to comment on what I think about continuing to give anti-D products after 1991. That matter is at the centre of the High Court case of 8 October and any comment I make as a defendant is evidential in nature.  I agree with the Deputy that anybody who is a victim is entitled to all <Col N="1801" /> relevant information.  The Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report gives an enormous amount of information.  In the various debates here and during Question Time I have tried, where I had extra detail, to add to what is a succinct report, but what I cannot do, and which Deputies want me to do, is to draw conclusions from that information about liability or negligence.  Deputies continue to ask what I think and who is to blame.  People are entitled to know every detail which resulted in their present medical condition, and that will happen in the High Court.</P>
      <P>There is a procedure where innumerable documents have been discovered and they are being examined by legal teams.  A novel procedure is being invoked where a series of questions are put to the BTSB and it will deal with them.  Deputy McDowell probably has the legal term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): That procedure, which is unusual, will form the next phase and eventually the matter will go to court where experts will be called.  I can provide as much detail as possible, but I will not be able to draw a conclusion.  Questions such as who is to blame, if anybody is to blame, whether there was negligence and if there is liability, form the core of the High Court case.  Even if I were not a defendant I could not go down that road and neither can any other Deputy.  I inherited this problem and I have done my best to sort it out, but I can only do the work of a Minister and parliamentarian; I cannot do the work of a court. I am, however, facilitating the work of a court and will not inhibit it in any way whatever.  In the case of court orders every co-operation will be given.  People worked day and night over weekends and during Easter and discovered documents. Full co-operation was given despite the fact that a Civil Service industrial dispute was in progress.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the fact that the court is seized of this matter and the respective rights of the defendant and the plaintiffs are being adjudicated on by the courts means the public interest is not being considered?  Deputies on all sides of the House have the public interest at heart and that is the purpose of this Question Time.  Will the Minister agree that in all the contributions made by him and the Minister of State to the House in this entire matter nowhere was there an admission that donor X had infectious hepatitis and that that fact was disclosed only because of the court proceedings? Will the Minister accept that that fact alters the position relating to liability and culpability because it goes to the core of the issue?  The conclusions of the Hederman-O'Brien report would have been starkly different if that information had been given.  Is the Minister saying that the recent disclosure in the High Court is of no consequence and nothing new?  Is he saying that the recent discovery that donor X had infectious hepatitis and that as far back as 1976 the BTSB knew it is of no consequence in terms of liability and culpability?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): I do not think the Deputy has read the report <Col N="1803" /> fully.  The expert group concluded nothing other than that the cause of the infection was infective hepatitis C.  The donor had hepatitis C, the same infection suffered by all the women involved. That information was not known at the time because there was no test for hepatitis C.  The test was for hepatitis B, the infective hepatitis which was common at the time.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): When the doctor examined the woman she had jaundice and he concluded that it was either hepatitis A or hepatitis B.  Blood samples were sent for testing in two laboratories and hepatitis B was excluded, resulting in diagnosis by exclusion. However, that was wrong.  The problem was not environmental jaundice or hepatitis A, it was hepatitis C.  In hindsight, with different medical practices, we all know about hepatitis C.  One of the questions that will arise in court is what did people know at the time and what should they have known.  It is not for me to recite that, it will be tested in the High Court.  Deputy O'Donnell argues from a wrong premise and I ask her to read the report in full.  There is no doubt that Miriam Hederman-O'Brien's group, including a haematologist as well as others, knew exactly what they were inquiring into and why the inquiry was <Col N="1804" /> set up because they had the initial documents. I am aware that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn could not possibly, in a busy Department, remember the activity in other Departments, but the Government of the day was briefed on these matters.</P>

The Minister has more or less agreed the file would not have become knowledge were it not for the fact that the court case is proceeding.  That is a scandal.  All the information and documentation relating to this matter should have been brought to the attention of the expert group and should have been provided to the Minister and Minister of State.  It is extraordinary that the Minister of State, while aware of the existence of the file, had not looked for it or seen it &mdash; I accept the Minister's word on that.  Was the file made available to the tribunal, about which I always said I have serious doubts?  Was any background information given directly by a civil servant in the Department or by anybody connected to the Department or to the Minister or Minister of State to others in the public domain to encourage and put pressure on victims of hepatitis C to go the tribunal route as opposed to the courts?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): A new file came up as a result of a High Court search.  It was provided by way of discovery to Ivor Fitzpatrick &amp; Co., Solicitors, who are the solicitors for the plaintiff. In that file there are dockets from Crumlin Hospital sent to the BTSB where it requested tests on the blood of the woman about whom we are talking. On the docket &ldquo;clinical diagnosis&rdquo; is in print and after that is written &ldquo;infective hepatitis&rdquo;.  That was what the doctor thought it was.  However, when they tested subsequently in the viral laboratory in UCD and in Middlesex they found it was not hepatitis B and went back to using her plasma.</P>
      <P>The inquiry produced a fine report. The Deputy has the statement of claim because she quoted from it.  If she goes through the statement of claim she will find that practically everything claimed is taken directly from this report in respect of the BTSB, the drugs board and the Department of Health.  It is all there in the report and it is a very good quality report.

I have given them a double option in the terms of reference of the tribunal.

      <P>In response to recent concerns regarding Goldenbridge and St. Kryan's, Rathdrum, the Eastern Health Board established a helpline which remained open between 29 February and 2 March 1996.  A total of 150 calls were received &mdash; 103 on the first day, 46 on the second day and one on the third day.</P>
      <P>Where it was requested callers were referred for counselling.  The majority were referred to the independent counselling services established by the Sisters of Mercy.  In addition a social worker has been assigned on a full-time basis to deal with the complaints, concerns and needs of former residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other health boards have also responded positively to the increase in calls from victims of past abuse by the provision, <i>inter alia,</i> of help-lines, counselling and support services.  Arising from discussions between senior officials of my Department and the health board chief executive officers, a <Col N="1809" /> joint response to help victims of past abuse is being prepared by the health boards, the details of which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>There is a Garda investigation in progress concerning the allegations in regard to Goldenbridge.  In these circumstances, I have no plans to initiate an inquiry into the conflicting statements concerning the experiences of former residents.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  As Minister for Health, does he approve of trial by television? In effect, that is what is happening in relation to the Goldenbridge affair.  We had the original &ldquo;Dear Daughter&rdquo; programme and then we had a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.  On a personal basis, I regret that.  The information required and the scene that should be set to ensure victims on both sides are able to come forward and put their views would best be done in an independent private way which would allow for the huge stress, strain and high emotion which exists in relation to Goldenbridge.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider that, rather than allowing a trial by television to continue, he should in consultation with the Minister for Education arrange for an independent inquiry where both sides in the Goldenbridge affair could put their cases?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether the Eastern Health Board should give, through the Department of Health, a substantial increase in resources to the rape crisis centres which have to deal with the majority of the victims of incidents such as those which occurred in Goldenbridge?</P>

In that context the Garda are conducting a criminal investigation into the allegations that have been made about Goldenbridge.

As I understand it, when the authorities in the Mercy Order became aware that alleged problems had occurred, to put it at its mildest, in Goldenbridge, they requested an independent third party to carry out an in-house investigation to establish as many of the facts as possible. I understand they kept the Garda informed of that investigation.  That was prior to the Louis Lentin programme.  I do not know at what point that was formalised although I am informed now that a Garda investigation is continuing. I am not competent to say whether last week's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme was prejudicial to the inquiry but if people <Col N="1811" /> have a problem, the recourse is not to the Department of Health in regard to such issues.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): I met a delegation from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre recently but I substantially increased allocations to the rape crisis centres around the country, particularly in 1995 when the total increases were in the order of 38 per cent.  The pressure on the rape crisis centres should be relieved somewhat and the position is being examined to see if it would be appropriate for the health boards, as a matter of routine, to provide helpline and counselling services to people who were in orphanages around the country <Col N="1812" /> and might be in need of such facilities and to do that as part of the public health service.  The chief executive officers are examining this matter and I will report back to the House on it in due course.  It is important to point out that we are not dealing with the difficulties of children in care; we are dealing with adults, many of whom are in their 40s or 50s, who have difficulties as adults as a result of what happened when they were in care.  Obviously the intervention will not be along the lines of the Child Care Act; it is an intervention for adults who have difficulties.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 15:</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for the allowance for security alarms to be claimed by a relative of the elderly person.  From what the Minister said on Committee Stage, it appears there is not any need to insert the phrase &ldquo;son or daughter&rdquo; because the term &ldquo;relative&rdquo; in the Bill would include a son, daughter or others.  On that understanding, I will not press the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I raised with the Minister the question of personal alarms, including lockets worn around the neck.  I queried whether the definition of an alarm system provided for in the section actually covers such a system, because the Bill states that it is &ldquo;an electrical apparatus which, when activated, is designed to give notice to the effect that there is an intruder present or attempting to enter the premises in which it is installed&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the definition is not apt to cover systems which elderly people could carry on them which can be used for other purposes, such as those which summon help in the case of illness or which can be carried outside the premises so an elderly person on a farm can go out of their home.  I want the Minister to confirm that such a system, that is, a portable object for an elderly person by which they can summon aid, which has nothing <Col N="1896" /> to do with a system installed in the house to detect intruders, will be covered by this provision.  It is important that we should have clarity on that point.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the comments made by Deputy McCreevy confirming that the amendment in his and his colleague's name is redundant because the word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; embraces both son and daughter and other close relatives.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say to Deputy Michael McDowell that in the spirit and intellectual tradition of <i>Humanae Vitae,</i> which is equally concerned with human life, a broad and liberal interpretation would be made with respect to the purposes and uses for which an alarm system is purchased and applied.  The definition of a personal alarm system which is designed to enhance the personal security of an individual from whatever source of danger will be liberally interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>We are not just talking exclusively about intruders; we are talking about securing elderly people living alone in a manner which they require.  They may need assistance for an unforeseen medical problem.  If the person has an alarm system to alert other people to the danger which the person is confronting, that will be suitably interpreted.  That is the intention of the Revenue Commissioners. I hope it addresses the concerns which are shared by every Member of this House.</P>

      <P>I represent a rural constituency in which many elderly people live alone and in which there have been many robberies, including some fatal attacks on elderly people. A number of people are working closely with the Irish Association for Victim Support.  They are not involved in the provision of a security system but they are involved with two private companies in the provision of a telephone alert system which is not referred to anywhere as a security or alarm system.  The telephone alert system enables the elderly <Col N="1897" /> person living alone to summon the Garda, a neighbour, a member of the family, a priest or a doctor, that is, somebody who is in a responsible position. It is not called an alarm.  Knowing how tightly the Revenue Commissioners interpret words and how carefully they listen to what their Minister says and agrees to in this House, can I get agreement and an assurance from the Minister that such a system will be included?</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I replied prior to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's intervention.  I was not aware that she intended intervening &mdash; I should have anticipated that.  I am happy to confirm that her interpretation is correct and that, subject to the normal safeguards, a system, which has elements of an alarm/alert electronic component designed to enhance the personal security of people living alone with which they can communicate their sense of distress, isolation or jeopardy from whatever source, be it medical or otherwise, <Col N="1898" /> will be liberally interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the Revenue Commissioners must interpret the law as it is written and they will inform themselves on the basis of what is law and precedent, but there is room for discretion here.  As a Member of this House with some experience, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has asked me to clarify what I mean by this section.  I think I have amply clarified my interpretation to her satisfaction.</P>
      <P>I hope there are no difficulties with the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not believe the section needs to be rewritten in any way.  However, if it is not satisfactory and we run into difficulties, I undertake to clarify it next year.</P>

Generally, in such matters, the Revenue Commissioners interpret the law in a generous fashion.  Hopefully, a large number of people throughout the country will avail of this tax relief.  I know there will be a certain loss to the Exchequer and the Minister for Finance always says he must always guard the public purse, but as this is one area which will be instrumental in developing social policy, I am sure there will be long-term savings to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6. &mdash;If a claimant proves that for the year of assessment he/she is employing an individual to care for his/her dependent children, the income tax to be charged on the claimant for that year of assessment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the appropriate percentage of the payments proved to be so made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, put forward this amendment on Committee Stage, as he did last year, in order to recognise the expense in which people working outside the home must involve themselves.  I know a number of Members of this House would agree with this suggestion.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment would be to allow a tax deduction against the taxpayer's income for payments, subject to an appropriate limit, the person must make in order to be able to work outside the home.  It would be of most benefit to women who usually must bear childminding expenses in order to be able to work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Ahern and I have said on previous occasions that there would be some spin-off to the Exchequer on the positive side too.  It is true to say that if they had to register themselves as being an employee, for instance, who looks after children, it would probably not be worth many people's time.  Many of these people are not registered as employers or employees.  The reluctance in that regard would come more from employees than from employers because people employed in this activity are often regarded as adult dependants on their husbands' social welfare claim, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many employers would like to build up an insurance record for their employees.  As Deputy Michael McDowell pointed out on Committee <Col N="1900" /> Stage with regard to his individual circumstances, he would not be prepared to take the chance.  As the employment laws have been developed and people have become more litigious and aware of their rights, a large number of people who have women taking care of their children in the home and who are not registered as employers and deducting PAYE and PRSI would prefer to have the matter legitimised.  They know if they do this, their employee will walk away.  They are then in the dilemma of trying to decide what to do if anything happens.  I am aware of cases from my own professional experience where the employee was satisfied for a long number of years to accept gross pay and remain outside the tax net.  For one reason or another when they decided not to work the employer received a letter, followed by a visit from the local officer of the Department of Social Welfare, to say the person had employed Mrs. X or Mrs. Y and that it did not have an insurance contribution.  This is tough luck on the employer because responsibility for registration does not rest with the employee.</P>
    <P>This rule which applies to all organisations would be of considerable benefit to women who have to go out to work or who have decided for their own reasons to remain in their profession. Speaking on the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 1996, last evening we remarked on the changed circumstances from the 1950s to the 1970s regarding the marriage bar in the public service.  The attitudes which prevailed then are long outdated.  I know the Minister is committed to greater participation by women in the work-force. If this amendment were accepted, there would be spin-offs and a gain to the Exchequer.  For those and other reasons I commend this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy McCreevy.  This is really a women's issue because the vast majority of people who require child minders or housekeepers are women and virtually all the people who take up <Col N="1901" /> the employment are women, many of whom are married and find it difficult to become involved in a full-time capacity in the workplace in any other type of employment.  Many of these women may not have had the opportunity, which their families now enjoy, of having an education for the work-force and to be able to take up the kind of fulfilling employment which many of their sisters may enjoy.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy is correct when he said that many of the women employees chose not to be registered and not to be part of the mainstream of the tax net. They are concerned that they will be penalised in some way and that it will not be worth their while to take up such employment.  Many of these women take up this type of employment from economic necessity to pay the mortgage and various other bills.  Sometimes that employment is on a three day week, on a part-time basis rather than in a full-time capacity.  At a time when all of us in the House are concerned, when there is a public outcry about child care facilities, the type of care we give our children and the rightful concerns we should have in relation to the people who mind them, this would be a timely amendment to the Finance Bill.  It would also encourage something we all want &mdash; a register of child minders. When one views what is happening in areas of residential child care and other aspects of child care, it is timely to provide such a register.  I do not believe we will have a true register until we have a facility such as that put forward in Deputy McCreevy's amendment which I strongly support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an extensive discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and I do not want to repeat at length what I said there.  This is an area which requires careful thought and consideration. I listened last night to the debate on the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill proposed by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Avril Doyle, who said two Departments were getting créche <Col N="1902" /> facilities.  It is great for the people in those Departments who are getting such facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but other people have to provide the same facilities out of their own pocket.  I presume the flint-hearted Minister for Finance will not charge anybody BIK on créche facilities being made available by their employers.  If it is not a benefit in kind in the hands of some people, it is harsh to say to other people who have to provide similar facilities at their own expense that they get nothing by way of acknowledgement that one of the consequences of their having to work is that they incur an expenditure of this kind. This is something that should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To keep people honest and to regulate the situation, it is out of the question to expect a married woman, or a married man for that matter, to fill out P60s and to deal with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to what goes on in their own house.  It is crazy.  I know this because I am happily married to someone who is competent to do these things and I never have to worry about them.  On one occasion I did have to worry because due to the particular circumstances I had to address my mind to a particular set of documentation and I nearly freaked.  I could not work out even how to start to compute all that has been done.  It is unfair to put an onus on ordinary people in their domestic existence for which other people require accountants to help them.  I do not think the average person can fill out the annual documentation required by the Department of Social Welfare.  Certainly, it is not made simple.  I reiterate that there is a certain category of employment in and around the home which should be the subject of a simple one page document and a flat sum which can be sent off without having to calculate percentages.  That should be the end of the matter and the person's position regularised.  That could easily <Col N="1903" /> be done if there was a will to do it. Many men and women want to behave in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy McCreevy.  If many people said they would obey the law, the employee would walk out the door immediately. Employers are forced into a position where they cannot legally do what they are obliged to do because of economic circumstances &mdash; Deputy Geoghegan Quinn made the point &mdash; to pay the mortgage.  They cannot comply with the law and at the same time do the right thing by their family.  I ask the Minister to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Employment in the home is recognised as special from the point of view that the Unfair Dismissals Act does not apply to it.  If a person sacks her child-minder she cannot be brought before an equality appeals tribunal and made to pay compensation.  This is sensible in that one could not possibly have people litigating about whether they were rude or abusive to their child minder in the home.  That kind of litigation would not make sense because the relationship is too close to have people going to law and forcing each other to employ each other and so on.  From a tax and social insurance point of view a different regime should apply.  The Government wants to encourage progressive employers to provide créches and knows there are many employees whose employers do not provide such facilities. If a créche is not regarded as a benefit in kind for a mother or father at work, it seems to follow that some relief should be given to a person who, out of their own pocket, has to put themselves in the same position as they would be if their employer was progressive enough to provide a créche.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate that this will be the subject of a special study in his Department to give justice to ordinary people who are trying to cope with an unfair situation.  If I cannot &mdash; and I <Col N="1904" /> consider myself reasonably well educated &mdash; make head or tail of the documentation which is required in respect of one of those types of employment, I do not think the vast majority of people can.  It is unfair in those circumstances to cast on them the onus of either going to an accountant or simply cheating to fulfil what are definitely reasonable family requirements in respect of help in the home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I am sure the Minister knows the problem is much wider and it involves defining social employment.  In addressing this problem, we must deal with the complexities of our historic interpretation of employment.  There are no easy answers and we must not complicate matters for employers or employees.</P>
      <P>We are not trying to penalise women who earn a few bob minding children, as such income makes an enormous difference to the living standards of families on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the difference between comfort and pain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Most parents are aware of the difference it can make to a family.  It also has beneficial knock-on effects in that children from different backgrounds interact and share knowledge. Some great friendships have developed from such child minding.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the difficulties the Minister outlined on Committee Stage and I am sure he will not accept this amendment.  However, it highlights a wider problem in our tax law which he must address.  While I accept the argument about people who set up businesses and care for large numbers of children.  I am concerned that many of them may not be qualified and may not adhere to proper safety standards. There is an urgent need to set up a national register of people involved in child minding, particularly those running businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we may not be able to deal with these problems today, we must deal with them in the future.  At the <Col N="1905" /> same time, we must have regard for those who need to earn extra money. Child minding involves the productive use of money and people benefit from it.  As the Minister said, small sums of money can make a difference between pain and normal living standards.  We must create the environment to allow that happen with the least amount of bureaucracy and red tape and employers and employees should benefit. I do not propose to address the sweeping changes that are taking place in Europe &mdash; house husbands and so on. I support this amendment which deals with the much broader issue of tax law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex area. Some of us may recall a time in our childhood &mdash; I am fortunate enough to be able to do so &mdash; when our parents were in a position to employ a person to live in and mind the children.  This involved the simple obligation to buy a stamp in a post office once a week which the employee placed in a book which she carried to all other places of employment.  It was a flat rate stamp, not pay related, and the employee and employer were in the system.  It was a non-bureaucratic transaction involving the type of work which provided a good deal of employment and, in my case, many happy memories.  The present system is complex and must be simplified, but not in a way that would diminish employees' entitlements.  Time has moved on and we are not talking about the type of relationships that existed 40 or more years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To alleviate the concerns of Deputy McDowell and others about benefit-in-kind, the créche that will be established in this complex later in the year will be open to Members and staff of the House on a first come first served basis, although some priority may be given to Members.  Benefit-in-kind will not apply because the parents of the children who are cared for in the créche will pay the going market rate.  The only facility provided will be the capital resources to set up the créche which is a standard procedure modelled on the créche facilities <Col N="1906" /> in Aer Rianta and elsewhere.  The Revenue Commissioners do not deem it a benefit-in-kind no more than the subsidised canteens in Irish Life or Dublin Corporation.  The capital infrastructure will be put in place by the employer or the sponsoring organisation following which the operation will be run on a pay-as-you-go basis, similar to the system in the restaurant.</P>

      <P>We will not be able to address this problem on Report Stage, but Deputies have put down markers in this regard. The matter must be addressed for a number of reasons.  We have heard horror stories about child care and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn correctly referred to the need for a register.  There is a necessity, a vocational desire, an economic obligation, or a combination of all three, for parents, particularly women, to keep a foot in the labour market. Many people in the public service who want to have a family &mdash; a fairly natural inclination &mdash; would like to spend time with their children at the crucial stages in their formation and retain the right to return to work.  Public service labour market laws are very rigid in this regard. People can job-share on a week-on week-off or morning-afternoon basis, but perhaps we should introduce job-sharing on a three year out basis with back to back deals.  There should be more flexibility in this area.  This is not a taxation issue, but a question of regulating the labour market to ensure people who wish to remain in the white economy can do so.</P>

    <P>It should enable people in the black economy who wish to do so to come out <Col N="1907" /> and work as a childminder in five different households on five days of the week and legitimately accumulate social welfare entitlements, while at the same time their five separate employers are kept on-side and are also tax and legally compliant.  Frankly, it is extremely complex to be compliant in that regard &mdash; and I have had direct experience of this. Many people give up and pay in cash.</P>
    <P>There are some people who do not want to come out of the black economy because it suits them better.  There is a separate issue which we addressed earlier in the context of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of going down what Deputy Cullen described on Committee Stage as the Scandinavian road of focusing entirely on away-from-home créches for very young children. People are having second thoughts after 30 years about whether this is the right kind of model &mdash; I have encountered this briefly with people who have experience of Scandinavia.  There are questions about whether people want to have their child in a créche at nine months of age as distinct from having somebody come to the house to mind the child or transferring the child to the company of other children across the street to be minded by somebody who is minding children anyway.  The turn-of-the century practice of putting a child into a créche from three months to four years of age and then into primary school, the classical model that we all seem to start with, is generating sufficient reservations among many people for us to say that we should not assume this model to be necessarily a valid one. It may be valid for some, but not for all.</P>
    <P>For obvious reasons I cannot accept the amendments, and I do not think the Deputies opposite are pressing them. We need to work at this, and the taxation component is only part of it.  We need to have flexibility in the labour market and in terms of contracts of employment.  We should not overburden small employers with additional responsibilities because they do not have the numbers to provide the cover associated with this.  We need also to <Col N="1908" /> simplify our bureaucratic systems.  All those things go above and beyond the realm of tax.</P>
    <P>My instinct is to give a tax allowance for the purposes of childminding if, all other things being equal, that has the consequential effect of generating additional legitimate employment. Otherwise it would be virtually impossible to justify and there would be great objection to creating a bias in favour of two people working outside the home by giving them an additional tax relief, while giving no such tax relief to somebody who has opted to stay at home for a number of years, foregoing the external income he or she could earn.  There are horrendous complications which we discussed at some length on Committee Stage.  Having regard to a famous speech delivered not a million miles away from here in the National Gallery, there are some colleagues in Government who could put legs, wings and arms to that debate and give it a very legitimate sense of concern.</P>
    <P>I will undertake to look at the question. We asked the tax strategy group to look at it last year, but they were not conclusive in their recommendations.  If the parties opposite have contributions to make, we will certainly listen, but there is no simple answer to this.  I will undertake to make the bureaucratic requirements associated with the current law easier to comply with.</P>

We had a wide-ranging debate and contributions from Members which covered a broad spectrum of socio-economics, not just taxation measures.  I know the Minister will look at this matter as favourably as possible not just because of the tax implications but because of the social implications.  When more thought has been given to the matter, I would envisage a Minister for Finance coming forward in the future with a proposal such as mine.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;academic year&rsquo;, in relation to an approved course, means a year of study commencing on a date not earlier than the 1st day of August in a year of assessment;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" />&lsquo;approved college&rsquo;, in relation to a year of assessment, means</P>
    <P>(a)  an institution which provides courses to which a scheme approved by the Minister under the Local Authority (Higher Education) Grants Acts, 1968 to 1992, applies, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a college approved of by the Minister for the purposes of section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;approved course&rsquo; means a part-time undergraduate course of study in an approved college which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) is of at least 2 academic years duration, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a course provided by a college to which paragraph (b) of the definition of approved college relates, the Minister, having regard to a code of standards which, from time to time, may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be laid down by the Minister in relation to the quality of education to be offered on such approved course, approves of for the purposes of this section;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the Minister&rsquo; means the Minister for Education;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;qualifying fees&rsquo;, in relation to an approved course and an academic year, means the amount of fees chargeable in respect of tuition to be provided in relation to that course in that year and which, in relation to a course to which paragraph (b) of the definition of approved course relates, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, approves of for the purposes of this section;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;qualifying individual&rsquo; means an individual other than an individual who has been conferred with a certificate, diploma or degree in respect of the completion by him or her of an undergraduate course of study of not less than 2 academic years duration.</P>
    <P>(2) (a)  Subject to the provisions of this section, where, for a year of assessment (being the year 1996-97 or <Col N="1914" /> a subsequent year of assessment), a qualifying individual makes a claim in that behalf, makes a return in the prescribed form of his or her total income and proves that he or she has on his or her own behalf made a payment in respect of qualifying fees in respect of an approved course for the academic year in relation to that course commencing in that year of assessment, the income tax to be charged on the qualifying individual for that year of assessment, other than in accordance with section 5 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, shall be reduced by an amount which is the lesser of</P>
    <P>(i)  the amount equal to the appropriate percentage of the aggregate of all such payments proved to be so made, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the amount which reduces that income tax to nil.</P>
    <P>(b)  In this subsection &lsquo;appropriate percentage&rsquo;, in relation to a year of assessment, means a percentage equal to the standard rate of tax for that year.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section a payment in respect of qualifying fees shall be regarded as not having been made in so far as any sum, in respect of or by reference to such fees, has been or is to be received either directly or indirectly by the qualifying individual from any source whatsoever by way of grant, scholarship or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(4) (a)  Where the Minister is satisfied that a college, within the meaning of paragraph (b) of the definition of approved college, or an approved course in that college, no longer meets the appropriate code of standards laid down, the Minister may, by notice in writing given to the approved college, withdraw, with effect from the year of assessment immediately following the year of assessment in which the notice is given, the approval of that college or <Col N="1915" /> course, as the case may be, for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where the Minister withdraws the approval of any college or course for the purposes of this section, notice of its withdrawal shall be published, as soon as may be, in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>(5)  On or before the 1st day of July in each year of assessment, the Minister shall furnish the Revenue Commissioners with full details of all</P>
    <P>(a)  courses,</P>
    <P>(b)  colleges, and</P>
    <P>(c) the amount of qualifying fees, in respect of courses, referred to in paragraph (a), for the academic year commencing in that year of assessment, which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section, the Minister has approved of for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>(6)  All such provisions of the Income Tax Acts as apply in relation to claims for the deductions specified in sections 138 to 142 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to a claim for a reduction of income tax under this section.</P>
    <P>(7)  Section 198 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended, in subsection (1) (a), by the insertion of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (xvi) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1994):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(xvii) so far as it flows from relief under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, in the proportions in which they incurred the expenditure giving rise to the relief,&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(8)  If any question arises as to whether</P>
    <P>(a)  a college is an approved college, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a course of study is an approved course,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> for the purposes of this section, the Revenue Commissioners may consult with the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies tabled an amendment for Committee Stage concerning tax relief on third level fees.  I listened carefully to the sentiments that animated the debate and I indicated then that in principle I was prepared to accept the application of the argument proposed on the understanding that any amendment would be confined and circumscribed in a particular manner.</P>
    <P>The text of the amendment we have drafted is based on the principles I enunciated on Committee Stage.  The philosophy underpinning the amendment is that, in essence, where a person leaves second level education and goes to work but decides later to go back to college to improve their education and undertakes a part-time course and where that course is a two year course recognised by the Department of Education and, by extension, the NCEA &mdash; for the purpose of drafting the amendment, the Department of Education is the body to which I refer &mdash; there will be tax relief at the standard rate in order to offset the cost of fees.  If the parents of such person pay the fees they may not claim tax relief on them.</P>
    <P>The text of the amendment is quite descriptive.  In many cases, a company and most Government Departments will pay education fees subject to clarification and certification.  Where the employer organisation pays the fees for a person in part-time education it will not be possible to claim double relief but where an employer organisation would be capable of claiming tax relief and for a variety of reasons decides not to so do we have made it very clear there is no onus on the employee student to produce evidence of that.  We have simply made it very clear that double relief cannot be granted.  I have moved some direction in meeting the spirit of the proposal put forward by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to correct what <Col N="1917" /> I said on Second Stage.  I recall saying that it is never the Minister's intention in a Finance Bill to change one iota of what is before him.  I have to withdraw that accusation in respect of this Minister, Deputy Quinn.  He had not planned to make any changes in this regard but having listened to all sides of the argument he did so during the debate.  This proves that even on the Finance Bill. one can get the Minister of the day to change his or her mind on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe from the initial contribution on Committee Stage that it was not part of the Minister's brief to agree to the amendment I tabled.  We had a very good debate on Committee Stage.  I think the argument that has convinced the Minister to make a gesture in this regard is that people such as he and I were lucky to have parents who pushed us and made sacrifices to send us to third level but that was not an option for all of my friends at primary school.  I welcome what the Minister has done and I thank him for this gesture.  It was obvious on Committee Stage that he was receiving advice to the contrary from some of his officials, for whom, incidentally, I have great respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is closely targeted.  When in Opposition, one would like such provisions to be as wide as possible. However, the amendment is fair.  The qualifying individual will be one who was not able to avail of third level courses, as I have so described.  In addition, the relief is standard rated, in line with attempts to provide all reliefs at this rate.</P>
      <P>The Minister promised an amendment on Committee Stage which would be targeted.  However, the definitions are wide enough to accommodate various courses.  Doubtless this was the cause of debate among departmental officials.  I remarked on Second Stage that Ministers never change their minds during the course of the Finance Bill.  I was wrong and I am glad to admit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for <Col N="1918" /> responding in a positive way to the debate on Committee Stage and to the amendment that was put down on part-time students.  It illustrates that the democratic forces can work to some degree.  An individual in Glasnevin who wrote to every member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and other parties and sought a meeting with Deputy McCreevy set the ball rolling.  We committed ourselves to putting down the amendment on Committee Stage.  There was also lobbying on the Government side.  It is good to think that an individual can be a catalyst in moving us all in the direction of change.</P>
      <P>I welcome the broad objective of the amendment.  I recognise the Minister is limited by financial circumstances. However, there may be a difficulty with that part of the amendment which states:</P>
      <P>...&lsquo;qualifying individual&rsquo; means an individual other than an individual who has been conferred with a certificate, diploma or degree in respect of the completion by him or her of an undergraduate course of study of not less than 2 academic years duration.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency for students in the regional technical college sector, for example, to complete a two year certificate course across a broad range of subjects and go into the workplace where further qualifications are required for advancement.  Many return, therefore, to undertake perhaps a one year part-time diploma course, with the hope of moving on to a degree course.</P>
      <P>While I acknowledge the financial limitations of the Minister, it would be logical to extend the provision, perhaps in next year's Finance Bill, to such certificate students.  There is a direct correlation between their input into the development of their personal skills and the return to the economy, given that the skills base of many companies will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is especially true of the regional technical college sector.  Where an undergraduate student at university will complete a degree programme, there <Col N="1919" /> tends to be stronger interaction in the regional technical college sector between the academic and industry. Many students leave the regional technical college after obtaining their certificates but then return to complete a diploma. In doing this they are developing a ladder of progression.  We no longer have rigid demarcation lines between various qualifications and hopefully people will always be able to progress.</P>
    <P>In the context of reform of the higher education grants scheme, we must look at those workers who fall below the income tax threshold and are attending courses.  Perhaps they could be assisted under the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for responding. This represents a breakthrough for many students, especially for those who never had the opportunity of pursuing full-time third level education and who had to go to work in the first instance. The statistics show that adult education, indeed education generally, is a growing phenomenon.  The report completed by the steering committee shows that the number of part-time students is staggering. It will be an increasing phenomenon. It is important that we recognise and encourage it because the spin-off to society and the country will be greater. Any study of the economic development of the country over the past 39 to 40 years will show that there is a strong correlation between our investment in education and success in the economy. Many people attribute economic growth to the education policies of the 1960s and to Donough O'Malley's free education scheme.  Even the officials who are perhaps trying to limit the Minister's enthusiasm will recognise that there is a payback at some stage to society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at length on this issue on Committee Stage.  I commend the Minister for the approach he has taken.  He said he would consider the matter and he has produced a substantial amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> In so far as it refers to the two year academic course, the amendment has a limiting effect on the regional colleges. In Waterford, many students commence certificate or diploma courses which enable them to get better quality work. In the workplace they see opportunities for progress and they want to return to college to get the extra qualification leading to a degree.  Many of the regional colleges, especially the one at Waterford, offer a staggering number of degree courses.  Over 50 per cent of courses offered by the college at Waterford are degree courses.  In this respect I have been seeking clarification from the Minister for Education on the distinction in definition between a regional college and a university.</P>
    <P>The mix in third level institutes has encouraged students to progress from one course to the next and to further their education.  Everybody realises the benefits of qualifications for careers. The situation at Packard Electric Ireland Limited has highlighted this again.  People with low level skills have increased difficulties in getting stable employment, while those with qualifications have access to better opportunities. The figures on this are staggering.</P>
    <P>I understand the provision as it relates to courses of two academic years duration.  However, many courses today target those who left the system and started work without any third level qualifications and are designed to get them back into the system.  Previously, many outside were deterred by the length of courses &mdash; often three to four years.  However, as courses have become designed to be completed in parts, from certificates to diplomas to degrees, many of them produce a qualification after one year while also encouraging the student to pursue further studies.  The regional colleges have been to the forefront in this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate the cost implication of the amendment; I doubt if it is very high.  We all want to see what effect it will have in the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> We must encourage people to improve their standard of education and ensure finance is not a barrier to access to third level education, which should be open to all students where feasible. This is a step in that direction.  I welcome the amendment and hope its interpretation will be broadened in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome measure, although I have a few reservations which should be voiced.  The term &ldquo;qualifying individual&rdquo; is overly restrictive in one sense and open to abuse in another.  A person could do a course, say he does not want to be conferred with a degree and get an extra two years tuition fee on that basis.  A person came to my clinic to point out that under the university scheme she was in an unfortunate situation because one of her colleagues had failed the final examination and got the benefit of the tuition fees as she was not a graduate and was therefore entitled to start again.  My client wanted to do another course in UCD but was not eligible under the scheme because she had a qualification.  The Minister should look at the qualifying issue for next year.  It seems to discriminate against a person who wants to start again for a bona fide reason in favour of somebody who reaches the end of a three year course but decides to do something else.  I have come across such a case; it is not a notional one.</P>
      <P>This states that the undergraduate course should be of not less than two years academic duration.  Does it have to be an approved course in a recognised institution?  It does not seem to have to be but if a person spends time getting a qualification in an unapproved course, he is out of court for this.  That should be thought through and it would have been if we had more time to think about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the appropriate percentage, it is harsh to set this relief at the standard rate given that there are single workers earning below the average industrial wage paying 48 per cent tax.  I <Col N="1922" /> do not know many married people who would go back to college; perhaps there are some but to give single workers earning below the average industrial wage paying 48 per cent tax a 27 per cent relief is too modest.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the welcome this amendment has been given and the observations made.  We have a long road to travel and I empathise with the point made by Deputy McCreevy. When I listened to the arguments put forward I contemplated, not for the first time, my good fortune in having parents who had the wherewithal and the motivation &mdash; there were people with the wherewithal but not necessarily the motivation &mdash; to deny themselves a consumption in their own time so their children could have it in the form of an investment in education.  If I had not had that good fortune, I suspect I would have ended up on a building site, perhaps as a carpenter of a developer.  God knows where I would have ended up after that.</P>

      <P>To be a carpenter would have been my natural inclination.  I was fortunate in life.  I remember my late father saying, when the family business had gone under, the one thing a bank, recession or liquidator cannot take away is a professional qualification.  That spirit has informed a generation and equipped it with the wherewithal to travel happily through life &mdash; I hope &mdash; not just on this island, but elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to rebalance the playing pitch for a specific category, but we cannot be as generous as we would like.  Deputy Cullen asked about the cost which will be approximately £1 million.  Although we do not know the take up, it will be of the order of £1 million to £2 million. The reason it is circumscribed and constrained &mdash; Deputy McDowell referred to this &mdash; is to try to mainstream it with <Col N="1923" /> other courses which, in the normal course, would be seen as ones that would enhance people's employment prospects and, therefore, their prospects in life.  It is, to that extent, labour market orientated.  It is not designed to enable somebody to fulfil a personal non labour market orientation.  We are using other taxpayer's money in effect to enable them to enhance their own marketability in the labour market. That is the logic which informs this and the reason courses must be approved by the Department of Education or a subsidiary body of the Department like the NCEA which <i>inter alia</i> approves courses with some labour market relevance or reference.</P>
    <P>If we were not to accept that discipline in the context of moving from a Committee Stage to a Report Stage amendment, it would be &ldquo;Open Sesame&rdquo; as regards what constitutes a course and what the purposes of that course may be.  I do not mind people spending their money on a course, but if we are to give them tax relief, which means using taxpayers' money or foregoing legal taxpayers' obligations, it must have some objective that can be justified.  The justification I am giving to this relates to what makes somebody a carpenter rather than an architect.  The difference is a chance at third level education. In this instance, the chance at third level education is determined by the criteria we set out in the amendment. I would like to think this could be expanded in due course.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards a situation &mdash; Packard Electric is a graphic example of it &mdash; where we will probably invest more in human capital over the next 20 years than in physical capital.  It is the most precious and unique resource we have and it will ensure that certain kinds of economic activity and, consequently, wealth creating ability will remain on this island.  We will not be able to withstand international competition and pressure from labour markets like the Pacific rim or parts of Eastern Europe with wage rates of £200 per month as <Col N="1924" /> against £12,000.  Tricking around with PRSI or income tax rates will not bridge that gap.</P>
    <P>The only way we can maintain and enhance our ability to consolidate and grow wealth on this island is to invest in human capital over the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  This is a small step.  It is not dramatic but it clearly sends a signal which I hope will be amplified in years to come, subject to available resources, that if people leave secondary school and find themselves on the adult labour market without a third level qualification and if they are prepared to use their own money to pay for courses which will enhance their labour market attractiveness, the rest of the taxpayers will ease the tax burden on their shoulders for the duration of these courses with respect to the cost of fees.  This is modest but it is a symbol and a signal which I hope will be recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" />&ldquo;15.&mdash;The figure of &lsquo;50 per cent&rsquo; shall be substituted for the figure of &lsquo;15 per cent&rsquo; in section 236 (1A) and the figure of &lsquo;100 per cent&rsquo; shall be substituted for the words &lsquo;one fourth&rsquo; in section 235 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We discussed this issue on Committee Stage.  I tabled this amendment to raise the question of pensions.  Since then the Minister has brought forward an amendment which provides for a change in the qualifying contributions which individuals can make if they are over 55 years of age.  These contributions have been increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent.  I cannot remember such a change in my political lifetime.</P>
    <P>By introducing that amendment, the Minister recognised that we have to give serious consideration to the pensions issue.  People are more likely to do something if they are given a tax break and we will have to proceed further down this road.  Other jurisdictions allow varying contributions to pension funds as people become older.  I recently read an article which pointed out the anomalies which exist between employees of companies, people who are the directors and owners of their own firms and people who are self-employed.</P>
    <P>When most businesses develop beyond a certain size, they incorporate themselves and try to grow from that base.  Companies are allowed to put as much as they like into pension schemes for directors and this is allowed as a tax deduction against profits.  The amount of money which directors can take on retirement, usually from the age of 60 onwards, is restricted to the salary they have been paid for the previous three years.  The Revenue Commissioners look at this fairly strictly.</P>
    <P>People who own companies can put a considerable amount into their pension funds.  However, sole traders or those in partnerships cannot do this.  They are restricted to the 15 per cent net relevant earnings rule, although they can carry forward contributions to a further year. <Col N="1926" /> At 35 years of age people should be given tax relief on their contributions at a certain percentage; at 40 years of age this relief should be at a higher percentage and so on.  It is only when many business people are in their 40s that they begin to think about providing pensions for themselves.</P>
    <P>This amendment recognises that in years to come, even with the best will in the world and no matter what growth there may be in the economy, it will not be possible for the State to provide care and hospital facilities for all old people. A person who builds up a pension fund can only draw one quarter of this fund when he or she receives a pension.  The remainder must go towards providing an annuity which will be paid for the rest of the person's life depending on whatever arrangements are made with the company.  This is strictly confined by the Revenue Commissioners under present law.  We should enable individuals to have more control over their pension funds, in order to provide not just for incomes but also for health and hospital care during their retirement.</P>
    <P>Other countries are considering this. Because of the demographic situation in this country, policy makers will have to address this in the near future.  There is a belief in most developed countries that people should no longer be able to rely totally on State pension funds when they reach retirement age.  There is a body of thought that individuals should be compelled to provide private funding.</P>
    <P>Employees are also allowed make additional voluntary contributions to their pension schemes.  Directors who own their own companies can pay as much as they like into their pension funds.  Employees who are thrifty and think far enough ahead can put more money into their pension funds and obtain tax relief.  However, individuals who are self-employed are restricted to the 15 per cent net relevant earnings rule.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> The Minister and the Department are probably familiar with the arguments to streamline this area.  It should be a policy objective to encourage people to provide more for their pensions.  The statutory social welfare pension has become a smaller percentage of the average industrial wage than it was 20 years ago.  Even with the best will in the world, future Governments will be constrained to this area because of the population age structure and State pensions will become a smaller proportion of what people will earn coming up to retirement.  The taxation system should be used to encourage people to provide for their own pensions.  This is the purpose of my amendment and should be further considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly support the amendment but I think it would be unfair in my favour if I could put 50 per cent of my income each year into such a fund and take out 100 per cent the day I reach the relevant age.  I would appreciate this but I could not put my hand on my heart and say this would be a fair arrangement.  I am glad that, by tendering this amendment, Deputy McCreevy has elicited movement from the Minister on this front.  I hope the Minister will ask the Revenue Commissioners to draw this change in the law to the attention of the self-employed. The 15 per cent rule is so ingrained in people's minds that even if they are told with a few weeks to go to the next accounting period that the relevant category of people are entitled to more, they will not have provided for it.  Many of them will not make proper provision for themselves.  The Minister should ensure that the Revenue Commissioners spend some of their advertising budget to draw this to the attention of those to whom it applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of people in my own profession are unaware that this change is being made.  The vast majority of 55 to 65 year-old people will not put aside enough money to comply with it unless they are warned by their accountants.  In <Col N="1928" /> most cases this is such an ingrained rule that unless they have an accountant who takes the trouble to advise them in advance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the points made by the Deputies.  No doubt if Deputy McCreevy found a self-employed person encountering the difficulties he has just described, a bit of friendly accounting advice would recommend converting their status into that of a company so that they could avail of the benefits he has described. That option may not be open to a number of self-employed people.</P>
      <P>We are not in a position to accept the proposal in the Fianna Fáil amendment which would provide 100 per cent relief for the lump sum.  That would dislodge the present set of relativities.  The assumption is that the 25 per cent &mdash; one quarter of the lump sum &mdash; that can be drawn down on the annuity, a tax free amount, is similar relative to the computation terms of the 18 months salary for an employee who is deemed to be eligible.  I do not know when these relativities were made but that relativity currently prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>However, all these relativities have to be recalculated in the light of changing work circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the event that I did not say this on Committee Stage, let me confirm that the whole question of the tax treatment of pensions, having regard to the changing pattern of work and work contracts, which is a feature of modern life, is under review between my Department and the Irish Association of Pension Funds.  As I said outside the House, there is a need to realign the tax treatment of pension provisions with current labour market contract employment practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> On the point made by Deputy McDowell about the 15 per cent provision, I will request the Revenue Commissioners, and others, to ensure that that information is properly conveyed through the channels that are open to them.  Deputies may be interested to hear that the current 15 per cent relief is availed of by some 53,000 taxpayers and costs an estimated £40 million in a full year.  The average deduction claimed is 8 per cent of net relevant earnings with only 12 per cent of claimants claiming the full 15 per cent or close to it.  It is these persons who, in the main, will benefit from any increase.</P>
    <P>The increase to 20 per cent for those aged 55 or over is estimated to cost approximately £2 million in a full year. On the other hand implementing Deputy McCreevy's amendment would cost close to £17 million on a full year basis.  That would be the total cost but, if we assume that 50 per cent of those eligible would avail of it, the cost would be about £8 million.</P>
    <P>I have made some progress in this regard.  I hope the study by the IAPF will give us some greater steer.  We all share the same objective of making adequate pension provision so that people do not become a burden on the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise what the Minister has done.  He is the first Minister that I can remember who has made any move in this area, and it would be churlish of me not to congratulate him. I welcome the fact that the tax treatment of pensions is being examined by the Department of Finance.  As the Minister rightly said both in this House and elsewhere, changing work practices necessitate changes in pension legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pensions Act under the aegis of the Minister for Social Welfare is one of the foremost of its kind in the developed world.  The way we treated pensions in legislation in preparation for the divorce referendum is a model for any developed country.  We are forward <Col N="1930" /> thinking in this regard but we will have to continue to be so.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when this was brought home to me and long before I thought of it in regard to my position, I reflected on what applied to people such as Deputy McDowell inadvertently referred to.  There are some professions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Accountancy being one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where one can have a large income in one year and not so great an income in other years.  In the profession Deputy McDowell referred to, one generally builds up the stake but he is involved in a peculiar profession that is a bit like architecture where one can have a big income in one year and a very small income the following year.</P>
      <P>It came home to me most forcibly in regard to professional sports persons who lobbied me some years ago.  They showed me the way the United Kingdom's Inland Revenue treated sports persons.  Long before the demographics of the Irish situation impinged on me, that made me think it would be worth making changes in regard to particular activities.  In considering pensions tax treatment the Minister should also take into account special occupations or professions.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the change he made in this year's Bill which signals his good intentions.  I will not press my amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;25.&mdash;(1)  Section 41 B (inserted by section 35 of the Finance Act, 1995) of the Finance Act, 1994, is hereby <Col N="1931" /> amended in subsection (1) by the substitution of the following for the definition of &lsquo;the relevant local authority&rsquo;:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;&ldquo;the relevant local authority&rdquo;, in relation to the construction or refurbishment of a multi-storey car park, means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the corporation of a county or other borough or, where appropriate, the urban district council, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in respect of the administrative county of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the administrative county Fingal or the administrative county of South Dublin, the council of the county, in whose functional area the multi-storey car park is situated.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2) Subsection (1) shall be deemed to have applied and have effect as on and from the 1st day of July, 1995.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the time factor and the fact that Members may wish to comment on other amendments so I will not make a long speech.  This tax relief for multi-storey car parks is an anomaly for Dublin city and county.  It should have been extended to local authorities that have an urban core such as Dún Laoghaire.  They were omitted for reasons of history, drafting and oversight in that order.  This is a correction on our part, and amendment No. 22a intends to do the same thing.  The amendment will create the position that was intended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not certain whether it is a good <Col N="1932" /> idea to support the building of multi-storey car parks because we know they are ugly manifestations of the way the motor car has destroyed the infrastructure of cities and rural areas.

I support this amendment because of the arrival of the HSS ferry in Dún Laoghaire harbour and the magnificent development there of which I humbly happen to be the author.  It has now found universal acceptance.  On the basis that 375 cars will come into Dún Laoghaire on one sailing &mdash; there are five sailings a day &mdash; one can understand why it is necessary to have multi-storey car parks.  In the meantime, we must get on with the development in Dún Laoghaire.  I saw this as the psychological key to ongoing development which is now happily spreading throughout the community and has found universal acceptance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought this matter to the Minister's attention on Committee Stage.  I am worried that we could catch genuine business people.  The capital allowance provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which allow taxpayers to claim capital allowances on industrial buildings, were being used legitimately as a tax avoidance measure. If a person found a building anywhere in the world which had been built in the past ten years, they were allowed to claim it against their profits.  This practice was known to the Revenue Commissioners and to officials in the Department of Finance and they were taking action in this regard.</P>
      <P>This amendment is closing that loophole. Industrial buildings allowances were not designed so that people could claim an industrial buildings allowance for a building on the Rock of Gibraltar. Although I do not normally point out loopholes to the Minister, even the most liberal tax adviser in this city would appreciate that sooner or later this loophole would have to be closed.  However, I do not want to catch legitimate business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) means that a person will not be able to get capital allowances on industrial buildings as a tax avoidance measure unless it is a &ldquo;building or structure to be constructed or which is being constructed which will be used for the purposes of a trade the profits or gains from which are taxable in the State.&rdquo; My amendment inserted the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; after &ldquo;building or structure&rdquo;.  I understand why this amendment is worded in this way because other buildings which are being constructed must be covered.  However, I do not want to catch the legitimate <Col N="1936" /> hotelier who pays his taxes here but who may want to build a hotel abroad.  I understand that by inserting paragraph (a)  nobody will be able to use it after these dates.  It was not my intention when tabling this amendment on Committee Stage to catch such people.  Is it not possible to take out paragraph (a) and leave paragraph (b)?  That would mean that legitimate hoteliers who operate here but who want to build a new hotel abroad would not be caught. I am afraid legitimate operators will be caught.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the use of this tax avoidance measure must not continue.</P>

      <P>I accept Deputy McCreevy's statement.  I assure him that the more expanded text contained in the amendment was designed, following consultation with interested players, to meet the concerns of people involved in legitimate businesses which are specifically expanding into Northern Ireland to capitalise on the peace dividend, etc. These people would, if the loophole had been closed in the original manner, have been very adversely affected.  The more expansive text contained in the amendment which I tabled, as distinct from the amendment in the Deputy's name which is aimed at closing the loophole, would penalise those people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 40, to delete lines 4 to 29 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  This section shall not apply</P>
      <P>(a)  to expenditure incurred within the qualifying period on the acquisition, construction or refurbishment of a building or structure (hereafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;the holiday cottage or apartment&rdquo;) which is, or is to be, a building or structure to which this section applies if, before the 5th day of April, 1996&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a binding contract in writing for the acquisition or construction of the holiday cottage or apartment was entered into, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  an application for planning permission for the construction of the holiday cottage or apartment was received by a planning authority, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  in relation to the holiday cottage or apartment, an opinion in writing was issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that an allowance to be made in respect of expenditure on the said holiday cottage or apartment would not fall to be restricted by virtue of section 24 of the Finance Act, 1991,</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(b)  where on or after the 8th day of February, 1995, but before the 5th day of April, 1996&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  expenditure was incurred on the acquisition of land on which the holiday cottage or apartment is to be constructed or refurbished, by the person who incurred the expenditure <Col N="1939" /> on the said construction or refurbishment, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  a binding contract in writing for the acquisition of the said land by the said person was entered into,</P>
    <P>and the said person can prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a detailed plan had been prepared and that detailed discussions had taken place with a local authority in relation to the holiday cottage or apartment.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is merely a drafting amendment.  In moving it, I must mention a technical amendment to amendment No. 26 on page 9 of the list of Report Stage amendments.  The reference to &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; to bring the amendment into line with the reference to &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; in amendment No. 26 (a) (ii). With the exception of An Bord Pleanála, every planning authority is a local authority but not every local authority is a planning authority.  That is the legal definition and the reason for the difference.</P>
    <P>This amendment represents an attempt to address a point raised on Committee Stage when the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, held the fort on my behalf.  He gave an undertaking to review the transition provisions of the section for Report Stage, with a view to accommodating cases not catered for by the existing transitional criteria, where there was evidence that expenditure had been incurred in good faith on the basis of the existing law.  Having carried out that review I am putting forward an amendment, the effect of which is to introduce additional criteria to alleviate the position for transitional cases &mdash; for example, holiday cottages.</P>
    <P>The new criteria will accommodate those who acquired or contracted to acquire land between budget day 1995, when the scheme was announced, and 5 April 1996 for the construction of holiday cottages or apartments.  In such cases, there will, however, have to be evidence that detailed plans of developments were drawn up and that <Col N="1940" /> detailed discussions had taken place with the local authority.  This will ensure that cases excluded from the new restrictions are genuine and that the land acquired or to be acquired was intended for use in the development of holiday cottages and apartments.  It is a form of transitional relief related to apartments and cottages as distinct from any other form of physical development. Manifest, objective evidence will be required to indicate that people had entered into the commitment to develop.</P>
    <P>There may be some general confusion with regard to the scope of this provision, which targets only one aspect of the seaside resorts scheme, namely the self-catering area.  It does not affect &mdash; I regret that this might have been inadvertently conveyed on Committee Stage &mdash; the general scheme of seaside resorts, tax designation enhancements and incentives.  The provision does not affect the following: hotels, guesthouses, bed and breakfast establishments, holiday camps, leisure and sports facilities, theme parks and interpretative centres, adventure centres, craft centres, entertainment facilities such as theatres, etc., restaurants, cafés and other tourist infrastructure and caravan and camping sites.</P>
    <P>This tightening of the provision is exclusively designed for self-catering components &mdash; namely, cottages or apartments.  It has been designed due to the existence of a legal tax planning scheme which, by leverage, resulted in a much more generous form of relief than was originally intended.  Having adequately dealt with the transitional cases, we are returning to the initial intention of the legislation.  Deputies expressed concern that the ground rules were being changed in respect of the schedule of reliefs for the items to which I referred a moment ago.  However, these stand as before.  We are simply tightening the provision of relief in respect of self-catering constructed units, cottages and apartments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 26:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> In the first line of subsection (5) (b), to delete &ldquo;on or after the 8th day of February, 1995, but&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply and acknowledge that he has taken on board, in the main, comments made on Committee Stage.  However, arising from the insertion of the new subsection, there are now two classes of people with the intention of developing a property for the purpose of self-catering accommodation.  The Minister has allowed the <i>status quo</i> to remain, in that full relief will be given to those who had the ability and wherewithal to purchase land following the enactment of the Finance Act, 1995.  Arising from the introduction of the seaside renewal relief last year, people who had been in possession of land for some time took it upon themselves to see how they could use the reliefs contained therein and negotiate with the planning authorities &mdash; invariably in areas which are sensitive from a planning point of view &mdash; with the intention of developing self-catering accommodation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not take on board my suggested minor amendment, his amendment will create a situation in which a person who purchased land after 5 April and has been in negotiation with the planning authority will get the relief but a person who was the owner of the land prior to 5 February 1995 and went through the same process and expense of negotiating sensitively with the planning authority to ensure there would be good planning will not be eligible for the relief.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to classify every person who purchased land since 5 February 1995 as a speculator.  However, there have been a number of instances where speculators purchased land and are being accommodated.  An owner who did not wish to dispose of the land to a speculator or property developer is being discommoded.  I agree fully with everything the Minister has said.  The safeguard in my amendment would ensure that the last paragraph of that <Col N="1942" /> section provides that the only people who will get this transitional relief are those who, following the publication of the Finance Bill, 1995, spoke to the planning authority about the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of holiday apartments.</P>
    <P>By ensuring those negotiations commenced from 8 February 1995 and had been concluded by 5 April 1996 I am not introducing a further category of persons which would involve a substantial loss of revenue to the State or open up that which I acknowledge the Minister is trying to curtail.  One must take on board situations where families held on to land and did not dispose of it to a speculator after 5 February 1995.  I suggest the number of cases to which I refer is extremely small and I have sent examples to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This scheme has been of phenomenal benefit to secondary towns.  There has been a loss of revenue but I suggest the passive investment released from savings has the potential to bring the Revenue Commissioners substantial returns in the form of VAT, PAYE and PRSI. The overall loss will be minimal other than the double rent allowance which could be tied to the capital allowance and I accept that should not have been allowed in the first place.</P>
    <P>The amendment, which I will press, deals with the small number of hardship cases but recognises that some people do not wish to dispose of their land to property developers and would prefer to develop it in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to cut across Deputy Hughes but the case I made on Committee Stage was that somebody who had acted substantially to their prejudice on foot of the availability of this scheme should not be left without any adequate remedy.  I do not know whether a landowner can claim to be badly prejudiced if all he has done is commission an architect to look at plans.  I was talking about people who had entered into a binding commitment to purchase property and were legally bound to continue with that venture.  It <Col N="1943" /> appeared to me that category of person would suffer serious prejudice if, by an early or premature termination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. However, I believe the last proviso to section 26 (5) at paragraph (b) is still overly harsh.  It states:</P>
      <P>and the said person can prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a detailed plan had been prepared and that detailed discussions had taken place with a local authority in relation to the holiday cottage or apartment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of that paragraph is to distinguish between people who casually bought land and might now decide to avail of the provision.  Surely either of those conditions is sufficient to establish a person's bona fides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy looking for an either or provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The section could be amended to read &ldquo;and the said person can prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that a detailed plan had been prepared or that detailed discussions had taken place with a local authority&rdquo;.  Either of those would establish the good faith element.  To insist on both seems to discriminate against somebody who had the plans but did not discuss them in detail with the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any reason the Minister should not accept an amendment to include the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; because if either of those two conditions was complied with the Revenue Commissioners' requirement would be satisfied.  Somebody who could prove he had drawn up detailed plans and had commissioned an architect but had not discussed them in detail with the local authority would be unfairly discriminated against if the <Col N="1944" /> Minister insists on a cumulative rather than alternative set of conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that point.  I am a member of a local authority.  At the moment, there is a scarcity of funds and one of the great sources of income is fees relating to planning matters.</P>
      <P>This a complex area.  Roads, access and sewerage schemes all form part of the planning process.  In one case insistence by the local authority on the provision of a road held up the development as the architect could not design it until there was agreement by the corporation. It is an impossible situation where, as Deputy McDowell pointed out, a person cannot meet both requirements. One can negotiate the cost involved but must wait for plans from the local authority to see what roads must be provided or whether an existing road is to be expanded.  Many developments are narrow old roads which must be broadened.  The developer may construct the road and include the charge with his planning fees.</P>
      <P>It is a legitimate point that it would be virtually impossible to meet both requirements.  The Minister is probably aware of the difficulties from his own professional experience.  However, I accept the overall intent of the Minister's amendment which redresses some of the issues we discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I had a slightly mistaken impression of the impact of the changes.  I thought bed and breakfast establishments were included and I was happy to find that was not the case.  The lifeblood of areas like Tramore or Ballybunion in the old days was the bed and breakfast business. There is nothing wrong with reestablishing those businesses.  They are better than rows and rows of concrete cottages and apartments.  However, that type of accommodation must also be provided.  It is an important facility which tourists expect to be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Hughes, has made the legitimate point that we cannot penalise somebody who owned the land prior to 1995 and reward somebody <Col N="1945" /> who purchased the land since that date. There does not seem to be any justice in that, if I am interpreting the Minister's amendment correctly.  I imagine that was not the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>We do not suggest that everybody who bought land since then bought it speculatively but nevertheless people who had land for a long period saw an opportunity to use it, discussed it with the local authority and want to get involved in the development of their local seaside areas should not be penalised in the way in which the Minister's amendment would penalise them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues. The programme has been ongoing for just nine months and people are only getting their act together with regard to discussions and negotiations. In addition, the regulations were not available from the Department of Tourism and Trade until recently.  It is premature to cut off this scheme.  People may have held negotiations with a planning officer and started to arrange finance, etc.  This was a three year programme and there must be a lead-in time if there is to be proper development. The exclusion of self-catering cottages and apartments will cause problems for those who have already paid considerable sums for work by people, such as those in the Minister's former profession, to get their plans together.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister has clarified the situation.  There was concern in some areas, particularly in Bundoran which I represent, regarding other aspects of the scheme.  Given that it was a three year programme, that only nine months have passed and that the regulations were not available until recently, the Minister should reconsider the position. Some people have negotiated with banks and building societies and organised planning matters.  Things must be done properly if the scheme is to be addressed.  I support my colleague's amendment and ask the Minister to reconsider the matter given the difficulties in which people now find themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must recognise that the Minister has introduced an ameliorating amendment to the section as drafted.  However, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, this does not overcome the difficulties of people who owned land prior to 8 February 1995.  They may be in a position to use the ameliorating section if they can prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that they entered discussions with a planning authority.  However, it is most unfair to penalise such people as opposed to a developer who bought property and is now in a position to comply with the section.</P>
      <P>I readily recognise that the Minister is trying to be helpful by not attempting to catch people who have gone a substantial way in terms of putting forward proposals and bringing them to a conclusion. However, it would not constitute a substantial loss to the Exchequer to further amend the section to cover the issue raised by Deputies Hughes and Coughlan.  It does not involve a large number of people and it is possible to redraft the section.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, we should not lose sight of the purpose for which the seaside resort renewal scheme was introduced, which was to revitalise existing seaside resort towns which had deteriorated over the years.  When I was Minister for Tourism and Trade, I often pointed to the example of Tramore where I used to holiday many years ago with my children.</P>

      <P>One needed to make a considerable profit on the horses at Tramore to fund the activities of the children.  Those type of resorts have <Col N="1947" /> deteriorated and when I was lucky enough to be Minister for Tourism and Trade.  I envisaged that the renewal scheme would revitalise such areas.  On Committee Stage I said that perhaps a more sensible approach would have been to allow the scheme to run for two years.  Nobody favours more tax avoidance measures, such as BES and others which it was necessary to close off, but the alternative was to signal that, after 6 April 1997, the tax incentive announced in the 1995 budget would no longer operate.</P>
      <P>It is not on to announce a scheme and change it midcourse.  As Deputy Coughlan pointed out, it was well into the latter half of 1995 before details of the scheme were available from Departments. Many people may decide in the next two years to build holiday apartments in Clonakilty.  This area was included in the scheme during Report Stage of the 1995 Bill but, when I drafted the original scheme, I never envisaged that Clonakilty would be included as a seaside resort.</P>

What about it if people want to spend money building apartments in those places?  It will revitalise certain towns, which was the purpose of the scheme.</P>

The Minister has <Col N="1948" /> gone some of the way by introducing an ameliorating amendment to try to overcome the problem of investors and others caught by the original provision. However, he could go one step further to overcome the difficulties raised by my colleagues.  The possible loss to the Exchequer is not substantial, perhaps as little as £2,000.</P>

I want to accommodate genuine people who, even if they owned land, have engaged in activity in this area.  For example, they may have persuaded a parent that they could undertake this development.  This could be the case in some circumstances.  I am attached to Deputy Hughes's amendment because it is time specific and terminated so that nobody can get in on the provision now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said.  We must make provision for two situations.  The first is that raised by the Minister and incorporated into the original amendment, namely for people who purchased land arising from the last Finance Act after 8 February 1995 or contracted to purchase it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and before 5 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We must also provide for sons, daughters, families or companies who have been the owners of land for ten or 15 years, land which may be lying undeveloped.  Those people, in trying to capitalise on the attractive tax incentives announced in last year's Government initiative, may have had discussions with the planning authority, supported by an affidavit after 8 February 1995 but before 5 April 1996.  That is why my amendment requests that if we are deleting &ldquo;on or after the 8th February, 1995&rdquo;, subsection 5 (b) should <Col N="1951" /> read as follows: &ldquo;but before the 5th day of April, 1996&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All of this is overshadowed by the fact that what the Minister is amending is a minuscule portion of the original package, but it must be acknowledged it was the portion in that package which in the majority of secondary tourism towns released this investment flow which generated revenue for the Exchequer and sheltered tax for those who availed of it. It is overshadowed by the hearing in the High Court at present on what exactly is the definition of a holiday apartment. We are discussing people who apply for planning permission for dwelling houses or apartments but do not state specifically it is for holiday dwellings or apartments.</P>
      <P>The decision in the High Court case may not be handed down for months.  In fact, as I understand it, this case has been in its preparatory stage and slowly finding its way to the High Court for almost ten years.  It is in the interests of many people that this judgment is not issued for several years.  In keeping with the way the Minister has handled this matter so far, I suggest the Revenue Commissioners be directed not to fine comb planning permissions which have been granted and make a distinction between a planning application for 20 houses, for example, as against the proper application for 20 holiday homes. Nobody applies for planning permission for holiday homes; they apply for dwelling houses or apartments but they do not add the word &ldquo;holiday&rdquo;.  I am satisfied the Minister will ensure that the spirit of what we have been trying to achieve will not be defeated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28.</P>
      <P>In page 41, line 20, to delete &ldquo;80 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;100 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The move to reduce the proportion of investments from 100 per cent to 80 per cent to our film industry will be detrimental to it.  All of us interested in this matter would, of course, first and foremost want to see our indigenous industry growing and prospering.  However, it would be foolish to believe that this could be done without the help of the blockbuster movies made in Ireland in the past few years which encourage and bring about an infrastructure on which our indigenous industry can grow.  Without that symbiotic arrangement, it <Col N="1954" /> would be even more difficult to gain not only the experiences there but to create the infrastructure needed for our film industry.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that IBEC proposed a compromise with regard to the proposed reduction of the 100 per cent investment to 80 per cent.  It believed that films with a budget under £4 million should be given the full 100 per cent while films with a budget over £4 million should be judged on a case by case basis by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty that has been caused by these proposed changes to what has become known as section 35 has had a negative impact on our film industry, in the last few months in particular.  It has already experienced a reduction in production activity for 1996.  We have had enough uncertainty on this section as it is.  In the beginning, there was a feeling that all comers were welcome.  There were then alleged abuses and a feeling that the regime had to become stricter. There is also a perception that the Department of Finance wishes to see major changes to section 35.  All this creates uncertainty, which I am sure the Minister will agree is detrimental to investment.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions in this House, I have taken the opportunity to point out that there have already been difficulties in certain respects with our film industry that, unfortunately, have not been addressed in this Bill.  I refer particularly to the infamous &ldquo;Divine Rapture&rdquo;.  I said at the time I would like to have seen the Minister making it a condition that any disputes over contracts would be settled in this jurisdiction and the producers of the film required to present a bond which would guarantee all moneys due to Irish workers and suppliers.  In the case of that film, the main losers were the people in the local areas who supplied different services, which is why we have the reference in amendment No. 29.</P>
    <P>IBEC has already alluded to the fact that with regard to these proposals there is an anomaly whereby the Minister for <Col N="1955" /> Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht may not certify a film as qualifying unless such a certificate has been applied for by budget day.  Film companies which raised their finance under section 35 and were still developing their film projects found that their investors had their entitlement to tax relief unilaterally cancelled. IBEC and those on this side of the House would like to see that situation addressed.  We also referred to the fact that we would have liked to have seen BES schemes used to assist scriptwriters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague on this matter.  I have spoken about this issue on every Stage of this debate.  The Minister should not have changed section 35; it should have been left as it was for another few years at least.</P>
      <P>I smiled when I listened to my colleague outlining IBEC's proposals.  I could imagine the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht looking at all films over £40 million and deciding whether they were worthy projects.  I do not mean this disrespectfully, but I could imagine him tearing his hair out trying to decide which film should be in and which should be out.  It would be an impossible situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe this reduction is going in the right direction. On each occasion when we had this discussion, the Minister talked about the <Col N="1956" /> loss and cost to the Exchequer.  If we did not have section 35 in the first place, there would not be any of this activity and, therefore, none of this income.  It is a mirage to talk about it in terms of a loss to the Exchequer because without this section, as it stands, we would not attract the type of investment involved.</P>
      <P>A film like &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, as well as projecting the image of Ireland's involvement in the film industry and the way in which it can attract and encourage other film producers to come here, is also a tremendous benefit to our tourism industry in general.  People will recognise the Curragh plains and Kildare in the film and will want to see it.  They may also see particular aspects of Ireland in this film that may not be as obvious in much smaller films, which would not reach a wide audience.  It is hard to quantify the real benefit of such a film.  I do not accept that the potential costs to the Exchequer are anything like the Minister suggested.  Although he has suggested this in good faith, there are many other issues involved.  The income to the State and the economy from such a film being produced here is far greater than the suggested artificial loss the Exchequer would suffer by having the original section 35 <i>in situ</i> as it was.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted any of our arguments on this section, although he listened to them carefully on both Second and Committee Stage.  Although I know the Minister has moved to deal with other issues, as somebody who enjoys a good film and the theatre, I would have liked to have seen this investment running for another few years.  I hope the Minister will accept amendment No. 28 in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to inform the House that I am not able to accept the three amendments and I want to discuss them together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the sentiments underlying Deputy de Valera's contribution, as Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  However, the change has the full support of the <Col N="1957" /> Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and its Minister.  It is not often that one gets line Departments agreeing to what would be manifestly seen as a deterioration in its financial status coming from the Department of Finance.  The Department agrees with the recommendations of the consultant. We can no longer protect the Irish film industry.  It must be developed and hardened off, otherwise it will remain permanently very fragile and susceptible to the first wind of change.  We cannot have a wholly tax dependent film industry.  There was a great tax driven burst of life from the Australian film industry at one stage but as soon as the tax supports were removed the international industry collapsed.  We are trying to avoid that experience and learn from it.  I am reducing the amount deductible from 100 per cent to 80 per cent and the thresholds associated with that in an attempt to learn from and apply here lessons learned elsewhere.  It has the support of those who are in the front line of the Department in question.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 29 was discussed very eloquently by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage.  We cannot impose conditions in this very mobile industry such as that when productions come to Ireland they must enter into bonds to ensure that every bill is paid to every supplier and so on.  The ultimate sanction &mdash; I am quoting Deputy McDowell &mdash; of <i>caveat emptor</i> applies.  If a supplier has any doubts about the credibility and credit rating of the person looking for goods and services on credit, then he or she should look for cash up front.  It behoves the would-be suppliers of those services to satisfy themselves as to their means of redress in relation to debts incurred.  For the State to impose in legislation a requirement on the lines suggested by Deputy de Valera in <Col N="1958" /> amendment No. 29 would be counterproductive. It would impose a restriction because of the &ldquo;Divine Rapture&rdquo; tragedy.  Poor cases make bad law. There are other provisions in commerical law and market transactions to which we can have regard.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 30 seeks to remove the requirement that a film is made for bona fide commercial reasons and not as part of a tax avoidance scheme.  That provision is included for obvious reasons and I would have thought Deputy McCreevy, given his membership of the accountancy profession, would understand it.  That profession is well known for its wonderful creativity with all forms of tax avoidance schemes. It could get into home movies which, through transfer pricing, would cost an enormous sum of money which would be a wonderful tax scam.  Benefits have to be restricted to commercial films.</P>
    <P>It is evident concessions with other taxpayer's money have to be in respect of a bona fide film and not some scam concocted in the back room of some accountant's office.  Accountants will be busy tonight looking at the Report Stage of this legislation to find out where the potential cracks and loopholes are.  The Minister for Finance and the Dáil will be back this time next year and the year after closing doors we thought were nailed down, bolted and welded.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Michael McDowell on Tuesday, 30 April 1996:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann recognises the urgent need for fundamental reform of our taxation system and, in particular, demands measures which would relieve the huge burden of taxation on PAYE workers on low to medium incomes; eliminate employees' PRSI; reduce the penal levels of employers' PRSI; and that such measures would form an integral part of any successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and help to create a pro-jobs, pro-enterprise economy properly geared for the competitive challenges which face us in the new millennium.</P>

    <P>Dáil Éireann welcomes the Government's firm and prudent management of the economy as reflected in the strong economic growth, increased employment, low interest rates and low inflation achieved over recent years; notes the control of public expenditure and the sound fiscal stance adopted in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty guidelines; recognises the substantial progress in reform of the income tax and PRSI systems and the other significant measures to promote enterprise and employment in the 1995 and 1996 budgets; acknowledges the Government's continuing support for the less well-off members of our society; and recognises the contribution Government policy is making towards creating a pro-jobs and pro-enterprise economy conducive to achieving real increases in take-home pay, improving the incentive to work and the deepening of the social partnership based upon consensus and consultation which has given Ireland the best economic performance of any country in the OECD in 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion which was tabled by the Progressive Democrats.  Our party spokesperson. Deputy McCreevy, has already given our party's main views on the matter, which are in agreement with the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of its central thrusts is there cannot be another <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> unless there is a programme of tax reform.  In tandem with that, any new national agreement must represent a balance between addressing the high level of taxation and making provision for tackling long-term unemployment; 150,000 people have become progressively long-term unemployed over the last number of years.  I accept <Col N="1963" /> the necessity for significant and progressive tax reduction, which will continue to be at the top of our economic agenda.  Since 1987, particularly in the years when Deputy Bertie Ahern was Minister for Finance, a radical look has been taken at tax reform with steady progress in that area.</P>
    <P>However, the plight of the long-term unemployed, who make up an ever growing percentage of the live register, cannot be forgotten.  In any democratic, socially conscious society the advancement of the haves cannot be at the expense of the have nots.  There must be balance in that relationship.  Any new national agreement must look at both of those measure in tandem.  The following four measures with regard to employment and long-term unemployment should be delivered on and encompassed within the terms of the motion, particularly in the consideration of another <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> if there is to be another.</P>
    <P>First, we must set targets for the reduction of long-term unemployment. We constantly moan and bewail the number, which we trot out when it suits us, beat our collective breasts and say something must be done about it.  If that is to be more than a ritual comment and condemnation of the figures, which it has become, difficult and different steps must be taken.  Targets for long-term unemployment would concentrate the mind wonderfully.</P>
    <P>Second, there should be an extension countrywide of the local employment services.  When we asked the Taoiseach if the INOU and ISME will be included in the talks on a new agreement &mdash; as Deputy Harney asked several times &mdash; we were told their views are encompassed in this or that forum.  We are weighted down with fora.  They are very worthy, particularly the one run by Maureen Gaffney in Dublin Castle, and make very worthy proposals, but nobody pays a great deal of attention to them.  It is almost two years since that forum proposed a nationwide local <Col N="1964" /> employment service.  To date, efforts are being made to advance that in 14 areas, which has taken two years.  Despite all the expectations, finance was not given to it in the budget.</P>
    <P>Third, quarterly labour force surveys should be introduced.  We are at sixes and sevens in terms of knowing who is unemployed; whether they are male or female; their age, profession and qualifications; how long they have been unemployed, for what reason and what type of work they require.  We are far behind other European countries, particularly the UK, in regard to the depth and minutiae of their labour force surveys. Because of the faulty data, policy planners, those who plan education and training and job creation agencies do not have a clear picture of the work-force or the non-workforce.  The introduction of quarterly labour force surveys would go a long way towards achieving that.</P>
    <P>The fourth &mdash; and most important &mdash; point is that we should have one Minister in charge of employment instead of eight footling about with various bits of Departments with advisers, programme managers, mobile telephones, plans and agendas, appointments and meetings, and the plethora of activity associated with the various sub-Ministers and subDepartments. Eight of them have bits and pieces to do with employment. There is a clear case for one Minister for employment.</P>
    <P>There is also a clear case for the consolidation of State enterprise agencies. Deputy Harney and I have spoken on this on several occasions. I must say <i>mea culpa</i> because we were responsible in Government for a particularly complex break-up of the IDA which was meant to render everything clearer.  We have ended up with IDA Ireland, Forfás and Forbairt.  I am sure each of them is working to what it thinks its agenda should be but they are all tripping each other.  Within the job creation field there are also agencies such as Údarás na Gaeltachta, FÁS, area partnerships, return to work schemes run by the Department of Social Welfare, the <Col N="1965" /> Leader programme and county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>A woman who knows all about this came to my weekly clinic last Saturday week and said she will go to the six agencies in County Westmeath which deal with job applications in case she misses out on one.  Imagine her trailing to Mullingar, going to two or three there, and coming back to Athlone where she will go to another two or three.  She will fill in the complex forms, which have eight or nine pages, and then begin the round of telephone calls, call backs, call outs, reviews, previews, perusals and mainly, in the end, refusals.</P>
    <P>All the agencies need to be streamlined. I am not casting aspersions on their personnel, whom I am sure are doing the jobs they are given.  However, there is a clear overlap.  Seeking advice and help is rather like entering the maze in Hampton Court for people who have no clear pathway.  The term &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; is jargon.  However, a person should be able enter one door and in one room, or a series of connected rooms, avail of the services and acumen of the Leader programme, county enterprise boards, IDA, Forbairt, FÁS, the Department of Social Welfare and so on, culminating in a perusal of their plan.</P>
    <P>The motion is excellent and worthy of support.  It looks forward to the consideration of another <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> We all know the gains made from consensus.  There must be a balance between proper tax reform and reduction on the one hand and diligent application to the issue of the long-term unemployed on the other. There must not be lip service to this latter issue, rather it must be tackled in a definite, coherent and structured way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion in the name of Deputy Michael McDowell links together the reform of our taxation system and the negotiation of a new agreement between the social partners. It suggests that national agreements are primarily based on tax reform and that tax reform is the principal tool in the creation of sustainable jobs in an enterprise culture.</P>
      <P>On the question of national agreements and a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work, the Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and its predecessor dealt, as they should, with taxation issues.  However, tax was by no means the only issue.  The critical feature of each of the national agreements was the broad acceptance by all the social partners of core economic policy objectives.</P>
      <P>These included, in the first instance, the promotion of economic growth.  The Government has done this.  Second, the creation of sustainable employment.  A record 45,000 jobs were created in 1995. Third, the mainenance of low inflation, which we have now got down to a very low level.  Fourth, the maintenance of low interest rates, which has meant more real money in people's pockets than any tax reductions.  Fifth, national agreements have recognised the need to control borrowing in order to meet the Maastricht criteria.  The Government is doing this and our general deficit has remained comfortably below the 3 per cent limit in recent years, which will allow us to qualify for Economic and Monetary Union.  Finally, recent national agreements have made the link between wage levels and tax reform.  I do not wish to underestimate this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is agreement on all of these core issues, and not just on tax, which has made the national agreements successful. The Government and my party hope that the social partners will together agree on how the nation approaches the new era of opportunity and challenge which lies ahead of us and to which Deputy Michael McDowell referred last night.  While continued tax reform will undoubtedly be a feature of <Col N="1967" /> any such new agreement there will be many other important issues in any balanced consensus which might emerge.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has always supported the principle that real sustainable jobs are created when enterprise flourishes. However, the primary condition underlying an enterprise culture is a stable economic environment with high growth, low inflation and low interest rates.  The overriding policy issue, therefore, must be the continuance of the prudent economic policies being followed by the Government.  Certainly the tax regime does impact on the levels of investment, risk taking and employment and is a very significant element in the mix of issues which concern all of us.</P>
    <P>Tax reform is the kernel of the motion in the name of Deputy Michael McDowell.  The motion suggests that there has been no tax reform by the Government.  However, there has been substantial progress in reforming the tax system incrementally in recent years. The level of progress has not been as rapid as we would all like, and it never will be.  However, it has been as rapid as prudent management of the economy would allow.  The record of that prudent management in terms of growth, inflation, new job creation and low interest rates is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>My party is committed to the reduction of the effective tax rate which is levied especially on PAYE workers. What is relevant here is not just the rates of tax but also the allowances, the tax bands and the social insurance contributions by both employers and employees.  What we must focus on is the overall take by the State out of the cost of maintaining each job.  We believe that tax reform must achieve two principal goals: it must make it pay to take a job and it must be employment friendly. We are committed to this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell's proposals may grab the headlines, but will they work?  It is interesting to note that, notwithstanding the reduction of the standard rate and the abolition of the <Col N="1968" /> third rate when the Progressive Democrats were in Government in 1992, the effective rate of tax, or the tax wedge, did not reduce significantly at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister proposing that tax rates should revert to the level they were at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This was because the Government of the time did not target the benefits by adjusting allowances or the tax bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister propose their reversal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>By contrast, this Government has adjusted tax allowances and bands significantly ahead of inflation.  Furthermore, the benefits have been directed at the lower paid &mdash; we make no apology for that.  The reality is that the Government's programme of reform, which has been more pronounced at lower income levels, when taken with pay increases under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has resulted in meaningful real increases in take home pay.</P>
      <P>A key element of this reform has been the widening of the entitlement to the low rate of employer's PRSI, which now covers over 600,000 jobs.  Many of these jobs are in traditional industries more exposed to the UK market and to the ever increasing competitiveness of the marketplace generally.  The low rate of employer's PRSI, which is 30 per cent lower than the normal rate, genuinely supports these industries.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the continued reduction of the effective rate of tax paid by taxpayers.  We are not solely interested in the headline effects created by cutting tax rates because that is not enough.  What is important to taxpayers is their level of take home pay and it is equally important that further reforms continue to promote job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How should the existing programme of tax reform be continued in future years?  The essential elements include, <Col N="1969" /> in the first instance, the progressive reduction in the standard rate of tax, which will benefit all taxpayers, and must be a priority.  In addition, widening of the standard rate band will reduce the average tax rate for greater numbers of taxpayers, and of course reductions in the 48 per cent rate, which is paid by so many workers, will also have to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not touched the standard rate of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take time and we will do so.  Second, reform has, up to now, been targeted at lower income levels. However, the income levels at which single people start paying tax at the top rate remains very low and must also be addressed.  Third, the process of reducing corporation tax for service businesses commenced under this Government. I look forward to seeing this process continue in future years.  Fourth, the burden of social insurance costs has been addressed by the Government. This process of targeting taxes on employment creation should and will continue.  Fifth, the Government has directly supported all children by increasing child benefit by 45 per cent over the last two budgets.  We must continue to recognise the need to support families in their care of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell spoke at length about the climate necessary to foster an enterprise culture, yet he did not address the issues relating to the tax treatment of small business people who are responsible for a substantial element of job creation in the economy.  He asserts that there has been no tax reform, yet this Government, not the one in which the Progressive Democrats took part, introduced a low rate of corporation tax for small business in addition to reducing the existing rate.  It is this Government which, over two budgets, has introduced a 75 per cent relief from capital acquisitions tax to facilitate the transfer of family businesses to the next generation.  Actions speak louder than words.  The business <Col N="1970" /> community, especially small businesses, can readily make this distinction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also promised the House last night that, if in Government, his party would reduce the existing tax rates to 45 per cent and 20 per cent and also abolish employee's PRSI over a five-year period.  However, he did not tell us how he would pay for this package, which the Department of Finance estimates would cost about £2 billion.  He made reference to a more efficient State sector but he did not spell out, even in general terms, how his tax proposals would be funded.</P>

      <P>Any party which proposes to introduce tax cuts totalling £2 billion over five years without listing the major cuts which would be necessary in the big spending Departments of Health, Education and Social Welfare and in public pay is being dishonest with the people.  It is incumbent on the Progressive Democrats to spell out, at least in broad terms, where the savings are to be made if any credibility is to be given to these proposals.  Furthermore, the record of the Progressive Democrats in controlling public expenditure does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>

I will ensure the Minister receives a copy later this evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil coalition of 1991 and 1992 <Col N="1971" /> public spending rose by 10 per cent in each year.  This contrasts markedly with the performance of the Government in 1995 and 1996.</P>
    <P>My party and I are committed to genuine incremental tax reform and tax reductions, but they must be consistent with the prudent management of the public finances and the economy.  We will continue to articulate that view in Government and we will make significant progress down that road in the lifetime of this Administration.  In contrast, the Progressive Democrats motion and Deputy Michael McDowell's speech last evening offers the people an appetising but &ldquo;pie in the sky&rdquo; set of proposals with no convincing explanation of how they can be accomplished or paid for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Early on in his contribution last evening I gather Deputy Michael McDowell signalled that he would outline the grounds on which the Progressive Democrats would fight the next election.  His speech portrayed his party as being anti-establishment and a party of outsiders. While I would not claim to have an intimate knowledge of the Progressive Democrats, its Members in the House, its public representatives and its supporters do not look like a group of outsiders.</P>
      <P>It is best in such speeches to get areas of common ground out of the way initially.  It will be a short exercise.  I share Deputy Michael McDowell's concern about the management of the public service.  I, too, would like to see a system with more responsibility and flexibility in the management of how services are delivered.  I would like civil servants to be allowed to use their initiative and hard work to alter the system in which they work and to see them rewarded appropriately.  However, there is no link between that approach and the low wage, low skilled and low investment economy Deputy McDowell went on to outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> Deputy McDowell outlined the success of his model in other countries and he singled out New Zealand.  When challenged on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; recently I understand he had little to say as to the effect of the new model on the welfare of pensioners in New Zealand.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats are trying to impose a low wage and a low skilled economy where the unemployed would be forced into the marginal fringes of the labour market to work in poor jobs with few entitlements. Contrary to Progressive Democrats rhetoric, social justice has no part in that equation.  In its eulogy of free market liberalism it forgets to mention the effects this has in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States in which an underclass has developed. Indeed, the policies pursued were not successful in coercing the unemployed back into the labour market.  That is something of which we should be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the tragic aftermath of the <Col N="1973" /> unfortunate events at Packard Electric. A large number of people face job losses in a constituency adjacent to mine.  It is a pity that the best the Progressive Democrats could do in those circumstances, by way of offering hope and solutions to those unfortunate people, was to resort to their tax mantra. Taxation has had relatively little to do with the problems experienced in Packard Electric.  When the Progressive Democrats make comparisons between the wages being paid to people working here and to those in the corresponding factory in Coventry and when one looks at the tax wedge between Ireland and the United Kingdom, the difference is of the order of 2 per cent.  It is really alluding to the fact that in Coventry workers are prepared to work for almost £2 per hour less than the rate paid in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they should have the courage to say so rather than resorting to their tax mantra in the hope that it will create some difficulty for unfortunate politicians of the Left who find themselves in these circumstances.  It is totally without value in terms of reaching a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats go on <i>ad nauseam</i> about the high levels of taxation paid in this country.  The truth is that the levels of taxation paid are more or less in accordance with the European average.  We pay marginally less than the going rate of taxation in EU countries. We do not spend inordinate amounts of money on social welfare.  It is true the tax burden for demographic reasons is concentrated on fewer taxpayers than in other countries, but that relates to the high dependency ratio <Col N="1974" /> which exists &mdash; 1:2.5 &mdash; compared to countries like Denmark where it is of the order of 1:0.9.</P>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats chant their mantra that tax will solve all our problems and that we will have huge economic growth and development if we lower the tax rates, we must realise that economic progress is derived from a range of factors, such as political stability, a well educated labour force, good management and careful, wise and prudent Government investment. We hear relatively little about these matters from the Progressive Democrats, who simply chant on about tax.  That might be understandable if we did not have the experience of what it did when in Government.  As the Minister said, when it was in office, Government expenditure rose and tax reform was directed at the better off.  No significant improvements were made in key areas like personal allowances, marginal relief or in employers' or employees' PRSI.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the Progressive Democrats' proposal which regrets that the officials in the Department did not crank up its computer and run the master plan through the system.  It might be as well that they did not because there are areas of vagueness in the proposal which would leave blank spaces.  A rough calculation of what it proposes indicates that £1.1 billion to £1.5 billion would be taken out of the economy.</P>

      <P>They get more tax mad by the minute.  In their document <i>An End to Tax and Spend,</i> they propose for 1996 a standard tax rate of 26 per cent and a higher rate of 46 per cent.  During the debate on the Finance Bill this morning they proposed rates of 25 per cent and 45 per cent.  The proposal in their amendment to the Bill would take £300 million out of the economy.  They propose that employers' PRSI be abolished in one fell swoop.  This would take <Col N="1975" /> another £300 million out of the economy.</P>

      <P>If employee's PRSI was phased out, it would cost £100 million a year.  If it was done in one step, it would cost £450 million.  The tax band adjustments they propose would cost in the order of £150 million.  The total amount of these tax reductions would amount to between £1 billion and £2 billion.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney has experts to advise him on the implications of these figures.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm to reflect on what this type of expenditure reduction would mean.  The proposals of the Progressive Democrats could be implemented by getting rid of the security services &mdash; the Army and the Garda &mdash; which cost £1.057 billion.</P>

      <P>If this is not acceptable, I have other suggestions.  The abolition of the Department of the Environment, in which Deputy Harney served with distinction, would provide a mere £950 million.  The Progressive Democrats could then put together a package aimed at social welfare recipients.  They could abolish old age pensions, child benefit, disabled person's maintenance allowance and supplementary welfare allowance, which would provide £308 million, £368 million, £116 million and £152 million, respectively.  This is the type of action they would need to effect their proposals.</P>

They propose a socially discordant society which would have virtually no social cohesion.  It would be made up only of a collection of individuals centred on the concept &ldquo;me and me only&rdquo;.  This is the type of society from which I recoil and I sincerely hope the public understands exactly what would be the full implications of taking £1 billion to £2 billion out of the economy. This is what is in the Progressive Democrats' document.</P>

      <P>In this motion we are discussing something constructive in which there is widespread interest.  This will be one of the main issues in the next general election.  I would find it difficult to speak or vote against this motion.  My colleague from Cork, the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, who has a far better grasp of economics than I, would have had great difficulty doing so, until he read the Progressive Democrats document.</P>

      <P>The document shows that we need to carefully examine what people propose.  Its language is as catchy as the motion; it is entitled <i>An End to Tax and Spend.</i> Anybody who pays tax could not disagree with the motion.  We all feel we pay too much tax and are not provided with sufficient services. It is attractive to say people should not pay so much tax and tax rates should be reduced to 20 per cent and 42 per cent.  This, and the removal of insurance based contributions such as employers' PRSI and the health levy would cost £2.261 billion.  The Department of Finance did not include the cost of abolishing the health levy.</P>

      <P>This is a staggering sum.  The Progressive Democrats are the masters of economics.  They are all in extremely well paid jobs.  How do they suggest we pay for their proposals?  The document talks about cuts in the costs of job creation agencies.  I assume this refers to FÁS and other agencies which help the long-term unemployed.  Amazingly, the document talks about cuts in spending on primary education and child support services.</P>

      <P>When a political party puts its ideas on paper, particularly for a debate in which everybody is interested, we should say it has the courage of its convictions.  However, when a party does so, it must realise that its document will be scrutinised by others.  When we scrutinise this document, we quickly see that under the Progressive Democrats proposals those who could afford services would have them and those who could not would have to do without.  The document appeals to the selfish core in us all.  I <Col N="1978" /> readily admit that we are selfish and want the best without paying for it.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil voice concern for the hard pressed PAYE worker.  We share this concern and it has been substantially addressed by the tax and PAYE changes in the Finance Bill.  However, both parties are less vocal when it comes to ongoing inequities between farmers and the self-employed on one hand and PAYE workers on the other.  Deputies who seek to make short-term political capital out of the plight of PAYE workers may be interested in a few facts in which PAYE workers also need to be interested.  In 1994 income tax paid on farming profits &mdash; that is profits made by big farmers on declared income &mdash; amounted to only 1.8 per cent of the tax take.  Huge farmers and ranchers, who gain from every available subsidy only had enough profit to pay 1.8 per cent tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It frightens me that the Progressive Democrats do not refer to farmers in their document.  In the same year the average tax paid by a PAYE worker amounted to £4,087.  This was nearly three times the average tax take from a farmer, which stood at £1,031.  It is obvious the PAYE sector shoulders 86 per cent of the national income tax burden.  I should not be intrigued, but I am, that only 25 random <Col N="1979" /> audits were carried out on the self-employed, including farmers.  Only five had an added tax liability.  If more audits were carried out, how much tax would be collected?  When I speak about farmers, it is perceived that I am against all farmers but this is not the case.  In 1987 23 per cent of farmers struggled to subsist on incomes of £5,000 or less.  Part time jobs and social welfare payments made up the rest of their incomes.</P>
      <P>A fair tax system should treat all income in the same way.  It should strike a careful balance between four objectives, which may often appear to be in conflict.  It must be fair in the way it collects revenue; it must take similar amounts from people and corporate bodies with similar resources, although it does not in this case; it must redistribute income, wealth and work; and it must collect sufficient revenue for the Government to pay for things that are socially necessary.</P>
      <P>That is the difference between what Democratic Left considers to be tax reform and what the Progressive Democrats consider it to be.  While the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil were in Government from 1989 to 1991 the average PAYE worker paid £3,127. That was in 1989.</P>

We do not want people in certain professions to pay nothing while the PAYE worker pays everything.  Unlike the Progressive Democrats, we want good social services which are necessary.

      <P>In addressing this debate there is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> given the involvement some of us have had this week and last in the Finance Bill.  Much of what has been said in the debate on that Bill is relevant to the topic we are discussing.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 to 18 months this debate has gone to centre stage and it will be the central argument in the next election.  Underpinning it is the question of employment and unemployment. That is as it should be because it still is the greatest problem we have.  It is the greatest problem facing the European Union and, while we are not alone in having this debate, unfortunately our unemployment levels are worse than in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to members of the Labour Party and the Democratic Left who in discussing this subject use a redundant mantra that emanated from Eastern Europe a few decades ago. Thankfully, that has disappeared but they do not seem to have anywhere else to go.  They lean backwards to the past to try to find some ideology with which they can reach into the future.  However, the old axioms they have been used to are no longer there.  The reality is that <Col N="1981" /> left wing labour parties in every other country are moving towards much lower personal tax regimes.  That is a fact.  One needs only to look at the Labour Party in the United Kingdom to see them expounding personal tax rates of 20 per cent.  Yet here, the left, led by the Labour Party, has still not accepted this basic argument which has been embraced throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The economies that are doing best and which have the lowest levels of unemployment also have the lowest levels of personal taxation.  There is a message in this.  One of the issues central to this debate which is causing concern is the question of future programmes that may or may not be negotiated.  Programmes leading to the present <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> have played a role in developing ecomomic growth.</P>
    <P>There are three basic parts.  One is the community support framework in the national plan that we have <i>in situ</i> and which have had in the past.  We are currently involved in the 1994-99 plan.  The second element is the Maastricht Treaty and the disciplines that has put on Government.  The third element comprises the programmes for Government which have married all three elements together.</P>
    <P>The big disappointment in all this was in the PAYE sector which was told it would have to make the greatest sacrifices if the country was to be pulled back from the abyss it was looking into the last time Fine Gael and Labour were in Government together in the mid-1980.  The PAYE sector responded through responsible people in the trade union movement.  They had to deal with two specific issues.  One was the question of productivity involving ancillary questions about work conditions and practices which had to be resolved.  The second element was restraint in the wage market.  Both of those were given by the PAYE sector on the understanding that genuine tax reform would <Col N="1982" /> come.  The PAYE sector was told that when these programmes were completed and real economic growth began to drive the economy, some of the benefits created primarily by restraint in the PAYE sector would be given back. Every Member of the House who was involved in the recent by-elections must understand the deep anger and frustration in the PAYE sector which feels it has been betrayed by politicians.  They did not get back what they were entitled to, what they were told would be given to them and what they expected us to deliver.</P>
    <P>This was in train from 1987 to 1993 in every Fianna Fáil-led Government.  In difficult circumstances, year in and year out, efforts were made to reduce the burden of taxation on employees and employers.  What happened?  When the Labour Party finally got its hands on the golden chalice &mdash; the Department of Finance &mdash; all movement towards tax reform ended.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a more radical and substantial approach to this issue in budgets.  It is not a simplistic equation whereby if you go for lower tax rates you must cut large chunks out of public expenditure.  That is not the central question.  Choices must be made by us that the public will have an opportunity to vote on in the next 12 months.  The retarding of the levels of public expenditure we have now reached will be central to future economic development.</P>
    <P>We cannot get back what we have spent.  We know that the inflows to the Department of Finance through the Revenue in 1996 are substantially ahead of target.  The economy is still growing ahead of expectations.  Given that buoyancy, and hopefully its maintenance, more choices are avilable.  Choices were available to the Minister for Finance last year given the budgetary situation he found himself in.  He was the first Minister for Finance in 25 years to be handed a current budget surplus and he had even more opportunity in the 1996 <Col N="1983" /> budget.  He had some excuse because he had not been long enough in the Department to make decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister had real choices in the 1996 budget about the direction in which the Government wished to proceed. However, as we learned in the past, the Labour Party approach is one of high tax and high spend.  The tragedy is that Fine Gael has permitted this to happen, despite the promises it made and the lessons it learned.  I read with amusement some of the speeches made by Deputy Yates as spokesman on Finance for Fine Gael in the past.  Fine Gael's finance policy was abandoned on the day the Mercedes Benz cars stopped outside Leinster House and its members found themselves in Government.  It is a tragedy that ordinary taxpayers will be obliged to foot the cost.  They are heavily burdened and work day and night to create a standard of living for themselves and to educate their children. However, the Government has made no response to that sort of approach or attitude, at a time when the opportunity was greatest to make a meaningful contribution to tax reform.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's somewhat trite amendment to the motion before the House which commends the Government for its prudent management etc., and takes credit for strong economic growth, increased employment and low inflation and interest rates.  The environment to facilitate such developments was created during the past six to seven years by Governments led by Fianna Fáil, in which Deputy Bertie Ahern served as Minister for Finance. It did not happen because the Labour Party entered Government. However, when the rainbow coalition leaves office, the situation will be similar to that in 1987 if changes are not made in the Government's approach to fiscal policy.  This is a tragedy for PAYE workers and undermines the Government's ability to negotiate seriously with <Col N="1984" /> the social partners on the next programme for Government.  There is a perception that the expected payback of serious improvement in personal taxation rates has not taken place.  If the Government has any desire to negotiate a new programme in the coming year &mdash; I hope that this will be the duration of their stay in office &mdash; that issue will be central to any agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of State agencies responsible for the creation of employment.  I will not denigrate any of the efforts being made in this regard. However, we must call a halt to the proliferation of the number of agencies involved in employment creation.  There is no need for the explosion of agencies in this regard.  It has been stated on previous occasions that the Culliton report set down a framework but, for various reasons, we have gone in the opposite direction from the one suggested by that report.</P>
    <P>Specific, targeted agencies must be involved with employment creation. Ireland has a population of 3.5 million. Councils in the UK have responsibility for running cities with larger populations. We do not need the overlapping and confusion regarding filling out forms which exists at present.  The system has reached the point where a person seeking employment cannot face applying to the various agencies involved.  I have become lost in my attempts to cross-reference information with regard to advising people about the agency from which they should seek help.  We must deal with this problem because it is not adding to the prospects for creating employment.  In some cases it is preventing the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. It is an important contribution to the debate on this topic, which will not die and will resurface on a weekly basis. The public expects that somebody &mdash; I believe it will be the next Government led by Fianna Fáil &mdash; will seriously deal <Col N="1985" /> with redressing the balance regarding the low personal rates of taxation which are so badly required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State alleged that the proposers of the motion were attempting to create the impression that tax reduction would solve the country's economic problems. I will not pretend that this is the case because, demonstrably, it will not. Nevertheless, I broadly and enthusiastically support the terms of the motion tabled by Deputy Michael McDowell.</P>
      <P>Some of the fundamentals of the economy are good and the Government has not been slow to remind people of that fact.  However, as the Minister for Finance is aware, there are three critical fundamentals in the economy which are dangerously askew, current expenditure, the level of the national debt and taxation.  These fundamentals have one thing in common in that they are far too high.  It is not merely the Opposition which is making that case, it is being made by every objective economic commentator on the subject.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Government has kept within the letter of the Maastricht Treaty, the fact remains that current public expenditure has continued to increase at a multiple of both inflation and the target set down and published, for public consumption, in the programme for Government.  Current spending will have risen by 2.5 times the rate of inflation during 1995 and 1996.  This level of spending has grossly exceeded the Government's targets. Deputies Upton and Lynch did not advert to that during their rants about comparative tax rates, levels of spending, etc., throughout Europe.  They did not refer to the simple fact that the levels of current public expenditure in which the Government has engaged since taking office have grossly exceeded its own targets by a multiple of almost three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> This excess in current public expenditure over the rate of inflation, and the Government's own targets, represents about £600 million in lost opportunities to reduce taxation and/or debt.  No Government speaker has attempted to answer the question why, with extraordinary levels of economic growth, any real increase in current public expenditure is needed.  Why has the Government failed to meet its own relatively modest targets for increases in public expenditure?  This country owes £30 billion to its creditors which is equivalent to providing mortgages worth £40,000 on every property in the country.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that, at the changing of the guard in 1994, the country was in a position of having a current budget surplus. In other words, we had managed to wean ourselves off borrowing following a generation of doing just that.  The rainbow coalition then decided, as a cold and calculated policy, to return to deficit budgeting at a time when the country was at the top of the economic cycle.  It is basic economic theory that budget deficits occur when the economy is at the bottom of the cycle and a Government must borrow money and spend more to stimulate the economy.  There is no economic theory which supports the notion for giving the economy an artificial stimulus through using a deficit when it is at the top of the economic cycle.  This makes no sense.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, we had weaned ourselves off borrowing by the beginning of 1994.  At last we were in a position to make ends meet.  However, the &ldquo;rainbow warriors&rdquo; unilaterally decided, as their first act of economic policy, to change ends.  The Minister of State stated that there has been substantial progress in reforming the tax system in recent years.  There may have been progress, but it did not originate with this administration.  Last night the Minister for Finance referred, on a number of occasions, to the significant tax and PRSI reductions brought about by this <Col N="1987" /> Government.  Let us look at those significant reductions, particularly in relation to the 1996 budget which was the first the rainbow coalition prepared on its own without arguments about policy or expenditure agreed by anyone else.  The Principal Features of the Budget, issued on budget day, set out the reduction in net income for people with various levels of gross income. That was a fraudulent document.  The figures illustrated that people at certain levels of gross income would be better off by 0.6 per cent, 2 per cent, 1.9 per cent, 1.8 per cent, 1.7 per cent, 1.5 per cent and 0.8 of per cent.  Those figures were taken without factoring in the reductions in mortgage interest relief and VHI changes.  When those were factored in by a number of experts, the figures dropped dramatically to 0.25 per cent, 0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would need to factor in children's allowance as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not mathematically possible, as the Minister of State knows, to factor in the indirect tax increases. The people who are, therefore, better off as a result of the budget are those rare individuals or families who do not pay a mortgage or VHI, do not smoke, do not use ATM cards, do not drive or do not engage in any other form of activity which would attract increased indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if we accept &mdash; which I do not &mdash; that in some minimalist way people are better off as a result of the budget and that the budget resulted in a real increase in after tax income, we are only working on the basis that income stands still when it does not.  We estimate that incomes will rise by about the rate of inflation over the 12 months after the budget &mdash; by 2.5 to 3 per cent and the <Col N="1988" /> tax yield will increase more in percentage terms.  On budget day the Government announced that its proposals would extract £730 million more in taxation in 1996 than in 1995.  That is £2 million more in taxation for every day of the year.  If one accepts there are one million taxpayers in the country, that represents £14 per week per taxpayer. That is the significant tax reduction which was delivered in this budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome the PRSI reductions in so far as they go, but they do not go far. The employers' PRSI rate was reduced from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent.  That is not much when one bears in mind that part of it was immediately clawed back by increasing the ceiling on employers' PRSI from £25,800 to £26,800.  The reduction in employees' PRSI from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent was clawed back by the elimination of the PRSI allowance for tax purposes &mdash; another revolving door.  Estimates suggest that the reduction in the lower rate of employers' PRSI from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent will yield a net benefit of £2,500 to a clothing manufacturer employing 50 people.  It will yield approximately £4,500 to a company employing 100 workers.  It is no exaggeration to say that will not make any significant difference to cash flow.  I scrutinised the budget and the Finance Bill carefully but I cannot find a scintilla of evidence of the significant or substantial tax reductions which the Minister mentioned and the Minister of State repeated tonight.</P>
    <P>The Government insists on continuing to make a virtue of having kept within the letter of the Maastricht guidelines.  As a demonstration of fiscal virility, that is a pathetic delusion.  The Maastricht criteria were designed more than four years ago for a European Union&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the grip of recession when deficits all over Europe <Col N="1989" /> were going through the roof.  In November 1994 the then President of the Bundesbank, Herr Tietmayer, said that the criteria of a 3 per cent Government deficit should be at maximum when the economy was at the bottom of the economic cycle.  For Ireland &mdash; the Minister of State and the Fine Gael Party should bear this in mind &mdash; adherence to the Maastricht criteria is not synonymous with good economic management because we are at the top of the economic cycle.  We should not only exceed the Maastricht criteria, but build up reserves for when the current period of rapid economic growth slows down and the financial life support system from Europe is switched off, as it will be at the end of this decade.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of qualifying technically to come within a single currency because that is only the start.  The real issue is whether Ireland will be in a condition economically to participate within the discipline of a single currency. That will require a more competitive economy than the economy which this Government will hand over to Fianna Fáil early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The economy can only become more competitive if the burden of taxation is substantially reduced. Whatever gloss is put on it, reduction in current Government expenditure is the <i>sine qua non</i> to reduce taxation; we cannot have the former without the latter. The Government has failed abysmally to grasp the public expenditure nettle, that will have dire consequences for this economy within the new harsher financial discipline which participation in the single currency will demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party espouses social justice. Nobody should try to create the impression that low taxation is in some way the opposite to social justice or that low taxation implies that one is not in <Col N="1990" /> favour of social justice.  They are two sides of the same coin.  The best way &mdash; I have not heard a better way advocated &mdash; to promote social justice is to allow more people to participate in the economic life; to take people away from the margins and bring them into the mainstream. The best form of redistribution &mdash; another pet ideological goal of the Labour Party &mdash; is to reduce the 290,000 unemployed and allow more of those economically excluded people into the mainstream.  The best way to promote social justice is to reduce taxation and the only way to do that and to make this country more competitive is to reduce current public expenditure.</P>
    <P>We have wasted a great opportunity over the past two or three years to avail of historic economic growth rates.  In the past 18 months in particular, fiscal continence has been cast aside.  If it is not already too late.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance when he is framing the next budget to please bear in mind the type of competitive environment this country will require to participate within the discipline of a single currency.  I ask him to frame a budget which is not dictated by political exigencies because they will fail.  It has been shown in the past that spending the people's money and buying their votes is a failed economic strategy. If the Minister for Finance, when framing his next budget, acts patriotically and tries to reduce taxation to create a more competitive economy in the interests of this country, he will be thanked more for that than for the other failed political and economic strategies.</P>

      <P>Judge me by what I do, not by what I say.  It is incredible that we must spend our time in the House tonight responding to this motion in the name of the Progressive Democrats, particularly when one looks at their track record for the only couple of years they were in Government.  They <Col N="1991" /> want to reduce income tax and introduce various other measures, involving a shopping list of £2 billion, but they have not indicated from where £1 of this amount will be collected in savings in public expenditure.  We all wish the tax bill could be reduced by £2 billion, and it is our intention to reduce it as soon as it is prudent and possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding the track record of the Progressive Democrats in Government, public expenditure increased by 10 per cent in the two years they were part of the coalition Government with Fianna Fáil from 1990 to 1991.  We are now expected to believe that Deputies McDowell, Harney and others have changed their minds and the Progressive Democrats have undergone a road to Damascus conversion.  However, they are really electioneering on the backs of the productive sector in a desperate hope of securing more votes and a few more seats.  They will not fool anybody, least of all the productive sector which minds every penny because it is hard earned.  People in this sector want more disposable income in their pockets and they know a credible policy, such as that being implemented by this Government.</P>
      <P>The Government will reduce tax rates, particularly the standard rate, and widen the bands as soon as possible. Great progress has already been made in this area.  The Progressive Democrats promise 20 per cent and 45 per cent tax rates.  However, this will cost £2 billion.</P>

      <P>This sum must be found in the money spent on health, education and social housing services but the Progressive Democrats are not responsible enough to indicate where this money <Col N="1992" /> will be found.  This motion should be taken for what it is, opportunism of the worst type, and I am surprised by the Progressive Democrats.  I would not have been surprised if Fianna Fáil had put down the motion because adversarial politics have been played long and hard across the House by our parties. However, I did not expect it of the Progressive Democrats, which was supposed to be a new party which would show us all the light and how things should be done.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats have fallen into an appalling trap.  They are not credible and they can be judged by their actions which are contrary to what they claim to espouse now.  They will not fool anybody, particularly Members of the House and the productive sector that pays the taxes which keep the country running.  These people want to know about disposable income.  When the Progressive Democrats were last in Government with Fianna Fáil in 1990-91, people with a £45,000 mortgage paid £40 a week more given the interest rates at the time.  These rates were due to the lack of proper management of the economy and the public sector.  People paid £2,000 a year more on average mortgages then.  No amount of tinkering around with tax levels in a budget would give a person £2,000 more disposable income, but the Progressive Democrats expect us to believe the nonsense in the motion.  They surprise me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats were the new kids on the block who would change everything and who would not be opportunistic or canvass on the backs of the people.  They are starting early because there is 18 months to go before the next election.  They should examine their actions and the policies they put forward in the House should be more credible.  Deputy McDowell spoke at length during the debate and mentioned the climate necessary to foster an enterprise culture.  However, this <Col N="1993" /> Government, and not the Administration of which the Progressive Democrats were part, has made the most progress in this direction.  This Government introduced the lower rate of corporation tax for small businesses in addition to reducing the existing rate. Over two budgets, this Government also introduced a 75 per cent relief from capital acquisitions tax to facilitate the transfer of family businesses in particular.</P>
    <P>We should not be fooled by an empty record.  The Progressive Democrats should be judged on their track record which is appalling in the area of public expenditure.  Their motion is incredible and they are a major disappointment to those who expected more of them.</P>

      <P>Three reasons account for the growth rates.  One is the success of the American economy which is pumping foreign investment into Ireland, while the second is the state of the British economy which is supporting increased Irish exports.  The third reason is low inflation and low interest rates which came about as a result of the German economy maintaining low interest rates in Europe for several years.  These three factors alone and nothing the Government has done account for the growth in the economy and low interest rates on mortgages.</P>

      <P>It is a fact.  The Minister of State should read their Government's document.  The two Ministers of State are in the Department of Finance, but they seem to know little about finance because they ask where cuts can be made and from where the money will come.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, mentioned the need to find £2 billion, while Deputy Upton mentioned £1.6 billion and Deputy Lynch mentioned £2.2 billion.  They do not even have their sums correct.  Does the House realise that since the Labour Party came back into Government three and a half years ago, £1.6 billion over and above inflation has been spent running the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Labour Party went back into Government, £30 million a week more, over and above inflation, has been spent running the country.  If that money had been applied to tax reform, each taxpayer would have received an extra £30 a week in take home pay.  If the Government had applied the proceeds of growth to tax reform in the budget and maintained spending in line with inflation, it could have reduced the standard rate of tax from 27 per cent to 22 per cent or the <Col N="1995" /> top tax rate from 48 per cent to under 40 per cent.  Either of these moves would have done more for employment, job creation and social cohesion than the action the Government chose to take.</P>
      <P>Some people seem to think the answer to every problem is to set up a new State agency.  The Culliton report said the greatest single action the Government could take to generate employment and reward effort was to change the tax system.  It went on to say that, in addition, there was a need to streamline the number of agencies for job creation.  However, there are now 120 different agencies in the area of job creation which employ over 4,000 people.  The job creation industry is bigger than distilling or brewing, two of Ireland's major industries.  This is the current position.</P>
      <P>I do not apologise to Deputy Upton for saying taxation was a major cause of, but not the only reason for, the job losses in Packard Electric.  I did not criticise the Government for its handling of this matter unlike the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and others.  I have not sought to raise false hopes among the workers and I have supported the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister Deputy Bruton.  However, it is the case that those jobs have gone to Coventry because labour costs are lower there. The reason for this is tax.  A worker in Coventry pays a marginal rate of tax of 34 per cent while a worker in Packard Electric paid a marginal rate of 56 per cent.  A worker in Coventry must earn £547 before paying the top rate of tax, while a worker in Tallaght would pay it on under £230.  This is the reality.  In the last year in which Packard Electric was in full production and its 800 employees were at work, 35 per cent, or £5 million, of the total pay bill of £15 million went to the Government in tax and PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> My party tabled this motion because we need a new deal for taxpayers.  We need a new deal that will ensure that the present system, which is failing this country, is changed.  It is failing this country because it is killing the incentive to work by imposing penal levels of tax on those on low and modest incomes.  It is failing this country because it discourages employers from creating more jobs.  High payroll taxes increase the cost of labour and reduce the incentive to create jobs.  The present system is failing this country because it damages social cohesion.  It is isolating thousands of our people to a life of unemployment where they have no dignity or self-esteem.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Upton that people are better off working, even in badly paid jobs, than not working.  That was the answer I got when I met some of the Packard workers early this morning. They want to work and participate in their community and their country and any just society will give them that entitlement.  Above all our tax system flies in the face of what could be regarded as a reasonable social justice.</P>
    <P>Is it socially just that we impose four taxes on those who work for a living?  Is it socially just that a single person who earns £250 per week pays £65 a week in tax?  Is it socially just that a married couple with one earner on £300 a week pays £68 a week in tax?  What does that do to support family life?  Is it socially just that we take tax from the average earner at a marginal rate of 56 per cent and if they earn £10 in overtime the Government takes £5.60?  Is it socially just that by way of PRSI we take 4 per cent of the income of a person on £250 a week and only 1 per cent of the income of those on £250,000?</P>
    <P>Our tax system penalises in the main the low and middle income earners.  The wealthy people in Ireland do not live here for tax purposes.  They are based in tax havens in Gibraltar and Monaco. They do not pay the penal levels of tax <Col N="1997" /> that the ordinary workers of Packard were paying.  They are not really interested in the levels of tax here because if they are high earners they will just be domiciled abroad.  Many of our leading business people are tax exiles.  Is it not ironic many of those who work on the factory floor pay more tax than the people who own the companies? Is that socially just?  Is that what the Labour Party and Democratic Left believe is fair?</P>
    <P>Our complicated system of taxation, which has been added to over the years in various Finance Bills, has given us an array of tax breaks, reliefs and allowances. We have reliefs and allowances for Deputy Higgins's Hollywood films, for holiday homes and for extensions to hotels.  No doubt these are all worthy causes but the PAYE taxpayer cannot avail of them.  Indeed, they cannot even afford the professional advice that could allow them to navigate their way around the array of allowances, reliefs and schemes.</P>
    <P>A change in our tax system is fundamental if we want to encourage incentive, reward effort and create jobs.  It is a fact that for every eight people who work in the wealth creating sector of this economy, there are 24 dependants. The smaller that sector gets, the less money we will have for health, education and many of the other fine things we all want.</P>
    <P>I believe in a society where the Government does a few things but does them well, such as, protecting the citizen and providing a decent health and education system.  I do not believe in a society where the Government runs airports and ports, makes fertilisers and steel, runs hotels and, recently, a pub in Dublin, dog tracks and many other businesses. Deputy Lynch criticised me for wanting to see Baldonnel airport commercialised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not strange that the Labour Party and Democratic Left in Government have decided that the voters and residents of Dublin South West cannot use that airport?  It cannot be commercialised but they will allow private jets land at Baldonnel.  No doubt the tax exiles will be able to use Baldonnel's facilities, but not the ordinary residents of the area.  What kind of party would give that facility over for private jets?  It is of no economic benefit to the area.  It is a great convenience to the people who are tax exiles and can fly in and out for their 120 days a year but it will be of no economic value to the majority of the people who live in the south west part of Dublin.</P>
      <P>We need a new deal for taxpayers and I propose a five point plan which must be introduced if we are to have that fair deal.  This plan can be introduced in the life of a Government.  We must have two basic rates of tax &mdash; 20 per cent and 40 per cent.  No worker should pay more than one tax.  We should not have levies, whether for health, employment, or PRSI.  No worker who earns less than the average industrial wage should ever have to pay the top rate of tax.  No worker should ever pay more than 40 per cent of what they earn to the Government, at any level, by way of tax. Allowances, bands and so on should be index linked to protect against the ravages of inflation.</P>
      <P>I do not know if many Members watched the British Labour Party's broadcast for the local elections last night.  I had an opportunity to see it and it was all about tax.  Tony Blair made it very clear that if one wanted a socially just Britain, the level of tax on work had to be lowered.  I pointed out how attractive those levels of tax are in comparison to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dundalk, for example, a worker on £300 a week is £17 a week worse off than the same worker in Newry.  In addition, for the employer in Dundalk to give his employee an extra £1 by way <Col N="1999" /> of take home pay costs him £2.53.  It is 50 per cent less in Newry across the Border.  Even though those rates are much more attractive than in the Republic, Tony Blair, the leader of the British Labour Party, wants an initial rate of tax of 10 per cent.  He wants to reduce tax in Britain which he believes is too high.</P>
    <P>I hope the Tánaiste who canvassed for the British Labour Party in the last general election campaign, takes a leaf out of that party's book and that he studies very carefully what Tony Blair and his Labour Party colleagues are advocating for the British economy.</P>
    <P>In the last election campaign the Labour Party ran with the slogan that they wanted to put justice into economics and trust into politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We know from the recent fund-raising events about trust in politics and that ethics means that no Labour Minister ever resigns.</P>
      <P>Labour has been involved in the preparation of four budgets and has had an opportunity to put justice into economics. It has had an opportunity to reward the ordinary worker and those who used to be the concern of the Labour Party.  Instead of doing anything for them in the first year in Government it imposed a 1 per cent levy on ordinary workers which it was forced by the trade union movement to abolish in its second year in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every commentator I read, every trade union leader I meet and listen to, every small businessman I meet and virtually every Deputy in this House, particularly the Deputies in Fine Gael. know that we need to change our anti-work tax system.  It was very unedifying to watch Fine Gael Deputy after Fine Gael Deputy in advance of this year's <Col N="2000" /> budget tell us that we had to reduce personal levels of tax.  How humiliating for them to watch the Government and the Minister for Finance ignore them completely.</P>
    <P>The left wing parties have less than 20 per cent of the vote in this country but yet, because of ideological obstacles, they have stood in the way of reforming tax, rewarding effort and encouraging enterprise in this economy.  Fine Gael is the largest party in the coalition.  It is certainly in Government but it is not in power and they are not in control.  One only has to look at the way the Taoiseach dealt yesterday with the comments of the Tánaiste's programme manager &mdash; he would not even answer my question.  He took up his file to read what Minister of State, Deputy Burton, said last week.  Today on radio he must have got the courage to say something because the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, had expressed a view.  The Taoiseach is afraid of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly business people and workers, would have much more respect for the Taoiseach and for Fine Gael in Government if they exerted their authority in the interests of the taxpayers.  As the majority in this House, the trade union movement and the country know, we must reform our anti-work tax system if we are to generate employment and reward effort.  The greatest thing the Government can do, by way of learning a lesson from Packard and ensuring that we do not have more Packards, is ensure this is a competitive economy that recognises that high levels of tax on work, PRSI and other taxes on employment are a disincentive and sent jobs out of Tallaght and out of Ireland and into Coventry and other places.</P>
    <P>Reforming tax and reducing the rates is not about cutting public expenditure. It is merely about controlling public expenditure.  There is an enormous difference. We have spent £1.6 billion in <Col N="2001" /> addition to inflation since the Labour Party got back into office.  If that had gone towards reducing taxes we would <Col N="2002" /> have a very different country &mdash; one that would genuinely reward effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  The crisis of funding has substantially curtailed, from today, the level and quality of service offered by the professional, trained staff of the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre, located in Castlebar, County Mayo.  It services the county and provides telephone support to adjoining counties which have no service at present, namely Roscommon, Leitrim and parts of Donegal.</P>
      <P>The centre, which was set up in 1994, received a grant of £15,000 from the Department of Health and was well supported by the community.  The volunteer staff had more time at their disposal to undertake voluntary fund-raising activities to the extent that £10,000 was raised in 1994.  As the centre was open for only five months that year, it expended a total of £13,000 and, accordingly, had a surplus of funds at the beginning of 1995 when it received £20,000 from the Department of Health, which delegated future responsibility for funding to the Western Health Board that year.</P>
      <P>The range of services offered continued to expand in 1995 as did the necessity to engage extra staff to cope with the huge demands placed on the service.  Throughout that year, at several meetings with health board officials, the staff of the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre stated that they were conscious of a fall off in voluntary fund-raising, which is normal for any service which has been up and running for a few years, and informed the health board that unless the annual subvention was increased, services would be cut back.</P>
      <P>Throughout 1995 the full-time and volunteer staff of the centre could barely keep up with the demand placed on their services.  In early 1996, there was a waiting list.  Funding of £20,000 was received from the Western Health Board but if the level of service was to meet demand then being experienced, there would also be a shortfall in the region of £20,000.</P>
      <P>Because of this financial crisis one part-time paid counsellor, who did ten hours per week was laid off at the end of March.  A second counsellor who did 25 hours per week, was laid off yesterday leaving only one counsellor, who up to yesterday did up to 30 hours per week, running the service for a reduced 25 hours per week.  In effect, 65 hours service is now reduced to 25 hours paid service per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The centre is fortunate in also having three volunteer counsellors with a further three in training at present. However, experience has shown that volunteer counsellors burn out quickly as the work involved demands great commitment.  Furthermore, finishing the training of these volunteer counsellors <Col N="2005" /> and giving ongoing training will be difficult and, accordingly, skills will not be kept up to date.</P>
    <P>Operating from rented premises comprising four rooms and supported by People in Need, the annual overheads amount to approximately £8,000 leaving only £12,000 for salaries.  There is so much commitment involved in the provision of such a service as that provided by the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre that volunteers cannot be expected to do it without full-time support staff.  There is much talk of caring for children and victims of abuse but the only way to care is to provide a quality service, for which we must pay, which meets the needs and begins the healing.  There is a growing awareness of rape and sexual abuse and people have begun to look for help. They have no place to go in County Mayo now or, at best, the service is operating at a third of its 1994 and 1995 levels.</P>
    <P>Other rape crisis centres comparable in size of catchment area, such as Tralee, County Kerry, Clonmel, County Tipperary and Waterford City receive £40,000 per year.  County Galway, our adjoining neighbour which I admit has a larger population, receives £60,000 per annum.  A county the size of County Mayo does not have a service to meet its needs.  County Mayo deserves the best &mdash; a good counselling service.  Why should County Mayo have any less of a service than that provided to any other part of the country?</P>
    <P>Are counsellors expected to be highly trained and then expected to provide that service for nothing?  As and from today neither present volunteers nor the sole paid counsellor will take any further clients.  Some 60 new cases were dealt with in 1995.  Accordingly, help in situations of recent rape, support through medical investigation, crisis intervention counselling, support through statement procedures with gardaí and court accompaniment will come to a standstill from 1 May.  All <Col N="2006" /> school workshops, education and public seminars, public awareness and preventative work in the areas of rape, child sexual abuse, incest and abuse within marriage will be suspended until such time as funding allows.</P>
    <P>Voluntary fund-raising keep the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre going with the addition of statutory State support but unfortunately those fund-raising efforts have fallen off as can be expected in any service that is no longer novel.  I implore the Minister to look at the situation.  I appreciate that he may say it is a matter for the Western Health Board but I ask him to have a look at the overall situation because it is a very valuable service which is now expanding.  Those in the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre are sharing their skills with adjoining counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Hughes for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to reply.</P>
      <P>The awareness of rape and sexual abuse in our society has increased in recent years.  The trauma of rape and sexual abuse and the need to support the victims through the provision of adequate facilities has underpinned my Department's policy in relation to the development of services for the victims. The role of the rape crisis centres is an issue which must be looked at in the context of this policy.</P>
      <P>There are 14 rape crisis and sexual abuse counselling centres in Ireland. Services provided by these centres include counselling for adult victims of child sexual abuse, crisis services for all rape victims and education and training for volunteer counsellors.  There has been an increasing recognition in the health services of the complementary role of the work of the rape crisis centres with that of the statutory health services in providing a comprehensive service to victims of rape and sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1991, funding for rape crisis <Col N="2007" /> centres came from a number of sources, with funding being uncertain from year to year.  The unsatisfactory nature of these arrangements was recognised and following a Government decision in July 1991 funding for the centres was channelled through the health boards from my Department's allocation of discretionary national lottery funding.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women in its report published in 1993 recommended that existing rape crisis centres be given secure multi-annual funding on a contractual basis such as health boards already provide to voluntary bodies for some community and family planning services; that where a regional rape crisis centre did not exist the health boards in question should establish one staffed by persons with appropriate expertise; and that all rape crisis centres and health boards should maintain regular close liaison with a view to implementing the most appropriate and sympathetic policies for the victims of sexual assault.  It was also important that rape crisis centres should network with each other.</P>
    <P>In 1994 funding to the rape crisis and counselling services was provided from the Department's allocation of discretionary national lottery funding.  The total amount allocated in 1994 was approximately £670,000.  In 1995 I made £907,000 available to the centres nation-wide, an increase of £250,000 or 38 per cent on the level of funding provided in 1994.  Part of this funding was in line with a recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women to assist with the establishment, where none existed, of centres in some health board areas.  I am pleased to say that this level of funding has been maintained in 1996 with an appropriate adjustment for inflation.  Arrangements were also put in place to ensure that secure funding, in line with the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, would be <Col N="2008" /> available to the centres on an annual basis through the health boards.  I have said that by way of background to put the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre in context.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Western Health Board, which is responsible for the delivery of health services in its functional area, made statutory funding to the amount of £20,000 available to the Mayo Rape Crisis Centre this year towards the provision of its services.  It is perhaps worth pointing out that the board has also supported the centre by addressing a serious accommodation problem which it had encountered.  This I believe is an indication of the good working relationship which exists between the two bodies.  The centre has, I understand, recently applied to the board for funding totalling approximately £48,836 in the current year.  The board is in discussion with representatives of the centre regarding this application and has asked the centre to provide it with additional information to enable it fully to consider the application. I am confident that when this information is provided the centre and the board will reach an agreement on the appropriate level of funding necessary for the centre to continue its service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving us the opportunity to raise this matter.  For the past six weeks there has been a serious difficulty in Lough Derg, the premier fishing and pleasure lake in this country, with regard to thousands of dead fish, particularly bream.  Various State agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, the central fisheries board and the ESB fisheries conservation section have been doing research on this lake for many years. Under the direction of Dr. Ciarán McCarthy of UCG, serious research has been carried out on the present problem. The conclusion of this research is <Col N="2009" /> that the fish deaths are primarily the result of environmental conditions in the lake.  I thank you sincerely for giving us the opportunity to raise this matter. For the past two weeks we have tried to have questions answered by various Ministers but there are so many State agencies and Government Ministers and Departments involved that nobody wants to take absolute responsibility for any problem in this lake.</P>
      <P>There are thousands of dead bream all around Lough Derg, which borders five counties in the midwestern and midlands regions.  We want the dead bream removed immediately from the lakeshore and the environs of the lake. If there is incessant rain these dead fish, which are at present decaying, will be washed back into the lake and cause further pollution.</P>
      <P>Serious pollution has entered the lake due to the inadequate sewerage schemes in all the surrounding towns and we want the Minister immediately to sanction the Lough Derg protection catchment scheme and the various sewerage schemes that are necessary to this problem will not recur.  The tourism, fishing and angling interests in this entire area are seriously worried about this season if immediate action is not taken and firm commitments are not given tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lough Derg catchment area is one of our great natural resources.  It is with great regret that we feel obliged to raise this question in the House.  The stench of thousands of decaying fish can be smelt around the shoreline and a disaster will follow if there is not an immediate clean up and if resources are not given to the various State agencies to carry out that work.  A major EU cohesion scheme which will assist all the local authorities in that catchment area to provide tertiary sewage treatment facilities, as well as a major scheme for Portumna, is in hand and the first tranche of funding has <Col N="2010" /> already been sanctioned.  I was personally involved in this scheme when I was Minister for the Environment because of the concerns expressed about the eutrophication and enrichment of that lake.</P>
      <P>The present problem is acute because of the fishing season, the mayfly and the fact that we are approaching the start of the tourist season.  People who have invested very heavily in tourism facilities and new tourism products could be absolutely devastated if that clean up is not done immediately.  Time is against us but we ask the Minister and his colleagues to make sure that resources are made available immediately for that purpose.  The ongoing clean up of the lake and the other related matters can wait but this particular matter cannot. We urge on the Minister the necessity of getting this work in hand immediately. Save the jobs in the tourism and fishing industries in the area.  Nothing less than immediate action will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I share the Deputy's concern about the recent reports on fish in Lough Derg.  There are a number of unexplained aspects, in particular that only bream are affected and other fish species such as salmon and trout which are more sensitive to changes in the ecological conditions of waters have been unaffected.  I am not aware of adverse effects on birds or other forms of wildlife in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Electricity Supply Board, which owns the fishery rights to the lake, is seeking to establish the factors responsible for the death of bream and samples have been forwarded to University College Galway for analysis.  The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board is also attempting to determine the causes.  The information available to me at this stage is that definitive findings have not been <Col N="2011" /> obtained from these investigations. Efforts will continue.</P>
    <P>The initial reports concerned parts of Lough Derg in which Galway County Council has jurisdiction.  Sampling conducted by the council has shown the lake meets the statutory standards for waters intended for human consumption. The council is concerned to ensure that the public can have confidence in the quality of water supplies taken from the lake and accordingly has instructed the Western Health Board to increase the level of monitoring of drinking water.  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency is arranging to intensify water monitoring in the lake.  The council, the fisheries board and the ESB are working together to collect, remove and dispose of all dead bream.  While there is no evidence at this time to suggest that environmental factors may be responsible, it is opportune to put on record the importance the Government attaches to protecting Lough Derg and the measures being taken to tackle potential sources of pollution.</P>
    <P>The lake has been identified as a sensitive area for the purposes of the EU Directive on urban waste water treatment and a major programme of investment is being implemented by the Minister for the Environment to upgrade sewage treatment facilities within the lake catchment.  This will involve the provision of secondary treatment facilities and or phosphorus reduction facilities at Ballinasloe, Birr, Nenagh, Roscrea, and Tullamore at an estimated cost of £6.5 million.  Planning and construction of sewerage schemes will also go ahead at Athlone and Monksland, County Roscommon at a cost of £2.85 million.  Sanction has also been given to the planning and design stages for Portumna, Clara, and Moate sewerage schemes.  Pump-out facilities to cater for sewage from cruisers on the Shannon have been provided or are under construction at 11 locations including Dromineer, Mountshannon, Shannon-bridge, Ballina, and Portumna.</P>
    <P>Steps are also being taken to deal <Col N="2012" /> with the impact of agriculture on water quality.  The control of farmyard pollution and rural environment protection grant schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are making a substantial contribution in this regard.  In addition, the Minister for the Environment has brought forward an amendment to the Water Pollution Acts to allow local authorities to serve notices on farmers requiring them to prepare nutrient management plans where authorities consider this to be necessary for the purposes of preventing, eliminating or minimising water pollution.  The objective of these plans is to strike the right balance between crop nutrient requirements, taking account of nutrients already in the soil and to be supplied from farm waste and chemical fertiliser applications, and water pollution prevention considerations.  These powers will complement existing statutory provisions and will leave local authorities well placed to deal with nutrient losses from agriculture where eutrophication problems arise in lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>All possible efforts will continue to establish as quickly as possible the reasons for the recent fish deaths.  The various agencies involved, together with relevant Departments, will assess the situation in detail when the factors responsible are established and will adopt any further counter-measures which may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The reply from the Minister for the Environment deals explicitly with the two issues raised by the Deputies &mdash; the collection of the dead bream from the shore environs of the lake and the commitment to the Lough Derg catchment protection scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this matter on the Adjournment.  The negotiation of a special tax status for American companies in Northern Ireland has for some <Col N="2013" /> time been under consideration in political circles.  It is a worthwhile idea; when one considers the economic devastation in the North over the past 25 years there is a clear need for innovative measures to lift its economy.  However, in the context of innovative thinking to find solutions to unemployment in the North, sight should not be lost of the serious impact the troubles have had on the counties immediately south of the Border and none has been more affected than County Louth.  At present, between 10,500 and 11,000 people are unemployed in this county, spread among the three main areas of population, namely Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee.  The encouragement of industrial investment in the area has been sluggish. Despite a concerted effort by the IDA the unemployment figures remain stubbornly high.  Given the current efforts to secure special tax status for American companies in Northern Ireland a similar effort should be made with regard to such companies which are locating or will locate in the six southern Border counties.  This would be of immense and immediate benefit. At a time when it is difficult to get mobile investment into this area, it would be a major shot in the arm for those in the business of bringing the industrial itinerary through Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now some months since the industrial development conference in Washington and there is some disappointment that no tangible progress has been made in terms of direct industrial investment.  It is no good holding conferences and seminars if they become mere PR exercises.  Tangible progress must be made.  Unless definite and innovative measures are taken, to actively encourage that investment, nothing will happen.  I am sure the Minister and the Government are not unaware of what has happened on both sides of the Atlantic in relation to this issue so I urge them to ensure that the <Col N="2014" /> six counties immediately south of the Border are included for consideration in any possible arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter.  I assume he refers to a recently proposed Bill for a free trade agreement between the US and Northern Ireland and the Border counties which is being introduced in the United States Congress.  I am not aware of any proposals regarding special tax status for American companies in Northern Ireland and in any event issues relating to the taxation of companies operating in any part of this jurisdiction are matters in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I understand the main proposal in the Bill now before Congress, which apparently has the support of a number of members of the US Senate and House of Representatives, is to eliminate or to reduce substantially the duty applied to exports to the United States from both Northern Ireland and the Border counties. I understand the Bill as currently drafted refers specifically to the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Monaghan, Leitrim, Cavan and Louth.</P>
      <P>The Bill is somewhat analogous to a Private Members' Bill here, in that its further progress will depend on the proposers' ability to garner widespread support in both Houses of Congress.  A major obstacle which will have to be addressed by the Bill's sponsors relates to arguing successfully for additional preferential access arrangements for Irish exports over and above the current GATT agreements.  Ultimately any special tariff arrangements would require approval by the European Union and the World Trade Organisation. Given my responsibility to promote Ireland's trade interests, my Department has monitored this proposal with interest and will continue to keep a close eye on developments through our Embassy in Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> The Deputy will be aware that the Border counties which feature in the proposed Free Trade Bill are also those which were the focus of the White House conference on trade and investment which took place in May last year. This Bill can be seen as a further indication of the widespread desire in the United States to contribute to the peace process by encouraging and assisting economic development in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>As I have said in this House on many occasions, we warmly welcome the efforts of the many friends of Ireland in US political and business circles to be of assistance to us in our efforts to achieve and copperfasten a peaceful political settlement in Northern Ireland.  The engagement of the United States can undoubtedly play a major role in converting the potential of the peace process into lasting economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The United States is a key economic partner.  It is our fourth largest export market with Irish exports in 1995 totalling over £2.25 billion.  It is also the largest source of inward investment to Ireland with more than 400 companies operating here.  In addition, almost 600,000 US visitors came to Ireland in 1995.  The strengthening and deepening of our economic links is, therefore, something which I would very much support.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the White House conference was a major and very welcome demonstration of US engagement with Ireland at the highest level.  The entire weight and attention of the Administration of the most powerful country in the world was put at the disposal of Ireland in an unprecedented personal initiative by President Clinton.  The conference provided an opportunity for one-to-one networking by Irish and US business people and for exploring avenues for potential co-operation such <Col N="2016" /> as joint ventures and other commercial link-ups.</P>
    <P>As this is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the House on US trade issues since the untimely death of the former US Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown.  I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and to again acknowledge the vitally important role played by him and his team, including his Assistant Commerce Secretary, the late Chuck Meissner.  Ron Brown and his officials were key players not only in the organisation of the conference, but in the follow-up contacts and business development missions which have taken place since then.  I had the privilege of meeting both men on a number of occasions, including at the White House conference where Ron Brown and I signed a joint communiqué on tourism co-operation.  I found both him and Chuck Meissner to be whole-hearted in their determination to assist to the greatest extent possible in underpinning the peace process through economic development and regeneration.  Their energy and commitment to the process will be sorely missed.</P>
    <P>One of Ron Brown's last acts was to set plans in motion for a follow-up to the White House conference on trade and investment.  This follow-up conference will take place in Philadelphia in the autumn and is intended to develop further the areas of potential economic co-operation identified at last year's conference, with a particular focus on Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, work is progressing on particular sectoral initiatives.  The US Department of Commerce is also planning further inward business development missions to introduce US business people to potential Irish partners, similar to that led by the late Chuck Meissner in autunm 1995.  My Department and the agencies for which I have responsibility, including An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte, will continue <Col N="2017" /> to co-operate with the Department of Commerce in facilitating this work.</P>
    <P>Finally, to return to the specific question of the free trade Bill currently before the US Houses of Congress, I would like to thank the Deputy for his interest in Ireland-US trade issues and to assure him that my Department will continue to follow closely the progress of this proposal.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Departmental Industrial Action.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter which is creating further havoc in an industry which is already on its knees. The lack of action and inability by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to solve problems is becoming a sick joke.</P>
      <P>This Adjournment matter arises as a result of the industrial action by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, which has resulted in chaos in the services administered to farmers, particularly in relation to their need to trade livestock and the permits which are needed to certify the disease free status of herds in relation to TB and brucellosis.  There are farmers now who cannot trade.  For months, they have been holding back stock because of the appalling prices on offer.  That catastrophe is now compounded by the failure of the Minister to resolve a problem which means many farmers cannot obtain special herd tests and are practically locked up, through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pleaded with the Minister on a number of occasions in relation to various areas of policy.  I raised this issue because of the number of inquiries I received over the past few weeks in relation to this matter.  For example, I was contacted today by a person involved in the farm retirement scheme who leased his farm from 1 May.  As a result of this decision he has arranged for a disposal sale of his livestock and <Col N="2018" /> farm machinery for 4 May.  In preparation for the sale he tested for TB and brucellosis on 5 April.  Because of the work to rule, he is unable to obtain the laboratory report of the results of the blood tests.  Consequently, he is unable to get cattle identity cards to proceed with the sale as planned.  It is of considerable significance that in 34 years of intensive livestock farming, this individual has never had a single case of TB or brucellosis.  If he has to postpone the livestock sale he will forfeit all his benefits under the retirement scheme and will have to provide for the upkeep of livestock at great expense as he has already leased his property.</P>
    <P>This is just one of a number of cases where people have asked me if the Minister or the Department have any inclination to deal with the havoc, pressure, hardship and worry suffered by an increasing number of farm families as a result of the failure to deal with the work to rule.  The Minister should consult his colleagues in the Departments of Education and Finance who have been able to secure special measures for acute problems in their Departments. The Minister for Education resolved the problem in relation to examinations.</P>
    <P>The famous farmers' charter is becoming something of a racket.  People around the country are asking if anybody in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has the ability or competence to solve these problems and resolve the crisis cases.  People need cash now and to sell now.  They are entitled to the results of blood test. Livelihoods are at stake.  We do not need to talk about BSE, the reduction in export refunds and all the other issues we have continually highlighted here, although unfortunately to no avail, in terms of farmers' livelihoods and earnings.  The Department is not capable of solving a problem which arises as a result of people not being able to sell in the marts in their own country, let alone being able to sell in foreign markets because of issues which have arisen in the UK.</P>
    <P>The Minister must confirm in the <Col N="2019" /> House he has resolved the issue because it cannot go on any longer.  Farmers are telephoning and writing to me, the Minister and every other Deputy asking if there is any way the collective genius of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry can overcome this problem so that people, like the person to whom I referred, will not lose all entitlements as a result of a failure in the Minister's Department to deal with the workings of the country's most important industry.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the farmers' charter is a sick joke.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry spent £600,000 of taxpayers' money on special payments to staff in his Department before Christmas &mdash; advance payments before the work was done.  This advance payment was for overtime, the purpose of which was to clear backlogs of work which arose because he insisted on the offices being open all day and not allowing staff to deal with the backlog which was accumulating as a result.  The farmers' charter has proved to be an unplanned and uncosted fiasco.  It is the most expensive photo opportunity in the history of Irish agriculture.  This estimate does not take account of the approximate £250,000 spent on the launch.  Farmers are paying in spades for the continuing one day, PR driven agenda of this Minister.  He is not even willing, it seems, to deal with the most desperate cases from this latest fiasco in the running of his Department.  There are livelihoods at stake.  People expect results and are fed up listening to excuses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by my colleague in relation to this matter. Farmers are desperate.  They have suffered a number of body blows in the last few months, but now administrative difficulties in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are preventing them from selling cattle in their local market to provide themselves with an income.  This is a penalty <Col N="2020" /> imposed on farmers.  As Deputy Cowen said, when there was a problem in the Department of Education in relation to examinations, the Minister rightly got down to work and sorted it out.  Farmers are virtually demented at this stage and have contacted Members on all sides of the House.  They are angry about the situation and cannot get anyone to listen to them.</P>
      <P>If the immediate cash flow situation was not bad enough, agricultural shows and various other events are taking place in the coming weeks.  The organisers of these events have asked us to raise this matter in the Dáil to bring the seriousness of the situation to the attention of the Minister to see if something can be done about it.  At present, people cannot get blood tests done on cattle they wish to sell.  With difficulty, I contacted the office in the South Mall in Cork two days ago.  I was told that since 2 April there is no way such tests can be done.  It appears that no great pressure is being applied.  The Minister must resolve this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>My office and I have been acutely aware for three or four weeks of the deterioration in services from my Department by virtue of the industrial action taken by the CPSU. While the decision was taken to exempt the intervention intake from the dispute, the restriction on services to farmers and the agribusiness and food sectors is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Deputies referred to the worldwide crisis in the beef sector.  While intervention has been made available, it is impossible for farmers who cannot sell animals because permits and cards are not being returned to herd owners from district veterinary officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interpretation that the CPSU has put on new work combined with the effective work to rule has essentially meant that 400 of its members working in district veterinary offices are doing no <Col N="2021" /> work.  I have high regard for the CPSU. Its members are key members of the staff of my Department.  They deal directly with the public under a multiplicity of schemes operated by my Department.  I acknowledge that staff in these grades are diligent people delivering an excellent service in normal circumstances to the public.  Industrial relations in my Department have been very good and I hope this situation will continue and that the present action will not damage these relations in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen referred to the severe criticism which he and others made of me with regard to advance payments I made, in excess of £835,000, in connection with overtime in the latter half of last year.  This is indicative of how I have bent over backwards to facilitate the CPSU.</P>
    <P>I regret the action being taken by the CPSU, which is having an extremely severe impact on the farming community. It means that, under the disease eradication schemes, tests have virtually ceased in all counties since farmers are reluctant to pay for tests when in many cases they cannot get identity cards or test results.  In addition, many farmers are unable to sell cattle as cards are not in date.</P>
    <P>There are even more serious problems. The results of drug tests done under the brucellosis scheme, which is not a new scheme, are not being made available.  This means that diseased animals are perhaps mixing with other animals in a herd for which no diagnosis can be obtained.  Brucellosis is a very contagious disease.  In addition, reactors cannot be slaughtered because permits are not being made available.  These are fundamental issues of animal health and I am deeply concerned that, at a time when food safety is at a premium, the national effort should be undermined by such industrial action.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that there are not other problems.  The House should be aware that utter havoc is about to <Col N="2022" /> descend on my Department in respect of the entire premium payments for 1996.  There are tens of thousands of maps in respect of the land parcel identification scheme which are in unopened envelopes in Hume House.  It will not be possible, therefore, to administer the premium schemes with regard to forage area aid etc.  This will become a monumental crisis for my Department if the strike extends well into this month.  It will cause huge direct hardship for farm families.</P>
    <P>This situation is unacceptable against a background of ongoing talks between the union and the Department of Finance at the Labour Relations Commission. When the Department of Finance agreed to these talks there was a clear understanding that problems arising would be addressed.  It has been a long standing and laudable practice in the trade union movement to suspend any action which might cause hardship while talks are in progress.  Even today, there were lengthy talks under the auspices of the facilitator.  It is unfortunate that the CPSU has not seen fit to do likewise on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I realise that industrial action by its nature causes disruption.  However, the interpretation by CPSU of the type of industrial action to apply to the disease eradication programme is unnecessarily rigid.  A more realistic interpretation would allow clerical staff to undertake the aspects of the new scheme which applied prior to 1 April.  This would allow trade to continue unhindered.  The same principle should apply to the other areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, talks are continuing at the Labour Relations Commission to resolve the dispute.  The Government has already signalled its preparedness to end the embargo which was the initial cause of the dispute.  In this context I am surprised that the union has persisted in its action in all Departments.  In particular, I am amazed it has refused to address the <Col N="2023" /> immediate problems arising for the agricultural sector.  It demonstrated co-operation in that it said it would not obstruct the intervention system, but this makes no sense when it is obstructing cattle movement which will prevent many farmers from delivering their cattle to factories and marts.</P>

    <P>In these circumstances, I see no genuine reason for the continuation of the industrial action in my Department. I am therefore calling on the CPSU to call off its industrial action now, or at the very least to cease the specific actions that are preventing animals testing or movements of animals and actions in area aid schemes which will in due course lead to problems with premia payments for farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Last year, in the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill regulating information on abortion services, I set out the Government's approach to the problem of unwanted pregnancy and abortion.  I said that the Government regarded the incidence of abortion among Irish wonen as representing a serious problem.  The other statistics quoted by the Deputy, in that they are to some extent indicative of unwanted pregnancies, also represent a serious problem.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to these problems is a comprehensive one, with two objectives &mdash; to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies and to reduce the extent to which these end in abortion.  It includes three elements.</P>
      <P>Firstly, a major research study is in progress at present to identify the factors which contribute to the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and those factors which result in the option of abortion.  The results of this research will provide a basis for the development of effective and properly targeted education programmes to help reduce unwanted pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> The second element in the programme is the development of comprehensive and accessible family planning services in each health board area.  Very substantial funding was provided to the health boards in 1995 and again in 1996 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The third element is the emphasis placed by the Government on the importance of counselling for women with crisis pregnancies.  Deputies will be aware that it is now a requirement that any doctor or counsellor who is asked to provide abortion information may do so only in the context of full counselling on all of the alternative courses of action open to the woman.  In addition, the Government has this year provided £700,000 to a range of voluntary agencies to support the provision of free pregnancy counselling, in addition to funding provided to the health boards for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>It can be seen, therefore, that the Government is at present involved in a concerted and quite unprecedented effort to tackle the problems which underlie the statistics quoted by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of heart disease, mortality rates vary in different countries.  In Ireland this disease is treated in a number of ways and can be broadly divided <Col N="1815" /> into four categories, namely (i) prevention, (ii) medical treatment, (iii) angioplasty and (iv) open heart surgery. Most patients with heart disease are treated medically in a non-invasive way.</P>
    <P>Patients with cardiac disease are fully assessed and only in certain clinical circumstances are some referred for cardiac surgery assessment.  There are internationally accepted criteria for cardiac surgery and in Ireland patients are reviewed by cardiologists and cardiac surgeons using these criteria, before a decision is made as to the best form of therapy for individual patients.  In Ireland, there is no evidence that patients are inappropriately referred for cardiac surgery.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Advisory Board's Report on BSE gives a very clear message.  It tells us that the continued rigorous enforcement of the controls currently in place here will protect the consumer of beef produced in the Republic of Ireland from exposure to the agent of BSE.  The main recommendation from the report is, therefore, that the existing controls should continue and be strengthened when and if necessary.  I know my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, agrees with this conclusion and will do all that is necessary to protect consumers and beef producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> In relation to the two specific recommendations in the report, the position is as follows.  In the case of CJD, records of deaths in Ireland attributed to CJD are being examined.  The initial examination has been completed and reveals a very low incidence, about one death per year.  Further research is under way which will include examination of clinical records where they are still available.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is taking steps to ensure prompt reporting of all new or suspected cases.  This will involve co-operation with hospitals as well as directors of public health.</P>
    <P>My Department is also investigating the possibility of co-operation at international level in the monitoring of the disease.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to BSE are, of course primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. However, I can tell the Deputy that the veterinary research laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is involved in collaborative research work, which also involves researchers in the UK.  In addition, research is also being caried out at University College, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the report of the Study Group on the Development of the Psychiatric Services <i>Planning for the Future,</i> which was published in December 1984, recommended a shift in delivery of services for the mentally ill from an institutional to a community-based service.  Since then, the report has been adopted as policy by successive Governments and acute units in general hospitals, day hospitals, day centres and community hostels have been opened to replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other therapeutic interventions which have altered the delivery of psychiatric services include domiciliary assessment, community nursing and home support, respite care, out-patient <Col N="1818" /> clinics and clinical rehabilitation services.</P>
    <P>Persons with mental illness are provided with a continuum of care from acute admission through care at home or in the community.  Services for patients who are acutely mentally ill are provided in a hospital setting.  When a patient has recovered from the acute phase of his-her illness they are discharged to the care of their general practitioner, in conjuction, where necessary, with the sector mental health team.  Discharge from acute care is made on the basis of a clinical decision.</P>
    <P>Prior to discharge from hospital, each patient is assessed individually to identify his-her psychiatric needs together with his-her personal strengths.  Following assessment, a specially designed programme of rehabilitation is drawn up for each patient.  Such programmes aim to cultivate the social, communication and vocational skills of the patient.  The patient remains under the care of the mental health team for as long as he-she requires.</P>
    <P>As the care of a person with mental illness is a continuum from acute admission to community based services, information on patients as requested by the Deputy is not available.</P>
    <P>However, the report on Activities of Irish Psychiatric Hospitals and Units, published by the Health Research Board, indicates the following admissions and discharges from acute hospitals and units in 1992, 1993 and 1994:</P>

    <P>An advantage of the organisation of care for the mentally ill in this country is that the same authority &mdash; the health board &mdash; is responsible for medical and <Col N="1819" /> nursing care in hospital and in the community, the provision of housing for the metally ill in the community and the provision of sheltered employment.  This has enabled services for the mentally ill to be provided in a more comprehensive way than is the case in other countries where these functions are divided among a number of agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): On 28 March 1996, I signed regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994.  These set out arrangements to be applied in respect of the registration of health benefits undertakings, the operation by undertakings of open enrolment, the provision by undertakings of lifetime cover, the making available by undertakings of a guaranteed minimum level of benefit under their contracts and the putting into effect of a risk equalisation scheme between undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulatory framework provides a high degree of protection to the members of the public in the context of the opening-up of our private health insurance market to competition.  As regards people who suffer from a psychiatric illness, who have the desire and means to effect private health insurance, insurers are prohibited from refusing cover, terminating existing cover because of frequency of claims or &lsquo;loading' premiums to discourage the availing of cover.  It guarantees to the <Col N="1820" /> insured person a specified level of indemnity for a period of not less than 100 days in-patient services in a year. Prior to the regulations there were no such expressed statutory guarantees available.</P>
    <P>The provision of a statutory guarantee of indemnity benefit for not less than 100 in-patient days represents insurance cover in excess of the three month period within which 92 per cent of discharges from private psychiatric hospitals occur.  Prior to the finalisation of the regulations.  I met representatives of the two major private psychiatric hospitals who indicated that a minimum cover of 100 in-patient days treatment and a commitment to include 20 day-patient days for psychiatric treatment in the regulations was acceptable to them. Furthermore, in the event of cases arising where an insurer's policy only provides for the minimum 100 days and the insured person exhausts same then he or she can avail of the entitlement to full eligibility for services under the public system, both hospital and community based.</P>
    <P>I consider that regulations providing entitlement to a specified minimum level of indemnity cover in policies to be written by commercial insurance companies constitute a protection for the general public.  I further consider that, in relation to the approach taken by insurers to limiting exposure to the provision of psychiatric benefit, the minimum level set under regulation is substantial.  I do not subscribe to the view that this constitutes discrimination in circumstances where facilitating competition in the market is an issue and particularly in a system where everyone is eligible for services under the public system regardless of whether they have or had private insurance cover.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware a set of proposals, worked out between health service management and the unions representing nurses, are currently being balloted on by the members of the four unions.  The proposals in their entirety, while complex, are designed to address a range of issues identified as their priorities by the union and management sides respectively.  The proposals were recommended for acceptance by three of the four unions while no recommendation was made by the fourth.  This would suggest a degree of acceptance of the proposals, at least at executive level, by the four unions. For the Government's part, I had indicated repeatedly that the nurses' claim would be looked at in a flexible and sympathetic manner, having regard to the priorities identified by the unions, the additional flexibility and co-operation required to provide an efficient, high quality nursing service and, obviously, the overall pay policy framework within which all claims on behalf of public service employees had to be processed.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, which remain to be implemented are Part VII of the Act, which deals with the supervision and inspection of pre-school services and Part VIII which relates to the registration of children's residential homes. As I have stated previously, it is my intention that the outstanding sections of the Child Care Act be implemented by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Part VII of the Act will require health boards to supervise and inspect créches, nurseries, pre-schools, play groups and other similar services for pre-school children.  It will be necessary to prepare regulations in relation to the standards of care, accommodation and facilities to be provided in pre-schools.  A working group representative of statutory and voluntary organisations is currently preparing guidelines on the content of the regulations.</P>
      <P>In relation to Part VIII, a working group has already prepared a draft set of standards for residential care centres and these will form the basis of the regulations to be prepared under Part VIII of the Act.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Statistics on the number of alleged child abuse cases reported to the health boards in 1995 are not yet available in my Department.  Preliminary figures for 1994 indicate that over 4,600 child abuse cases were reported. These figures are currently being finalised including the number of confirmed cases of abuse and I will forward details to the Deputy as soon as they become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on the average time lapse between the reporting and investigation of a child abuse allegation is not available.  The procedures followed by the health boards in investigating allegations of child abuse are in accordance with the guidelines issued by my <Col N="1825" /> Department in 1987.  In addition, last year I launched Guidelines for the &ldquo;Notification of Suspected Cases of Child Abuse between Health Boards and Gardaí&rdquo; which amend the 1987 guidelines in relation to the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda are to notify suspected cases of child abuse to each other and in relation to the consultations that should take place between both agencies following a notification.  The 1987 guidelines stress that where child abuse seems likely and a child appears to be at serious risk immediate action must be taken to protect the child and any other children in the family.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances where an allegation proves difficult to verify the guidelines state that the key health board worker involved should continue to visit the family as often as he/she thinks necessary until a decision to do otherwise is reached by a case conference or by agreement with a senior member of staff.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in response to the recommendations of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation report, the health boards have taken steps to improve arrangements for the assessment and management of child abuse cases, with particular importance being attached to co-operation and co-ordination between the hospital and community care services of the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 36 and 50 together.  I dealt with the question of the publication of the Madonna House report during my address to the Joint Committee on the Family last Wednesday, 24 April, and I will repeat what I said then for the benefit of the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is important to understand that there are significant differences between the Madonna House and Kelly Fitzgerald reports.  The report of the inquiry into Madonna House was commissioned by the Sisters of Charity, who were responsible for the operation of the home until its closure in 1995.  Many of the allegations made in the case of Madonna House have never been tested in court and are, at the moment, allegations only.  A new allegation of abuse of a child at Madonna House was made recently.  This allegation is currently being investigated by the Garda Síochána, in co-operation with the Eastern Health Board.  In addition, there are a number of civil actions pending against the Eastern Health Board and the Sisters of Charity.  These claim damages against the defendants for assault, negligence and breach of duty.  This situation is in direct contrast with the Kelly Fitzgerald case where, as far as I am aware, there are no civil or criminal proceedings, pending or threatened, arising from the subject matter of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reiterate my firm intention to put as much of the Madonna House report into the public domain as is legally possible.  Arrangements for the publication of as full a version of the report as possible, including the full <Col N="1827" /> recommendations, are almost finalised and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on publication next week.</P>
    <P>As regards the west of Ireland farmer case I have been informed by the health board in question that the work of the group established to review the board's involvement in the case has been suspended on the legal advice of senior counsel.  Therefore, the question of publication does not arise as no report has been completed in this case.  However, the board has explained to me that it is their intention to have the review group resume their work as soon as is practical and to publish the report, subject to legal constraints.</P>
    <P>Putting Children First, the discussion document on mandatory reporting which I launched on 29 February, has been widely circulated to professionals and interested parties in the child care area.  To date, a number of submissions on the issues raised in the discussion document have been received in the child care policy unit of the Department of Health.  I am heartened by the thoughtful and caring responses which have been received to date on this complex and sensitive subject.  The initial deadline for receipt of submissions was 30 April.  However, as I announced on Monday last, I want to ensure that all interested parties get a full opportunity to participate in the consultative process which I initiatied on mandatory reporting.  While I am anxious to make an early decision on the issue, I am aware of the practical difficulties which many of the larger organisations had in consulting their members and compiling comprehensive submissions.  I wish to take the views of all interested parties into account in relation to mandatory reporting and arising from numerous requests, I have decided to extend the deadline for the receipt of submissions on Putting Children First to 31 May 1996.  Following the receipt of all submissions, it is my intention to provide opportunities for interested parties to <Col N="1828" /> come together to discuss comprehensively the issues involved.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The addition of fluoride to public water supplies is provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.  Fluoride is added to the public water supplies as a positive public health measure for the reduction and control of dental caries, decay.  This has long been recognised internationally as a safe and effective way to improve public oral health and research has confirmed this improvement.</P>
      <P>The fluoride may be produced in two different ways.  One way is as a by-product of the agricultural fertilizer industry while the other way is as a primary product in its own right.  All fluoride used in the public water supplies, whether as a by-product or as a primary product, must comply with the required specification to ensure that it is of a high quality.  Fluoride occurs widely in nature and is present naturally in the environment and in some natural foods.  It is mainly sourced from geological sources, and it is natural constituent of differing types of natural rock formations.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): On 20 February 1996, the Government made decisions on a range of measures designed to reduce the demand for drugs.  Provision was made in these decisions for the development, by the Eastern Health Board, of proposals for additional services to deal with waiting lists for such services in the Dublin area.  The board has submitted a comprehensive and detailed implementation plan for 1996 which aims, through a variety of initiatives, to increase the numbers receiving treatment for drug <Col N="1832" /> misuse to 2,500 by the end of the year. This represents almost a doubling of the existing programme.  Work has already commenced on the implementation of the plan and additional funds are being provided by the Department to ensure that it will be properly resourced.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indicative drug target, IDT, scheme has its origins in discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners in the context of the 1992 GMS review when it was agreed that medicines were not always prescribed in the most effective manner and that, accordingly, there was significant potential for <Col N="1833" /> an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better patient care and better use of the resources in the development of general practitioner services.</P>
    <P>Each doctor was, accordingly, encouraged to examine his-her existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of any available opportunities to make prescribing more effective and less costly for all his-her patients.  To assist in the process, doctors were provided with indicative drug targets which had been constructed on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted on the basis of age and sex.</P>
    <P>The duty and obligation of individual doctors to provide the most appropriate management for each patient who presented and, in so doing, to utilise resources available for the optimum care of patients individually and collectively was emphasised by all parties to the scheme.  In this context the right of the doctor to prescribe, as he-she considers necessary, remains absolutely in place and there is no limitation on the range of items from which he-she can choose to prescribe.</P>
    <P>As an incentive to doctors to embark on this review process, the scheme provided that a portion of the savings made would be made available to the individual doctor concerned for practice development projects which received the prior approval of the health board. This resource has been allocated towards improving facilities within general practice for the purposes of providing a more comprehensive and better quality service for patients.</P>
    <P>Generally, I am satisfied that a considerable number of doctors are making a genuine effort to achieve more rational and cost-effective prescribing. Prior to the introduction of the incentive based indicative drug target scheme, the average annual rise in general medical service drug costs was much greater than that occuring since the introduction of the scheme.  The rise in the ingredient cost of medicines in the GMS has decreased from an annual average of 11 per cent prior to the inception of the scheme to less than 6 <Col N="1834" /> per cent in the past three years.  This containment is in no small way directly related to the impact of the scheme and the achievement of more effective prescribing by doctors.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners, will continue to evaluate and refine the scheme with a view to achieving rational, safe and cost-effective prescribing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>Recently in a reply to a question in the House I said that I had no plans to intervene in the dispute between the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland relating to arrangements for payment in respect of the treatment of VHI members in 18 private hospitals. The parties concerned have not called on me to become involved as both are aware that I am not in a position to intervene in the dispute.</P>
      <P>I remain of the view that arrangements relating to the cost of services are matters to be directly negotiated between any health insurer and service providers.  I do not have any statutory function in the appointment of arbitrators to resolve commercial disputes between health insurers and service providers. Furthermore, I consider that such a role for me would be wholly inappropriate in the context of the evolving competitive health insurance market for which I, as Minister, am the regulatory authority.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the parties to decide whether they want to pursue the course of referring their differences to arbitration. I would have no objection to such a course being agreed between the two sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that both sides have taken steps to minimise inconvenience to the patient-VHI member.  The private hospitals will give the patient the option of assigning the payment of VHI benefit directly to them.  The VHI will not require the member to have settled the account before paying benefit; it will make payment directly to the member at the appropriate rate within three weeks of receiving completed claims and supporting invoices and is also prepared to pay the hospitals directly on <Col N="1836" /> the assignment of benefit by the member.</P>
    <P>I was also asked if I have received any notice of a price increase from the VHI. Section 3 of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996 requires the VHI to give the Minister for Health specified prior notice of proposals to increase premium charges.  I have not to date received any notice pursuant to the provisions of the section.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The exact nature of the administrative problems or in which social work service area they may arise, from the high turnover of social workers, is unclear from the Deputy's question.  While some administrative problems may arise from time to time as a result of difficulties with the recruitment and retention of social workers, every effort is being made by health boards to fill posts without delay. Health boards are involved in an ongoing recruitment campaign which has the objective of having all social work posts filled as quickly as possible, whatever the origin of their post, be it newly created or vacant on foot of the promotion or departure of a previous postholder.</P>
      <P>On 20 March 1996 I approved the report of the national validation body on the criteria governing the validation of non-national qualification in the field of social work and this should greatly assist health boards in the filling of social work posts in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Asthma cannot be construed as an infectious disease within the meaning of the 1947 Health Act and cannot, therefore, be classified as an infectious disease.</P>
      <P>Asthma appears to be increasing in Western Europe.  The reasons for such an increase are unclear, but it is suggested that changes in the home environment favourable to proliferation of the house dust mite, earlier diagnosis and relabelling of symptoms such as wheeze, and an increase in air pollution levels, may all be contributory factors. The Health Research Board is supporting a project looking at the epidemiology of a number of conditions, including asthma.  It is expected that the findings of this study will be available next year.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new public health departments in the health boards, with their emphasis on epidemiology, will greatly improve the level and quality of information on all diseases and conditions, including asthma, in each local area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cost incurred by persons in respect of the treatment of asthma, persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified by their general practitioner as having a long-term medical condition, such as asthma, with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and <Col N="1838" /> medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>In the case where a particular child or member of a family is incurring heavy expenditure due to their asthma condition, the chief executive officer of the health board may grant a medical card to cover that child or individual, rather than issue a card to cover the whole family.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medicine above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive treatment and financial assistance is being provided to asthma patients through the existing range of services and support schemes available.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government measures to combat drug misuse announced in July 1995, the Minister for Education has announced a programme on substance abuse prevention for primary schools.  This programme includes awareness raising seminars for teachers, parents and school management, the development of in-career training for teachers and educational resource materials with a special focus on areas where substance abuse is known to be a major problem.  The Department of Health participates in the steering committee for this programme and will cooperate with the Department of Education in the development of the various aspects of the programme.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The procedures followed by health boards in investigating allegations of child abuse are in accordance with the 1987 child abuse guidelines issued by the Department of Health.  The procedure which I introduced last year for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between <Col N="1841" /> the health boards and the gardaí represents a major amendment of the 1987 guidelines, in so far as the interaction between the two key players involved in child protection is concerned.</P>
      <P>The 1987 child abuse guidelines specify that where child abuse seems likely and that a child appears to be at serious risk, immediate action must be taken to protect the child and any other children in the family.  The guidelines specify that, whether with parental consent or under an emergency care order, the child should be taken for a medical examination by a local doctor and/or, where appropriate, by attendance at the nearest paediatric unit.</P>
      <P>The identification and validation of child sexual abuse is fundamentally different and the child abuse guidelines set out particular issues which must be borne in mind in such cases.  Multi-disciplinary teams should be designated for the examination of children and the validation of alleged child sexual abuse. These teams are required to be sensitive to the needs of sexually abused children and to the many complex issues involved including matters related to the giving of evidence in court.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, additional resources totalling £35 million have been invested in the development of child care services. All health boards availed of this funding to strengthen their community care teams to better protect children from abuse and specific measures were undertaken to improve services for the validation of child victims of abuse. These included: the expansion of services at the child sexual abuse units at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Hospital; the development of the child abuse unit at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork; and the expansion of services provided by the child sexual abuse unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The nominal change in the Health Vote is a decrease of 1 per cent.  However, when account is taken of the fact that funding for the disabled person's maintenance allowance was transferred from the Health Vote to the Vote for the Minister for Social Welfare and allowing for certain once-off items of expenditure in 1995, there is a real increase in the Health Vote of approximately 4 per cent.  The Vote allows for the full year costs of developments initiated in 1995 and also includes a savings element of 0.7 per cent of non-capital expenditure, which as the Deputy is aware was required of each Minister, in the context of the 1996 Estimates.  The savings have been used as a contribution towards the cost of further service developments approved for 1996 in line with the Government programme and the action plan contained in the health strategy.  These developments include child care services, services for the mentally handicapped, the physically disabled and the elderly, psychiatric services, dental services, acute hospitals and services for those with AIDS/HIV and drug problems.  I am satisfied that there is adequate funding to maintain services at approved 1995 levels and to provide for the critical service developments which are contained in the Government programme.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The present multi-organ donor card campaign, which is run by the Irish Kidney Association with funding from the health allocation from the national lottery, has been particularly successful in creating public awareness about organ transplantation and encouraging organ donation among the general public.  Ireland is practically unique among European countries in that it is essentially self-sufficient in the availability of organs.  Because of this, I understand that the transplant community here would be reluctant to change the present voluntary and altruistic character of organ donation as it is felt that this very factor contributes to the existing high rates of organ donation.</P>
      <P>The present code of practice concerning organ transplantation is based on the principle of informed consent of donors and/or their next of kin.  It is, therefore, considered highly desirable that the relatives of deceased persons whose organs would be suitable for transplantation should be fully involved in the donation process.  There have been occasional calls for computerised databases to be maintained of people wishing to make organ donations. However, the cost of maintaining such databases and the likely marginal net benefit would suggest that the present system is working well.  I would be reluctant, therefore, to make changes without good reason.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Regulations relating to the general medical services (GMS) scheme stipulate that, in so far as is practicable, a person availing himself of the service shall have a choice of medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>A condition relating to this choice is that the doctor concerned must be practising within seven miles of the patient's place of residence.  Exceptions may be permitted to this condition, for example, in remote areas where the distances involved would make its application impracticable.  In addition, the doctor concerned must not already have a full list of patients and he-she must be willing to accept the person as a patient.</P>
      <P>Within the parameters mentioned above, medical card holders have always had the right to change their doctor of choice under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for the provision of services under the GMS rests with the health boards.  Posts in the GMS are filled by open competition.  Health boards operate an equal opportunities policy in their competitions for these posts which are open to all suitably qualified candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of progressing developments under the health strategy and arising out of the availability of investment moneys in general practice from the indicative drug target scheme, there have been a number of improvements in the range of services provided by doctors in the GMS scheme.  In this regard, the Department requested the health boards last year to concentrate on the development, within general practice, of a range of services in a number of areas including the area of women's health.  It was suggested to the health boards that, where special expertise or support was not available, such services could be provided on a sessional basis.  This initiative would <Col N="1847" /> allow health boards, in co-operation with general practitioners, to addresss situations where there is non-availability of a female GP, for example, in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to these developments at general practitioner level, I have asked the health boards to prepare detailed plans for the delivery of a comprehensive family planning service, including choice of service provider, and these plans are currently being finalised.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy is aware, substantial additional funding has been made available in recent years for the development of services for persons with a mental handicap or a physical or sensory disability.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £44.58 million invested in the services for people with a mental handicap in the period 1990-95 has enabled health boards to put in place over 1,000 additional residential places and 2,100 day care places.  A further £10 million has been made available in 1996.  Since 1993, additional funding totalling £15.5 million has been invested in services for people with a physical or sensory disability with emphasis being placed on the development of day care, respite and residential care services as well as therapy services. In 1995, £3 million capital funding was provided for the development of new services and the refurbishment and improvement of existing services.  This included £500,000 for aids and appliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that this additional annual funding has made a significant impact on the number of persons <Col N="1848" /> awaiting residential care or in need of day service and that it has enabled a start to be made in tackling the issue of inappropriate placement.</P>
    <P>However, I am aware that more needs to be done if we are to meet the needs of those awaiting services.  The Government is committed under both the health strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> and <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the continued development of the service as resources become available. It is my intention, on completion of the validation of the national mental handicap database to propose a five-year development plan for the services based on the information on the database. Services for people with physical and sensory disabilities are being examined by the review group whose final report is expected shortly.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Dental fluorosis is a chronic condition and is not acute, debilitating or life-threatening.  It is always caused by excessive, i.e. higher than optimal, fluoride injection over a period of years.  The amount of fluoride added to public water supplies in Ireland is regularly monitored to ensure that the levels of fluoride as provided for in the <Col N="1851" /> Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, are adhered to.  In addition the presence of dental fluorosis has been investigated thoroughly by means of scientific studies carried out since water fluoridation began here more than 30 years ago.  The results of these studies show and confirm that the condition is not a public health problem in the State.</P>
      <P>The relationship between dental enamel fluorosis and the long-term consumption of excessive fluoride in the diet is very well known and has been documented for very many years, commencing about 100 years ago.</P>
      <P>Definitive scientific investigations have not established that there is any link between the fluoridation of public water supplies and osteoporosis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly over the winter period, in recent years.  This is not a problem confined to Ireland but is a feature in other developed countries also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The causes of the problems which arise have been well documented.  The ageing of our population has contributed to the difficulties in accident and emergency departments.  The winter <Col N="1854" /> period brings its own set of problems for our elderly population.  This in turn can lead to an upsurge in the number of patients who present in accident and emergency departments requiring admission to hospital.  Many elderly patients require acute hospital care initially but much of their recovery period could be spent in step down subacute accommodation.  The shortage of sub-acute beds, particularly in Dublin, has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospitals.  This can result in patients having to be placed in temporary accommodation.  There is nothing new in this.  This has been the position for quite some time and has faced different Ministers for Health.</P>
    <P>The volume of patients who present at casualty departments for treatment has also increased.  For example between 1988 and 1995 the number of new attendances at the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin increased by approximately 39 per cent. The extra volume of patients in some instances, has necessitated extending the physical facilities in some accident and emergency departments and it is intended to continue refurbishing A &amp; E departments as required.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency problem has been building up, especially in Dublin, for some time.  Up to now, difficulties in the accident and emergency services have been dealt with by providing mainly once-off solutions.  I was anxious that a more comprehensive and integrated approach be adopted.</P>
    <P>In the first instance there is a need for hospital management to give greater priority to the problems that have emerged in the organisation and delivery of accident and emergency services. Hospitals need to refocus their activities to a greater degree with regard to bed utilisation and in relation to admission and discharge procedures.  It is important that each hospital agrees a series of measures that will result in a <Col N="1855" /> better and more streamlined response. It is only when the above issues have been tackled that a hospital is in a position to deal with the many day-to-day logistical problems that arise in the provision of accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>The successful management of the accident and emergency difficulties includes tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and services provided by the acute hospitals which, when taken together, provide a comprehensive and integrated response.</P>
    <P>The measures adopted for the winter of 1995-96 are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 25 bed new elderly care unit opened in Peamount Hospital in December 1995,</P>
    <P>&mdash;40 additional nursing home places in private nursing homes were made available,</P>
    <P>&mdash;three new community ward teams for the elderly have been approved,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 25 bed unit for the young chronically disabled in Cherry Orchard Hospital opened at the start of February 1996.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 46 bed community unit for the elderly on the Navan Road opened in the middle of February 1996,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a health board public education campaign co-ordinated by the Eastern Health Board on the appropriate use of accident and emergency services was launched on 15 January 1996.</P>
    <P>&mdash;in the six accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin a number of measures were taken including:</P>
    <P>(i)  the opening of extra beds,</P>
    <P>(ii)  additional staff recruited,</P>
    <P>(iii)  medical equipment grants were approved for A &amp; E departments,</P>
    <P>(iv)  observation facilities were opened,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> The cost of the measures outlined above was £534,000 in 1995 and will be approximately £2.5 million in 1996.  This is the largest investment ever in the management of accident and emergency services in Dublin.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Over recent years additional funding has been made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families. While health boards do not maintain waiting lists specifically for Alzheimer's patients, the investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to those with Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  This is reflected in the ongoing progress being made to improve further health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers, including the development of specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that my Department allocates £80,000 annually in core funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in <Col N="1857" /> recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Almost £16 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): With the elderly population set to rise, there is a need to provide some additional health board long-stay places and to improve existing accommodation.  As the Deputy may be aware, I announced last summer my commitment ot a capital programme over the next few years which will improve and expand long-stay health board facilities for the elderly in each of the eight boards.  I would see this as one of a number of priorities which must be addressed within the capital programme on a sustained basis, until the identified needs for additional and improved accommodation have been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, apart from providing additional and improved health board accommodation the Deputy will be <Col N="1859" /> aware of the subvention scheme operated under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990.  This subvention scheme came into operation in September 1993 and currently 8,015 persons have been approved for subventions under this scheme.  I provided approximately £15 million for the scheme in 1995 and £16 million in the current year.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): All health boards and voluntary hospitals were notified in their letter of determination of their 1996 approved allocation.  A requirement of the letter of determination is the preparation, by the agency concerned, of a service plan which ensures that activity levels are maintained at approved 1995 levels and within allocation. I am satisfied that the level of funding available to health agencies in the current year will ensure that these requirements can be met.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that temporary bed closures are a routine feature of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country.  They arise for a variety of reasons, including the need to carry out essential maintenance and repair works. Such closures are usually planned to coincide with a period when staff are on annual leave, and when the level of activity has traditionally declined.  All emergency and urgent services, of course, continue to be provided during such periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The Health Insurance Regulations were signed by me and laid before the House of the Oireachtas on 28 March 1996.</P>
      <P>One group which represents the views of persons suffering from certain psychiatric conditions has expressed concern about the minimum annual period of psychiatric in-patient cover which insurers will be legally obliged to provide under their policies.  The regulations provide that the minimum period of guaranteed cover in respect of private psychiatric in-patient care is to be 100 days in a year.  Furthermore, I am committed to making provision, at an early date, for a further period of 20 days day-patient care in private psychiatric hospitals.  This is a significant improvement on the 40 days in-patient cover which was the original proposal on psychiatric cover.  The level of cover now provided as a statutory minimum compares very favourably with the position taken by insurers elsewhere who specifically limit, in some cases extensively, their exposure to risk in the area of psychiatric illness or do not cover it at all.  It is the practice of foreign insurers to exercise pre-authorisation of admissions to psychiatric hospitals and to otherwise be in a position to significantly qualify the basis on which benefit may be payable.  My Department is not aware of any other case internationally where providers of private health insurance contract to make available cover for a period of 100 days psychiatric in-patient services without pre-certification and in an environment where the entire population is eligible for a free public psychiatric service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 report of the Health Research Board shows that 92 per cent of discharges from private psychiatric hospitals occurred within three months. Where circumstances arise that an insured person requires treatment in excess of 100 days, later to be increased <Col N="1861" /> to 120 days, in a year and where the policy does not cater for this, it will be open to him or her to avail of treatment in public psychiatric hospitals and public community-based facilities.</P>
    <P>Prior to finalising the regulations I met with representatives of the two major private psychiatric hospitals to whom the proposals on minimum benefit in respect of psychiatric in-patient and day-patient services were acceptable in the context of an open competitive health insurance market.</P>
    <P>There was concern raised regarding the extent of out-patient cover provided under the regulations.  I believe that the provision made is appropriate to the core hospital and consultant related services which are the subject matter of the regulations.  Furthermore, it would be inappropriate and an unsustainable imposition on freedom to provide services under the EU's Third Non-Life Directive to seek to prescribe, as a minimum entitlement, a comprehensive out-patient service that would exceed what is generally available in the market at present.  It is already apparent that insurers will compete more on products than on premium costs, in the first instance, so the regulations must avoid unduly curtailing their latitude for product design.  Concern previously raised about the absence of provision of ancillary health services such as ambulance services in minimum benefit regulations was not sustainable under regulations which have as their core objective the protection of community rating within a competitive environment.  There was concern from the insurance sector about some indemnity aspects of the regulations but my Department was satisfied that the provisions were appropriate.</P>
    <P>The only submission following the signing of the regulations, of which my Department is aware, relates to the issue of minimum guaranteed cover in respect of psychiatric services.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): It is difficult to give precise details of costs in respect of the provision of services for people with AIDS.</P>
      <P>The policy on HIV-AIDS is based on the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee. HIV-AIDS and drug misuse policies are closely interlinked given that 55 per cent of all HIV positive cases are intravenous drug-use related.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 funding has been allocated to all health boards, particularly the Eastern Health Board where the majority of drug misusers reside, for the development of services. Between 1992 and 1995 a total of £10 million was allocated to HIV-AIDS and drug misuse services.  A substantial part of the funding available in this area has been used in the provision of services for people with AIDS.  These services include the appointment of consultants in infectious diseases in the Mater-Beaumont and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  A consultant in palliative care has also been appointed in Our Lady's Hospice, Harolds Cross.  Other services for which funding was made available include the provision of additional respite beds in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>In addition, services are provided to persons living with AIDS in acute hospitals which are funded from such hospitals' ongoing revenue allocations. Allied to these services, funding for voluntary organisations involved in the provision of services to people with AIDS has been increased substantially since 1992.  I will continue to ensure that services for persons with AIDS are provided as necessary.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): There have been no recent specific surveys, of the type referred to by the Deputy, carried out by my Department.  However, the longstanding policy of successive Governments over the past 25 years in relation to acute general hospital services for Dublin city and county has been founded on the development of six major acute general hospitals; St. James's Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Beaumont Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital, which will replace the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street.  These hospitals provide a wide range of services to the people of Dublin.  In addition, there are other hospitals which service Dublin city and county such as, for example, the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, The Children's Hospital, Temple Street, St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, St. Luke's Hospital and St. Columcille's Hospital.  Furthermore, access to hospital services has been improved by recent investment in the ambulance service.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that people who reside in the city centre and those who work there are catered for to the extent that there is no need to build another general hospital in the centre of Dublin.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The plans for the provision of alternative mental health care in the Clare area are in line with the national policy document, <i>Planning for</i><Col N="1865" /><i>the Future,</i> published in 1984 and the Mid-Western Health Board's response to this document.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board is continuing to implement the plan for alternative care through the provision of services in the community throughout County Clare.  The provision of these services has led to a significant reduction in in-patient numbers at Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis, during the past ten years.</P>
      <P>This plan for alternative care in the region will continue with the provision of an acute admission unit at Ennis General Hospital which I was pleased to announce during my visit to Clare in February of this year.</P>
      <P>The plan also involves the relocation of those patients deemed to be inappropriately placed in Our Lady's Hospital. It is envisaged that two community residential units will be in operation by the end of 1996 providing accommodation for 20 persons with mental handicap.  A number of elderly persons currently placed in Our Lady's Hospital will avail of the future development of day, respite and long-stay care services in the area.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board is satisfied that accommodation for the non-psychiatric elderly in the Clare area is satisfactory.  The four non-acute hospitals at Ennistymon, Raheen, Kilrush and Ennis continue to provide rehabilitation, respite, palliative and long-stay care places for the elderly.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which was implemented on 1 September 1993, also allows health boards greater flexibility in managing the long-stay needs of the elderly in their area, through the assistance provided by the subvention scheme which accompanied the Act.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware that the cost to the State of keeping a child in residential care is considerably greater than the cost of foster care.  The main reason for the difference is the cost of employing professionally trained staff to care for children on a 24 hour basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present approximately 3,000 children in the care of health boards, of which over 75 per cent are in foster care.  Decisions on the most appropriate care options for children are a matter of professional judgment taking into account the needs and <Col N="1867" /> wishes of individual children.  Whereas it is generally recognised that foster care is the preferable option in relation to the care of vulnerable children, there are children for whom foster care is not a suitable option.  Because the needs of children in residential care and foster care are different, it is not possible to compare the outcome of care in respect of either setting.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the valuable contribution of foster parents to the care of children in need of care, I was pleased to increase recently the foster care allowance to £60 per child per week in respect of children aged 12 years and over, with effect from 1 March of this year.

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The Government has authorised the drafting of a new Adoption Bill to provide, among other matters, for certain amendments of the Adoption Act, 1991, which contains the current statutory provisions relating to the recognition of foreign adoptions.  A primary objective of the proposed amendments will be to facilitate the recognition under Irish law of adoptions effected in countries, such as the People's Republic of China, whose laws permit the termination of adoptions in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards adoptions effected in Paraguay, I understand that the adoption laws of that country provide for two forms of adoption &mdash; plenary adoption and ordinary adoption.  The former has <Col N="1868" /> a similar legal effect to an Irish adoption and as such qualifies for recognition under present legislation.  However, an ordinary adoption effected in Paraguay is not entitled to recognition here because the legal effect is significantly different from that of an Irish adoption order in relation to the termination and creation of parental rights and duties. The question of whether such adoptions could be brought within the scope of the proposed extended recognition system raises complex questions which are currently being examined.  I have sought legal advice in the matter.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Adoption Board, which has a central role in the administration of the Adoption Act, 1991 has compiled a list of countries whose adoption laws it has examined for the purposes of establishing whether adoptions effected under those laws qualify for recognition under the legislation. I am arranging for a copy of that list to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that an application has been submitted to my Department for funding under the cultural development incentives scheme 1994-99, which I am administering under the Operational Programme for Tourism, by Dún Laoghaire Arts Centre Limited in respect of the development of an arts centre in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have approved in principle the funding of eight projects submitted to me under the cultural development incentives scheme 1994-1999.  The advisory committee which I have established for this purpose is considering, with a view to making recommendations to me, the other applications received.  I expect this process will take approximately another month to complete and I hope to be in a position to approve in principle the funding of further projects and to announce details of these projects in May.  A decision will be made on the application submitted by Dún Laoghaire Arts Centre Limited in respect of the arts centre in Dún Laoghaire during this process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 79 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed Dublin port access route is intended to be a national primary road.  The development of proposals for the route is, accordingly, a matter for Dublin Corporation, as road authority for the area, acting under the general supervision of the National Roads Authority which has overall responsibility for the planning, design, construction and financing of national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> It is the intention that the proposed route would be constructed as a motorway. The Roads Act, 1993 outlines the statutory procedures which must be complied with before a project of this nature can proceed.  These include a full environmental impact assessment, the preparation of a motorway scheme and the holding of a public inquiry into all matters relating to the scheme, including the environmental impact.  These procedures, which involve extensive public consultation, give all interested persons and organisations ample opportunity to make their views and concerns known, and ensure that all views and objections are fully considered before a final decision is taken on a proposed scheme.  As Minister, I have a quasi-judicial function in relation to individual motorway schemes and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any aspect of a particular proposal until the statutory procedures have been complied with.</P>

While it is not proposed to introduce a formal programme in computer and keyboard skills for all pupils in primary schools, many primary schools do, from their own resources, introduce children to computers as part of their curriculum. In addition the Department has provided financial support for the purchase of computers to some primary schools in disadvantaged areas.  It has also provided computers for children with certain physical disabilities to assist them with communication.  The question of providing additional computer equipment to primary schools will be addressed as resources become available.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy's question relates to major capital projects.</P>
      <P>Generally, the planning and building process from project identification to enrolment projection, examination of amalgamation possibilities, site acquisition, architectural planning, construction and completion takes two to three years in most cases.  As planning work is completed, projects are released to construction on a phased basis depending on the funds available.  Thus, contracts under way in the current year would have been planned in the 1993-95 period.</P>
      <P>With regard to primary schools, planning work is in progress in respect of 120 projects with a total estimated cost of £34 million.  Construction work is under way at a further 50 schools and the sum allocated to the subhead this year is £21 million.</P>
      <P>In so far as post-primary schools are concerned, architectural planning work is in progress on 85 projects with a total estimated cost of £62 million.  Construction work will be in progress at a further 50 schools and the sum allocated to the subhead is £30 million.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education facilities on a phased basis at all second-level schools where such facilities are not already available.</P>
      <P>The principal factor which determines progress in this area is the amount of capital funding available in any given financial year.  Given the limited resources available, the priority for the foreseeable future as far as the second-level capital programme is concerned will continue to be the provision of essential classroom accommodation. However, it was found possible to make a provision of £500,000 in the 1996 capital programme for the architectural planning of twelve PE halls.</P>
      <P>In the case of second-level provision is made for PE halls where new schools or major extensions are being developed.  Therefore, details in relation to the number of PE halls which have been grant-aided in each of the last five years are not readily available.</P>
      <P>The provision of indoor sports accommodation in existing schools will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.

      <P>An important outcome of the emergency Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on 1-3 April, called to address the BSE crisis, was that other measures in addition to the intervention purchasing of beef would be considered should the market situation warrant it.  In this context, the Council agreed at its meeting on 29-30 April on the urgency of short-term income support measures for producers. Furthermore, the Commission undertook to suggest concrete measures to the Council at its next meeting in May.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue of compensation for beef producers at the Council and suggested that such compensation could best be provided by way of increases in the deseasonalisation and special beef premiums.  I will be pursuing this matter further at the next meeting of the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The public consultation programme being undertaken by CIE involves an extensive series of public meetings, exhibitions, surveys and bilateral discussions with interested parties.  Its purpose is to explain the concept of light rail, to outline specific light rail proposals, to listen carefully to any concerns expressed in relation to those proposals and to respond to those concerns where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present consultative process will continue until a statutory public inquiry into all aspects of the light rail project is held towards the end of the year.  Legislation providing for this and other matters relevant to the implementation of light rail in Dublin will be published in the very near future.  A different, but no <Col N="1891" /> less important, type of public consultation will be necessary once construction gets under way.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear on numerous occasions that no final decisions will be taken on the precise routes until the public consultation process is completed, a public inquiry has been held and EU approval procedures have been finalised.  The proposed statutory public inquiry will enable people who believe that light rail is not the appropriate solution to Dublin's transport problems, that other routes should be given priority or that alternative engineering approaches, such as tunnelling, should be adopted to put forward their views and challenge the DTI recommendations and the detailed planning work of CIE's project team.</P>
    <P>Turning to the more detailed question asked by the Deputy, it is important first of all to set out the policy context.  The DTI strategy, which has been accepted by the Government as the policy framework for transportation planning in Dublin, recommended an on-street light rail network.  It specifically recommended against an underground &mdash; DART &mdash; system on economic, financial and accessibility grounds.  The recommended light rail network comprises a core network of lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely and Ballymun and a phase two network, including an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin Airport and Swords for implementation when the core network had been completed. The DTI report also recommended a quality bus corridor serving Dublin Airport and suggested further evaluation of a conventional rail link to the airport from the mainline rail network.</P>
    <P>Data relating to the Dublin Airport link can be found in chapters 4 and 7 of the DTI final report, published last year. Forecasts of journey times by different modes in the three corridors that form the core light rail network and the passenger carrying capacity of light rail are published in DTI Technical Volume 6.  I am advised that, on the basis of a very <Col N="1892" /> preliminary estimate, CIE calculates the additional cost associated with constructing a two kilometre underground section of light rail in the city centre would be in the region of £65 million. This would include the cost of stations and of upgrading the rolling stock.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of sections 20 and 21 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, an annual voted grant is paid to the Central Fisheries Board from which a grant is disbursed to each of the seven regional fisheries boards on the basis of approved estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no statutory function in the matter of the payment of taxes by regional fisheries boards to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I expect, however, in line with good financial practice, the regional fisheries boards to meet their tax liabilities promptly and in full.  I can assure the Deputy that the regional fisheries boards have been <Col N="1893" /> made fully aware of their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board also intends to appoint an outside body to examine and advise on the administrative-financial system of the central and regional fisheries boards and to make recommendations to address any deficiencies which may exist.</P>
