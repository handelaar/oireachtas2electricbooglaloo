      <P>It is proposed to take No. 13, Finance Bill, 1996, Second Stage (Resumed), and, subject to the motion for the Second Reading of the Bill being agreed, the Order for Committee.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders or in the Order of the Dáil of 16 April, that business shall not be interrupted today until the decision of the Order for Committee of the Finance Bill, 1996 has been declared from the Chair; and that such Order shall be made without debate.</P>

      <P>Arising out of statements made in the House last night by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on light rail, on 28 March in a speech to the Dublin City Traders' Association the Minister said: &ldquo;There is a fixed timescale for EU funding that underpins the project, and there is no guarantee that this money will be obtained unless the timetable is adhered to&rdquo;.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied, now that the European Commission ordered <Col N="322" /> a further study last November, that the timescale will be achieved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to put on the record of this House this morning that last night's bombing in London was a cynical exercise.  If it was meant to draw concessions from the Governments, they must be firm and not give concessions to those who hold that threat over the peace process.  We must ask the Sinn Féin leadership in particular to use its influence to achieve a full and total cessation of IRA violence.  The proposed talks cannot succeed if a threat of violence such as we saw last night is held over them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Harney for raising this matter.  I am sure everybody in this House will join her and me in condemning last night's bombing in London.  It is another setback for those who are working for a peace process, and in a peace process there is no halfway house between violence and peaceful politics.  One must decide which path one is following &mdash; one cannot pursue the two paths simultaneously. As far as I am concerned, the only acceptable path, and the only path that represents the true will of the Irish people of both traditions, is the path of peaceful politics and peaceful politics exclusively.</P>

      <P>On the same matter, I too join in condemning the bombing in London last night.  The people responsible are acting against the will of the Irish people, North and South, who have overwhelmingly indicated their desire for peace and for all-inclusive negotiations.  In order that those negotiations can be all-inclusive, we want to see a cessation of violence at the earliest date.  We condemn unreservedly what occurred in London last evening.</P>

      <P>In view of the very welcome decision by the Joint Committee on the Family on the Kelly Fitzgerald report yesterday, would the Taoiseach indicate whether he would be prepared to allow Government time to discuss that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Committee on the Family will consider this matter in a detailed and systematic manner.  My view would be that the deliberative approach is the best way of going through points raised in this report in a careful manner and drawing the appropriate conclusions.  At this juncture a debate in the House would not be appropriate.  The joint committee should be allowed to do its work first.</P>

      <P>Regulations pertaining to health insurance were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Health some time ago. Under the rules of the House those regulations pass after 21 sitting days in the event that a resolution annulling them is not placed before the House.  I have been attempting unsuccessfully to lay such a resolution before the House. There has been an attempt on the Government side to push that resolution into a Private Members' time. May I ask the Taoiseach's and the Minister for Health's assistance in ensuring that Government time will be given to debate this resolution. which involves Government regulations?</P>

      <P>That matter is being considered by one of the committees of the House following the publication of a discussion paper prepared by the Minister for the Environment.  The question of a referendum will fall to be considered following the deliberations of that committee.

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory and agreed.  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been making the point that the time is ripe for job creation.  All the indicators are favourable. Interest rates have never been lower in the history of the State and there is confidence among the people. Of course, this confidence stems from the Government's openness and honesty. In the words of a famous motor manufacturer, people now understand they are getting &ldquo;a square deal&rdquo; which instils confidence in the management of our economy.  The nod and wink policy is something of the past.  People are now aware that any project they propose will be given fair consideration, that the attitude of &ldquo;you scratch my back and I will scratch yours&rdquo; is gone, that there is now open competition.</P>
      <P>Within that favourable climate we must do everything in our power to create jobs, particularly for our young people.  I fully support FAS and other schemes being developed by various agencies and voluntary organisations. However, my one criticism is that there is too much paperwork involved.  Applications could be streamlined, rather than placing a burden on the many voluntary organisations prepared to recruit six or seven young people to carry out good work within their local communities, such as the restoration of old buildings, walls adjacent to towns and villages and so on.  Procedures should be simplified to facilitate their recruitment. Crafts I thought had long since disappeared are also being fostered, giving young people another outlet for their talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might digress to the other end of the scale and compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on having increased the carer's allowance from £62.50 to £67.50. Care of the elderly will always be extremely important.  At a time when the country is doing well we could easily forget the elderly.  There is a place for nursing homes, whether health board or privately run.  However, a message should not go out from this House that <Col N="329" /> the elderly should be cared for in nursing homes.  Given the opportunity, most old people would prefer to remain in their own home.  We must not forget that they want to remain in their local environment.  We must do what we can to help them achieve that.  Old people have fears about going into institutions. I am not decrying the policy in regard to nursing homes but 90 per cent of elderly people in nursing homes could be cared for by the family grouping with the help and support of various schemes.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the increase in the carer's allowance in the budget, we should look again at the means test for this allowance which is too stringent. People who would wish to avail of this allowance cannot do so because of the stringent means test.  Home helps who call on people for two hours each day do marvellous work but they are paid only £27.50.  This meagre amount should be increased.</P>
    <P>Multinationals have a role to play in the Irish economy but the days of attracting major multinational industries to the region I represent are numbered. We have to encourage small businesses. There are opportunities and people have more confidence in themselves and in the country.  Many small businesses are crushed by the tendering system of the State and semi-State agencies.  For example, in the bakery industry, the major concerns tender for all State contracts to distribute their goods throughout the country on a block basis.  Many of the State organisations have units adjacent to small bakeries who are precluded from tendering.  The tendering system should be opened up so that each hospital, nursing home, army barracks and so on could seek tenders locally to supply them with provisions.  I gave the example of bakeries but other provisions are required.  I do not think there should be block tendering and distribution. We should be seen to be playing our part in developing local business and I ask the Minister to take note of that.  There are other points I wish to make but I will not take from the time <Col N="330" /> of the Deputy with whom I am sharing time.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the Government which is doing a marvellous job.  It will continue with its good work up to the next general election when I hope we will be returned to office for five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The country has never fare better.  There has been a significant increase in employment.  In the past year or so 45,000 more people are at work, an increase of 3 per cent.  The growth rate is at the unprecedented level of 7 per cent.  Investment has increased in real terms by 11 per cent and private consumption is up by 4 per cent.  Mortgages and short-term interest rates are at an historic low.  The increase in the volume of exports is 13 per cent. Economists are predicting that unemployment levels will be less than the European average by the end of the year which represents a huge advance. Great progress has been made in recent years.  At the same time, however, we should not be complacent about the impact of those figures on the public. The public is unhappy with the present position and there was a great deal of evidence of that in the recent by-elections. We must address that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is part of a package being put forward by the Minister for Finance. Last year in his first budget he outlined his objectives which were to reward work, to promote enterprise and to strengthen social solidarity.  They are very worthy objectives and it is important to bear them in mind.  The ability of society to work cohesively is very important in terms of generating economic progress and social cohesion and this should be our priority.  Very clear lessons should have been learned from our experience during the periods of social discord and lack of harmony. In comparison the social contracts of recent years have had a beneficial effect and our unprecedented levels of economic growth, low interest rates and so on are to a large extent related to the capacity of the labour movement, the <Col N="331" /> Government and the social partners to work together to a set of objectives. This Bill is a continuation of the path of progress.</P>
    <P>Other issues have to be addressed. Some progress has been made in regard to tax equity but those in the PAYE sector feel they are paying more than their fair share.  There is great discontent among large elements of PAYE workers who feel they are carrying an unfair share of the national burden and have felt that for a long time.  Some progress has been made in this budget but we have a long way to go before that sector of society will be happy they are carrying their fair share.</P>
    <P>The annoyance of this sector is the result of an accumulation of problems over many years.  It is not as if this has happened suddenly, it has been building up for a long time.  As a society we, unfortunately, have been unable to address that matter.  Undoubtedly, some progress has been made but there is need for much more.  The anti avoidance measures in the Bill are useful.  The changes in corporation tax should be beneficial particularly for small firms which play a very important part in our economic development, as Deputy Boylan mentioned.</P>
    <P>On the theme of social cohesion, this Bill is part of the Minister's objective of strengthening social solidarity. That is essential. The Bill makes some worthwhile provisions in that area. However, we must devote time to understanding what must be done to generate the type of social cohesion needed here and reassess the values that have dominated our political agenda for the past ten years.  There has been an excessive concentration on individualism and individual rights to the exclusion of matters which relate to concepts such as the common good, the objective of social cohesion.  Liberty must be balanced by considerations that relate to fraternity.  Much emphasis has been placed on liberty and individual <Col N="332" /> rights, but little has been placed on fraternity. If as a society we do not seek to work together and produce common goals, progress will be diminished.  That is one of the great lessons to be learned from some estern countries.  I am not suggesting that we should imitate those countries in every way, but lessons can be drawn from the manner in which they have behaved.  One of their central features is social cohesion and social solidarity.</P>
    <P>We must reappraise the emphasis placed on rights to the exclusion in many ways of a much needed one on fraternity.  Much greater emphasis must be placed on the obligations of society and the duty of all citizens, irrespective of their position, to carry their fair share of the burden.  The PAYE sector is particularly annoyed by the fact that it considers it carries an unfair share of the burden and that others, by legal and illegal methods, can avoid their responsibilities.  It is important to stress that aspect.</P>
    <P>Another worth while feature of the Minister's budget and the Finance Bill is that they seek to establish long-term objectives.  When introducing the budget the Minister spoke of the need to think long-term, to plan over a period of years and to link budgets as part of a pattern.  That is important and happens in successful companies.  It is essential that the first steps taken towards that end should be developed and expanded. I look forward to next year's budget when I am sure the Minister will pursue this objective further.  That type of planning and long-term strategic thinking will greatly help to diminish the tendency towards cycles of boom and burst, where the economy booms for a while, then overheats and falls into a depression.  That cyclical aspect of economic behaviour is inevitable, but it is important that we damp it down and control it as best we can.  Developing concepts which relate to the community, obligation and to everybody believing they have a share in society will help to achieve that.  That is what the Minister was alluding to when he spoke of social <Col N="333" /> solidarity and is a central feature of that concept.  Everybody should have a stake in society and belong to it, but a significant number believe they do not.  That must be tackled.  The sense of exclusion, of being an outsider, of not having any responsibilities and of not belonging is an important factor in the genesis of much of the social chaos and decay we are experiencing to a frightening degree in parts of this city, including areas in my constituency.  It is important that this Bill is viewed in terms of a move back towards social solidarity which implies duties and obligations.</P>
    <P>People on the left, as I am, mention the role of the family as a pillar of society, but a lack of emphasis has been placed on that role.  Mentioning that role is perhaps stating the obvious, but sometimes it is necessary to state it.  The role of the family is important in terms of generating social solidarity to ensure we have a society that will benefit everybody.  This Bill and the analogous Social Welfare Bill introduces considerable improvements in that area, but more changes must be made.  It is important that as a society we move away from the quick buck and lotto mentality, the idea that one can work magic, political or otherwise, that there is a great leader whom we will follow and that we will never have a bad day again.  Life is not like that.  It is time we began to accept that if we are to make progress, it will be slow, tiresome and made step by step.  That can be done, but we must accept that we must put in the effort and plan and work together. We must put aside the notion that somebody among us or from elsewhere will come along and solve our problems.  To some degree we have suffered from such a subliminal thinking process arising from the large amounts of money we have received from Europe.  While it has been welcome, at another level it has been an easy escape from hard-thinking and getting our act together to a far greater extent than we have.</P>
    <P>That is true of the agricultural industry and particularly true of the beef industry, which is now experiencing a <Col N="334" /> significant crisis, but it would not be as severe if the necessary planning had been undertaken.  If Irish beef products had been promoted, European and other customers would be buying Irish beef confident in the knowledge that it is a safe product, free of BSE.  We have not been able to promote our brands and put them on the shelves of world markets.  That requires a major investment over a prolonged period of time. It is important that we must understand, give some thought to it and work out its logic.</P>
    <P>To that end it is encouraging that the budget contains some initiatives to promote science and technology.  The Minister has taken some steps to encourage investment in science and technology, patents and developing new products. The way forward is through the development of new products and new ideas.  The world is changing and has changed over the past two or three centuries when power was derived from military capacity.  In more recent times power has been derived primarily from financial capacity.  The Japanese, who were not a major military power but have been very important players in the world, are a good example of that. There have been further changes and now power is related to knowledge and information which will be the driving force in the new society.  It is important to understand that and to take steps to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we continue to invest in science and technology and that we increase the amount of investment in that area, which has been miserably small in the past number of years.  It is long overdue that we radically change our thinking process in that regard.  I am glad the Minister has taken worthwhile steps to address this area.  I also compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, with responsibility for science and technology for the extent to which he has set about promoting science and technology.  He has done a good job considering the difficulties he is facing in that large elements of the Civil Service do not have the <Col N="335" /> faintest idea about science and technology. They do not have any interest in it more is the pity.  I hope the position is changing, but that would have been the lesson drawn from an analysis of what happened in that area during the past 15 to 20 years.  The National Board for Science and Technology, established in the late 1970s, was duly rubbed out, rubbished and subsumed into Eolas which, in turn, was gobbled up by Forbairt. That carry on is not reconcilable with a society which values and sees science and technology as a central factor in generating progress.  The position is beginning to improve, but we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>It is important that we continue to invest in education, one of the great sources of success, particularly among the younger generation.  Education standards have been exceptionally high, much higher than would have been predicted based on the rate of economic development.  They have been a central factor in developing the economy.  To a fair extent, this is due to the dedication of those involved in the teaching sector at first, second and third-level.  They have made an exceptional contribution to economic development.  This has been characterised by a central preoccupation with high standards.  Under no circumstances should we contemplate or tolerate reductions in standards in education if we are to make progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister's objective is to strengthen social solidarity.  To achieve it it is important to move from the culture of blame, conflict and accusation, an approach which damages progress.  It is important that that is understood.</P>
    <P>People who call for more honesty, openness and frankness, which are exceptionally desirable, should be prepared to respect those who are honest, frank and open.  In the past honest people were exploited and their honesty was used as a tool with which to beat them.  That type of behaviour does not help to develop the culture that is essential to underpin economic progress.</P>
    <P>Some important steps have been <Col N="336" /> taken in this Bill which is part of a process. I am glad the work has started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Síle de Valera.  To take up the point made by Deputy Upton that we should all work together, it is interesting to hear so many Labour Party Deputies in recent weeks speak in those terms.  We have no intention of getting into their canoe which is sinking fast.  When we were aboard ship we were ditched.  We intend to maintain our independence on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Before addressing the specific provisions of this Bill I will comment on the context in which the Minister has put together his proposals.  In general, the overall condition of the State's finances is good largely due to three main factors &mdash; first, the excellent management of the economy under successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments which led the country from the brink of financial chaos in 1987 to balancing the books for the first time in many years by late 1994; second, the net transfer of funds from the European Union which continues to stimulate the economy and, third, the overall world economy which is going through a phase of growth combined with low inflation and, consequently, relatively low interest rates.</P>
      <P>The general sense of economic growth and well-being makes it essential for the State to make hay while the sun shines.  In other words, it is vital that we avail of the positive international and national financial climate to aggressively tackle fundamental problems in society.  It does not make sense to wait until times of inflation and stagnation before addressing core and urgent problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When attempting to assess the 1996 Finance Bill we must keep in mind if there are particularly pressing problems facing society which require extraordinary effort and vision in planning.  It does not require much delay or soul-searching to rapidly answer that question. Despite the apparent health of the State's finances, we face problems of both an intimidating and critical nature, <Col N="337" /> rather than drawing together the extremes of wealth and poverty, the depressing reality is that the gap between the poor and rich continues to widen.  As a result, there is a growing number of people who feel alienated or hard done by in modern society.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the problems come easily to mind.  There is major unemployment, a rapidly increasing rate of violent crime, an escalating drug abuse problem, increased levels of domestic violence and abuse, a grossly uneven take-up of third-level education across different socio-economic groups and a continuing erosion of the family as the cornerstome of society.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair and factually incorrect to suggest that the Government can realistically eliminate the various social ills affecting modern society within its period of authority.  However, it must be emphasised that a special and unique responsibility lies with the Administration to provide leadership to the people at times of particular need and stress.</P>
    <P>The scale of the problems I have outlined is enormous.  We in this House have a major responsibility to the people to give a clear indication that we can and will show the necessary degree of leadership, compassion and determination to successfully tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>Much of the language used regarding the well-being of the State's finances is of little or no interest to the individual or family struggling against great odds to survive.  They want to see evidence that their vital needs are being effectively addressed.  They want to be reassured that all our efforts are directed towards tacking issues of fundamental importance to their lives. They have little time or respect for political play-acting or point-scoring.  Similarly, they have little difficulty in finding out any Government which places selfish short-term political interests above the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>It is against this growing and extremely worrying pattern of increased social inequality, with a corresponding <Col N="338" /> loosening of the bonds of social cohesion and common purpose, that we examine the many provisions of the 1996 Finance Bill.  Is there compelling evidence that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has mastered the many difficulties facing him in his portfolio and, as a result, is advancing the economy towards greater social equality and justice? Has he decided to seriously tackle a small number of core issues rather than tilting at every windmill in sight?</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to indicate my great disappointment at the overall package of proposals brought before us by the Minister.  Rather than reaching out and grasping a unique opportunity to make an impact on the major problems of unemployment and social inequality, for the second time the Minister's main aim seems to be to bring in a set of proposals which are unlikely to cause too much offence to his partners in the rainbow Government.  It highlights the nonsense, in terms of major policy development, of having far left, centre and far right &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; Government control at the same time.  It is not surprising that the resultant mix of policies is neither healthy nor attractive.  As is so often the case in Government, by attempting to placate everyone at the same time the Minister has ended up with a set of extremely disappointing proposals the net effect of which, at best, will be to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> With two parties in Government particularly committed to the principle of social equality the Bill is a major let down.</P>
    <P>In case my comments are interpreted as supporting a budget of handouts I wish to make my position clear.  For a number of years it has been abundantly clear that, as a nation, we must deal rapidly and effectively with the problem of unemployment.  It has been generally agreed that bringing the State's finances firmly under control is a key requirement in creating the necessary level of confidence in our economy and financial management among national and international investors.  Successive Ministers for Finance, Ray MacSharry and <Col N="339" /> Deputies Reynolds and Ahern, contributed in a major way to bringing about such a climate.  The people tolerated excessive taxation levels and general financial restraint to put the country in a strong position.  The totally unacceptable levels of unemployment were tackled aggressively.  Having brought about a remarkable recovery in the national finances, it would be completely irresponsible to waste a major opportunity for change by using available resources in an unplanned and unfocused manner.</P>
    <P>What I expected from the Finance Bill was evidence of the commitment of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues to radically reform those aspects of our system which retard the required level of growth in enterprise and employment. A radical overhaul of the taxation and social welfare systems is required. One looks in vain at the Bill for a signal that this simple but crucial message has the ear of the Minister.  Almost every informed commentator on the unemployment problem stresses three key issues, the first of which is that the general financial climate must support those who have the drive, vision and business ability to create new enterprises.  For example, the availability of venture capital is vitally important to such individuals and companies. They need support from the financial institutions by way of working capital and reasonable loan terms. Despite initiatives such as the BES and other schemes, the level of venture capital available in this country is inadequate to cater for the development needs of new businesses.  Despite some welcome movement in recent years, the main financial institutions continue to operate in an extremely conservative manner in the domestic market and seem to focus their risk taking outside this country.  That is regrettable.  It is not in the long-term interests of the banks and is damaging to young business leaders.</P>
    <P>The second issue is the need to provide further resources for the ongoing <Col N="340" /> training and educational needs of the unemployed and those in employment. Reports indicate that every pound spent on such schemes is well repaid.  Despite the overwhelming evidence of research, is there any indication in the Bill that this message has been received by the Government?  Sadly the answer is no.</P>
    <P>The third ingredient necessary to remove blocks towards further growth in employment levels is the incentive to participate in the workforce.  It does not make any sense for a person to be better off receiving social welfare benefits than to be in gainful employment.  The term &ldquo;gainful employment&rdquo; must be redefined given the current shortcomings in our taxation and social welfare laws.  Despite some minor adjustments, the Finance Bill also falls down in tackling this aspect of the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair not to acknowledge some of the positive aspects of the Bill. On income tax, the Minister has made a number of adjustments which go in the right direction towards reducing the crippling burden of taxation on many average income earners.  I support the provisions in section 4 (d) which increases the deduction allowable for carer's costs from £5,000 to £7,500.  Similarly, the adjustment which increases the incentive towards shareholding among employees is welcome.  I welcome the adjustments made to the BES but I have two worries in this regard.  The net effect of the changes may act as a disincentive to participation in the scheme because of the increased level of bureaucracy.  That would be counterproductive. My second worry relates to the need for a detailed audit and assessment of the scheme.  It is suggested by reliable business commentators that the scheme is not as effective as it should be in the area of job creation.  A comprehensive independent assessment of overall performance would be of benefit to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the aspects of the Bill which assist those involved in the promotion of arts and culture.  With the outstanding success of many Irish artists <Col N="341" /> on the world stage it is too easy to forget that the majority of those who are involved full time in the arts have a precarious financial existence.  Very often we are only too happy to share in their moments of glory but it is vital to support them financially in their formative years.  I welcome the proposals to stimulate island investment.  With their rich and unique traditions it is vital that every effort be made to redress the population drift from the islands which has been a feature of recent social history.</P>
    <P>Despite these features of the Bill I am disappointed with the Minister's proposals. I hope the Bill will be improved sufficiently as it passes through the House and that some of the ground which has been needlessly lost will be recovered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wallace and the House for allowing me to share time.  I will deal with section 35 which concerns the film industry as that comes under my brief of arts, culture and heritage.  The section refers specifically to the film industry.  The measure was initiated by a Fianna Fáil Administration. In 1993 the section was amended by Deputy Ahern, then Minister for Finance, it resulted in potential growth for the industry and stimulated production activity.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge that further improvements and refinements were needed.  Inconsistencies in the administration of the legislation led to uncertainty. Initially all-comers were welcome but, as a result of alleged abuses, a stricter regime came into being.  Further uncertainty arose as a result of the position of some in the Department of Finance who, it is believed, feel this section should be abolished.  I have learned from a number of people in the film industry that the perception is some people in the Department would like a smaller number of investors to participate in the scheme so that there would be a ready-made excuse to abolish it. Such a perception creates uncertainty which is detrimental to investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> The net benefit from the implementation of section 35 is evident, not least in its focus on Ireland, which can only have a positive effect on tourism and benefit local economies and communities. We have seen this with the blockbuster movies made in Ireland. The one exception was the infamous case of &ldquo;Divine Rapture&rdquo;.  I referred to this matter in the House in July 1995 and again on budget day in January 1996, on both of which occasions I put suggestions to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the hope that they would be implemented in law to protect local communities and those involved in service industries in the event of difficulties arising similar to those we witnessed with &ldquo;Divine Rapture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is great potential for job creation in the film industry not only in the world of acting, directing and production but also in the associated trades, for example, carpenters and other skilled crafts and trades as well as the service industries.  To help our script-writers in particular IBEC suggested the introduction of business expansion schemes.  The companies which develop screen plays for production are considered to be in the high risk area of the film industry as many projects never proceed from development to production. Business expansion schemes could lead to sustained expenditure on the development of film projects which would provide vital experience for our writers, directors and producers.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the budget debate on 24 January, the increase in the number of blockbuster films helped our indigenous film industry to get a kick-start by providing an infrastructure into which our industry could tap for expertise. The move to reduce the proportion of investments which are eligible for relief from 100 per cent to 80 per cent will have a detrimental effect on the film industry, which has already experienced a reduction in production activity for 1996.  That was alluded to by Deputy Bertie Ahern in his contribution to this debate yesterday.  IBEC recommends a 100 per cent tax relief on section 35 <Col N="343" /> moneys raised for films with budgets of up to £4 million, which would bolster the indigenous film industry, and that projects over £4 million should be judged on a case by case basis by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The Government proposals on section 35 chip away at investment attractiveness and, therefore, investment potential.  In debates in this House on the film industry I have pointed out that other countries are prepared to consider proposals such as section 35.  If such proposals were implemented by countries, within or outside the EU, that would chip away at our competitiveness in the film industry worldwide.  Now that our film industry is beginning to grow it is not the time to introduce proposals such as those in this Bill which would affect our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not deal with the issue of seasonality in the film world, yet when pressed by me on 24 January he acknowledged a difficulty in that regard. I hope even at this late stage the Minister for Finance will acknowledge by way of amendment the difficulties for those involved in the film industry in terms of seasonality.</P>
    <P>An anomaly exists whereby the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht may not certify a film as a qualifying film unless such a certificate has been applied for by budget day.  Film companies which raised finance under section 35 and were still developing their film projects found that their investors had their entitlement to tax relief unilaterally cancelled.  IBEC strongly recommended that this matter should be addressed by permitting the Minister to certify a film after budget day according to the criteria that apply at present.  That would enable pre-budget investors to obtain tax relief. IBEC also recommends that a pre-budget day investor be treated in the same fashion as a post-budget day investor or a BES investor as regards carrying forward excess investments.  Under the present proposals a company which <Col N="344" /> has raised section 35 finance before budget day for a film which was granted application for approval before budget day cannot decide, even for good commercial reasons, to substitute another film since approval would have to be sought for that film before budget day.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes to the legislation have caused great uncertainty. Changes of a negative nature send their own signals.  The proposed amendments and restrictions will undermine all the achievements in the film industry to date.  I ask the Minister for Finance to consider carefully once again the proposals on section 35 and I hope he makes the amendments suggested by this side of the House and by interested bodies outside the House, particularly IBEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy McGahon.  In debating a Bill of this kind we should probably react to the contributions of previous speakers.  I noted the comments of Deputy Wallace on behalf of Fianna Fáil, particularly his opening remarks in which he solidly declared that the overall condition of the public finances is very good.  I am delighted with that acceptance on the part of Fianna Fáil.  There is, however, an attempt to explain away the reasons for the good financial position.  If we had problems with the public finances Fianna Fáil would say it was our own fault but because the condition of the public finances is good there is an attempt on the part of Fianna Fáil to claim credit for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was first elected to this House I recall the fiscal madness that then permeated Fianna Fáil thinking.  There was the notion that the more you borrowed, the more benefit you brought to the country.  At that time under a Fianna Fáil Administration the national debt was quadrupled.  That led to enormously high interest rates and historically high inflation rates.  It also led to huge unemployment. It was economic and fiscal madness.  I am delighted that in recent years a sense of fiscal responsibility has <Col N="345" /> descended on Fianna Fáil.  The day of going to the polls and promising a free for all, as Fianna Fáil did in the past, with lower taxes, greater expenditure and more services is, I hope, over.  Or is it?</P>
    <P>An election will be held in the not too distant future.  I would say to Fianna Fáil not to succumb to the temptation it fell for in the past, not to destroy our national finances as it did in the past with silly, foolish promises about abolishing taxes and awarding enormous increases in pay.  It behoves every party to be responsible in terms of election promises, particularly when dealing with the lives and fortunes of the people.  The consequences of irresponsibility are unemployment, misery, hardship and suffering.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of public pay and tax reliefs.  There is some industrial unrest at the moment and while I do not intend to discuss the particular issues involved, it is important there is a balanced debate on public pay and tax reductions.  I again detect from the Opposition a tendency to suggest that people should get more pay and tax relief.  There is an obvious correlation between the two and that must be fully understood in any discussion or debate on public pay and tax relief for the future.  One cannot have unrestrained increases in public pay and huge tax cuts.</P>
    <P>It is important that people involved in industrial unrest fully appreciate the impact of their actions on others.  I am thinking about two particular examples. The annual Hereford bull sale takes place in Bandon today.  One may ask about the relevance of that.  A widow who has bulls entered for that sale needs certification from the Department to state they are disease free.  They are disease free; all the tests have already been carried out.  However, her vet must get a call from the Department to formally confirm that fact but it refused to give it because of industrial action.  Whatever about the merits of that industrial action, it is having a negative impact on that lady.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> Another small farmer in Baltimore has been confined to his farm for six months because he has TB reactors. However, he passed the first TVB test and only needs to pass one more before he is back in business.  He is a small farmer living in poor circumstances and has suffered enormous loss.  He needs clearance from the Department to allow his vet to carry out the second test.  The vet is standing by to carry it out &mdash; he would do it this morning if the Department told him to go ahead.  However, it has not been given because of this campaign.</P>
    <P>I highlight these two incidences to show that while the case of those low paid civil servants may be justified, they should bear in mind the consequences of their actions on others who may be in equally difficult financial circumstances. Sometimes that relationship is forgotten. This is especially relevant to national agreements which preclude industrial action.  While people have a right to present their case fairly and reasonably, when a national agreement which precludes such action exists people should be slow to take steps which have an impact of this kind on other innocent people who have no part to play in that industrial relations battle. There must be a sense of proportion and justice.</P>
    <P>Will we have another national <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> or wage agreement of any kind in the future?  If we do, we must focus on our principal objectives.  We are great for talking about the problems of unemployment and the need to generate jobs. There is also a direct relationship between what is done in other areas about unemployment and the jobless figures.  There was an enormous growth in employment over the last two years &mdash; it is the highest rate in Europe &mdash; because of the competitiveness of this country.  While this is not the sole reason &mdash; Ireland also has a good Government &mdash; the fact that we are competitive has an enormous influence on those figures.  If we accept that and <Col N="347" /> if there is a real intent to tackle unemployment and maintain job growth, there must be moderation and restraint on the part of those people with jobs in the public and private sectors and elsewhere in demanding extra pay.</P>
    <P>There is a direct correlation between increases in pay and tax relief.  If whatever money available is absorbed by additional pay increases, there will be no money for tax cuts.  There is a ceiling. The Maastricht limit of a maximum of 3 per cent on borrowing and other limitations with regard to inflation and the reduction of the debt burden on our GDP apply here.  If all the available slack is taken up by increases in public pay, there will be no money available for tax cuts.  This factor must be debated and understood and if people are calling for tax cuts, more emphasis should be put on it and a greater proportion of money should be made available.</P>
    <P>Tax cuts help everybody.  Irrespective of whether somebody works in the public or private sector, it is the net amount of money in their pockets, not the nominal pay, which is relevant.  Would it not be better for everybody if that net pay was increased as a result of tax cuts as opposed to nominal pay increases? There should be greater emphasis on tax cuts rather than pay increases, especially if they bring the same benefit to those claiming them.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for pay increases by low paid members of the public sector provided it is argued and pursued reasonably &mdash; I am not saying this should not be done.  Some members of the public sector, such as nurses, etc., also feel, with some justification, that their work is undervalued.  I have no problem with their making that case, as long as it is made in a balanced and restrained way and takes all circumstances into account.  There is no point in saying that increased employment is the national economic priority unless we are prepared to follow it through by focusing on the necessary economic and fiscal measures and to keep up the employment growth rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> As somebody who comes from a rural constituency, I always thought we needed a fully developed approach to regional policy.  I spent five years attending various European councils and was naturally supportive of its approach to regional policy.  We are a peripheral island in the European context and had a good case &mdash; every Government has argued for it &mdash; for having a proper European regional policy.</P>
    <P>However, the same enthusiasm for a regional policy has not existed in national terms, particularly among our urban orientated colleagues.  The approach to regional policy is seen to be fully dealt with when we get our return from Europe under the Structural Funds, but that is only half the battle. There is a need for much clearer thinking on regional policy in national terms and in that respect I want to focus on one aspect in particular, namely, telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The cost of telecommunications and the service generally will be very influential in determining the economic vitality of a region in the years ahead. We are in the early stages of a revolution in the way people use telecommunication channels.  Looking ahead to the next five to ten years, there will be four main areas of usage, namely, the telephone, the fax machine, electronic mail and electronic access to information sources.  The rate of increase in the use of the latter two will be enormous. Voice phone could become a relatively small part of telecommunications usage in the next 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>One might ask what this has to do with regional policy.  The answer is simple. The cost of a phone call in country areas is far greater than in the city.  If there is to be greater use of telecommunications in the years ahead, the additional costs to peripheral areas will greatly increase.  A third of the population lives within the greater Dublin area, which is a local call area, yet people living in remote areas, such as <Col N="349" /> the village of Allihies, in my own constituency, where President Mary Robinson began her election campaign many years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have to pay ten times that which a person living in Ballyfermot, Balbriggan or the hill of Howth pays.  Why should that be the case?  Why should somebody carrying on business in Allihies be subjected to that extra cost?  Why should this cost factor increase in the future because of the greater use of telecommunication facilities?  I see the growth in the use of telecommunication facilities as a major instrument in reducing the cost of peripherality, but everything will depend on cost.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Eircell users pay a flat rate.  It costs me the same to make a call to Dublin from my home in Bandon as it would if I were ringing Dunmanway, a few miles away.  That is only right.  While some moves have been made by Telecom in recent years to broaden the local call charge areas, they have not been sufficient.  We must aim to have the entire country as one local call area in the near future.  An essential part of our policy should be to achieve that in as short a time as possible.</P>
      <P>Other countries are following this line.  Where possible the United States always adopted the standardisation of the costs of essential goods and services throughout that vast country.  That has always been an essential part of the thinking there.  I would like to see that approach adopted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the possible changes that might take place in the structure of our semi-State bodies on the years ahead, joint ventures, privatisation and part privatisation are all possibilities. We do not know what will happen in the years ahead but I would like to see the principle established now of a flat rate of charges throughout the entire country. If some element of privatisation were to take place, that could be <Col N="350" /> included in any new regulatory format as part of a licence to operate.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies to electricity from the point of view of current charges, not installation; the price of a unit in Allihies is the same as in Dublin. It also applies largely in the private sector. The price of a pint in Allihies is the same as it is in Dublin.  In fact, taking labour costs into account, it might be more attractive to buy one's pint in Allihies than in Baggot Street.  This issue should be part of Government thinking in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Part of this thinking is reflected in the Finance Bill, particularly in relation to the islands.  There are 21 inhabited islands around our coast, seven of which are in my constituency.  That is not a large number but I have always felt strongly that we must support the islands as much as possible.  In that regard I welcome the innovative approach adopted in the Bill and the tax reliefs that are available to encourage residents of the islands.  If that approach is successful it will make a major contribution towards the vitality of our islands in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The population on the islands has fallen considerably over the years.  I was in Sherkin Island last Sunday taking to the local people who told me of their concerns about the decrease in population, particularly with regard to school numbers.  More permanent residents are needed on the island.  The example now being set by the Government should be followed by local authorities and others. Tax relief is available for owner-occupiers by way of 50 per cent of the cost of construction and 100 per cent for people who make buildings available for rent to permanent island residents.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should also make housing available.  I realise there is not a great demand at present but the future life of the islands may depend on greater use of the rural resettlement scheme.  Part of the current problem on the islands is that many of the houses are available for holiday purposes only and not for use by the locals.  There are <Col N="351" /> no houses available for people who want to become permanent residents on the islands.  That is one of the difficulties in implementing the rural resettlement scheme as far as our islands are concerned.</P>
    <P>When the opportunity arises I hope to develop further the main issues to which I have referred, namely, pay, tax cuts and regional policy.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for sharing his time with me. While he did not mention it by name, the Deputy referred to the infamous 1977 manifesto and its incalculable cost to the Irish nation and he called for a responsible attitude on the part of all political parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including my party, regarding the production of glossy brochures and manifestos which are a contributory factor in the growing cynicism with which the people view all political parties.  While canvassing in Blanchardstown, Clonsilla and Castleknock last week, I was struck by the staggering level of political ignorance in those areas.  Children should be educated in primary schools that politics are necessary for them and their country. Unfortunately, thousands of people believe the political system exists to penalise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was manifest in the upmarket areas of Castleknock and Blanchardstown last week.  One called at the doors of beautiful houses in new estates, with two cars outside, in some cases the houses had Sky Sports, which costs over £300, but these people did not want to pay £80 for the most essential service to their homes, water.  This illustrates the urgent need to educate children that politics are necessary.  Rather than teaching them Irish, we should teach them the basic of politics otherwise there will be a morass here in the future with Independent Deputies representing hospital, water, rates and <Col N="352" /> unemployment causes.  Collectively, they can do nothing because the policital party system &mdash; bad as it is &mdash; is the only viable option for any country.</P>
    <P>Having got that off my chest, I wish to point out to my party that there is an overwhelming need to do something for middle class people on middle incomes. Traditionally, Fine Gael represented those on middle incomes, including the self-employed and those who provided for themselves.  Now more than ever, these people need help because they are overburdened.  They provide for themselves by buying houses with mortgages, usually at usury rates, and they wish to send their children to university but they must pay through the nose to do so.  I did this and I am still in debt as a result.  I am aware of the problems facing such people.  Fine Gael must identify with their cause and do something for them, particularly next year.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my disappointment at the Government's acceptance of the European Commission's proposal to allow ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency to organise the spending of the much vaunted peace money.  I cannot understand how that proposal was reached and I indict the European Commission representatives in Ireland who seem blind to the needs of the Border areas given the past 25 years.  This money should have been apportioned to local authorities.  Although we criticise them on occasions, they are established professionals and over the past 60 years, have experience of administering the meagre amounts they receive from central Government.</P>
    <P>However, the novel idea now is that the community at large will be given huge amounts to spend.  I predict &mdash; I wish I could predict a winner on the racetrack as certainly &mdash; that when the final tally is done in the years to come, it will show a huge amount of fraud by these so called community groups which have very dubious origins, particularly in the North of Ireland.  The amount of money lost will be incalculable and a grave mistake is being made in giving it to inexperienced people to administer.</P>

      <P>It seems to have been forgotten by everybody, including Bord Fáilte.  The town of Carlingford is a jewel but, unfortunately, it is a hidden jewel.  I ask the Government to designate it and Omeath under the seaside resort scheme.  This would help those villages to overcome the debilitating economic factors which have prevailed over the last 25 years.  Given their location near the Border, they became virtual cul-de-sacs but, as a result of local initiatives in the two towns, there are definite signs of resurgence.  Apart from Kinsale, Carlingford is the loveliest town in Ireland.  However, the area needs help and it was little short of criminal to omit it from the seaside designation scheme last year.  I appeal to the Government to include it this year.</P>

      <P>In one of last Sunday's newspapers I read, as did the nation, that the Minister for Finance will give massive tax reliefs to hard pressed middle income taxpayers, but not until next year. However, the Minister should live horse and get grass, which is what taxpayers have been doing for the past two years.  In 1995 the Minister presented with great pride the first rainbow coalition budget.  He was the first Labour Party Minister to steer a Finance Bill through the Dáil.  The Bill was supposedly based on the Government of Renewal policy statement of December 1994.  In regard to taxation it stated: &ldquo;The Government will accelerate the process of tax reform and will be guided by the following principles and priorities&rdquo; ...One of those priorities was targeting lower paid workers and young new job entrants through a combination of measures aimed at taking them out of the tax net and the development of a reformed system of PRSI contributions and other measures.  What happened? The Government failed miserably to meet this promise and, indeed, the increase in the tax exemption limit is still desultory at £3,900 per annum, which equals £75 per week.  That is roughly £10 above the level of unemployment assistance for a single person. The Government said it would get those people back to work by reforming the tax system but is this an encouragement?</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the PRSI changes that have been effected are helpful but there is still a plethora of PRSI rates which are a real headache for many of the small employers who do not have access to computer systems.  For example, under Class A there are six sub-classes and there are 18 other classes and sub-classes to complicate the issue.  I hope this can be simplified further in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another priority in that document was widening the standard rate tax bands with the aim that only those on higher incomes would pay tax above the standard rate and to increase personal allowances significantly greater than the <Col N="355" /> rate of inflation.  The increases are not in line with those empty promises.  The widening of the tax band increased by 7 per cent between 1993-94 and 1994-95; 8.5 per cent between 1994-95 and 1995-96 and 5.6 per cent between 1995-96 and 1996-97.  That is and average increase of 7 per cent &mdash; from a nil increase in previous years &mdash; under the stewardship of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  What happened the increases promised in that famous document published in December 1994?  Tax free allowances were increased by 8 per cent between 1993-94 and 1994-95; 6.38 per cent between 1994-95 and 1995-96 and 6 per cent between 1995-96 and 1996-97. Rather than increases these are decreases.  Where have the promises been fulfilled from that policy statement regarding those tax increases?  During the term of office of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the PRSI allowance was reduced by 51 per cent between 1994-95 and 1995-96 and done away with altogether between 1995-96 and 1996-97.</P>
    <P>Another priority was the raising of the exemption threshold for employment and health levies.  There has been a slight increase at 2.7 per cent from 1994-95 to 1995-96 and a 5.4 per cent increase from 1995-96 to 1996-97.  These are not major increases.  That famous document also stated that the study on the integration of tax and social welfare codes would be completed and published in April 1995.  We are still awaiting the publication of that document. This is another unfulfilled promise. It also stated that residential property tax would be revamped.  That is a couched statement that it would be abolished.  We still await developments in that area.  I have no doubt if we hold our breath we would die from asphyxiation before there will be any changes under this Government.</P>
    <P>All the actions of the Government in the taxation area have given the lie to its fine promises.  The public has given its answer in all the recent by-elections to the Government's inaction and about-turns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> The net take home pay since 6 April 1996 has clearly shown to the doubters that what we said at budget time was true, no one is better off.  The taxpayer has been short-changed by these deceitful statements.</P>
    <P>When in Government from 1987-94, Fianna Fáil, despite having to correct the near bankruptcy in which the former Fine Gael-Labour Government left the country, was able to reduce the tax burden, at the same time keep the finances in order and bring the country back to a situation in which it had not been for 30 years when we had a budget surplus rather than a deficit.  In all aspects the last two budgets have put a halt to the progress of those years and any type of tax reform has been put on hold.  The Government has been acting in a most insulting manner to the PAYE taxpayers &mdash; and all taxpayers &mdash; in a time of financial well-being that has been unknown to any Government for the past 30 years.  It is frightening to think what damage these parties would do in times of economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement provided for tax relief in respect of expenditure occurred on the purchase or installation of intruder alarms in the homes of persons aged 65 or over living alone.  The downright stupidity, ridiculousness and meaninglessness of this announcement was highlighted by Fianna Fáil during the budget debate and the penny finally dropped.  The Minister recognised that what he had suggested was meaningless and so he has extended the allowance to any relative who bears the expense.  This is most welcome but if the Government had the real intention of helping the aged it would have given a grant rather than interest relief.  What it is doing is a daisy in the bull's mouth approach.  We see the Government for what it really is, parties of perception rather than substance.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme was introduced to foster and create sustainable jobs.  Over the years the qualification for reliefs under these schemes have been necessarily tightened up.  The <Col N="357" /> changes in this Bill imply that many of the BES funds are still not invested in genuine business ventures.  I would like to hear the Minister spell out in greater detail the reason he has again changed this scheme.  I have no doubt he has information from monitoring the schemes which show the reasons for the changes and I look forward to hearing from him regarding same.  We heard so much from the Government about job creation and simplifying the process of job creation that I was surprised when I saw the introduction of a certification system which means more paper work and bureaucracy and involves the State in extra public sector expenditure, which I thought we were trying to get away from.  It could also mean that claims could arise in the future against the State because there is no doubt that some whiz-kid lawyer will attempt to involve the State if a State certified business expansion scheme goes belly-up. The insertion of this section in the Finance Bill is cobbled together to keep some dissenting voice happy within the Rainbow Coalition.</P>
    <P>While the section 35 tax break scheme is welcome, as it has helped to create jobs as well as promote Ireland, this Bill provides a major advantage to the film industry against the business expansion scheme.  It has led to fears that funds will flow from the business expansion scheme funds to the more attractive film tax breaks.  The small print allows those who invest in films to get out after a year compared with the former rule which kept him or her in for three years.</P>
    <P>The investor in the business expansion scheme must wait for five years before getting money back.  Experts in the area have stated that under the previous regime there was only a two year differential between section 35 and the business expansion scheme repayment time and thus did not have a major impact.  Now the difference at four years is quite important and means that the section 35 film industry tax break is greatly favoured.  The view is that factories and industrial enterprises which <Col N="358" /> are funded under the BES scheme last a long time and do not end within a year like films.  This change may result in a fall-off in investment in business expansion scheme funds which were designed to create long-term sustainable employment. The Minister should not weigh the advantages so heavily against investment in long-term job creation enterprises.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the provisions of Chapter III do not change capital allowances, especially for farmers, the majority of whose net incomes, before capital allowances, are below the average industrial wage.  Out of those net incomes they are required to invest in machinery, major capital repairs, reconstruction, land reclamation and other essential capital expenses necessary for their enterprises, but they are allowed a maximum of only 15 per cent tax free capital allowance.  From my experience as an accountant I am aware of the severe pressures placed on farmers by the costs associated with pollution control, land reclamation and other necessary capital expenditure.  The common view that all farmers are rolling in money does not hold.  I ask the Minister to review this area urgently.</P>
    <P>The announcement last year of a pilot relief scheme for certain resort areas was widely welcomed in the areas designated. It was the catalyst needed to rebuild areas such as Youghal. However, section 25 has put a severe damper on this development.  The scheme was to be effective for three years from 1 July 1995, but only nine months later it has been changed.  Many people have gone to considerable expense, both in time and money, preparing projects but they will not qualify for relief under the conditions laid down in section 25 (5) (a), (b) or (c).  I look forward to discussing this matter in further detail with the Minister on Committee Stage because he should re-examine cases where substantial expenditure has been incurred.  People who were willing to take the risk to rebuild <Col N="359" /> those areas are now at a great disadvantage and loss.  Why was the scheme changed in such a short time?  The pilot scheme is not as advantageous as the urban renewal scheme as rates exemption do not apply and reliefs are applicable only to touristm related expenditure. Was pressure brought to bear from some source in Government who did not favour the development of the countryside?</P>
    <P>In section 27 the Minister attempts to close off loopholes in the patent royalties area.  This section gives powers to the Revenue Commissioners to decide if the scheme is solely for avoidance purposes.  I have no doubt there will be a court case on this matter in the future which will be costly for the State.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy who expressed disappointment that the Committee Stage will be held in a committee room rather than in the Chamber.  This is important legislation which will have a major impact on every individual and on employment. Allowing only two days to discuss it is an insult to every elected Member.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the last two budgets that this cobbled together Government of convenience has failed to live up to their policy statement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> of December 1994.  I would not be so cynical as to suspect that the 1997 budget will include all those flowery promises of December 1994, but what are the odds with an election not long afterwards?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> We debate the Finance Bill every year but I am not sure if anyone listens.  There has been much talk in the past two days about this country never having it so good with low inflation, low interest rates, high economic growth and a booming economy.  Those factors should bridge the gap between the haves and the have nots, but that is not the case.  The rich are getting richer and the poor are staying poor.  It is amazing that in a Government of which Democratic Left and the <Col N="360" /> Labour Party are members this position should continue.</P>
      <P>PAYE workers, trade union members and small business people have been abandoned by the Government.  Despite the healthy economic position we still have the problems that have existed for the past three years, high unemployment, crime and drug problems and a lack of equality in third level education. Approximately 70 per cent of families in most housing estates are affected by unemployment.  They want the Government to provide leadership and jobs but, unfortunately, this Bill will not give them any hope.  It contains a number of proposals for job creation and more quangos, some of which were established when we were in Government. There are county enterprise boards, FÁS, community development and partnership programmes and other job creation structures in place, most of which are doing very little to create jobs.  We are merely creating layers of bureaucracy, red tape and jobs for chief executives and specialised people but they, in turn, are not creating jobs for those who need them.</P>
      <P>Drugs and crime are major problems but the Bill will not assist in putting those involved behind bars.  There have been delays in providing additional prison spaces and appointing extra gardaí and other people required to deal with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of equality in third level education concerns many Members. The majority of young people who live in housing estates never see the inside of a college or a university.  We will have to provide selective investment in such housing estates and other high unemployment areas to encourage young people to attend colleges so that we can break the cycle of unemployment and low educational standards that have existed in those areas for a long time. People in Donegal and Dublin raised the same issues with politicians canvassing during the recent by-election, namely, lack of education for poor families, taxation and crime.  All politicians must listen to these people.  While there <Col N="361" /> was a reasonable turn-out on polling day in Donegal, the position in Dublin was alarming.  That malaise will spread throughout the country unless we are prepared to listen and to tackle the problems confronting us.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill consists of 130 sections, most of which mean nothing to many sections of society.  It is complex and confusing and, if we were prepared to admit it, many of us do not understand some of its sections either.  It contains nothing that will help the unemployed get back into the workplace and, despite the changes proposed, in 1996 PAYE workers will pay more money to the Government than they did in 1995. We should endeavour to take those in the low income bracket out of the tax system and examine the position of those in the middle income bracket who are paying up to 56 per cent of their income in taxation.  People should not have to pay more than 50 per cent of their weekly income to the Government through taxation, PRSI and other payments. The people in the middle income bracket who have to pay full water and service charges, educational fees for their children and full medical fees are disillusioned and feel crucified by the tax system.</P>
    <P>Many people made sacrifices in the late 1980s and early 1990s and during a time of economic boom we should be looking at ways and means of increasing the take home pay of people in the PAYE sector.  Last Sunday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, said he hoped to be in a position in 1997 to look after the middle income group.  He should have looked after this sector last year and this year instead of saying he will look after them next year when there will be a general election.  One of the reasons people are cynical about politicians and politics is that Governments have acted in the same way in the past.  This cynicism not only exists among the large number of unemployed people in housing estates but also among middle income earners and taxpayers who have to pay such a high rate of tax.  It is time the Government looked <Col N="362" /> seriously at ways and means of increasing the take-home pay of PAYE workers, giving people an incentive to work and overhauling the taxation and social welfare systems.  It is not good enough to tinker around with the system. That is of no benefit to taxpayers or social welfare recipients who are not happy with the Government and believe politicians are not representing them or endeavouring to deal with them in a fair manner.</P>
    <P>When the resort renewal scheme was introduced last year it was welcomed by all sides of the House and many Deputies tried to have additional areas included in it.  However, for reasons best known to him the Minister has decided to make changes to the scheme which will have a serious effect on the level of investment in seaside resorts.  Courtown is included in the scheme and during the past few months negotiations and discussions have taken place and seminars have been held to encourage people to invest.  Much of the groundwork has not yet been completed and many people are only in the process of applying for planning permission and seeking funding to invest in Courtown.  As a result of the strict changes proposed by the Minister many investors have contacted me to tell me they no longer propose to invest in Courtown but propose instead to invest in Wexford or Enniscorthy which are included in the urban renewal scheme and which will yield a more profitable return on their investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look seriously at these proposed changes and consider letting the scheme run for three years before making any changes or including other resorts.  He should not introduce changes in the scheme in midstream as this will have a serious effect on investment in seaside resorts which need to be upgraded and require new facilities. These changes are another kick in the backside for rural Ireland.  The urban renewal scheme is a major incentive to people to invest in towns and cities and I ask the Minister to reconsider his proposed changes to the resort renewal <Col N="363" /> scheme as they will not be in the best interests of rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleagues for sharing their time with me. The constraints of the Chair make it difficult for me to contribute to debates.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the proposed changes in section 25, particularly as they will affect my constituency.  These changes will curtail the advantages and tax breaks available under the resort renewal scheme.  I received a letter from a firm of solicitors in my constituency in which they outlined their aversion to these changes as they will affect Arklow, which has been devastated over the years, together with its south Wicklow hinterland.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>In relation to Arklow, I have been involved in advising on several proposals but we have had great difficulty in relation to planning and the financial difficulties being encountered...and due to this they have been much slower to get off the ground.</P>
      <P>However up until now prospects were looking good and if some of these schemes had got off the ground they would have had a marked impact on Arklow as a tourist destination, especially in the accommodation front which would have involved the provision of self-sustaining holiday cottages which would have been a major benefit to the local economy, initially providing construction jobs to be followed by the spin-off effects of additional tourist numbers in the town.</P>
      <P>I have, as a result of this amendment, been contacted by a number of investors who now tell me that they are no longer interested in investing in Arklow as a result of this amendment and will now switch their investments to the West where the incentives are better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my considered opinion it is an absolute scandal that Arklow has yet again been left out in the cold while <Col N="364" /> better off tourist resorts reap all the benefits of the tax relief....</P>
    <P>No words of mine could better describe the situation that this letter from a firm of solicitors who are living and working in the town and know the difficulties on the ground.</P>
    <P>For many years I have been making the case for the inclusion of Arklow in the urban renewal scheme.  My criticism is not confined to this Government only; rather it is of successive Governments who have refused to include Arklow in the urban renewal scheme.  Over the past ten or 12 years this area of my constituency has been devastated, the traditional pottery and fertiliser industries have been run down and 2,000 jobs have been lost in Arklow and the surrounding hinterland of south Wicklow.  The northern part of County Wexford benefited greatly when the economy of Arklow was doing well.  This problem has not been addressed and corrected and these proposed changes are another kick in the teeth to this area of my constituency.</P>
    <P>The IDA had identified Arklow as one of the top three towns warranting positive and urgent action.  These negative changes are unacceptable to me and the people of Arklow and Wicklow who have had enough.  My colleagues will table Committee Stage amendments to correct these totally undesirable and unacceptable changes in the scheme. We were very pleased when Arklow and other areas along the east coast were included in the scheme last year and it is unacceptable that the scheme should now be curtailed in this way.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the Committee Stage amendments which will be tabled by my colleagues, to listen to what they have to say and to let this meritorious scheme proceed in the way initially proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Seán Ryan and Éamon Walsh.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance <Col N="365" /> Bill.  We all know the economy is performing extremely well.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, is to be congratulated on the strong economic growth this year and in previous years. For the first time in a generation, we are translating economic growth into job creation.  Having long been an unemployment blackspot in the European Union, some commentators estimate that our unemployment rate will be within 1 per cent of the EU average by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>A perception has developed, ably assisted by the Opposition, that we pay higher tax rates than our European partners.  It is an idea that has firmly taken root among the public but which is not entirely true.  Figures for taxes and social contributions in 1994 place Ireland eleventh in the league table of European Union countries per percentage of GDP taken up by taxation and social spending.  The perception that taxpayers are highly taxed is not without foundation as our unique demographic situation &mdash; we have by far the youngest population in Europe &mdash; has meant that our taxpayers support more dependants than is the norm in Europe.  This problem has been compounded by our high unemployment rate which is now declining. I hope the measures announced in this year's budget will impact here.  Taxpayers quite rightly expect high quality services in areas such as health, education and social services and they must be funded by taxation.</P>
      <P>Another aspect which compounds this problem is the PAYE sector feels it carries an excessive tax burden <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the community.  It is a view for which I, as an urban Deputy, have considerable sympathy.  The columnist, Colm Rapple, in an article in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Business Post</i> detailed the level of State support and intervention payable to the farming community.  It is hard to refute the allegation that this section of society does not pay its fair share of tax.</P>

    <P>The attitude of the Revenue Commissioners does not help in this area, although it is not difficult to understand <Col N="366" /> their position.  Their view is that rather than prosecute those involved in tax evasion, it is better to get some money into the Exchequer.  The benefits of this to the Exchequer are obvious but it creates an impression that people can adopt avoidance strategies with the Revenue Commissioners without ever having to pay the final penalty.</P>
    <P>The tax burden has declined in recent years as a result of Government policies. Since entering Government my party has tended to direct tax relief to the lower paid whereas other Governments concentrated on across the board reductions.  I support my party's policy in this area because it is based on social justice and is targeted at removing poverty and employment traps which prevent people taking up jobs.  Such a strategy is complemented by the social welfare package which allows people to retain certain secondary social welfare benefits after taking up work thus creating an incentive for them to get back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>This year's budget further increases personal tax free and PRSI allowances. The extension of the standard rate bands is welcome.  Workers through successive national pay agreements have made sacrifices to secure economic growth.  It is right that they should now reap the rewards.  I note with interest the Taoiseach's remarks yesterday about how take home pay has increased over the course of national pay agreements. However, the time has come to make a large gesture in this area and I hope the Minister will bear this in mind when preparing the 1997 budget.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I am bemused by the approach taken by the Opposition, in particular Fianna Fáil. Each time we have a debate on public finances it says we are overtaxed and require tax reductions, which is fair enough because that is its policy.  It is certainly the policy the Progressive Democrats pursues with vigour. However, when we debate health, education or social welfare, Fianna Fáil says we are not spending enough.  It is trying to square the circle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> I refer to the Government's contribution to tourism in recent years and speak as a member of the Dublin City and County Regional Tourism Organisation. Last year was a boom year for the tourism industry and the peace process contributed to this.  Dublin Tourism has indicated that bookings for this year are up on last year.  I welcome the incentives to support the industry in coastal towns. The number of new hotels in Dublin city has mushroomed in the past year or two in areas previously derelict.  Dublin Corporation is receiving planning applications almost monthly for large hotels needed to meet the projected tourism increase.  Last year our city teemed with tourists.  We must provide incentives for the provision of more hotels and accommodation and to attract more tourists. The tourism industry creates welcome employment in hotels, restaurants, theatres and studios and is helping our economy to improve.  On the Government's initiatives to tackle long-term unemployment I welcome the recruitment subsidy of £80 which will be paid to employers in respect of employees who will be unemployed for at least three years.  Up to 5,000 places will be provided this year under that scheme. To refocus community employment on the long-term unemployed, an additional 1,000 full-time places are being provided on community employment schemes on a pilot basis for people over 35 years who have been unemployed for at least five years and who can contribute to the economy.  It is important to target this group, as people who have been out of work often give up hope of finding employment.  It is important that they are redirected back into the economy.  I welcome this Bill which is a continuation of the policy set out in the programme for Government to deal with unemployment, in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill which gives legislative effect to measures announced in the budget.  The <Col N="368" /> purpose of the budget was to reduce poverty and unemployment traps and to increase the incentive to work.  On the basis of statistics and figures available, I have no doubt it will move us in the right direction.  I hope the initiatives in the Bill will provide much needed jobs, particularly for the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>On last year's Finance Bill I referred to granting a tax allowance for local authority service charges paid in full on time.  The maximum amount which qualified for relief was £150.  I welcomed this as an interim measure but only those who pay income tax benefit. Thousands of families on low incomes and on social welfare cannot benefit from such relief.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment and the Government should address this issue of service charges.  I do not say this because of the votes received by an anti-water charges candidate in the recent Dublin West by-election but because of the need to introduce proper funding for local authorities.  It is imperative to put local authorities on a proper footing. The problems of local authorities date from the abolition of rates in the 1977 budget.  This issue, and the finances of local authorities, has been a political hot potato for years and has been shelved by successive Governments.  If we are serious about reforming local government, it is essential that the review of local authority funding initiated by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  Deputy Howlin, is completed and its recommendations implemented as soon as they are known. In this regard, water and service charges should be taken off the agenda and a fairer system put in place.  Residential property tax, introduced in the mid-1980s, should also be re-evaluated, because it is mainly a Dublin tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about devolving more responsibilities to local communities, which will entail further tiers of local government, it is imperative that a fair and equitable system of funding is put in place.  All of us in this House are <Col N="369" /> aware of the need for such a system. Accordingly, as I have done on other occasions, I appeal to the Opposition parties not to play politics with this important issue.  It should be addressed by the House as a whole, and it is up to us to ensure that we do not fail the people on this occasion.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in this year's budget debate I welcomed many of the measures contained in this Bill.  I was particularly satisfied that the issue of long-term unemployment was being addressed and the ongoing progress in dealing with the public finances. Although this year's budget provided in the region of £178 million in tax relief for the PAYE sector, there is a perception among PAYE workers that there was little increase in their weekly or monthly salaries.  Given economic progress in recent years, it is imperative that further and more substantial progress is made in this area in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The consensus approach to economic management in recent years by the social partners, trade unions and the Government has been responsible for the sustained growth.  Reduction in taxes for the PAYE sector and attempts to increase the tax take from other sectors will be essential in maintaining the momentum behind the social partnership approach.  Although in recent months trade union leaders have expressed unease about a new national programme, a commitment from the Minister along the lines already outlined will, it is hoped, bring them back into the fold.  At the end of the day it will be up to the union membership to make a democratic decision on that.  As someone who was active in the trade union movement, I believe that the consensus approach in recent years has provided us with the opportunity to create additional jobs and to plan ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a couple of areas of concern in my own constituency. The urban renewal scheme was introduced in the 1994 Finance Act and I understand it is under review at present to assess its benefits.  I want to <Col N="370" /> make a case for designating the town of Balbriggan under the urban renewal scheme next year.  Balbriggan is a town that has experienced peaks and declines over the last few centuries.  It is located in north County Dublin, close to Drogheda and within easy reach of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Balbriggan, like many other towns in Ireland, was a major industrial town 200 years ago.  By the 19th century it had a number of vibrant textile, fishing and agriculturally based industries.  Infrastructural developments in the mid 19th century provided a boost to the established industries.  However, like many other towns throughout the country, the traditional industries declined in the 20th century.  The town has experienced difficulties in replacing its traditional industrial base.  The problems in this area include the decay of the buildings there, lack of jobs and, as anyone travelling to the North will see, excessive traffic, which works against Balbriggan as a town.  Thankfully, the Government has provided finance, after many years of promises, for a road to divert heavy traffic from Balbriggan.  Apart from the by-pass and the inner by-pass, designating Balbriggan for urban renewal would give hope to the people in an area which has the highest rate of unemployment in my constituency.  At long last communities are coming together and putting forward proposals to local authorities and Government.  One of the main proposals already submitted consists of a 30 or 40 page detailed document on areas to be developed and designated under the urban renewal scheme.  I make no apology for going on a bit about that because it is a town which needs the support of the Government.</P>
    <P>There are areas in my constituency, and in many other parts of urban Ireland, which are unemployment black spots, and there is a need for taxation relief for businesses prepared to invest in these areas.  There was reference to a scheme introduced last year to provide amenities in seaside resorts.  Since Fingal caters for hundreds of thousands of people from the city centre visiting the <Col N="371" /> seaside at weekends, I was most disappointed that none of the towns in my constituency was included.  I understand that scheme has been successful and remain hopeful that at least some of the many resorts in my constituency &mdash; Rush, Skerries, Donabate, Loughshinny, Malahide, Portmarnock, Balbriggan, etc., many of which have blue flag beaches &mdash; will be included.</P>
    <P>I must deplore the latest bombing in London last evening.  It is my fervent hope that sanity will prevail. The last thing this island needs, North and South, is the perpetration of such bombings which will merely diminish further our overall economic prospects.  We had witnessed the clear consequences of the peace which had prevailed over the earlier 18 month period.  Let us hope that sanity will prevail and that the views and expectations of the vast majority of people on this island will penetrate the hearts and minds of those who engage in such atrocious acts, condemned by all decent people.</P>
    <P>I have been very glad to contribute to this debate and have no doubt that, since this Bill forms part of a three year programme, the best is yet to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Finance Bill is the important annual fiscal instrument affecting the livelihood of all our citizens, taxation being its central feature.  It is my belief that taxation must form an integral part of any civilised society.  It is a means of distributing wealth from one sector to another and of directing various taxation funds towards the more needy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much debate in the House on taxation and tax relief. Whereas previous budgets veered taxation funds in another direction, this one concentrated on the creation of employment.  While no one budget can meet all needs, if we are to work to a plan we must be selective.  Therefore, I was glad to note that employment and <Col N="372" /> unemployment were its main focus this year.</P>
    <P>I must now deal with taxation, an important factor of the overall economic equation, particularly in the case of those workers who produce the wealth for distribution to those in greatest need.  There appears to be the perception abroad that an unfair share of the burden of taxation falls on the shoulders of the PAYE worker. Although many workers in that sector are unsure whether statistics or analyses quoted are correct, they are fully aware that they are not getting a sufficient break.  Notwithstanding that fact, they must be reminded that they have benefited from indirect tax concessions, not immediately recognisable, but without which they would be lacking certain benefits in education, social welfare and housing.</P>
    <P>I might remind the House of what has been done with regard to increased child allowances.  Within the social welfare aspect of the budget there has been a substantial increase granted each year leading this year, for the first time, to a decent payment to every family, irrespective of means, payable to the female spouse and welcomed by many families experiencing considerable financial difficulties, if not poverty.</P>
    <P>The fact that the <i>per capita</i> grants to primary school students have been increased is not yet fully recognised by many PAYE taxpayers, since nobody has informed them of the fact; many schools tend not to inform parents of their State <i>per capita</i> grants.  Indeed that fact is not sufficiently vaunted in this House.  For example, in 1992 the State <i>per capita</i> grants for a primary school pupil was £28, increased to £40 in 1995, with further funds available for an additional increase in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>We need to spell out to those demanding tax reliefs and tax breaks that funds are being expended in their interests in other areas.  Always we are confronted by a choice: in which direction should we move?  Should we put a cap on services in return for more <Col N="373" /> money in pay packages?  This is a perpetual dilemma.  We must endeavour to strike a balance because many citizens cannot provide the services they require from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The issue of local authority service charges is important, particularly in my constituency of Dublin South-West. Once again taxpayers perceive this latest imposition as unfair, but, in order to render the overall provision of such services fair and equitable, certain safeguards must be incorporated which of course cost money.  We are beginning to ascertain the increasing administrative expenses incurred in the collection of such charges and their commensurate diminished benefits.  That disparity must be examined because, the more safeguards there are built in, the lesser will be the funds collected and the fewer the benefits accruing.  I advocate the abolition of water charges nationwide to be substituted by proper financing of local government and serious, well thought out analysis of what is required to provide proper local authority services.</P>
    <P>Another group of low paid workers in my constituency whose difficulties need to be addressed are those employed by Packard who are in need of a tax break. While jobs were targeted in this budget, I hope taxation will be the focal point of next year's.  Many constituencies have pockets of deprivation, Dublin South-West is no exception, particularly West Tallaght, where resources need to be directed.  If tax breaks are to be afforded low paid workers in such areas I hope administrative expenses will not diminish their benefit.  I am thinking particularly of areas like Glenshane, Fettercairn, Jobstown and Killinarden, where there have been media reports of people endeavouring to regain control of their areas from drug barons or their sub-agents.  The women in those areas want to be sure that, when their menfolk leave, they can walk the streets safely.  Indeed, their present action is a symptom of the urgent need for such safeguards.  However, the requisite funds must be found and it is my hope <Col N="374" /> that we will not diminish their effectiveness by cutting taxes too severely. People living in places like Fettercairn, Glenshane and Jobstown, experiencing enormous difficulties with drugs, need resources invested in their areas. Resources must be invested immediately to tackle the drugs problem.  Next year may be too late for some young people living there.</P>
    <P>While arguing for tax reductions is eminently valid, on the other hand, there are many other genuine, urgent demands competing for such funds.  This leads to the dilemma of knowing best how to balance the scales.  We should first endeavour to target the low paid PAYE worker, give them a substantial tax break since they have carried a huge burden for so long, thus according them the recognition they deserve.  They have waited patiently, quietly and I hope their time will come.</P>
    <P>That being said, I make no apologies for the provisions of this Bill targeting jobs, many people in the areas to which I have referred being in desperate need of them.  If they can be provided with employment, the battle against crime, drugs and other deprivations will disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.  One of the changes that has taken place in this House since I was elected is that there is a time limit on debates.  Overall that has been a good thing for more ordered business but the disadvantage is that there is not an opportunity to reply to the outlandish misconceptions that are trotted out by the Labour Party, in particular. An example is the abolition of rates in 1977.  Do the members of the Labour Party not realise that it was the committed policy of all parties to abolish rates?  Before 1977 the Labour Party in Government had abolished 25 per cent of the rates that contributed to the health services.  In 1982 when a Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government was formed after the general election, the Leader of Fine Gael said there would have to be prudent management of the <Col N="375" /> economy and control of public spending, but within 12 hours the Labour Party Leader said there would be no such thing.  In four years that Government doubled the national debt, creating the terrible problems we have had to deal with since.  I am tempted to reply to the points that were made, but I will desist and concentrate on the 1996 Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill gives effect to the measures announced in the budget and introduces other measures as well.  This is the fourth great opportunity the Government has had to bring about worthwhile changes, particularly in tax reform.  The Government has introduced two budgets and this is its second Finance Bill but it has not introduced worthwhile changes.  The issues that have to be addressed by any Minister for Finance are reform of the tax system for a variety of reasons and control of public spending.  We have to be concerned about the level of public spending, particularly in the light of the present good economic environment. Last year the Government added £1,000 million to the national debt which in my view was totally unnecessary.  The Government inherited a situation in 1994 where the budget came in with a £15 million surplus.  They budgeted for a deficit last year and surpassed it by spending an extra £60 million.  They have budgeted for an even higher deficit this year which is totally unacceptable at a time when our economy is doing well. We have to bear in mind that we have benefited from European Union Structural Funds which are making a substantial contribution to development.  We cannot be absolutely sure that after 1999 we will be favoured by the European Union to the extent we have been in the past.  The Government should prepare for the rainy day because at some stage there will be a down turn and it is important that we are able to maintain the level of services.  Prudent management is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charter 1 includes marginal relief in <Col N="376" /> income tax.  The Government has missed the opportunity to bring about proper tax reform and spend the money that was available wisely, to target it in areas that would be of benefit to taxpayers and ensure that we were able to remain competitive in some of the labour-intensive industries, for example the food sector.</P>
    <P>The changes in PRSI were minuscule. Employers who take on people in areas of high unemployment benefit from a 0.2 per cent reduction, that is £20 in £10,000, which is not much incentive to employers to create jobs in these areas. The £140 allowance was abolished.  During the Donegal North-East by-election a number of people raised the question of why it was not possible to give tax relief on domestic charges in the current year rather than having to wait an extra year.  The Minister might look at this.</P>
    <P>The economy is performing well and we on this side of the House make no apology for taking the credit for that.  I was a member of the Government in 1987 which decided on the key issues to be addressed and hard decisions to be taken.  Those decisions were taken and I am sorry that my Labour Party colleagues are not here to let them know it was possible to reduce taxation and at the same time increase spending on social welfare.  Public spending was properly controlled.  The Government of the day looked for better value for money.  We are reaping the payoff and that is the main reason the economy is doing as well.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the Maastricht Treaty and economic and monetary union, it is right that there should be prudent management of the economy and that public spending should be controlled.  I have said before that we do not have the right to spend money we are not prepared to raise and leave the bill for our children. We do not have that right.  On the question of inflation, it is important to recognise that nine of the 14 European Union countries turned in better inflation rates.  Under the Maastricht criteria the average for the three countries with the lowest inflation rates is 1.1 per cent as <Col N="377" /> against our 2 per cent.  It is no harm to keep an eye on these figures, which highlight the need for control of public spending.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with income tax relief for installing alarms.  Obviously what was announced in the budget was totally unacceptable and has been recognised as such.  If somebody installs an alarm for an elderly member of their family, they will be able to claim the tax relief. It showed a total remove from reality to bring in a scheme whereby pensioners would be able to claim tax relief when the overwhelming majority of them do not pay tax.  That fact should have been known.  These people should be given a grant and should have alarms if they wish to have them.  We should contrast the way this was dealt with the enlightened initiatives taken by the then Minister, Charles Haughey, in introducing free telephone rental, free television licence, free electricity allowance and so on.  These things were examined and then implemented immediatley and one did not need to set up a task force, unlike the way it was handled by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the provision in section 35 of grant subsidies to employers in certain circumstances but did not refer to the new scheme &mdash; outlined in the explanatory memorandum &mdash; to be announced by the Department of Enterprise and Employment which FÁS will operate.  It would be interesting to hear more about the scheme.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with changes in stamp duty.  I wish to raise the question of removing stamp duty for those aged 65 and over who purchase a house.  It has been suggested recently that people over 65 years who own very large houses could buy a smaller house for themselves when they retire but the level of stamp duty is an impediment to that.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance might look at the cost benefit of stamp duty and how it works in the sale of houses, considering that elderly people living in very large houses might well prefer to be in a smaller house and the <Col N="378" /> construction industry would benefit.  It might be worth looking at the question of stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with consolidation provisions.  While I welcome the decision to consolidate finance law dating back to 1967, the Minister should consider how it will be dealt with by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Given that the Minister said it would involve 1,100 sections, to deal with it properly some thought must be given to how it will be managed.  The integration of the tax and social welfare systems, with which my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, dealt at some length, could also be considered at that time.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 54 to 59 which provide incentives for construction and refurbishment work on the islands.  I am concerned about the Government's U-turn regarding incentives for seaside resorts.  The case was eloquently made by my colleague, Deputy Jacob, regarding towns in his constituency, but it applies to all resorts.  Having regard to our demography, a much wider issue needs to be addressed.  It has been highlighted on many occasions in terms of the marginalisation of areas of cities and towns.  I refer to the depletion of our rural population.  We must consider what can be done to change what has happened over the years,</P>
    <P>The decentralisation programme introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government was abandoned by the Fine Gael-Labour Government between 1982 and 1987 and reactivated by Fianna Fáil in 1987.  It has worked extremely well in transferring people to centres in rural Ireland along the west coast, in my constituency in Cavan town and elsewhere. The problem is that at present all parties are committed to decentralisation on a cental basis.  There seems to be a conscious effort to centralise all decentralised services in county towns. That issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency because if not we will end up with decentralised services concentrated in 26 county towns.</P>
    <P>The ESB is closing a number of its offices.  With the highly sophisticated <Col N="379" /> telecommunications available today there is no reason its offices in towns other than the county town should be closed.  The Army closed its barracks in Cootehill, a first class town, and built a new one in Cavan town.  Over the years we have allowed sub-post offices and rural Garda stations to be closed and service providers to locate in main towns.  There appears to be an advance on that now in that county towns are being developed at the expense of other towns.  That matter should be addressed. It is an undesirable trend which, if allowed to continue, will have serious consequences.</P>
    <P>Public service utilities such as water and sewerage should be provided in all towns.  Every town should operate from a level playing pitch in terms of having the necessary services to attract industry, create jobs and retain its population.</P>
    <P>There is not a Government commitment to Border areas.  Border areas and others are unable to compete with the greater Dublin area.  I understand industralists are prepared to pay £120,000 per acre within 20 miles of Dublin, but they will not pay £20,000 an acre for land 50 miles down the road.  That issue must be addressed.  The main reason for that disparity is the lack of a fully serviced infrastructure including roads, water and sewerage facilities and particularly the lack of highly sophisticated telecommunications, such as fibre optics.  Those services should be available.  I refer particularly to the Border areas and other areas where advance factories should be located.  The IDA is committed to locating them in those areas, but they should be in place.</P>
    <P>Despite the incentives for locating in Border areas, of the 10,000 jobs created as a result of overseas investment only 120 were created in my constituency, which has a population of 100,000.  That is an indictment of the Government's lack of commitment to Border areas, particularly having regard to the investment conference in Washington.  Many funds are available under INTERREG, the IFI and the peace initiative.  I ask <Col N="380" /> the Government to ensure that the funds are spent wisely and are additional and not substituted.  For many years moneys allocated by taxpayers in France and Germany were substituted for Exchequer funds which the Border areas should have received. Following the ceasefire, and I hope it will be restored despite last night's incident, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that such funds are additional and spent wisely to ensure that proper infrastructure is provided to attract investment opportunities and create jobs to enable people live in their local areas.  Too many agencies are dispensing funds under the peace initiative. I do not see the need for the large number of newly established agencies.</P>
    <P>There is no major road west or north of the Dublin-Galway road.  Elsewhere there is a reasonable network of national primary roads, but there is not a national primary route from the north east to the north west to serve Border regions.  All our maps, as well as the national development plan, highlight there is no national primary route north of the Dublin-Galway road.  That has major consequences for people and businesses in Border regions.</P>
    <P>The food sector is the largest sector in my constituency.  It has encountered problems arising from price differentials in competing with Northern Ireland and Britain over the past 12 months.  The increase in the value of the punt from 95p 18 months ago to £1.03 against the pound sterling has posed serious problems for that sector.</P>
    <P>I referred to the miniscule changes in PRSI.  Worthwhile improvements could have been made this year to make industry more competitive, particularly labour-intensive industry such as the food sector.  It is a tribute to that sector, which accounts for 50,000 jobs, that it has been able to survive.  The agriculture industry is going through a difficult period.  The price of winter finished beef has fallen.  There has also been the BSE fiasco caused unnecessarily by the <Col N="381" /> announcement in the House of Commons. I have no hesitation in saying, as a politician and doctor, that I will continue to eat beef.  I hope this problem will be dealt with in time.  All these factors put pressure on the food sector.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains many complex measures.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, that given its importance Committee Stage should always be taken in this Chamber rather than dealt with by a select committee. We will have an opportunity at that stage to deal with the various sections in more detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Hanlon for sharing his time with me which is rather short to debate such comprehensive legislation.  I welcome in particular the proposal to consolidate the tax code, but what is required even more is tax reform.  There is a need for greater integration of the social welfare and tax codes.  It would be a step in the right direction if the provisions governing reference numbers and so on were tightened.</P>
      <P>It must not be forgotten that the Bill and the budget are silent on VHI and mortgage interest relief.  These reliefs are again being reduced, placing a further burden on the PAYE and PRSI worker.  Residential property tax remains intact.  It is both unfair and unjust in that it mainly affects Dublin and Cork home owners.  It is not based on the size of property or income of the household.  Location is not a reason for taxation.  That was one of the lessons of the Dublin west by-election.  In the short time I spent in the constituency I was made aware by some property owners that this was a relevant issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the business expansion scheme and the film tax arrangements. These arrangements are merely an official admission that people cannot be expected to pay over 51 per cent of their income to the State.  All indirect taxes and the iniquitous residential property tax are in urgent need of <Col N="382" /> reform, but have not been addressed by the Minister.  He has shown flair in introducing the old car replacement scheme, even if he continues to ignore my suggestion relating to second-hand cars which would enhance the scheme to the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The film tax arrangements should be built into a reduction of the higher tax rates while the BES should be confined to its original purpose rather than amended.  It was introduced to encourage risk taking and help new and small business in raising finance.  This is not happening under the existing scheme. There is an impediment in that one has to meet certain criteria.  In addition, the scheme is geared towards helping labour-intensive industries.  We have many fine capital intensive industries, but they will not have an opportunity to secure funding because of the restrictions imposed in the budget.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> Shane Ross pointed to some weaknesses and the high cost of securing finance and indicated that the financial institutions were abusing the scheme.  Prospectus advertising should be properly monitored.  The certification arrangements are of no help in job creation.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the seaside resort scheme announced last year which is now being amended in mid-stream.  This could hardly be described as fostering employment creation.  For some time we have been very vocal on the issue of the development of the hospitality sector to the benefit of the tourism industry.  Because of the restrictions being imposed many people will be caught mid-stream.  The Minister should reconsider and relax the proposed restrictions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill will produce £4.388 billion in income tax, an increase of £455 million on the figure for 1995 &mdash; so much for the Minister's claim that he is helping the PAYE and the PRSI worker.  It is clear that he has lowered his own expectations of being a radical Minister for Finance to one who is treading water. <Col N="383" /> There will never be a better time for not needing a Minister for Finance, with world trade in such a favourable cycle, funding from Brussels at an all-time high and the economy doing well without any help from the Minister, who inherited a favourable situation from Deputy Bertie Ahern one year ago.  It is disappointing that the rainbow Administration could not build and improve on that sound platform.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows like everybody else that he cannot make all the people happy all the time.  The trouble is that he seems to think that he cannot make any person happy with the tax code.  He is a bad harvester.  The seeds that he garners he scatters to the winds with a few landing here and there, but nothing happens in terms of fruitful cultivation. Instead of adopting a miserly Fagin's policy of making nobody happy, the Minister should seek to sow his seed in choice, productive areas and reap a proper harvest of jobs.  What are we doing? We are building ghetto after ghetto and improving the welfare system without creating any jobs.  Many of the people living in those ghettos will never know what it is like to have a job.  That is the reality of life.</P>
    <P>We have a large national debt which continues to grow.  Were it not for the co-operation of Deputy Dukes, whom I admire and who is now on the back benches, with Fianna Fáil from 1987 onwards the Government would not be able to gloat about economic achievements. He has, regrettably, paid the price.  I sympathise with him.</P>

    <P>There is a crisis in the beef industry, which accounts for 10 per cent of GNP. <Col N="384" /> Its exports are valued at £1.8 billion.  For the first time people realise its importance to the economy.  It is as important on O'Connell Street as in Glanworth, Kildorrery, Ballycotton and Midleton in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for putting the brakes on some of his colleagues in their anxiety to spend in unproductive areas. He has been able to use the Maastricht Treaty to curtail the efforts of Ireland's first Democratic Left-led Administration, a Government with L plates, although they are good learners.  I doubt, however, if they will qualify for the big &ldquo;P&rdquo;, a good pension, because they have been reckless.  The tragedy is that Fine Gael, which was classed until recently as the business party, has been singing and dancing to the tune of Democratic Left.  The real Taoiseach is the leader of Democratic Left, Proinsias De Rossa, and the people are beginning to realise that.  Labour does not have any influence in Government.  The loony left is running the country and the economy into the ground.  When we were in Government Deputy Bruton lectured us on accountability and mentioned transparency and panes of glass. He badly needs to buy a bottle of Windowlene and a nice white cloth to clean the glass and show us what he has achieved.</P>
    <P>The country is on a road that does not lead anywhere.  After all the constructive work done in the economy from 1987 onwards when restrictions were imposed on the people and they suffered hardship, a serious crisis is looming. The people will pay the price for the Government's mismanagement.</P>
    <P>There has been enourmous growth in Government Departments and the cost of the public service has risen from £1.6 billion in 1987 to £2.3 billion today. Such growth in a few years is frightening. I appeal to the Taoiseach not to allow Deputy De Rossa, who represents a small number of people, to run the country.</P>

      <P>I am glad they did so. Such figures show good, solid, sensible budgeting.  There is nothing of the looney Left there.  It is a good budget outcome for Fine Gael and when it is accompanied by a series of social welfare initiatives which I and my colleagues have been arguing for over a number of years it is one with which we can be modestly content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect with which Deputy O'Keeffe dealt briefly requires attention. He is coming along quite well and has what Joyce called the &ldquo;agenbite of inwit&rdquo;.  It is beginning to bite now.  He mentioned the integration of the tax and social welfare codes.  Unfortunately he did not dwell on this area but he may do so next year.  When he examines the issue he might find cause to congratulate the Taoiseach and the Government because, for the first time, a Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, has been specifically charged with integrating the taxation and social welfare codes.  I am delighted with that.  It is too many years since I, as Minister for Finance, tried to look at these two codes in an integrated way.  The importance of doing so was brought home to me further by an interesting study I received recently from a friend of mine dealing in a thoughtful way with the interface between taxation and social welfare.  I recommend that Deputy O'Keeffe and his colleagues think about it.  I sent a copy to the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan and to the Ministers for Finance, Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment.  It will be a useful contribution to thinking in this area through it is not the first such study.  Some years ago, my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, produced some startling conclusions on this area.  However, in the meantime the issue has become more worrying.  It was with that in mind that I said while I was happy with the overall shape and outcome of the budget, the Government, with every goodwill &mdash; and I am not <Col N="387" /> criticising it for doing so &mdash; made the same mistake as most other Governments. It tried to do too many worthwhile, laudable and desirable things in the budget and, therefore, did not do any one of them sufficiently well to make a substantial impact on the problems we face.  Nowhere is that more obvious than in the area of personal taxation. It is not sufficient for Deputy O'Keeffe to drag up the same old chestnut and ask why if personal allowances are being reduced the tax take this year will be higher than last year.  That old argument is so tired&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no harm repeating it if you do not want to think. Repeating it makes no difference to the fundamental fact that there is more income to tax.  Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill deal with the tax reliefs, increases in personal allowances and so on and section 35 provides for employment grants or subsidies to be made to employers on or after 6 April in regard to new employment provided by them. It relieves certain new employments from the necessity to pay corporation tax and income tax as appropriate.  On the one hand we increase personal allowances and so on and on the other we recognise that the tax system is anti-employment and we introduce employment grants and subsidies in section 35. If we look at the explanatory memorandum and the number of bodies involved we will realise the extent of the problem.  There are operating agreements between the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and county enterprise boards.  There is the EU Leader II Community Initiative, the area partnerships scheme administered by Area Development Management Limited under the EU Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Local employment initiatives counter the effect of the difficulties arising from the interaction of our tax and social welfare systems.  The degree to which that is the case is very worrying. It was with that in mind that I said we would be far better in budget policy to recognise that the scope for tax reductions in any one year is limited and to concentrate the resources available for tax reductions in the areas where they will make the biggest difference to the capacity of our economy to employ people, and that is always at the lower end of the tax system.</P>
      <P>There is a particularly difficult interaction between our tax and social welfare systems.  Low income workers, depending on their level of income, are eligible for tax exemption.  Families with children are exempt from income tax up to an amount significantly higher than the normal tax free allowance of £6,100. The tax exemption amount is linked to family size; it increases depending on the number of children in the family. Workers who benefit from the tax exemption system move on to a 40 per cent tax rate, which is more than twice the difference between the tax exemption figure and the tax free allowance figure.  For example, a worker with an adult dependent and four children is exempt from tax up to £10,000 per annum instead of having a tax free allowance of £6,100, but that person pays at 40 per cent on all additional earnings up to £18,000.  A worker with eight children escapes from the 40 per cent tax band under the marginal system only when income exceeds £23,500. That is the first difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For most family sizes there is not a very big difference between the medical card income limit and the tax exemption amount.  For example, for a worker with an adult dependant and two children the medical card income limit is £8,086 whereas the exemption limit is £8,700. That does not allow for other income <Col N="389" /> amounts added to the medical card income limit such as provision for travel to work or payments of rent or mortgage over a certain level.</P>
    <P>The next item that affects low paid workers is the family income supplement, a very useful scheme.  This supplement, which is paid to workers on low wages from employment, is linked to the level of gross income and to family size.  For example, the FIS income limit for a married worker with two children is £11,180.  For a worker with four children it is £13,260.  The family income supplement payment is 60 per cent of the difference between the gross income and the FIS income limit.  For example, for a family of two adults and four children with a gross employment income of £10,000 the FIS entitlement is 60 per cent of the different between £10,000 and the FIS limit of £13,260, that is £1,956 per annum.  All increases thereafter lead to a reduction in the family income supplement payment at the rate of 60 per cent so that an increase of £1,000 in the gross income figure leads to a reduction of £600 in the FIS figure.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the operation of employee PRSI and the levy of 2.25 per cent of additional income &mdash; the limit was changed this year.  If a worker's income is above the medical card limit or tax exemption limit, which are very close, the worker immediately loses the benefit of the medical card and loses exemption from the 2.25 per cent in levies. That can amount to a loss of between £500 and £900 depending on family size.  All additional income up to the FIS limit is subject to levies, PRSI, income tax and FIS reductions.  At certain levels of income, with additional income coming into the household, a 60 per cent reduction applies in family income supplement, a 40 per cent marginal tax rate applies, employment levies apply at 2.25 per cent and employee PRSI applies at 5.5 per cent.  The combination of extra impositions or reductions on the additional income can amount to 107.75 per cent.  In those cases, the worker who receives an <Col N="390" /> increase in gross income experiences a reduction in disposable income.</P>
    <P>The income band over which additional gross income leads to a reduction in net disposable income varies with family size as the medical card limit, FIS and tax exemption amount are also linked to family size.  There can be quite a spread of income &mdash; for example, for a family with two children, earning between £8,700 and £11,180, increases in gross income over that band lead to a reduction in net disposable income.  That happens because of the operation of the social welfare system with FIS, the tax system with marginal relief, PRSI and the levies.  It creates the major problem at the lower end of the income scale and prevents people from taking on work rather than remaining unemployed.  All increases in income between the medical card limit, the tax exemption amount and the FIS limit lead to a reduction in net disposable income.</P>
    <P>The maximum loss a worker can experience by falling in that income range is suffered by the worker with a large family earning just above the average manufacturing wage.  A worker with eight children who pushes his earnings from just below £12,600 to £17,000 would lose a gross total of £5,624.  For an increase in income of £4,400, one loses £5,624, a net reduction in disposable income of £1,224.  This comes about because of the interaction of the various parts of our tax and social welfare system, which is where the real disincentive to work comes into play.</P>
    <P>Increasing income over that range also involves costs to the employer.  The employer's PRSI rate over that range increases from 8 per cent to 12 per cent on all earnings above £80 a week.  If the employer tries to cover that loss in net disposable income for the worker, it will have to be with income payments bearing an increase in the level of the employer's PRSI contribution.  This is where the tax disincentive to work comes into play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> If one examines the comparison between net disposable income from employment at the average manufacturing wage, which was £13,806 in 1995, and total income from unemployment for different family sizes, as family size increases the relationship of net income from unemployment payments to that from work increases from 77 per cent for a family with two children to 92 per cent for a family with eight children. This only considers income from employment.  If one takes account of the benefit, for example, of a local authority rent, the value of a medical card and the other elements built into increasing the income level below which one would qualify for a medical card, it is not difficult to imagine situations where a worker on the average manufacturing wage level is worse off than an unemployed person in receipt of those various social benefits, medical cards and increases in allowable income limits. However, there is a wise provision that a dependant of a worker in receipt of unemployment assistance can earn up to £2,000 per annum without the loss of any benefits or without incurring any income tax liability.  There is a knot in family income which constitutes a major difficulty.</P>
    <P>Curiously, the task force report on long-term unemployment made little reference to this matter.  Instead it proposed establishing a local employment service, measures to increase skills, positive discrimination in favour of the long-term unemployed, etc.  However, it did not deal in any real sense with the interaction between our tax and social welfare systems.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I am not for a moment suggesting we reduce the levels of social welfare provision, the provision under the family income supplement etc. However, when we have resources to reduce levels of personal taxation, if we want to have more employment in our economy we should use whatever resources we have at the lower end of the scale to relieve the tax burden on those earning lower incomes so that we <Col N="392" /> get past the tax wedge problem which is creating the poverty and unemployment traps.</P>
    <P>It would be perfectly valid for any Government to say, for example, that for the next three to four years it will devote any leeway it has to reduce personal income tax to address this problem and tell people like me that I will have to be content with the effects on my income.  While there would be a positive effect by reducing taxation at lower income levels &mdash; because I am higher up on the scale I would get its full benefit &mdash; there should be nothing else.  If we are serious about helping to turn our economic growth, which we have managed to achieve consistently and steadily for the last few years, into more employment at a higher rate than at present, that is the strategy we should adopt when we come to discuss our taxation system.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for a number of other useful measures.  However, it is puzzling why some of them take the form specified.  Section 5 provides for relief from income tax for expenditure incurred on the purchase and installation of an intruder alarm system. Although that was greeted with some hilarity on budget day, on reflection people found it to be a good idea.  Many older people, because of provisions made in their earlier years, have an income tax liability although they are over 65 years of age.  However, I do not understand the reason for limiting the benefit of this measure to people over 65 years of age who live alone.  Would anybody suggest that a married couple over 65 years of age are less at risk than a single person?  They may be, but the difference is not that great.  This good idea has been compressed by budgetary exigencies and I cannot imagine that making this relief available to couples over 65 years of age would severely worsen our £2 million current budget deficit this year.  We might have an opportunity to look at other matters in the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> Part III of the Bill deals with value added tax and makes a number of worthy changes that nobody would argue against.  What has happened to the idea of moving towards a single value added tax rate?  I would hate to think that idea has disappeared from the fiscal map. We have several rates of value added tax which, in some circumstances, can cause substantial difficulties and costs for people in trade and retailing who have to account for them.  A single rate of value added tax has a number of advantages not the least of which is convenience for traders as well as the dynamic effect of such a single rate on substantial sectors of our economy.  I would like the Minister to give an indication of his thinking on this issue when replying to the debate because there is a great deal to be said for simplification in our tax system if that can be achieved.</P>

      <P>Each year the Finance Bill provides an opportunity for the Government to use the tax system as its instrument to bring about social justice and greater equality in our society.</P>
      <P>I want to take on board some of the points made by Deputy Dukes.  It is a fact in our society that many people are doing extremely well.  High levels of growth have transformed the economy for many people and, in particular, low interest rates are improving the lot of those who are hard pressed to pay their mortgages.  The extension of free university education is of enormous benefit to a certain class in society and to their children but for many thousands of other people who are excluded or locked out from the benefits of high growth in the economy, there is nothing in the budget or in this Finance Bill to improve their position, remove their isolation and marginalisation, give them a greater opportunity to participate in our economy and contribute to their own community by being allowed to work, which every citizen is entitled to do. Their dignity is being denied them because they are being excluded from employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> There is no greater instrument available to Government than taxation to encourage what is good in our society and discourage what is not.  Year after year, Government after Government brings in tax breaks or designates certain areas of certain categories of industry for beneficial tax breaks to encourage various aspects in this economy.</P>
    <P>This Bill, and the budget announced in the House earlier this year, does not increase equality of opportunity for the unemployed.  It does not give to the hard-pressed taxpayers, particularly PAYE taxpayers, the fruits of the growth about which the Government is so keen to boast.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the proposed successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Yesterday in this House I raised with the Taoiseach, as I have done before, the fact that certain key sectors of the economy are not involved in social partnership which, if it is to be a true partnership between all the components in our society, must be as inclusive as possible.  I said yesterday to the Taoiseach, in the context of Northern Ireland, that if, as he rightly advocates, we are to transform that society, if we are to have a lasting peace settlement and if Northern Ireland is to become a partnership society to which Unionists and Nationalists can each give their allegiance, we must have inclusive talks and everybody should be at the talks table.</P>
    <P>Equally, in the context of social partnership in this economy, if it is to be inclusive and if all the partners are to be represented, we cannot simply pick and choose.  Many people believe that the social partnership is becoming more and more an insiders' club, where those who have are represented and those who have not are excluded.  In particular, there is no justification for not having the INOU, the only organisation whose sole focus is unemployment, represented at that table.  I know the trade union movement, IBEC and employer organisations are concerned with unemployment also, but theirs is a wider brief.  They are concerned about their <Col N="395" /> own industries, sector and employees. The Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed is the only organisation whose sole <i>raison d'être</i> is to improve the lot of the unemployed and to give them a greater opportunity to participate in real work.  There is a strong case for including that organisation in the social partnership.</P>
    <P>The organisation, ISME, represents the traded sector in which 400,000 people work.  That sector, more than any other, knows the need for this economy to be competitive and what incentives can do for employers in relation to taking on more employees.  It knows too the effect of high taxes on its workforce.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue with the social partnership which, on balance, I support because there are strong reasons for having social partnership, provided we can afford it and that it is a genuine partnership, it must be as inclusive as possible.  There is no justification for having five voices in the area of agriculture at the table &mdash; the three farming organisations, ICOS and Macra na Feirme &mdash; while excluding other key sectors in the economy.  I could list others such as the chambers of commerce or the National Youth Council. There is a strong case to extend the social partnership to ensure it is genuinely inclusive.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about whether the Government has the capacity to agree a new deal.  One only has to look at the responses in the past few days from the trade unions and from IBEC to see they are getting a little sceptical about the Government's capacity to deliver a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The Taoiseach made an extraordinary statement yesterday. He seems to be more concerned with a deal, any deal, rather than the nature of the deal.  We cannot adopt a narrow minded approach to the nature of the deal that will succeed the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> because this economy is entering a far more competitive European Union.  Our economy has enormous problems <Col N="396" /> because of the high levels of unemployment and our peripheral location.  In the context of peace in Northern Ireland, the economy in the Republic is not now as competitive as the economy in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, it must be tax based.  Nominal increases in salaries are of no use to Irish workers if they have to face penal levels of tax on work.  Is is right, for example, that a single worker in Packard Electric in Tallaght, Oral B in Newbridge or the many factories around the country, earning £12,000 per year or £246 per week, pays £46 per week in tax?  Is it right that a married man with a dependent spouse who earns £300 per week pays £68 per week in tax, and on their marginal income they pay over 56 per cent of what they earn to the Government?  Any society that takes more from a person by way of tax than the individual can keep for themselves is not encouraging self-reliance, rewarding effort or encouraging people to go out to work.  Tax reform must be fundamental to any successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> if this economy is to reward effort and encourage enterprise.</P>
    <P>In the recent Dublin West by-election, more than 50 per cent of the voters did not vote for any party represented in this House.  We may say by-elections are different.  That is true.  When people focus on choosing a Government they examine different issues as well as the capacity of parties to deliver good government for the country.  Nonetheless, 50 per cent is a startling figure and it would be foolish of any of us, particularly of any leader in this House, not to take on board the strong message delivered to us by the voters in Dublin West.</P>
    <P>The protest in relation to water rates was not merely a fundamental issue about not paying for water.  That is how it may have been represented but it was much deeper than that.  The taxpayers were saying they have had enough. They are fed up paying high taxes.  They <Col N="397" /> live in a society where they are not rewarded for the effort they make.  They do not live in a fair society and, in so far as they can, they will agitate and protest because they do not believe in paying double taxation.</P>
    <P>The strong message that comes from that is that reform of the tax system is essential for social cohesion.  The people who work in this economy, the eight out of every 24 people who work in the private sector and the two out of every 24 who work in the State sector, are the backbone of society.  They are the people who maintain its fabric in so many ways because a society that does not respect workers and appreciate the contribution they make through ordinary efforts, earning a living for themselves and keeping their families, is in danger of destablisation.  Reform of taxation is not just an economic issue; there is more to it than that.  It is about social cohesion in families, the nature of the society in which we live and the kind of Ireland we want as we head into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, spoke recently about the need for tax reform next year.  If they can get away with it, the Government will try to have two budgets before the next election, one at the beginning and another at the end of the year.  The Government had an opportunity this year to introduce tax reform, as it has had for two years, indeed the Labour Party has had this opportunity for four years.</P>
    <P>We should consider the record of the Labour Party in Government.  For example, as the newspaper stated today, each individual in the State now owes £8,434 in terms of the national debt. However, this sum has increased by £1,011 a head in the four years since the Labour Party went back into Government. The national debt has increased since the 1970s &mdash; every party in the House has been in Government during that time &mdash; but the rate of increase since the Labour Party went into Government is three times the rate when the Progressive Democrats were in Government.  Since the Labour Party <Col N="398" /> went back into Government, spending has increased by £2.2 billion, an increase of over 25 per cent, while £700 million extra has been taken in taxation from the PAYE sector.  There is no point in the Labour Party boasting about free university education if the workers the party seeks to represent are being penalised through high levels of tax on their income.  That is no incentive or reward.</P>
    <P>If a different strategy had been followed, with spending this year kept in line with inflation and the provision of services to the people limited in real terms to the growth level of inflation, the Government would have had £375 million to apply to tax reform.  It could have reduced the standard rate of tax by 5 per cent, from 27 to 22 per cent.  Since the Progressive Democrats left Government in 1992, neither the top nor standard rates of tax have decreased by even a single percentage point.  We live in a society where there are five taxes on work.  In addition to the two tax rates, there is the employment levy, the health levy and PRSI.  We live in a country where work seems to be taxed as if it were a luxury and something we are trying to stop.  We must change our ways and start rewarding effort.  We must start encouraging those who make a contribution to society to see the benefits of their effort.</P>
    <P>Spending this year will rise by 6 per cent, which is over two times the rate of inflation.  This is not justifiable and the proceeds of growth should not be spent on more Government agencies, quangos and task forces.  If there is a lesson we in Ireland must learn it is that throwing money at problems does not solve them.  If the establishment of new agencies and quangoes solved unemployment, there would be none.  There is now a ludicrous situation where in excess of 100 different agencies deal with job creation in the economy.  More people, approximately 4,000, are involved in job creation agencies than in some of our major industries, such as brewing and distilling.  The job creation agencies have become job creators <Col N="399" /> themselves.  In the rush to create jobs in agencies, incentives have been decreased and employers have been penalised.  Many of them now wonder if there is any point taking risks.</P>
    <P>We should consider the contrast, from an employer's point of view, of locating in the Republic as opposed to Northern Ireland in the context of an employer in Dundalk <i>vis-á-vis</i> his counterpart in Newry.  The distance between them may be a mere 12 miles but it is a long way in terms of taxation policy.  The cost to an employer in Northern Ireland of giving his employee extra money in take home pay is 50 per cent less than his counterpart in Dundalk. A worker in Dundalk earning £300 a week is £17 a week less well off than the same worker in Newry.  Irrespective of the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the wage increases it delivers, it will be impossible to give that worker £17 extra unless the issue of taxation is addressed.  This is a small country with a small internal market and we must export at least 70 per cent of what we make.  The more that is made, the more that can be exported and the more people can be employed to make the products.  If the economy is not competitive and Irish companies cannot compete, whether in Northern Ireland, Britain or internationally, they will not be able to sell their products. The consequences will be less employment, less wealth and less growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>We must also realise, as the end of the decade approaches, that Ireland will operate in a very different Europe.  It will extend eastwards and the first five countries expected to join the EU are much poorer than Ireland.  They are all food producing countries and it would cost an extra £10 billion a year to extend CAP eastwards.  Germany, which funds 80 per cent of the bills in the EU, will not fund that type of extension.  Ireland must survive in a European Union from which it receives much less.  At present, in terms of net receipts, Ireland receives £2 billion a year from Europe.  We are <Col N="400" /> the biggest development aid recipient in the world.  This development aid is running out and we must learn to stand on our own two feet and to live within our means; Governments cannot spend money they do not have.</P>
    <P>Given that the national debt will rise this year by £1 billion, it is unjustifiable not to address the fundamental flaws in the economy, such as the fact that it taxes work as if it were a luxury.  The economy does not reward effort and believes the State knows best.  The liberal philosophy of rewarding the individual, of considering the State as one's servant and not one's master, does not dominate the politics and economics of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A different approach is required, particularly in the context of the next election which will be sometime in 1997. There can be no doubt about this because that is the legal limit.  However, if a longer time was available, I am sure the Government would try to hold on as long as possible.  The next election will be about choosing a Government for the next millennium, but the choice will not be between Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil because whatever Government comes into play after the next election will be led by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. The choice will concern the partnership to make up the next Government, a choice between the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party.  However, it is not just a choice between two parties, it is a choice between two different directions.</P>
    <P>If we believe in more quangos, committees and task forces, high tax and that 56 per cent of the marginal earnings of a single worker earning less than the average industrial should be confiscated by the Government, then the choice should be the Labour Party.  However, we should choose the Progressive Democrats if we believe the economy should become one which rewards effort, encourages enterprise and self-reliance to bring out the best in people, which recognises that every individual has talents and resources and is entitled <Col N="401" /> in their community and country to contribute to the development of their society.  If we believe that every individual is entitled to keep more of what they earn and make the decision on how to spend it, even if they make mistakes &mdash; the argument was made during the debate that they would spend it on imports, but, in a civilised, democratic and civilised society, people are entitled to spend their money as they see fit because it is hard-earned &mdash; the choice should be the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>The time has come to move away from the politics of promising people that there is a bottomless pit, that there is a crock of gold and the Government can solve every problem.  We have seen with the publication of the Kelly Fitzgerald report, the hepatitis C débâcle and many other examples, such as the beef tribunal, that the State often has not served its citizens well.  The State has a capacity to be incompetent and action is not taken when that happens. It is not all about spending more money to get the right answer.  It is about decisiveness, leadership and a different direction. It is time the House started to address that different direction because at present 350,000 people in the economy have no real jobs; 285,000 are officially unemployed while the remainder are on Government schemes of one type or another.</P>
    <P>This is not a society which encourages effort and rewards enterprise.  It is not a society which is interested in its own cohesion and fabric.  We must change our economic policies and control Government spending.  We must begin to set aside the national debt by privatising certain key industries and above all else we must decrease the burden of tax on work.  When this is done, there will be a very different type of society. Real political leadership is required to drive the economy.  The people want risk takers and ground breakers, not just handshakers and promise makers.  The people want the successor to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to give dynamic leadership and management to the economy.  If they get it, they <Col N="402" /> will see the fruits of those efforts in more employment, success and a much more dynamic and satisfying economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the 1992 CAP Reform package, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3508/92 established an integrated administration and control system in relation to livestock and arable aid schemes financed partly or totally by the EU.  Articles 2, 4 and 13 of that regulation obliged each member state to put in place by 1 January 1996 an &ldquo;alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels&rdquo;.  The purpose of this is to provide a database whereby each land parcel being declared as forage area or for arable aid can be quickly identified by way of a unique land parcel number; can be located on maps on which its boundaries are drawn; can have the area declared by the applicant cross-checked against the gross area assigned in the database to that parcel; and can be cross-checked also to ensure that part or all of that land parcel is not being declared by any other farmer in the same year.</P>
      <P>This country was obliged, therefore, to undertake a project to put such an identification system for land parcels in place in time for the issue of the 1996 area aid applications.  This project was enormous and complex and involved processing over 250,000 area aid applications and 400,000 maps submitted by farmers in 1994 and 1995; transforming the details of a million plots shown on those maps into land parcels drawn against the background of 24,000 Ordnance Survey map sheets; attributing a new unique land parcel number and gross area to each land parcel so created and printing over 400,000 maps for issue to farmers this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> The time-scale for completing such a large and complex project was remarkably short &mdash; from July 1995 to April 1996.  It has been undertaken on foot of guidance received from the EU Commission and with the advice at each stage of a consultancy firm with expertise in the area of digitising maps.  That so much has been achieved in such a short time is remarkable.  That there are some problems relating to what has been achieved within that time-span is not at all surprising.</P>
    <P>Having set out the background, I will now deal with the specific questions asked by the Deputies.  I will take the issue of the closing date for the receipt of 1996 area aid applications first.  The closing date of 30 April 1996 is set out on the front of each application form; in each accompanying helpsheet; in each accompanying set of terms and conditions; and in recent advertisements in the farming and local press.</P>
    <P>In case any farmer finds it difficult to meet that deadline, however, the Minister has taken two measures to ease the situation.  First, he has arranged for the insertion of a further advertisement in this week's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> and <i>Farm Examiner</i> in which the following relatively simple message to each intending applicant is set out:</P>
    <P>Ensure that your area aid application reaches the area aid unit of the Department on or before Tuesday, 30 April 1996 whether or not it is accompanied by any maps you need to complete for 1996.  We will accept that application provided you forward any maps needed as soon as possible after 30 April.  I would hope that this will enable applicants to lodge their applications on or before 30 April 1996 regardless of any problems they may have with their maps.</P>
    <P>Second, in view of the industrial action by the Civil and Public Services Union which is disrupting work within the Department in relation to 1996 area aid applications, he has directed the <Col N="405" /> Department to seek from the EU Commission an extension of the closing date for receipt of 1996 area aid applications to 15 May 1996, the last date allowed by the relevant EU Regulations.  As Ireland had already obtained an extension to 30 April 1996 from the normal closing date of 31 March, it is by no means certain that the Commission will agree to this request for a further extension. Nevertheless, we shall be making the point that the circumstances we find ourselves in as a result of that industrial action are so exceptional that it is vital that the extension now being requested be given for the sake of both our farmers and the efficient administration of the 1996 area aid applications.</P>
    <P>The next issue I will address is the matter of the alleged confusion and disorganisation in regard to the issue of 1996 area aid documentation.  Undoubtedly what has issued is not perfect.  It could not be in the circumstances.  The extent to which there are complaints should be seen in the following context. What issued for 1996 is based on what farmers sent in for earlier years.  If there were errors or omissions in what some farmers sent in during those years, then I am afraid what has been sent out to the same farmers this year will mirror exactly those errors and omissions.  A quality control sampling exercise carried out by the Department during the last week on what issued to farmers this year has confirmed that the vast majority of maps issued to farmers this year reflected precisely what was on the maps received originally from the farmers to whom those maps issued.  Human nature being what it is, most of the farmers who receive maps with which they are satisfied are not likely to tell us so.  Only those who are unhappy with their maps will bring the matter to our attention.  Thus, the overall picture is distorted because a minority have problems. Furthermore, in this context, I can confirm that all maps due to issue to farmers will have issued this week.</P>
    <P>Of course, those farmers who receive documentation which causes them problems in completing their 1996 area aid <Col N="406" /> applications are entitled to complain if the fault is not theirs and to seek help which will enable them to complete their applications on time.  It was precisely because the Minister anticipated a certain number of problem cases in 1996 that he put in place this year a freephone area aid advice service in the Departments area aid unit, arranged for staff in the Department's local offices to deal with 1996 area aid inquiries at a local level and arranged close liaison with Teagasc so that it could offer farmers any advice needed towards completing their area aid applications accurately and in time.  It is all the more regrettable, therefore, that the CPSU's industrial action has resulted in the freephone service being suspended and in over 80 per cent of the staff in both the area aid unit itself and our local offices not dealing with queries relating to the 1996 area aid applications.</P>
    <P>That is why he has asked the Department to intensify its liaison with Teagasc so that Teagasc can offer its normal advice service in this area as effectively as possible, why he has told farmers they can submit their applications by 30 April without any maps if necessary and why he has sought an extension to the 30 April closing date.  It is also the reason he will take any further steps that appear necessary to him in the light of ongoing developments so that farmers will not have their 1996 livestock or arable aid payments delayed or endangered.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of the contract for digitising maps.  As I have explained already, Ireland, in common with all other member states, was obliged to undertake this by the relevant EU Regulations.  The expertise for such a project was, however, not available within the Department or, indeed, within Ordnance Survey. Because of that, tenders were sought from outside contractors by way of advertisement in the EU's Official Journal in accordance with usual practice. The tenders received were assessed in the normal way and the least costly tender accepted after consultation with the <Col N="407" /> Department of Finance and the EU Commission and after independent consultants had vouched for the technical capacity of the contractor involved.  The overall cost of the contract at present is of the order of about £8 million, close to 25 per cent of which is payable not to the main contractor but to Ordnance Survey for map royalties and photographic services.  Given the fact that livestock and arable aid payments amount to about £650 million a year at present and that the benefits of this contracted expenditure will stretch over the next five to 10 years, the contract amount of just over 1 per cent of one year's total benefit under these schemes is not excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed ten minute reply. Perhaps his Department would bear in mind that time for priority questions is limited and that we try to elicit information from Ministers rather than listen to press releases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view on this matter.  While the Chair has control over Deputies' supplementary questions, he does not have control over Ministers' replies. Members are entitled to the maximum information when Ministers are replying. However, Members from both sides should have regard to the fact that a rigid time factor applies at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Minister of State acknowledges the level of confusion and disorganisation that exists in regard to this scheme and, as it started only recently, the CPSU strike cannot be used as a scapegoat for its maladministration. Does he agree that if there were not a CPSU strike there would still be a level of disorganisation?  The majority of farmers who attend area aid meetings do not have maps, not to mention incorrect ones?  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the level of service from the private company who has obtained a contract to the value of £8 <Col N="408" /> million?  He told us maps will be available to farmers by 25 April at the latest and the closing date for applications is 30 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions warranted a detailed reply.  This is the first time this task has been undertaken.  Furthermore, while I am not blaming the previous Administration, we faced enormous problems when we took office. We put the matter to tender in February and the scheme was up and running by April.  We were faced with the dilemma of ensuring that area aid payments were made to applicants for 1996.  Having regard to the major task with which we were faced, we have done well to get the scheme to this stage.</P>
      <P>In referring to a meeting held in Naas, Andy Doyle stated in this week's <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> that almost two-thirds of those present had all the necessary information and were not experiencing major problems.  In his opinion the job of filling in the form is not as major as the fear of doing so.  The task is not as difficult as it appears.  However, problems will arise because of the maps submitted to us and the mistakes made by the contractor involved.  I hope we learn from our mistakes and process the scheme properly next year.  I accept that there is confusion in some quarters about the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's honest acknowledgement of the concern about the way the matter is being handled.  The Department was notified last July about the difficulties that would arise in administering the scheme, but for some reason neither the Minister nor officials rose to the challenge of ensuring its proper administration and as a result it is necessary to seek a further extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.  We were faced with probably one of the biggest tasks that will ever be undertaken by the Department.  We can resolve the problems that have arisen. <Col N="409" /> We have dealt efficiently with the matter in a very short timespan and advanced the process considerably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>To date a total of 13,019 applicants have been approved for payment of a total of £45.82 million in respect of the REP scheme.  Of this some £29.56 million was paid in 1995, £840,000 in 1994 and the balance in 1996.  The second instalment would normally become due for payment 12 months after the commencement date of the agri-environmental plan.  Due to the high level of deficient plans submitted during the first year of the scheme more detailed checking of applications is now being carried out before first and subsequent payments can be made.  As a result, no second year payments have yet been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's confirmation that not one of the approximate 13,000 second year payments have yet been made.  Does he agree that many farmers have been waiting up to five months for those payments? Will he also confirm that this is an important payment for those involved in non-intensive farming?  In order to delay payment further &mdash; probably due to a lack of funds &mdash; there will be further monitoring of what the Department claims were deficient plans. How many inspections have taken place of those plans?  It is my understanding that no such inspections have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I took over the running of the scheme approximately <Col N="410" /> 300 plans had been approved by the Department and due to a series of public meetings, press advertisements and general promotions, the scheme exceeded all expectations, with the result that approximately 13,000 applicants have been approved.  As a result of the success of the scheme, the monitoring process may not have been adequate.  We examined the normal EU sample of 5 per cent of plans submitted and discovered that some 40 per cent of them were defective.  As a result we had to carry out an overview of the system. The REP scheme is very important, particularly in view of the recent promotion of environmental awareness and practices on farms.  I am sure, therefore, the Deputy would agree that we would not be thanked for putting in place a defective scheme, particularly as farmers have to repay money to the banks. Those who submitted defective plans will have to resubmit plans to ensure they meet with specifications.  Also, in respect of second payments we have asked planners to confirm that farmers comply with their plans and we propose to introduce a number of spot checks on farms before second payments are made.  I hope these spot checks will commence some time during the next two to three weeks.  The money is available and I do not want to hold up payments to these people.  It was important to take an overview of the entire scheme because while it has been successful and the philosophy behind it is good we must ensure that the specifications are complied with, that farmers realise this is not a handout and will have to farm in an environmentally friendly way as required under the REPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister confirmed the importance of the scheme, yet admitted that the resources are totally inadequate in terms of the payments due and the spot checks and monitoring which have been imposed as a further condition for qualification for the second payment.  This is a further indication that the level of administration in <Col N="411" /> the Department is not up to scratch.  It seems the Department supports schemes for which there is not a large take up but that payments are not made in the case of schemes for which there is a demand from the farming community, for example, REPS, the control of farm pollution scheme or other environmental schemes which have been acknowledged by the Minister as important.  In addition, the spot checks announced some time ago have not begun because of a lack of resources and personnel.  Will the Minister agree that it is time certain political decisions were taken and responsibility for the maladministration of the scheme in terms of funding, implementation and administration lies with him and his Department?</P>

We wanted to give the money to the farming community whom we thought would comply with the specification.  However, some farmers did not comply with it.  We were ahead of many other EU countries where it can take up to 14 months for farmers to receive a first payment under environmental schemes.</P>
      <P>I assure the House this scheme will be properly resourced and successful and will have the necessary impact.  I have total confidence in the procedures we are now putting in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 8, 36, 46, 67 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last autumn when the Commission cut export refunds for live cattle and beef to control the level of subsidised exports to comply with GATT limits, the industry has gone through a difficult period.  This difficulty, which manifested itself mainly in tighter margins for winter fatteners, paled in comparison with the fall-out from the BSE <Col N="414" /> crisis which hit the industry at the end of last month and from which it is still trying to recover.  This has been one of the most difficult periods the industry has faced in recent times.</P>
    <P>The response and approach of the Government has been clear, sure and effective.  Consumers have been reassured about the quality of Irish beef and a major diplomatic offensive has been undertaken in the last month to maintain our third country markets.  In addition, the introduction of temporary intervention purchasing to cope with the market consequences of the crisis at the emergency Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on 1-3 April was a major breakthrough.</P>
    <P>The special intervention measures allow for the purchase of 50,000 tonnes of beef for the entire union under the two tenders in April.  However, the restrictions in place for the first tender submitted last week limited the uptake to 10,000 tonnes in the whole European Union with 905 tonnes tendered for in Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, sought a relaxation of the intervention restrictions at both the emergency Council and in direct discussions with Commissioner Fischler, pointing out that for these emergency measures to have the desired effect it was vital that all obstacles were removed.  I am pleased that his efforts contributed to the desired outcome.</P>
    <P>The concessions secured at the Beef Management Committee last week, through the removal of the weight limit restriction along with the widening of the eligible grades to include the very important 04 grade, mean that over 90 per cent of Irish steers will now be eligible for intervention.  I am confident the way is now open for the industry to submit a substantial bid for the second tender on 19 April.</P>
    <P>These intervention measures will give immediate relief to producers who have a substantial backlog of cattle built up over the past three weeks and will also strengthen the market where there is a growing level of commercial activity taking place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> However, intervention measures on their own may not provide the full solution to the problems faced by producers and, in particular, winter fatteners, at this time.  The Minister will, therefore, seek other measures to address income.  These include an increase in export refunds and additional premia.  An important outcome of the emergency Council was that other measures would be considered should the market warrant it.  The Minister will, therefore, put a strong case to the Commission for additional premia when a complete picture of the extent of the losses and the disruption incurred is available.</P>
    <P>Export refunds need to be pitched at levels which allow Irish traders to compete successfully on international markets and give reasonable returns to all sections of the industry.  In the current situation where a number of important third country outlets are closed and where EU imports are reduced because of the BSE scare, our first priority should be to secure the reopening of these markets.  Once that happens the Minister will put further pressure on the Commission to increase refunds to realistic levels.</P>
    <P>One of the first casualties of the BSE scare was the almost total cessation of live exports to third countries.  Following Government and EU intervention, the Egyptian market is now open again for Irish cattle and beef and the Minister, Deputy Yates, will travel to Libya shortly to seek the reopening of the important trade with that country.</P>
    <P>The BSE scare has been all-embracing in its effects with every sector of the beef industry and ancillary industries experiencing some difficulties.  As pointed out by the Deputy, transport companies is one of the areas affected. However, the market is improving steadily and it is expected that the industry will return to normal patterns very quickly.  Under the new intervention arrangements, whereby boning must be completed in a different premises that that in which the cattle were <Col N="416" /> slaughtered, transport companies will be provided with additional business which should compensate for reductions in haulage activities incurred since the scare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that 905 tonnes is of no use to anyone and that the measure will be of no value unless the figure is 20 times greater?  Will he further agree it is totally ridiculous that the reductions in the export refunds during the latter part of last year and early this year are continuing and this is creating difficulties in the short-term disposal of the surplus cattle now available?  Will he deal with the point I made last night on the orders made by the British Government limiting access to its market?  Under the recent regulations made by Mr. Hogg it seems a substantial proportion of the Irish beef normally sent to Britain is precluded from entry to that market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that 950 tonnes was not sufficient and that is why the Minister went back to the Commission seeking an improvement in the conditions. Now almost all our steers will qualify because of the removal of the weight restriction.  That was an important development and we should recognise the Minister's achievement.</P>
      <P>As regards the refunds, the most important thing at this stage is to open third markets and then make a case for the refunds.  Refunds are down substantially on the level this time last year, although they picked up somewhat because of pressure from the Minister. We have a battle to fight but it is important that we first open third markets. We succeeded in opening the Egyptian market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my information, An Bord Bia is not yet concerned about the new regulations imposed by the British and believes they will not affect Irish beef exports to Britain.  I have asked for further information on this point which the Deputy made last night because it would be very serious if exports were <Col N="417" /> affected.  I will seek clarification on whether what the Deputy has said is true and I will come back to him on that.  From my initial inquiries today, An Bord Bia believes the regulations will not impact on beef exports at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that it is only as a result of the technical committee that what can be termed as an emergency intervention scheme has been brought forward, whereas the scheme agreed to by the Minister at the Council of Minister's meeting has proved to be of no use?  As regards the 950 tonnes, can the Minister confirm that was an application for bone in meat only and not for boneless meat, mainly because the Department failed to successfully negotiate with the Department of Finance to come up with a realistic deboning allowance similar to the 15.2p per lb. available in the UK?  Our processors looked for 13.2p per lb. but only 8.1p per lb. has been made available by the Department.  Does that not indicate that the Department had possibilities within its remit to make even the first intervention tender more attractive but failed to do so?  Will the Minister accept that some of the responsibility lies with him in ensuring that the boneless factor was not part of the tender because the deboning allowance was so unrealistic? Will the Minister indicate if meat inspection fees might be waived for processors to alleviate current problems?  In view of everything that has happened so far, will the Minister indicate what the price level is likely to be?  Can the Minister confirm that even if it is 97p per lb., which is the most optimistic amount in the public domain, it will still mean losses of £150 per head for the winter fatteners?</P>

The Deputy hardly expects me to pre-empt the Minister and announce the expected tender prices today since they are expected tomorrow.  I hope they will be as good as possible, that it will take the surplus cattle ready for slaughter off the market and will alleviate the problem to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said his preliminary inquiries indicate there are no grounds for concern as far as our market in Britain is concerned.  How can he reconcile that with the British not allowing any beef for human consumption, whether from Britain, Ireland and any other EU country, that has more than two permanent incisor teeth at the time of slaughter, which means the animal is more than two and a half years old?  Will the Minister agree that the bulk of the beef we traditionally sent to Britain would have been that age or more, particularly cow beef which, by definition, would be that age?  Given that meat from the countries I listed last night is exempted from that prohibition, will the Minister agree it would be a cause for concern if the bulk of our exports were blocked off from what is the most important individual export destination for our beef?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be concerned if we were blocked off because Britain is our main export destination. While I will investigate further, the information I have suggests that it will <Col N="419" /> not affect our beef exports to Britain to a great extent.  If this has major implications, I will come back to the Deputy on the matter.  While we export cow beef to Britain, much of the beef we export is young beef.  The quality of the beef we export is beyond question, especially to the multiples who insist on a quality Irish product and will not accept an inferior one.  They are now suggesting that beef will be branded as Irish.  The goodwill in the English market towards Irish beef should ensure that exports are not affected.  I regard what the Deputy said as quite serious, but it has not been brought to my attention as posing another difficulty for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there are two serious problems which are consequential on each other? The first problem is price levels for cattle and the second is that cattle must be held because of the price and that feed is a problem in that regard.  Does the Minister accept his Department's figures that £1.06p per lb. is a break even price for a finished steer?  He will be aware that 92p per lb. is being paid at present.  That means that a finisher is losing at least £100 per head.  What are the favourable results to which the Minister referred?  I do not know whom the Minister thinks he is fooling, but he is not fooling the primary producer who is losing heavily.</P>
      <P>On the question of export refunds, little or no impression has been made to date.  Is the Minister going to seek an increase in export refunds or a reintroduction of what we had before, in view of the terrible difficulties we are experiencing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to a conclusion. BSE is probably the biggest problem in farming circles today.  As a producer I cannot say often enough that our product is clean and can be laid on any table at any time.  Will the Minister <Col N="420" /> agree that what contributed to our serious problems was that the Minister did not react soon enough with a statement of conviction when the scare struck?  It is typical of the Minister that he waited to see which way the wind was blowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unprecedented crisis for the beef industry and, unfortunately, it is inevitable that people will suffer, irrespective of who is Minister.  We had a major task.  First we had to differentiate between ourselves and the UK and demonstrate that we had better measures for controlling BSE, etc.  The Minister did that.  His next task was to restore consumer confidence, and recent opinion polls suggest that confidence in Irish beef is returning, that people are beginning to eat it not only at home but abroad.  I went to Sweden two weeks ago.  The Swedish retail and wholesale sectors openly supported the Irish product on television, and the Swedes are probably the most discerning consumers in Europe and perhaps in the world.  Our beef exports to Sweden have increased from £11 million in 1994 to £19 million in 1995 and are growing.  That is an endorsement of our product.  It is the type of restoration of confidence in our product that we need.</P>
      <P>Also, we had to get excess beef off the market, and we succeeded in reintroducing intervention.  Now we must open up third markets and the Minister is doing that this week.  Finally, we will have to introduce other measures to support farmers who are suffering.  It is hoped that we can extend the DSP and there may be scope for a top-up premium or some form of aid for those farmers who are now threatened with extinction.  We have to fight that battle in Europe.  All the stages I have referred to had to be gone through before we could get to that point.  I share the Deputy's concern.  I am not trying to pretend that it will be easy, far from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for making a point I have been making in <Col N="421" /> Private Members' business over the past two nights, that it is only when someone like himself goes to Sweden to reassure people face to face that results are seen and that the consumers there realise that what he has to say stands up.  The problem has been that for almost a month we, who are the biggest exporters of beef in the northern hemisphere, have not sent a political person, with the exception of the Minister's trip to Sweden, to speak to the consumers of 80 countries to tell them that our beef is clean.  Prior to the recent visits the perception abroad has been that the British situation is in some way related to the Irish because of the problems between the North and South of this country.  It is precisely this type of wide-ranging political initiative by the Minister that is required to shore up the beef industry. We wish him well on what is a limited tour at this stage.  He would do well to go to all of those countries.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not in this country's interests that some Government representatives should seek to regard one market as less important than another?  Would the Minister agree that the purpose of these measures must be not only to open up markets but to make them fully functional and that that might be done more quickly by the Minister's physical presence and that of his colleague?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of steps, which I outlined, had to be taken.  The Minister has gone out to the marketplace and will visit Spain, Italy and Libya this week.  I will be going shortly to Russia, which is a very important market.  Initially we took a diplomatic offensive.  Our ambassadors went out and reassured not only our markets in Europe but also third countries that we have a distinctive product, and we have succeeded.  The only EU beef banned within the internal market was British. Through the efforts of the Taoiseach, we have succeeded in opening up the Egyptian market, which is the most important of the third markets.  There <Col N="422" /> are positive signs from other third markets also.  The last time the Iranian market closed to us, it took some years to open it up again.  I am convinced that it will not take years on this occasion but a matter of weeks or months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU budgetary allocation for the top-up ewe premium to Irish sheep producers in the non-disadvantaged areas, agreed at the December 1995 meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers, has recently been provided.  Payment of the premium, however, requires the preparation of specific legislation by the EU Commission.  The work on finalising the necessary regulation is in progress, and I have been assured by the Commission that the final document has been presented to the European Parliament and that it will be presented to the <Col N="423" /> Council of Ministers as quickly as possible. I hope that the Council will adopt the proposal without delay, after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received.  Payment will then be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  There is a process that must be gone through. This was a concession made to Ireland, not to any other country, and consists of a contribution similar to the rural world premium of about £5.50 per ewe for non-disadvantaged areas.  A regulation must be put in place to ensure payment. When that is done, and we have been assured that it will be done as quickly as possible, payment will be made.  I hope this payment will be made by June or July.  Fortunately, the Deputy will not have to table another Private Members' Motion on sheep farmers for some time. They are doing very well at the moment.</P>

      <P>Some time the Deputy may understand the processes through which such a decision must go within the European Parliament, when he will readily appreciate what is involved.  For example, legislation will have to be framed to make this very special contribution to Ireland &mdash; very hard won by the Minister at the time &mdash; which will be made as soon as possible.  I have no <Col N="424" /> doubt farmers will welcome this special premium when they receive it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>An in-depth study on the food industry was published in April 1993 by the Expert Group on the Food Industry, established following the recommendations of the Culliton report on industrial policy.</P>
      <P>One of the expert group's principal recommendations was the need for competitiveness in terms of cost, innovation, marketing and product quality. It recommended that a single operational programme for the food industry covering all the elements essential to competitiveness should be co-ordinated by my Department.  As a result, a sub-programme for the food industry was incorporated in the <i>Operational Programme for Industry 1994-1999.</i> The sub-programme envisages a total investment of £641 million of which £283 million will be contributed from the national Exchequer and the EU Structural Funds.  The measures in it were: capital investment grants; assistance for in-company and institutional research and development; training assistance and assistance for marketing and promotion.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the publication of the sub-programme, An Bord Bia, Teagasc and Forbairt drew up and published five year development plans consistent with the sub-programme.  These plans incorporate detailed arrangements for the implementation of the measures set out in the sub-programme.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the very competitive trading environment in which the food industry is operating.  I am satisfied, however, that the necessary measures are in place to enable companies not only to meet the competitive challenges but to continue to develop and to expand employment.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the many difficulties our exporters face, especially those to the United Kingdom.  While acknowledging that the Minister established the <Col N="426" /> poultry industrial forum early in 1995&mdash; whose report I understand has been on his desk since the beginning of March &mdash; central to it there was to have been a detailed study of the differential in feed costs.  On Tuesday last I tabled a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach seeking under two headings the price of broilers and turkeys in European Union member states.  His reply contained information in respect of eight countries, but none in respect of the most relevant, the United Kingdom, in respect of which departmental studies had been undertaken over an 18 months period, and on which I have not been able to obtain any from the Department.  How can the Minister of State explain that at a time when the industry is experiencing such difficulty?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to exports to the United Kingdom, I agree that difficulties have been experienced because of the strength of our punt versus sterling, which have created problems for many exporters in the Deputy's constituency, particularly those in the mushroom sector, who enjoyed a very competitive advantage up to 1990 when <Col N="427" /> the punt stood at approximately 88p or 90p against the pound sterling.  The reverse is now the case so that, for every 1p differential, we lose something like 6p in price.  As I said in my reply, I hope the £641 million available under the sub-programme will make us more competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> our managerial structures, plant, research and development and training which, while not warranting perhaps the same degree of urgency, are all important.  I am convinced that, on the expiry of this programme in 1999, Irish industry will be much more competitive, that, in the interim, problems being encountered by some exporters to the United Kingdom will have been more than compensated for by improvements in their overall operations.  If the figures the Deputy has requested in respect of poultry are available, I will endeavour to obtain them for him.  He will realise that the Minister established the poultry forum but I can request that its report be published as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that none of the £641 million is being siphoned off to those in real need to alleviate their problems over the past six months, particularly those in the mushroom industry, many of whom have gone out of business?</P>
      <P>Since the Minister based his reply on a report published in April 1993, I must draw his attention to the fact that there is no comparision between the system of trading then and now as currency fluctuations over the past six months, feed prices, transport costs and the like have eroded the competitive edge.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that markets built up assiduously and carefully over a long period and the jobs of primary producers will not be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's comments.  With regard to the restoration of a concession like the marketing fund established in 1992, the Deputy will be aware that its beneficiaries are <Col N="428" /> now being requested to reimburse such grants on the basis that the fund was anti-competition and not in conformity with EU regulations.  Therefore, we must be very careful even in directly assisting some exporters at present experiencing difficulties because of the differential between the Irish punt and sterling.</P>
      <P>The Expert Group on the Food Industry was established following a recommendation in the Culliton report, and advocated the implementation of a special programme to help the food industry, leading eventually to the establishment of the £641 million sub-programme. If that programme is not successful and warrants further review, that can be considered but, three years after the production of an excellent report by the expert group, is too early for such review.  However, because of the changed circumstances that have arisen since 1993.  I take on board what the Deputy said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister recognises the potential difficulties &mdash; particularly those arising from the differential between the punt and the pound sterling &mdash; what initiatives have been taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to support the food sector, particularly mushrooms and poultry producers, throughout the difficulties of the past 12 months?  Has the Department made representations to the Minister for Finance? He has the power to take initiatives to make the industry more competitive, particularly in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our response was through An Bord Bia.  We have a marketing fund that is available to companies to improve market penetration in Britain and other countries which is working quite successfully.  Our exports of various food commodities are up in Europe and outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained already, a similar fund to the market support fund of 1992 would not be acceptable because the <Col N="429" /> people who received that money have encountered problems.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget, the Minister for Finance reduced the employers' PRSI contributions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The concessions last year and this year have made a significant difference.  For example, what it meant to Kerry Ingredients in the Kerry Group, the food industry closest to my constituency, is that they could take on 12 more employees last summer and I hope this year's concession will help further.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we must put in place, whether through budgetary concessions or other assistance, initiatives to help them, otherwise they will go out of business.  Our approach is to provide money for a marketing fund to increase market penetration and provide the resources to sell their product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that other organisations such as the Irish Veterinary Union, which is not part of the central review committee representation, is represented on the TB forum? Will he confirm that membership of the central review committee is not a prerequisite for membership of the TB forum?  That being the case, what is the reason that ICSA &mdash; which is very involved with the question of TB &mdash; is not represented on the forum?  Will he <Col N="430" /> confirm that the reason it is not represented is not because of a threat of withdrawal by other farm organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Veterinary Union, the Irish Veterinary Association and the Irish Veterinary Officers Association have an association with the Irish Congress of Trade Union, a participant of the central review committee, and that is why they are on the forum. The reason the United Farmers Association is excluded is that it has not participated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> If it becomes a participant in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; and this was not drawn up in my time &mdash; it would be welcome to become involved in any activities.</P>
      <P>I have always entertained the United Farmers Association and any time it sought a meeting with my officials or me it was slotted in with a week's notice.  I would not like to give the impression that the United Farmers Association was excluded from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It was not.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy welcomes the setting up of the forum.  I heard him call for its establishment.  It is good to see everybody around the table discussing the problem and I hope we will find the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I tabled the question is that everybody is not around the table.  I suggest the reason being given for not having everyone who represents farmers on the TB forum is spurious, that is their non-membership or their non-associate membership of the central review committee.  Will the Minister agree that membership or non-membership of the central review committee has nothing to do with qualifications or expertise as members of the TB forum?  Will he further agree that the only criteria for representation on the TB forum should be that the organisation is representative of people who are involved in the industry and have a <Col N="431" /> knowledge as to how we can solve the TB problem?</P>
      <P>The Minister quite rightly made it clear that in his view everybody involved should be represented on the TB forum.  Will he undertake to take this up with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to ensure that not just UFA but the ICSA will be there also since veterinarians and other farm organisations are represented? We do not need party political bickering in farmer politics to get in the way of what is required -that is everybody around the table giving his constructive views on the matter.</P>

      <P>While the existing legal basis for the EU milk quota regime extends to the year 2000, the European Commission has indicated that a review of quota and related price policy will begin in 1997.  I have already indicated in the Council of Ministers that I favour early consideration of the future dairy policy regime, so that our dairy farmers and the industry generally will be in a position to plan for the future.</P>
      <P>By way of preparation for such discussions at EU level, I have already set up a high level group broadly representative of the industry to work with my Department in considering the dairy policy options best suited to Ireland's future needs.  In this context, the B quota idea will obviously be looked at, as will other possible adaptations to the existing dairy regime.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of this work by advocating any particular policy change at this stage. Following the work of the high level group I hope to be able to put forward ideas to the Commission to be taken into account in the review to which I have referred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What plans does the Department have to deal with that matter and when can we expect to see an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages associated with abolishing the system given <Col N="439" /> that we are in a position to produce milk far more efficiently than practically any other country because of our grassland-based system?</P>

      <P>As the milk quota system is due to be reviewed by the EU in 1997, we will have to be ready.  The process is ongoing.  There has been speculation that by the end of the year 2000 there will not be quotas and beef exports to third countries will not be subsidised.  All these matters will have to be considered in a major review of the milk quota system.  It is recognised that this is necessary because people are suffering.  They are unable to expand, to produce more and are being penalised. The system has worked from the point of view of price, but expansion has been curtailed.</P>

      <P>In the event of the quota system being retained, will the Minister of State ensure that priority is given to small dairy holders, particularly those dependent on a proper quota to ensure viability?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing policy favours smallholders.  As Deputy O'Hanlon is aware, under the dairy investment programme a 60 per cent grant is available to suppliers with quotas less than 15,000 <Col N="440" /> gallons.  Under the special subsidy restructuring scheme 75p per gallon is available to suppliers with quotas of less than 22,000 gallons.  I agree with the Deputy that as smallholders with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons are under most threat, they should receive preferential treatment under any future EU policy.  I will make this point strongly to the expert group.</P>
      <P>I do not have the names of the members of the group, but will supply them to Deputy Ellis.  It will have to report soon otherwise we will not be ready when the system is reviewed by the EU in 1997.  I hope it will report by the end of the year, although a specific date has not been set.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Social Welfare Bill, this Bill will give effect to the changes announced in the budget last February.  Since then Fianna Fáil has tried to square an individious circle of its own making.  Its response can be summed up as follows: on the one hand, the Government is not spending enough, on the other, it is spending too much, and where will it all end?</P>
      <P>I felt a slight twinge of nostalgia earlier this week when Deputy Charlie McCreevy pledged that Fianna Fáil would abolish residential property tax. This is the same party which, from the safety of the Opposition benches in 1985, stated that it was &ldquo;totally opposed to the system of service charges and on return to office we will abolish those charges&rdquo;.  The rest is history.  When returned to the Government benches the charges remained largely unaltered until Democratic Left entered Government and obtained not alone tax relief measures, but legislation delimiting the powers of local authorities to arbitrarily disconnect householders for the nonpayment of service charges &mdash; so much for Fianna Fáil rhetoric.  On ground rent, water charges and now residential property tax, the ambition of the grand abolitionists is matched only by their inaction when in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democratic Left is not against property taxes.  On the contrary, the taxation of property above a certain value is a legitimate source of State revenue. Handled properly, property taxes can be a far more effective and equitable method of raising revenue than the traditional system of taxing earned income <Col N="513" /> and work.  However, the residential property tax is not a tax on property but on the family home.  In recent years the residential property tax saga has been handled with mind boggling incompetence, has militated against Dubliners and, with developments in the property market, it is likely to impact soon on residents in Cork and Limerick.  I agree with my colleagues, be they Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats, Labour of Fine Gael Deputies, when they highlight the anti-Dublin bias inherent in the property tax as currently constituted.  House prices in Dublin rose by 10 per cent in the past six months and by 15 per cent in the six months prior to that.  Many modest three bedroom semi-detached houses in Dublin will soon be within the tax threshold.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an immediate end to taxation of the family home. However, in proposing to abolish property tax, I note Deputy McCreevy shied away from exploring the need to tax other forms of property.  I regret that the Minister did not seize the opportunity this year to subject property tax to radical surgery.  I hope this issue will be addressed in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen adopted a slightly different stance from his rediscovered Fianna Fáil colleagues.  While he may have shaken off the Progressive Democrats Whip, like his erstwhile comrades he is unwilling to give Thatcherism a decent burial.  Just like the twin ghosts of Christmases past, he and Deputy McDowell linger at the wake muttering wistfully about the good old days when right-wingers everywhere believed in rising tides, floating boats and cabbage patches.  I envy Deputies McDowell and Cullen their touching faith in the old recipes.  Looking at areas such as those in my constituency where thousands of people have found their boats are beached in the midst of an economic boom I only wish the Progressive Democrats recipe and dream had worked.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's contribution was yet another indication of his party's <Col N="514" /> paucity of ideas.  He acknowledged that there was nothing new about what he had to say.  In refusing to acknowledge the real benefits this Government has brought to those living on social welfare or low pay he retreated into the Thatcherite womb.  His message can be summarised as follows: cut taxes, cut spending and abandon the semi-State sector. Most would agree that creed of selfishness is not new.  It was tried in America and in Tory Britain and resulted in spiralling poverty levels, reduced services and increased social divisions. Democratic Left is determined to ensure that the Progressive Democrats Party never has a chance to impose its &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; philosophy on the people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in recent years Ireland has had to contend with the modern day phenomenon of &ldquo;jobless growth&rdquo;. Record levels of jobs were created in 1995 but they tend to pass the long-term unemployed by.  The measures promised in the budget and in the Social Welfare Bill and Finance Bill are unashamedly interventionist.  We make no apology for that.  Intervention is necessary to ensure that all share the benefits of economic growth equally and that the long-term unemployed are brought in from the economic and social margins. The elimination of tax anomalies and poverty traps is vital if people are to be encouraged not only to create jobs but to take up employment.  The Social Welfare Bill dealt comprehensively with many of the poverty traps inherent in the social welfare system and the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, is to be congratulated on his innovative measures such as the retention of the child dependant allowance for a period after taking up work and the phased retention of other secondary benefits such as the medical card for those leaving the ranks of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The increase in personal tax allowances and the adjustment in allowances for single parents compliment the measures in the Social Welfare Bill. Deputies opposite have been vocal in their concern, which I share, for the <Col N="515" /> hard-pressed PAYE sector.  It has been substantially addressed by the PAYE and PRSI changes in the Bill and by some of the changes made in the Social Welfare Bill.  However, they are less vocal on the issue of the ongoing inequities between farmers, the self-employed and PAYE workers.  The some Deputies who bemoan the anti-Dublin bias of the residential property tax have been strangely silent with regard to the ongoing feather bedding of this country's rich ranchers.  It is an issue few politicians are prepared to tackle head on.  Unlike the long-term unemployed eking out a precarious existence in urban blackspots, large farmers are effective, articulate, well-funded and politically well represented in this House.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies seeking to make short-term political gain out of the PAYE sector may be interested in some facts.  In 1994, income tax paid on farming profits amounted to 1.8 per cent of all income tax receipts.  In 1995, the average tax payment made by PAYE workers amounted to a staggering £4,087, nearly three times the average tax take from farmers which stood at £1,031.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I was intrigued to discover that last year 25 random audits were carried out on the self-employed, including farmers.  Of these, five or 20 per cent, yielded an additional tax liability. It does not take great mathematical skills to extrapolate these figures for the tax paying population as a whole and to envisage the extra revenue which could be realised were farmers and the self-employed pursued more vigorously by the Revenue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures in the Finance Bill to consolidate the tax system and to make the revenue collection maze slightly more penetrable for the ordinary citizen.  I regret that the area of farm tax was not addressed more rigorously and, indeed, I get the impression that the Bill contains yet more sweeteners for large farmers.  I have in mind <Col N="516" /> section 10 which increases by one-third the exemption derived from certain leases of farmland and section 11 which enables stock to be transferred at book rather than market value for the purposes of the EU early retirement scheme.  Chapter 11 of the Bill consolidated rather than revisited the myriad measures relating to stock relief.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left will support any measures designed to improve living standards for the 23 per cent of farmers who, in 1987, struggled to subsist on household incomes of £5,000 or less. However, our tax system should not be used to further maximise the benefits already derived by large farmers from the plethora of featherbedding schemes.</P>
    <P>This Bill, like its 1995 predecessor, represents a substantial improvement for those at the lower end of the income scale.  However, it does not go far enough.  It addresses some of the ills but not the central planks of our taxation system.  A fair tax system should treat all income in the same way.  Any exceptions to that should be aimed at securing a few clearly defined objectives: protecting those on lower incomes; redistributing income and encouraging productive enterprise.  However, a careful cost benefit analysis of any exceptions should be carried out before they are implemented.  A good tax system should strike a careful balance between four objectives which may often appear to be in conflict.  It must be fair in the way it collects revenue &mdash; it must take similar amounts from people and corporate bodies with similar resources; it must redistribute income wealth and work; it must collect sufficient revenue for the Government to pay for things that are socially necessary and it must serve the economic objective of encouraging enterprise and job creation.  Our taxation system falls far short of these objectives. I hope when the working group on the integration of tax and social welfare reports its recommendations will enable us to eliminate some of the present anomalies.  Despite the welcome changes introduced in this year's <Col N="517" /> budget, the dole is still more profitable for some people than going to work.</P>
    <P>The budget presented this year is the second in a package of three.  I am confident that when the Government comes to an end in 18 months' time the remaining poverty traps and disincentives will have been eliminated and the progress already made will have been consolidated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contribution to the debate.  I hope in the time available to me to deal with a number of issues, otherwise I will deal with them on Committee Stage.  Much comment was made on tax reform.  This was a theme which was taken up in several interventions with calls for further, more extensive and radical reform.  Some comments naturally sought to understate or minimise what has been achieved by this Government.</P>
      <P>On the general tax improvements being enacted in this Bill, it is worth pointing out that the increase in personal allowances, exemption limits and the standard band at 5.5 per cent or more is twice the expected rate of inflation, and represents a significant real increase in tax relief.  Over the past two budgets combined, for example, the standard income tax band has been widened by £1,200 in the case of a single person and by £2,400 for a married couple.  This is an increase of close to 15 per cent, an amount which more than compensates for the reduction in mortgage interest and VHI reliefs.  This year's budget continues the trend of reducing the tax and PRSI burden as a percentage of income, especially in the case of the lower paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year I focused tax resources on the low paid through taxation changes but more especially through increasing the PRSI-free allowance from £50 per week to £80 per week for full rate contributions and by £10 to £20 per week for other categories of PRSI contributors. This has yielded further real increases in take home pay for persons on low incomes.  If we look at the period <Col N="518" /> of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the percentage increase in take home pay for a single industrial worker on £9,000 gross pay in 1993 has increased by 14.6 per cent when the tax changes and basic pay increases under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are taken into account.  In the case of a single person on the average industrial wage the percentage increase is much the same.  For a family with one earner and two children the corresponding percentage increase at £9,000 is 16 per cent and at the average industrial wage it is just under 13 per cent.  These increases are in all cases significantly ahead of inflation.  For those further up the earnings scale the corresponding increases are not less than 12 per cent. The middle and higher income groups have also benefited from these tax and PRSI changes, though in terms of percentage of gross pay the benefits have been slightly lower.</P>
    <P>Tax reform and reduction extends beyond personal taxation.  Over the last two budgets, the Government has reduced the standard rate of corporation tax to 38 per cent and is introducing a new lower rate of 30 per cent on the first £50,000 of income taxed at the standard rate.  There have also been reductions in the standard and lower rates of employers' PRSI and increases in the range of income to which the lower rates apply.  Obviously, I would wish to do more and it will be my goal to continue to expand reliefs generally as resources allow, but it is not accurate to decry the absence of tax reform as some speakers did, and those Deputies are not here now to hear the reply.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies questioned the Government's commitment to controlling public expenditure.  Deputy McCreevy referred to current unprecedented growth in public expenditure. I have been over this ground in the House many times but let me repeat that the Government remains firmly committed to the fiscal policy parameters set out in its programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which were developed specifically to guide our <Col N="519" /> budgetary approach in the period up to 1997.  The 2 per cent real ceiling on current supply services spending is a demanding target particularly when viewed against the much higher rates of real increase in such spending in recent years.  The average annual real increase in gross current supply services spending between 1991 and 1994 was 6 per cent approximately.  What has been achieved already is a more restrained and controlled growth in public expenditure. It is not out of control as some seek to portray.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy stated that under the present tax system more than 50 per cent of a single person's wages is taken by the State in tax and PRSI even though they earn less than the average industrial wage.  In fact the average tax and PRSI take on these employees is much less &mdash; around 25 per cent, not 50 per cent.  Deputy McCreevy also criticised the non-renewal of the annual £140 PRSI income tax allowance since this allowance benefited the lower paid. I remind the House that the non-renewal of this allowance forms part of a package which included the introduction of a new PRSI-free allowance.  This PRSI-free allowance, which was introduced last year, now stands at £80 per week in the case of full rate PRSI contributors.</P>
    <P>The measure, on its own, is worth up to £228.80 per annum, or £4.40 per week, to such workers.  When combined with the non-renewal of the PRSI income tax allowance, it still results in significant net gains, especially for those on lower incomes.  For example, low income workers exempted from income tax or on marginal relief enjoy the full relief of £228.80 as they did not benefit from the PRSI income tax allowance in the first place.  The net gains can be up to £152 per annum, or £2.92 per week, for those on the standard income tax rate, and up to £92 per annum for those on the top tax rate.</P>
    <P>The combined package clearly gives great relief to those on lower pay, which was not the case with the PRSI income <Col N="520" /> tax allowance.  It is a targeted tax relief to assist the exposed competitive sector of the economy who had come to me on a number of occasions asking for some form of relief to alleviate the difficulties they experienced with the upward valuation of the Irish pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling. It gives that specific relief in a targeted way and also has the benefit of taking, in part, another burden off the low paid in the services sector, in the sheltered part of the economy.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and the difficulties this can throw up for those on lower incomes either moving into employment or seeking to improve their net take home pay while in work.  I share the frustration with these problems and the difficulties in effectively remedying them.  I would remind Deputies, however, that these problems did not arise overnight.  They result from individual policies applied over the past 20 years or more &mdash; policies which are entirely supportable in themselves, such as improving out of work benefits and removing the low paid from the tax net altogether, but whose interaction can lead to the sort of results referred to.  In my two budgets I have introduced a number of measures to help alleviate the problem.  These measures included the general improvements in tax and PRSI and special provisions designed specifically to ease the transition from unemployment to work. The latter includes increases in the income limits applying to the family income supplement, the retention of child dependant allowances by the long-term unemployed for 13 weeks on taking up employment, and the retention of the medical card by the long-term unemployed for three years on returning to work.  The retention of child dependant allowances is specifically designed to improve the take-up of FIS, thereby building a bridge between unemployment and employment.  The problem is one we will have to work at solving over a period of time.  The final report of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare, to <Col N="521" /> which Deputy Byrne referred, is expected shortly.  I hope the group can provide us with a strategy to tackle the problem within a reasonable timeframe, but it will not be easy as the matter is immensely complex.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy made a general point about who proposes Finance Act changes.  I would have thought that for Deputy McCreevy who has experience of Cabinet and has been a member of a parliamentary party for the same length of time as I, certainly since 1977, such a question would have been entirely rhetorical, and no doubt it was.  He referred in particular to the stamp duty provisions on CREST, tax relief for mail order operations in Shannon, qualification for CGT 27 per cent relief, tax relief for mining rehabilitation and the renewal of relief for Enterprise Trust Limited.  There is nothing unusual or sinister about any of these changes.  In the case of CREST, the changes are necessary to ensure that the stamp duty yield is maintained and that we can levy stamp duty on electronic transfers of shares.  The same argument applies to the extra increase in ATM cards because of the fall off in the usage of personal cheques, which had a stamp duty.  Such provisions were promoted by the Revenue.  In that instance, we were happy to respond because it could measure the drop in the yield from the conventional form of stamp revenue.</P>
    <P>In the case of mail order operations in Shannon, this was the result of trying to attract such operations to locate there with obvious employment benefits.  In the case of CGT and mining reliefs, these are measures announced in the budget.  The mining relief arises from last year's report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group.  The relief for Enterprise Trust Limited is a rolling forward for a further year of relief first given in 1992.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the welcome afforded to the proposed consolidation of the income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax legislation next year.  I am most anxious, as I indicated in my opening remarks, to ensure that the <Col N="522" /> consolidation Bill, when published, is fully understood by the legislators who will have to consider it.  There will be a special seminar and workshop on the Bill to be held by the Revenue later this year.  In my opening speech, I gave an invitation to the Members opposite, and from all sides of the House, to attend that seminar.  I also sought to ensure that sufficient notice of the preconsolidation changes in this year's Finance Bill would be brought to the attention of the Deputies by having the relevant sections published in full with a detailed explanatory memorandum on 5 March, nearly a month before the Finance Bill itself was published.  When that consolidated legislation is in place, it can be updated each year.  We can then proceed from this time next year with a continuously upgraded Finance Bill that will, in respect of those taxation measures, be an upgrading of the one finance legislation.  This will make the value of the consolidation work extremely useful for practitioners and the general public.</P>
    <P>I am aware that my proposals in the budget to come up with a better way to deal with pre-budget submissions has caused disappointment to some lobby groups.  This is based largely on a misunderstanding and misapprehension of what was suggested.  It was skilfully and politically exploited to the full by Deputies who have a well tuned and applied skill for doing this.  However, it was mischief-making of the highest order and the Deputies who engaged in it knew exactly what they were doing.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements I suggested, which involve the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs hearing submissions, are not intended to isolate me from meeting interest groups.  I am still available to meet the social partners, and do so on a current, regular and ongoing basis, but the proposals I have in mind will provide a full, open, transparent and constructive way in which to examine pre-budget submissions.</P>
    <P>The numbers of pre-budget submissions have grown exponentially in recent years.  The submission is sent into <Col N="523" /> the Department and it is analysed by a number of staff at considerable length. These groups then have private meetings with the Minister seeking concessions on a raft of areas related to their particular lobby groups' interest. There is no way in which I, as Minister, can question why they should get such concessions.  The dialogue is in private. it is a one way listening exercise because I cannot query what the taxpayer might get from these special concessions. Therefore, from the points of view of time, staff efficiency and, most importantly, democratic accountability, any lobby group seeking tax concessions and making a case for getting special treatment against the interests of the taxpayer should first be able to put their case in public and be heard to do so. More importantly, Deputies from all sides can, in the Select Committee on the Finance and General Affairs, put questions to that group, ask why these concessions should be granted and query their value to the overall benefit of the common good.  I make no apology to anybody in putting that suggestion forward.</P>
    <P>I will, of course &mdash; and I said this in my budget speech &mdash; continue to meet with the social partners and the major interests represented in the social partnership structure to ensure they have a clear intervention as far as pre-budget submissions are concerned.  However, I meet such groups regularly throughout the year when aspects relating to expenditure and taxation are frequently the subject of conversation.  While the way in which this issue was exploited by some Deputies might have been fair in the political process as practised in this Chamber, it was clearly and utterly misleading.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy made several observations on particular sections of the Bill and put down markers for certain amendments.  I will be happy to take up these points on Committee Stage.  However, he wondered why it was necessary to confirm the provisions <Col N="524" /> implementing the second VAT simplification directive in primary law and asked if this meant that regulations already made or adopted were flawed. The provisions are being incorporated in the Bill on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman who feels that such statutory confirmation represents best legal practice.  The regulations already in place implement only the strict requirements of the directive.  The Bill confirms these provisions and, in addition, makes the necessary technical tidying up changes to the VAT Act itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen asked why the seaside resort scheme is being restructured.  In fact, the changes refer only to one aspect of the scheme relating to holiday cottages and apartments.  The changes are designed to redress the balance in terms of relief for these types of developments as opposed to other types of project which would benefit seaside resorts, such as non-accommodation tourist amenities.  It is not unusual to fine tune reliefs in any scheme over the course of its operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to discuss this in some detail on Committee Stage. It is a complex matter; we have nothing to hide.  We are making these changes in the interests of equity and justice as well as trying to bring the operation of the law to the way in which we intended this time last year.  However, we can discuss it in more detail under the relevant section on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to restricting tax relief in the R &amp; D area. However, the Bill contains measures to enhance R &amp; D tax relief and in the case of restriction of patent relief, a special exception is being made where there is an ongoing programme of research and development.  Others also questioned whether we needed to make changes in patent relief and what evidence was there of abuse.  I can confirm that there have been abuses uncovered by the Revenue and that they were on the <Col N="525" /> increase.  What I am trying to do is to eliminate them to protect the Exchequer while preserving the essential object of the scheme, that is, to stimulate innovation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen referred to the recent performance of the Irish economy and suggested that Ireland's relative international performance was slipping backwards. This, of course, is not the case. The latest OECD economic outlook shows that Ireland had the best growth rate of any OECD country, except Turkey, for last year.  More importantly, in the context of Deputy Cullen's comments, the OECD forecasts that Ireland will have the fastest economic growth rate, bar none, in the OECD for both 1996 and 1997.  According to OECD forecasts, Ireland's growth rate will be more than twice the OECD and EU average for this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been given the wrong information.  I did not refer to our growth rates; I was talking about our slippage in the competitiveness league.  I never referred to it in that context.</P>

      <P>Moreover, our export growth is projected to be well in excess of that of our total export markets over the next two years indicating a further increase in our relative share of world markets.</P>
      <P>There was also a reference to the 31,000 net increase in employment which we expect this year and which the Deputy seemed to find disappointing in the context of our strong growth rate.  I would point out, however, that the OECD predicts that employment growth in Ireland over the next two years will be faster than in any other European country, except Luxembourg and Turkey, and will be well over twice the OECD and European Union average.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the high level of flooding which occurred in County Clare in the winter of 1995.  North Clare and Ennis were most affected and there is considerable <Col N="529" /> concern among residents and UDC members in Ennis that this situation could be exacerbated by any building development on the flood plains of the River Fergus, particularly from Mill Road to Bank Place.</P>
      <P>The town development plan recognised the importance of the flood plains in this area.  However, public concern was expressed at the Mill Road traders meeting on 1 April last regarding planning permission in the post office field and proposed development on Watery Road in Ennis.  At this meeting it was pointed out that this stretch of river is prone to flooding and is unique as it lies between two river control mechanisms. The weir is situated on the up river side while the bridge is located at Bank Place.  The point was also made that this area acts as a flood relief zone at times of high rainfall.  This situation can be exacerbated by spring tides causing the water to back up.</P>
      <P>In the existing circumstances, it was thought prudent for Ennis UDC to commission an impact study on the area to avoid causing a problem, such as the crisis in Clonmel this year.  Will the Minister give a financial commitment to enable such an impact study to take place?  According to many of my constituents, if development takes place in the flood plain area, it will further reduce capacity in the river.  I am told that, if the river is enclosed on the east bank, it will have the effect of rising the river level by approximately two feet between Mill Road and Bank Place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many residents have approached me because they are concerned about the proposed works of Ennis UDC and the civic trust.  Their concerns include landfilling areas previously prone to flooding and the construction of a flooding protection wall at Cloughleigh; landfilling existing water courses at Mill House and the river itself; a reduction in the width of the river by up to 15 feet due to landfilling to create a new river walk; demolition of the existing earth and flood protection embankment along the eastern perimeter of the tennis club; a slipway and poorly designed surface <Col N="530" /> water pipe to facilitate water flow at flood periods into property behind the riverside walk which is being constructed; the provision of pedestrian and vehicular access to the rear of properties previously inaccessible, and the destruction of boundary fencing.  My constituents inform me that a detailed flood impact study is needed and that a slip-way and a wall level greater than four metres above datum is required as a minimum until the study is completed. That level will only deal with known previous flood levels and does not take into account the detrimental impact of the works outlined.</P>
    <P>My constituents say it is obvious that the works undertaken are not flood neutral and call on the UDC and others to demonstrate what proposals they have to ensure that such works, including any future proposals, will not adversely affect river overbank flows on to their property.  The Minister should commit funding for a technical plan to be drawn up for this area.</P>

    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are empowered to undertake drainage schemes for the relief of localised flooding problems under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995.  The current drainage programme, which was established after the passing of the 1995 Act, comprises investigation of flooding problems and preparation of localised flood relief schemes for nine areas around the country which are known to suffer periodic flooding and for which <Col N="531" /> the commissioners already had sufficient information to enable scheme designs to be initiated quickly.</P>
    <P>These nine schemes are: Sixmile-bridge, County Clare &mdash; where construction work is to commerce shortly &mdash; Gort Town, County Galway; Carlow Town; Kilkenny City; Duleek, County Meath; Cappamore, County Limerick; Newport, County Tipperary; Dunmanway, County Cork; and Williamstown, County Galway.</P>
    <P>A further scheme for the Lackan area of Ardrahan, County Galway, which was recommended by the specialist consultants who investigated the overall flooding problems in South Galway, has also been prepared and will proceed shortly.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Commissioners of Public Works do not have the resources to deal with all of the flooding problems in the country as and when demanded by individuals, groups, local authorities or indeed elected representatives and to expect them to have is both impracticable and unrealistic.  It is considered therefore that the available resources, financial etc., would be used to the best advantage by concentrating on those applications most in need, in effect, to prioritise schemes in some order so that a flood relief programme of works can be carried out on an ongoing/phased basis.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works intend to establish a national priority programme of areas to be considered for the execution of localised flood relief schemes.</P>
    <P>There are in excess of 100 areas which are known to be at serious risk of or subject to periodic flooding.  The effect of the flooding varies widely and includes damage to houses and other property, closure of national primary and other roads, isolation of houses, businesses, farms, etc., waterlogging of agricultural and other land, disruption of water, sewerage and other services, damage to the natural environment, including habitats, instilling fear in communities and individuals, particularly <Col N="532" /> the elderly.  It will be necessary, in preparing the national priority programme, to have regard to these and other impacts in order that a system of prioritising evolves in a rational way.</P>
    <P>We have decided to appoint consultants to advise us on the criteria to be applied in considering areas for inclusion on the priority list and on the relative weightings to be given to different factors.  We have, in fact, agreed on the consultants who will be appointed in the next week or so.  I expect to receive their report in about three months.  The criteria determined on the basis of the consultants' report will be applied to the flood affected areas to establish priority lists.  Ennis has been noted as an area which has suffered severe flooding recently and will therefore be among the first areas which will be considered by the consultants for inclusion on a priority list.  I cannot go beyond that because I would be pre-empting their work.  I will report to the Deputy in about two weeks on the question of funding the flood impact study to which she referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What are known as company cars are being driven around by children of 14 or 15 years of age.  This has been a problem in parts of Dublin for some years.  We have frequently heard reports of the Garda stopping these stolen company cars and cars which had been purchased from itinerants for £40.  Up until last year all gardaí could do was ask the drivers to produce their tax and insurance at a Garda station within ten days.  A campaign by the Garda, residents associations, public representatives etc. succeeded in having the law updated and the necessary provision was included in section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The Minister for the Environment signed the regulations into law in the spring of 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A parliamentary question was tabled <Col N="533" /> about two months later seeking information on the number of cars confiscated at all Garda stations or at north-side Garda stations and full details were given in respect of each Garda station. Since then there is growing concern that the law is being used to confiscate vehicles not covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The perception is that some gardaí have lost the run of themselves.  While they are probably strictly within the law in confiscating any untaxed car, what they are doing is not within the spirit or the intent of the law as it was lobbied for and enacted.</P>
    <P>Cars are being confiscated and in many cases motorists are left stranded on the side of the road or at a Garda station at all hours of the day or night. I listened with interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, on radio at lunch time speak about a particular case with which she dealt.  I fully agree with her concern in this matter. Gardaí are alienating many genuine motorists by their over zealous interpretation of the law in a manner which was not predicted at the time the legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>I tabled an oral question some weeks ago, for which I had to wait several weeks for a reply, seeking the up-to-date figures on the numbers of cars confiscated at Garda stations.  All I received was a smart alec reply that the Department or the Garda do not know what is known as a company car.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem.  There is a perception that gardaí are over zealous and not using the law in the manner and for the purpose for which it was intended.  I should like to know the figures for the number of cars confiscated. If there is an argument about the definition of company car, will the Minister provide the figures for the number of cars confiscated and the number of cars which were reclaimed the following day, or two days later, on payment of £100? The difference will indicate the number of genuine company cars.  We can safely presume nobody is paying £100 to reclaim a car purchased for £40 at the <Col N="534" /> local halting site.  If the Minister provides the figures I can extrapolate the information I need.  I was shocked at the previous reply.</P>
    <P>The same argument could be made in respect of motorcyclists who have been stopped by gardaí while in parts of my constituency other children who drive scrambler bikes across roads, parks, green areas etc. are never stopped, perhaps because it is too difficult.  I was extremely disappointed with the recent reply and I hope the Minister can furnish details which will allow me to decide whether my perception is true or false.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my Department would ever prepare a smart alec reply to a question legitimately tabled by any Member.  I am upset by the Deputy's inference that I would treat a question in a flippant or smart alec manner.  The question Deputy Ahern asked on 2 April referred to company cars.  Newspapers or people may idiomatically refer to them as &ldquo;company cars&rdquo; but such a classification does not exist in law.  I am aware that businesses supply cars to company staff and that they are termed &ldquo;company cars&rdquo; and I suppose one could idiomatically call ministerial cars company cars.  However, the Deputy's question seeking statistical information on company cars could not be answered because there is no such classification. I know what the Deputy meant, but he should have been more specific.  The Deputy referred to &ldquo;stolen, untaxed company cars&rdquo; in today's question, that classification is understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, was enacted by the Minister for the Environment before I joined him in Government and it came into effect on 19 April 1995.  Under section 41 of that Act, gardaí are empowered to seize vehicles if the driver does not have a driving licence and is ineligible to hold one by reason of age, does not have insurance or if the vehicle has been <Col N="535" /> untaxed for more than three months. The Deputy did not refer to stolen cars in his question of 2 April.  Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, does not refer to such vehicles, they are dealt with under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended.  Section 41 of the 1994 Act was brought into force to strengthen Garda powers on under age driving and drivers using vehicles that have been uninsured and-or untaxed for three or more months. These are the only criteria for detaining and seizing a vehicle under section 41 of that Act.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;company car&rdquo; is not defined in the legislation and Garda records do not indicate the categories of vehicle detained.  I know the Deputy is referring to cars acquired by juveniles for small sums of money and driven without proper documentation which, if the driver is under age, he or she cannot obtain.  If a car is being driven without tax or insurance by an under age driver &mdash; irrespective of whether the Deputy calls it a company car &mdash; the gardaí have the power to seize that car.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that while a total of 1,961 vehicles were seized and detained by gardaí between 19 April and 31 December 1995, only 33 &mdash; less than 2 per cent &mdash; were being driven by under age persons. More than half &mdash; 55 per cent &mdash; were untaxed and the remainder &mdash; 44 per cent &mdash; were uninsured.  I have been assured by the Garda authorities that every effort is made to enforce the legislation in a fair and impartial manner.  I do not have figures to show how many of the 1,961 cars were reclaimed, but I will do my best to get that information for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Questions raised about such matters require many hours compiling statistics that are not readily available because all the necessary information technology is not yet in place.  I do not wish to take operational manpower off the streets to gather figures for something which I am not sure would be useful.  However, I will try to get the information for the <Col N="536" /> Deputy and he can extrapolate how many of the 1,961 cars were reclaimed. If only 1,000 were reclaimed it could be assumed the people concerned with the other 961 were glad to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should know that I do not give smart alec replies.  His question referred to something which cannot be classified in law.  While I may have known to what he was referring, I had to answer the question he asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Oldfields set up here and offered a rates consultancy service to businesses from its offices at Eden Quay and Lower Baggot Street in Dublin. The company claimed it could reduce rates' bills for firms and charged £245, plus VAT, in advance for its consultancy service.</P>
      <P>At least 5,000 &mdash; possibly as many as 7,000 &mdash; business people in the Republic paid £300 each in advance to the firm. The Oldfields sales, pitch delivered by innocent young people employed as telesales people for minimum wages, often claimed the company had secured a one-third reduction in rates for some well known company which they would name.  For example, the company cited this achievement to the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> in January when it investigated Oldfields.  When the newspaper contacted the firm cited by Oldfields, the firm told the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> it had never heard of the company.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, last month Oldfields abandoned its offices in Dublin in a hurry and left thousands of disgruntled customers in its wake.  Most clients of Oldfields are highly critical of the service provided.  The promised rates survey never materialised while, for others, their rates actually increased.  Only a few hundred appeals were lodged in the Valuation Office in Dublin.  Representatives from the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs visited Oldfields on several occasions but found that laws had not been broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Oldfields first came to attention in <Col N="537" /> Belfast in January, where it also had an operation.  The company may have taken in as many as 1,500 customers in Northern Ireland.  However, some of its directors had come to attention prior to this latest saga, one whom is reported to be the subject of a fraud squad investigation in Britain about a controversial timeshare operation.</P>
    <P>The Oldfields débâcle is one of the worst examples of sharp practice of which I ever heard.  It is beyond belief that such fly-by-night merchants could take in so many people and get away with between £1 million and £1.5 million, possibly a conservative estimate.  It is astounding that the company was able to operate within the law despite the obvious concerns expressed by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>This case highlights the necessity for change in company law so that greater powers can be wielded against such conmen. There is also a need for greater scrutiny of those appointed as directors, as some of the people involved in this operation appear to have come to attention in other jurisdictions prior to their &ldquo;outing&rdquo; here.  Above all, the case highlights the necessity for business people to be on the alert.  Irrespective of the laws we introduce, the old maxim of <i>caveat emptor</i> still remains the tried and true adage.  Business people should seek advice before paying in advance when unsolicited approaches are made by unknown operators.</P>
    <P>I have received calls to suggest that the people behind the Oldfields operation may have resurfaced under another guise elsewhere in Dublin, but that has not been confirmed.  Business people should deal with reputable firms, find out their credentials and not part with money in advance of a service.  Is it possible to plug a loophole to ensure that such fly-by-night operators cannot hoodwink hard-pressed business people and take off with the proceeds?</P>

      <P>The Companies Acts, 1963 to <Col N="538" /> 1990, comprise a comprehensive legislative framework governing the incorporation and operation of companies within this jurisdiction.  In essence, the aim of this legislation is to provide a necessary framework within which companies can operate and thereby provide those operating companies, and those dealing with them, with a degree of certainty in respect of the manner in which they are to be operated.  Certain information in relation to companies is accessible in the Companies Registration Office.  This facilitates those dealing with companies to obtain information before deciding to what extent they wish to interact with that company.</P>
      <P>It is very important to point out that the companies legislation does not operate to regulate or govern the areas or activities in which companies incorporated under the Acts decide to operate or engage.  In so far as this proves necessary, in certain areas &mdash; for example in relation to banks, building societies or insurance companies &mdash; separate legislation is introduced to govern the specific activities of companies operating in these areas.</P>
      <P>I understand Oldfields and Company (Ireland) Limited was incorporated in January 1995.  From a company law perspective, nothing in relation to the activities of that company has been brought to my attention.  In particular, given that the company was so recently incorporated, its annual returns would only now be falling due for submission to the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether the activities of this company would give rise to the need to amend existing Companies Acts, I should perhaps explain that, as with all legislation, the necessity to keep the law under review and, where necessary, amend it, must always be borne in mind. In this regard, my predecessor the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, established a company law review group to examine certain aspects of the Companies Acts which were considered to require examination and possible amendment.  The first report of the company law review group was submitted in <Col N="539" /> December 1994 and published by me in February 1995.  The report made recommendations for changes to company law in respect of six areas.  In publishing the report of the Company Law Review Group, I indicated that I proposed to consider, and where necessary to implement, the recommendations of the group on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>In respect of the proposals for the amendment of examinership law, the possibility of amending legislation on this area and also for the removal of the audit for small firms is being contemplated. The other areas covered by the first report of the company law review group will be examined and, where necessary, implementing legislation will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of anything arising from the recent press reports in relation to Oldfields and Company (Ireland) Limited that would give rise to the necessity to bring forward proposals to amend the Companies Acts.  Having said that, however, if there are lessons to be learned from the Oldfield case I will be more than happy to have then looked at by my officials.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, the Director of Consumer Affairs was made aware of the practices in this company.  Following an initial investigation the director found that no breaches of consumer legislation had occurred and as the traders had entered freely into contracts with the company the issue was primarily one of contract law.  I have received a note from the Director of Consumer Affairs about the matter and apparently no contemplated changes in consumer law would deal with this situation; it is a straightforward question of contract law and, as the Deputy said, it is sadly very much a case of <i>caveat emptor.</i> From what I know about the case, I understand why Deputy O'Rourke would want to ventilate it.  However, it seems that no action can be taken under company or consumer law.  I am not sure if steps can be taken to prevent an occurrence of this case &mdash; I am advised that <Col N="540" /> none readily suggests itself &mdash; but I will have the matter examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in the issue raised by Deputy O'Rourke as it has some bearing on my matter which relates to people who have suffered severe financial difficulties as a result of pursuing programmes which were put forward as beneficial and lucrative.  I am referring to those farmers &mdash; approximately 40-50 are from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan &mdash; who were encouraged to take up deer farming in the belief that it would be a bonanza.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The only difference is that these farmers were encouraged to take up deer farming by people of a high calibre.  Some farmers are caught by milk and beef quotas while poultry farmers cannot increase production and the former Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, strongly advised them to take up deer farming.  He was so much in favour of this type of farming that he became a director of Galtee Deer Farming. He and other senior politicians, including the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, led many farmers to believe that deer farming would be a bonanza. Some farmers invested sums of £50,000, £60,000 and £70,000 in ordinary deer while other farmers bought pure bred deer for £2,500-£5,000 each.  One deer bought by Ray MacSharry made the grand total of £27,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can see, therefore, how easy it was to encourage farmers to take up deer farming.  I raise this matter to ascertain if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry can help alleviate the difficulties experienced by many of these farmers through headage payments, etc.  Many farmers sold their milk quotas and machinery to take up deer farming and some of them are now <Col N="541" /> being forced to sell their land.  They were promised that the deer would be bought back from them at a guaranteed price.  However, some farmers who contacted me were offered only £3.63 per kilogram which is a quarter of the initial price of £12.63.  One can imagine the uproar by beef farmers if they had to accept a similar drop in prices.</P>
    <P>Some Monaghan farmers were given loans by the AIB in Fermoy even though their farms had not been inspected by the manager.  One farmer who bought 25 Hungarian cross hinds and one Hungarian stag for a total cost of £27,675 and who spent an additional £10,000 on fencing was told that he would earn a profit of £13,200 per year for at least five years.  The former Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, advised farmers who attended a meeting in Three Mile House in my area that they should take up deer farming.  Will he or anyone else now advise these farmers on how to meet their bank commitments?</P>
    <P>Given the difficulties in the beef sector, an opportunity now exists to promote the sale of venison.  However, this is not being done.  According to the details in the three fancy brochures for 1993, 1994 and 1995 many of our deer population are pure bred Hungarian deer.  The brochures stated that we had 61, 96 and 80 pure bred deer.  As far as I can gather from a parliamentary question I tabled, only a small number of deer came from Hungary.  I wonder from where all these deer came.  Some were bought in England, Scotland and Wales.  Is it possible that some are deer to which papers were issued?</P>
    <P>It is a serious situation as farmers are on the point of bankruptcy and are looking for a way out of this problem.  I hope the Minister will have positive news and that the former EU Commissioner and former Minister for Finance will be able to come to the aid of farmers.  He advised them that the market was open and that it would be fulfilling and lucrative and farmers who could not get quotas opted for this. They were led into a difficult and dicey <Col N="542" /> situation and farm families should be bailed out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this problem and I had a recent meeting with a groups of deer farmers in Kerry who face financial ruin because of their entry into deer farming.  No doubt the introduction of a headage grant, which Deputy Crawford has sought, would improve their position considerably. The Deputy raised other questions to which I will not be able to respond as they were not mentioned in the matter he raised.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the issue of paying grants in respect of deer in Ireland's disadvantaged areas is one that has been receiving considerable attention for some time now within my Department.  It has obvious advantages in diversifying farm production away from products that are already in surplus to an alternative enterprise taken up by about 500 farmers in this country, 300 of whom are in our disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>As there was no provision in the relevant EU regulations for payment of headage on deer, the first difficulty we faced was whether we could pay grants in respect of deer at all in our disadvantaged areas.  There was provision in those regulations, however, for payment in the case of production other than cattle, horses, sheep and goats on an area basis having subtracted the area devoted to feeding those four categories of animals.  This means that we can pay a set amount per hectare of land being grazed by deer provided that land is not being grazed also by cattle, horses, sheep and goats and is not being used for other farming purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, my Department is pursuing with the Department of Finance for payment of a set amount per hectare of land being grazed by deer within our more severely handicapped areas and of a slightly lower amount per hectare of land being grazed by deer in our less severely handicapped areas &mdash; these <Col N="543" /> payments can be made within the financial envelope currently available for headage within the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry.  So far no agreement has been reached between the two Departments on these proposals &mdash; and, of course, if or when Department of Finance sanction is received for these payments, it will then become necessary for us to secure the agreement of the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee and from the EU Commission to making them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> I can assure Deputy Crawford that I am as anxious as he to introduce deer grants in our disadvantaged areas. Further discussions will be held shortly with the Department of Finance to progress this issue, so that subsequent negotiations can be opened with the two other bodies mentioned with a view to introducing disadvantaged area grants in respect of deer at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

    <P>The decision by the Commission on the beef storage case was for a reduction of £24 million in the disallowance by comparison with what had been proposed by the Commission services leaving a total in this case of £50.3 million. This represented 10 per cent of the cost of beef intervention in Ireland in 1990 and 5 per cent in 1991.  In its decision, the Commission explained the differentiation between the two years as follows: &ldquo;because Ireland has, since the beginning of 1991, shown its willingness to introduce significant improvements in its control system and began to put in place arrangements for remedying the deficiencies found&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This improvement in control systems was a central part of the case made by <Col N="442" /> Ireland in its negotiation with the Commission services and I was glad to see this point acknowledged in the final Commission decision.</P>
    <P>The disallowance for the multiple tendering case is £18.5 million which is 2 per cent of the cost of beef intervention in 1991 and 1992.  The Government was disappointed that the Commission maintained the full disallowance in this case.</P>
    <P>The Commission has asked that the £71.982 million be declared in Ireland's statement of May EAGGF Guarantee expenditure.  The Commission advance for May, which is due in July, will accordingly be reduced by the amount of these disallowances.</P>
    <P>I have asked for legal advice on a challenge to the Commission decision, which has to be made within two months of the publication of the Commission decision.  Having considered that advice, I will be making a recommendation to Government as to whether or not a challenge should be made.  In the event of a successful challenge, the money will be returned to the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The negotiation on the EU disallowances was a co-ordinated one and involved a number of Departments.  The Office of the Attorney General and an independent legal adviser, Ms Mary Finlay, SC, advised on the preparation of a memorandum on the beef storage case to the independent Conciliation Body. In the negotiations with the Commission, close liaison was maintained between my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs (including the Permanent Representation in Brussels) and Finance to ensure that the interventions in the negotiation were made most effectively. I met Commissioner Fischler on the issue in Strasbourg on 17 January.  A formal meeting was held on 26 February between the Commission services (led by David Williamson, Secretary General, and involving the Cabinets of President Santer, Commissioners Fischler and Gradin) and an Irish delegation <Col N="443" /> consisting of officials from the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department. Close contact at political and official level was maintained with the Commission, including Commissioner Flynn and his Cabinet, right up to the Commission decision on the disallowances on 27 March.</P>
    <P>In summary, I consider that the reduction of £24 million in the beef storage case was a significant achievement, given the difficult negotiating environment which existed.  I have already paid tribute to Commissioner Flynn and his Cabinet, to my Government colleagues and to the officials from my own and other Departments for their contributions in securing this reduction.  I am hopeful that a legal challenge to the Commission decision in the European Court will be successful, in which case a significant reimbursement to the Irish Exchequer would occur.</P>

      <P>The total cost of setaside payments in 1995 was £11.5 million.  As there were some 3,806 participants in the scheme in 1995 the average payment for setaside was about £3,000.  I am anxious to encourage the growing of crops for non-food purposes including bio-mass crops for the production of energy.  It should be noted that many such crops can be grown on setaside land without the loss of setaside premium.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 21, 32, 48, 56, 57 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The rural environmental protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; introduced in 1994 addresses the problem of designated degraded commonage areas by providing a financial incentive to flockowners to participate in an environmental programme to regenerate affected lands. This may necessitate the reduction in stock numbers to sustainable levels or the removal of sheep from those commonages during the months of November to April, thus limiting the damage which may occur during the winter months and allowing these grazing areas some time to recover.  The REPS measure was revised at the end of last year to encourage greater participation in these areas.  In addition, to augment the REPS measures, I introduced a national condition into the ewe premium scheme from 1994.  Flockowners who graze sheep on degraded commonage areas, and who are not participating in REPS, who wish to expand their flocks, are obliged to give an undertaking not to graze the additional ewes in the designated areas between November and March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1996, I also prohibited the leasing or transfer of quota rights between <Col N="446" /> the disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged areas to avoid an undue concentration of sheep numbers in the poorer land of the disadvantaged areas, which could have been adversely affected by overgrazing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of difficulties associated with the proposal for a forage acreage system for livestock producers who do not produce their own calves.  It is not possible to mix an acreage related system for drystock producers and a livestock premium system for male cattle for other beef producers in the same member state without effectively increasing the national quota.  Under such an arrangement some of the male cattle which are reared on the farms of drystock producers would have already claimed one or both premiums on farms of suckler cow or milk producers; therefore, mixing the livestock premium system with an area-related premium would mean that some of the male cattle reared on the holdings of drystock producers would benefit both from the special beef premium and the area aid payment. Such an outcome would be equivalent to an increase in the quota for the special beef premium and this would not be acceptable either to the EU Commission or other member states.  Apart from this, an area-related payment system would discriminate against owners of good quality land.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that this proposal would involve the renegotiation of the 1992 CAP Reform Package which was exceptionally advantageous to Irish producers generally and I would be reluctant to initiate any renegotiation of that package in view of the possible losses to Irish producers and the Irish economy which would result from a review of the premium arrangements. However, in the context of any such renegotiation, I will seek to ensure that the premium system works to the advantage of all producers to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <Quest>the average amount in national and EU direct payments drawn down by farmers in 1995; the total amount of such payments; the 1996 projection; the changes, if any, he anticipates being made to the operational programme for agricultural rural development and forestry following this year's mid-term review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Direct payments to about 160,000 producers from national and EU funds amounted to £747.2 million in 1995: the average payments for 1995 accordingly amounted to £4,670.  No significant increase in these payments is anticipated in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards any changes which might be made to the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, the position is that the <Col N="452" /> Community Support Framework for Ireland under the 1994-99 round of Structural Funds stipulates that an independent mid-term review has to be carried out by 1997 of the CSF as a whole and also of the nine operational programmes contained therein.  My Department has recently invited applications for such a review in the case of our operational programme and I expect it to be completed before the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>Recommendations which may emerge as a result of the review for changes to any of the measures contained in the operational programme will have to be considered in the context of the completion of the mid-term review of the CSF as a whole.</P>

      <P>The actual expenditure under the REP scheme in 1995 was £29.56 million.</P>
      <P>Payments under the scheme are related to the area farmed by the participant. The rate per hectare is derived from standard costings agreed by the Department with the EU Commission for the different measures to which the scheme applies.  Farmers are required to carry out the works specified in their environmental plan and to retain records of having carried out such work;</P>
      <P>There may also be additional payments in respect of a specified supplementary measure.  Of course REPS payments are subject to tax and any cost incurred by participants is tax deductible in the normal course.</P>

      <Quest>the concerns, if any, he has at the competitiveness of Coillte Teoranta, particularly its administrative overheads and structure in comparison to known international levels.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6075/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Coillte Teoranta was established pursuant to the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1988.  Under that Act, Coillte Teoranta was given a mandate to undertake its operations on a strictly commercial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This commercial mandate inherently requires the company to continuously <Col N="454" /> assess its competitiveness and efficiency levels.  The Forestry Act, 1988 specifically empowers the company to utilize and manage the resources available to it in a manner consistent with its commercial objectives.  The 1988 Act also specifically requires Coillte to conduct its business at all times in a cost effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it is the statutory responsibility of the company itself to maximize its competitiveness and level of efficiency.  However, for the information of the Deputy, I would add that the company, since its establishment in 1989, has rigorously pursued a policy of containing costs at all levels and has also undertaken extensive restructuring of its operations.  This has, in my view, met with a considerable measure of success.  From an essentially break-even position in the first five years of its operations, the company posted a profit of almost £11 million in 1994 and the 1995 results, currently being finalised and to be announced shortly, will again show a strong profit performance by Coillte.</P>
    <P>Valid international comparisons are somewhat difficult to make given, for example, that Coillte's forest estate is entirely man-made and is relatively immature, thus requiring comparatively extensive silvicultural treatment.  In my view, the critical factor centres on the recognition by Coillte that its operations are subject to international market circumstances and that it continues to improve its efficiency levels to ensure future success in the international marketplace. Notwithstanding the considerable progress made to date, Coillte intend to continue its policy of containing costs which I wholeheartedly endorse.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 33, 51 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The House of Commons statement of 20 March on BSE has caused a wave of concern regarding the safety of beef and beef products throughout the European Union and in many third countries.</P>
      <P>A number of third countries imposed restrictions on imports of European beef in the wake of the statement including Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Qatar, South Africa, Syria, Trinidad, Tunisia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. However, all European Union markets, Russia and much of the Middle East remain open to Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is being made to reopen and regain these markets.  My Department, the Diplomatic Services and An Bord Bia have made every effort to reassure the authorities in all importing countries of the safety of Irish cattle and beef.  High level delegations have visited Egypt, Iran and a number of Gulf States to discuss the specific technical issues raised by these countries.  I am pleased <Col N="457" /> that Egypt and Kuwait have lifted their restrictions.</P>
    <P>Political interventions have been made where appropriate.  The reopening of the Egyptian market, which followed direct contacts between the Taoiseach and President Mubarak, is very significant and it is hoped that it will have a positive influence on other countries in the region.  The Taoiseach has also been in contact with the political leaders in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates while the Tánaiste has been in contact with the Iranian Foreign Minister.</P>
    <P>I have taken a pro-active stance on the issue both within the Union and with third countries.  I have discussed the difficulties with my Union colleagues and I am endeavouring to ensure that all necessary action is taken within the Union both to restore consumer confidence and to support the beef market.  I was very pleased regarding the recent changes to the intervention rules which will make the vast bulk of Irish steers eligible for intervention. A solution has been found to the difficulties facing the rendering industry.  I have had direct contacts with the Iranian Minister for Agriculture and the Saudi Arabian Minister for Commerce and I will be visiting Libya shortly.  The need for further action will be reviewed in the light of future developments.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia is drawing up plans to promote Irish beef at various locations within the Union and in targeted third countries.  Both the Minister of State and I will be actively engaged in these campaigns, the timing of which will depend on developments in the particular markets.  A very successful promotion campaign was recently held in Sweden and I will be attending a similar promotion in Italy and Spain this week.</P>
    <P>A lot of resources and effort are being invested into dealing with the many difficulties which have arisen following the recent developments on BSE.  While this work is already bearing results it will be some time before normal market conditions are restored in the beef sector.  The House can be <Col N="458" /> assured that all appropriate action is being taken to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>The necessary internal procedures for submission of this proposal for decision by the Commission are now being concluded, and I have been informed that the Commission hopes to take a formal decision by the end of April.  Following this, it will be placed before the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture Ministers will take the final decision after the European Parliament has given its advice.</P>
      <P>When the Commission decision is made public, I intend to announce the list of areas to be included in the extension. I intend that the farmers in the new areas will benefit from the relevant headage schemes in 1996.</P>

      <P>The significant increase in world grain prices over the past year was due to reduced supplies resulting from adverse weather conditions in some of the major exporting countries in 1993 and 1994, coupled with increased demand in consuming countries.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say what impact, if any, this will have on domestic food prices.  However, given the highly competitive nature of the food industry, I am hopeful that any increase in prices due to higher raw material costs will be kept to a minimum.</P>

A total of 124 cases of BSE have occurred in Ireland since the first case was confirmed in 1989.  The number of animals slaughtered under this policy in each of the last five years and the amount of compensation paid is as follows:</P>

      <Quest>the changes, if any, he will be seeking in the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure that income support measures are targeted at the 23 per cent of farming families, who, in 1987, had a gross household income of £5,000 or less; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some significant changes since the survey, on which the figures referred to by the Deputy are based, was carried out.</P>
      <P>In 1992 a major reform of the CAP was agreed.  This involved lesser emphasis on the market support arrangements which existed up to then and increased emphasis on direct payments to producers. This is a more efficient system of getting the support where it is required i.e. to the producers.  The direct payments, also contain a bias in favour of small and medium sized producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CAP reform also made provision for the introduction in member states of three important new structural <Col N="464" /> measures viz. an agri-environment programme, an early retirement scheme for farmers and a package of forestry measures.  These schemes are now fully operational in Ireland with total expenditure of nearly £77 million under the three schemes in 1995.</P>
    <P>The position on farm incomes has improved very considerably since 1987 and particularly so since 1992.  Since 1987 farm incomes have increased by 60 per cent, or 28 per cent after taking inflation into account.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry which is being implemented under the 1994-99 round of Structural Funds offers considerable opportunities for farmers to improve their incomes by availing of grant aid for on-farm capital investment, farm diversification, and the development of forestry.  Many of the schemes involved are particularly targeted at the lower income farmer.  As part of the operational programme, Teagasc are providing farmers with a completely revised advisory service for farm viability and rural enterprise.  In addition, the programme also provides for major income support to farmers under the compensatory headage allowances scheme which again is targeted at the lower income farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  Increased payments under this scheme as well as improved social welfare entitlements since 1987 have contributed positively to the situation of farm families.</P>
    <P>I will, in the course of all future negotiations on the CAP have particular regard to the position of small and medium sized producers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 49 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement of animals between EU member states is governed by Council Directive 90/425/EEC on veterinary and zootechnical checks on certain <Col N="466" /> live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market. It is implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Trade in Animals and Animal Products) Regulations, 1994.  A wide range of powers is contained in these regulations including, in certain cases, the destruction and disposal of the animals concerned.  The maximum penalties for contravention of these regulations are 12 months imprisonment and a fine of £1,000</P>
    <P>Following the Commission decision of 27 March, the Minister adopted an order banning the importation of cattle and products of bovine origin from the UK on 28 March 1996.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the prohibition, close liaison has been maintained between my Department, the Garda authorities and Customs and Excise to ensure that the ban is implemented as far as imports from Northern Ireland are concerned.  In particular, the two senior superintending veterinary inspectors of the Department responsible for the Border regions have been given specific functions in relation to the enforcement of the import prohibition at local level.  I am confident that the measures in place in these areas and at factory and mart level are providing adequate safeguards to ensure that the EU prohibition is being properly enforced as far as the illegal importation of cattle is concerned.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle, income from pensions is, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>Pensioners are, however, treated more favourably under the Irish income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. The exemption limits for pensioners are significantly higher than those which apply generally.  These currently stand at £4,500 single/£9,000 married couple for those aged between 65 years and 74 years and £5,100 single/£10,200 married at 75 years and over as compared with £3,900 single/£7,800 married for other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Alternatively, if taxed under the normal system, a person aged 65 years and over receives a special age allowance of £200 single/£400 married couple in addition to the normal personal allowances.</P>
    <P>I draw to the Deputy's attention that when personal allowances and exemption limits are increased, as in this year's budget, the increases apply to the elderly as well as to other taxpayers.  In the 1995 budget, to provide greater assistance to the elderly, the increase in the exemption limits for those aged 65 years and over was double that made in the general exemption limits.  Consequently, arising from my two budgets, the exemption limits for the elderly have increased by £400 in the case of a single person and £800 for a married couple.  Increasing the exemption limits, rather than the age allowance, is considered the more appropriate method of giving extra assistance to the elderly through the tax system, as it focuses assistance towards those on lower incomes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>For reasons of confidentiality the Revenue Commissioners do not supply details of charitable bodies granted exemption from tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for administering the tax laws and they determine whether a body or persons or a trust is entitled to tax exemption on the basis that it is established for charitable purposes only. Where a claim to exemption is refused by the Commissioners there is a statutory right of appeal against the refusal to the Appeal Commissioners and ultimately to the courts.</P>
    <P>Under their general powers, the Ombudsman is responsible for investigating complaints about administrative actions, delays or inaction affecting persons or bodies in their dealings with the public service and other agencies, while the Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible, <i>inter alia,</i> for the audit of the assessment, collection and bringing to account of revenue and for the examination of the economy and efficiency with which Government Departments and other bodies use their resources in carrying out their functions. In the relevant legislation in relation to these two officers there is no specific provisions about the review of the manner in which exemption from tax is granted to charities.</P>

Card holders who do not meet the the criterion for eligibility under this scheme have been written to by the board and advised that arrangements are being made to cancel their cards. These persons are also being advised that they may avail of the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, where any expenditure on prescribed medications in excess of £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The health insurance regulations were signed by me and laid before the House on 28 March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> The regulations were framed in the context of the creation of an open single market in private health insurance.  It is the objective of the EU's Third NonLife Insurance Directive that insurance undertakings authorised in one member state should be free to establish or provide services in any other member state. The EU Commission and I, as Minister for Health, want to see competition develop in the Irish private health insurance market.</P>
    <P>The regulations, which were made pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, are intended to facilitate competition while protecting our core values of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  Accordingly, these contain a variety of protections for the consumer within a competition framework. The regulations include a legally guaranteed minimum level of cover in respect of a variety of hospital and consultant in-patient, day-patient and outpatient services.  Under the regulations consumers are entitled by law to a specific minimum level of cover under health insurance contracts which can be sold in an open competitive market here.  Prior to this consumers had no such legal protection and were reliant on the customary practices, in a restricted market, of the country's sole provider of private health insurance to the general public.</P>
    <P>Under the Regulations the minimum period of guaranteed cover in respect of private psychiatric in-patient care is 100 days in a year.  Furthermore, I am committed to making provision, at an early date, for a further period of 20 days' day-patient care in private psychiatric hospitals.  This compares to the 40 days in-patient cover which was the original proposal on psychiatric cover. Following an intensive consultation process, I was pleased to be able to respond positively to the concerns of the appropriate interests in regard to insurance cover and substantially increase the cover on the lines indicated.  This compares very favourably with the position <Col N="476" /> taken by insurers eleswhere who specifically limit, in some cases extensively, their exposure to risk in the area of psychiatric illness.  It is the practice of foreign insurers to exercise pre-authorisation of admissions to psychiatric hospitals and to otherwise be in a position to significantly qualify the basis on which benefit may be payable.  My Department is not aware of any other case internationally where providers of private health insurance contract to make available cover for a period of 100 days' psychiatric in-patient services without pre-certification and in an enviorment where the entire population is eligible for a free public psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>The health research board's 1994 Report on the Activities of Irish Psychiatric Hospitals and Units provides statistical information on discharges and length of stay in private psychiatric hospitals.  Of a total of 4,209 discharges in that year, 3,871, or 92 per cent, occurred within three months.  A guaranteed minimum level of cover in respect of 100 days in-patient services in a year therefore represents a very significant protection for the consumer, particularly in the context of the operation of a free market and insurance practice in the area of exposure to liability for such cover.  In addition to this there will be the minimum cover for day-patient services which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Where circumstances arise that an insured person requires treatment in excess of 100 days, later to be increased to 120 days, in a year, it is open to him or her to avail of in-patient care in public psychiatric hospitals and public community-based facilities.</P>
    <P>Prior to finalising the regulations I met representatives of the two major private psychiatric hospitals who welcomed the significant increase in the proposed minimum cover.  I regret that the AWARE organisation did not consider it possible to accept the provisions of the regulations.</P>

It is also my intention to bring forward, at the earliest possible date, legislation to provide for the establishment of a national adoption contact register to assist adopted persons and birth parents who wish to reestablish contact with one another.  The issue of access by adopted persons to birth records will also be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The Nurses Act, 1985, established An Bord Altranais to provide for the registration, control and education of nurses and provided for other matters in relation to the practice of nursing and the persons engaged in such practice.  Section 30 of the Act allows the board, with the Minister's consent, to register in a separate register the names of persons engaged in a profession or calling which is ancillary to nursing.  The board has never sought ministerial consent to the establishment of such a register and neither I nor my predecessors have to date requested An Bord Altranais to implement that provision of the Nurses Act.</P>
      <P>The register maintained by An Bord Altranais is a register of fully qualified nurses only.  This has been sufficient to meet the requirements for the health services in this area.  If this situation were to change in the future rendering the registration of grades ancillary to nursing appropriate, I am confident that An Bord Altranais would then seek my consent to the implementation of section 30 of the Nurses Act.</P>

      <P>I refer to the replies to Questions Nos. 142, 143 and 144 of 12 March 1996. As regards other aspects, applications for recycling grants in 1994 were invited by press advertisement on 23 September 1994; 152 applications were received. Applications for recycling grants in 1996 were invited from the private sector by press advertisement on 4 April 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> Applications will be invited from local authorities shortly.</P>
    <P>Applications for recycling grants were not formally invited in 1995 due to delays in securing the agreement of the new grants scheme with the European Commission.  Some 90 per cent of the total allocation of £100,000 for that year was paid in grants to three local authorities in respect of recycling facilities and to IBEC in connection with research for the REPAK initiative. Details of all grants paid in 1995 were published in Environment Bulletin No. 29 of February 1996, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Recycling grants have contributed to a substantial expansion of recycling activity and infrastructure since 1989. For example, the number of collection points for recyclables has increased from some 60 sites in 1988 to 200 in 1993 and now exceeds 400.  The recycling rate for packaging waste which was 10 per cent in 1993 is now estimated at 17 per cent.  Recycling grants have also contributed significantly to the development of the Kerbside collection scheme which now serves some 34,000 households in the Dublin area.  The total expenditure on recycling grants by my Department in each of the years 1989 to 1994 is set out in the following table:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> I have no plans to review the criteria of entitlement to family income supplement (FIS) to include community employment (CE) scheme workers.  As I have already indicated to the Deputy, I do not consider that FIS is an appropriate mechanism for improving the income of these workers.  The level of allowance payable to CE workers is a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>In response to the submission from the Fountain Resource Group, I would like to clarify that the FIS scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.  The CE scheme provides part-time employment opportunities to reintegrate the unemployed into the labour market and to provide a resource for local development and for the voluntary and community sectors.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children, including twins, up to 16 years of age, and up to 19 years in respect of children who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally handicapped.  Benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child, where three or more children are born together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special once-off grant of £300 is payable on the birth of triplets and £400 <Col N="492" /> where four or more children are born together.  These arrangements were extended to include the birth of twins in 1993 when the grant of £200 was introduced.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents in multiple births I made provision in the 1996 budget for an increase, from £200 to £500, in the grant payable on the birth of twins and for the introduction of a new grant of £500 which is payable on the twins reaching the ages of four and 12.</P>
    <P>The new grants are intended to assist with the particular financial pressures as the twins enter primary and secondary school.  These improvements were brought into effect from 1 January 1996 and are in addition to the increases being provided in the rates of child benefit.  From September next, the monthly payment will amount to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  When taken together with the increases provided for in the 1995 budget, these rates represent an increase of 45 per cent in the rate payable for the first two children and 36 per cent in the higher rate payable in respect of other children.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any basis for the Deputy's contention that providing new grants for twins constitutes discrimination against them.  I believe that these arrangements are fully consistent within the overall framework of child benefit and give practical support by providing financial assistance with the extra costs which arise for parents of twins, both at birth and at the relevant ages.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned to the Deputy in response to parliamentary questions on 27 February and 26 March, my Department received a communication from the EU Commission in Brussels confirming that the Commission has approved grant aid, under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty, amounting to ECU 376,806 for 194 workers made redundant in 1994-95.  A number of aspects of the Commission's decision, and the conditions attached to the decision, have to be clarified by my Department before any payment can be made by the EU Commission.  My Department has been in touch with the Commission but it will be some more months before all matters are clarified.</P>
      <P>Regarding readaptation aid payments to workers made redundant since 1988, the 30 workers made redundant in 1988 and the 90 workers made redundant in 1992, were not eligible for readaptation aid from the EU Commission under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty, because I understand, the redundancies were the consequences of a rationalisation of the product range of Irish Steel Ltd. and were not the result of a permanent discontinuance, curtailment or change in activities, which at the time was necessary to qualify for readaptation aid from the EU under Article 56 (2) (b) of the ECSC Treaty.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy arises from industrial action taken by the Civil and Public Services Union on a Civil Service wide basis.  A high proportion of the staff in the Companies Registration Office are members of the Civil and Public Service Union.  The industrial action is, accordingly, having an adverse effect on the work of the office, resulting in a diminution of the service provided to customers. A notice to advise customers of the office of the difficulties was placed in the national newspapers at an early stage after the Civil Service wide industrial action was commenced in March.</P>
      <P>I understand that, following discussions between the CPSU and the Minister for Finance, it has been agreed to commence restructuring negotiations under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement, with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission.  In the meantime, while the dispute continues, local management in the Companies Registration Office and senior management in the Department continue to address local issues arising from the CPSU action.  I am happy to record that the particular problem mentioned by the Deputy has been resolved with the availability of company searches having recently been restored.</P>

      <P>While there are no reliable figures on the scale of illegal use of growth promoters, the available evidence is that their use is not significant, is declining and is confined to a small minority of producers.  For example, during 1995, a total of 84,491 samples were taken from live animals and carcases and analysed for the presence of illegal growth promoters; 637 samples, which represents a level of 0.75 per cent, were positive.  The corresponding level for 1994 was 1.67 per cent.  This represents a significant decline in the <Col N="496" /> use of illegal growth promoters and I am determined to take all necessary steps to eradicate their use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the pigmeat sector has recently improved.  The difficulties experienced by pig slaughtering plants in the Border regions were due to a number of factors especially a shortage of throughput.  Pig numbers are now on the increase; the December 1995 CSO livestock survey shows that pig numbers rose from 1.498 million head in December 1994 to 1.542 million head at the end of December 1995.  As the months progress, an increased number of pigs are forecast to come through to slaughter stage and supplies will improve, particularly in the latter part of this year.</P>
      <P>Another factor was the arrival in Northern Ireland of a major pigmeat processing firm which is paying higher prices for the raw material, and producers of pigs are selling for the highest price.  However, prices for pigs in Northern Ireland have fallen.  This has restored some balance to the market.</P>
      <P>Under the Single Market rules of the EU it is not possible to stop the movement of pigs across the Border.  Member states are also precluded from giving any national aid to assist firms in becoming more competitive.  The outlook for the industry is good and, as indicated, supplies are expected to become more plentiful in the latter part of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 132 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is keeping a close watch on the incidence of sheep scab and more so since the abolition of the countrywide compulsory dipping in 1994.  There have been unverified <Col N="501" /> reports of an increase in the incidence of sheep scab.  Coupled with this there has been a marked reduction in the sale of dips which itself is an indicator of reduced treatment.  In response to this development and following consultation with all interested parties a package of measures was introduced in June 1995 to highlight the need to control and eradicate the disease.</P>
    <P>As part of this awareness programme a confidential phoneline &mdash; telephone 1-850-245900 &mdash; was introduced to enable callers to report suspect sheep scab cases.  In addition a video campaign was launched to highlight the economic losses and devastating effects of the disease on sheep.  The video set out treatment options through dipping or injectible methods and advises flockowners to practice good animal husbandry to control and eradicate this disease.  In addition, livestock mart managers have been asked to assist in combating sheep scab.  Furthermore my Department has increased its vigilance at livestock marts, meat plants and farm inspections and follows up with the local authorities any indications of scab that arise.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of this programme of awareness and eradication, a public two-day conference was held on 27-28 March 1996 not alone to reflect the many aspects of this disease and treatments for it but to emphasise the need to fully understand the disease; to improve methods of diagnosis; to be aware of the different types of treatments; to be aware of statutory obligations, to notify the local authority of suspect cases; and to practice good animal husbandry.</P>
    <P>With experts speaking on different aspects of the disease and its control followed by a question-and-answer session after each guest speaker's talk attendants were afforded an opportunity to advance their own understanding of the disease and its control and eventual eradication.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that although the annual autumn compulsory sheep dipping scheme was removed in 1994 <Col N="502" /> the onus rests on individual flockowners to protect their sheep against sheep scab.  Sheep scab is by law still a notifiable disease and outbreaks must be dealt with by compulsory treatment of the affected and contiguous flocks until the outbreak is controlled.  I shall keep this programme of awareness under constant review.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to distinguish between imported timber from sustainably and unsustainably managed sources.  Certification of timber in relation to its source in this context is essentially a marketing mechanism and as such relies both on customer interest and on the development, operation and control of a certification system at the production or marketing stage.</P>
      <P>Part of Ireland's forestry policy is to increase the planting of temperate hardwoods or broadleaves, which can substitute for tropical imports.  Broadleaf planting in 1995 was 20 per cent of the overall total, a significant increase on the 3-4 per cent figure of a few years ago.  I am obviously anxious to promote, wherever possible, import substitution in this area in the interests of employment and wealth creation in Ireland.

      <Quest>his views on whether a limit of 20 milliwatts, rather than the current 100 to 600 milliwatts, should be put on microwave emissions from mobile phones as recommended by CENELEC in view of health and safety reasons; and the plans, if any, he intends to implement, in conjunction with the Ministers for Health and the Environment, to reduce public exposure to the current proliferation of mobile phone microwave ground stations.</Quest>

      <P>It is not known to what limits the Deputy is referring in the text of the question.  The most widely accepted standards for limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and from their associated transmitter towers are those of the International Radiological Protection Association (IRPA).  At all of the frequencies employed by Irish mobile phone systems the IRPA exposure limit is 0.45 milliwatts per square centimetre.  The general public exposure in Ireland to electromagnetic fields from mobile phone systems is about one thousand times less than this. The users of mobile phones experience greater field strengths than those experienced by the general public but these fields are also within the IRPA guidelines.</P>
      <P>The IRPA standards are kept under continuous review by independent groups of scientists recognised by the World Health Organisation.  The CENELEC recommendations in respect of mobile phone systems are the same as those of the IRPA.  There is no reason or basis to propose standards different from those proposed by a knowledgeable scientific body which has been endorsed by independent expert groups free of any industry influence.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to recruit the army nursing service; his views on whether the current arrangements whereby staffing shortages in St. Bricin's Hospital, Dublin are being compensated by transferring staff from Cork and the Curragh are satisfactory and fair to the staff concerned, particularly in view of their family circumstances; and the arrangements, if any, that exist for payment of subsistence to nursing staff who are on temporary transfer.</Quest>

      <P>There are no plans at present to recruit nurses to the Army nursing service. However, the staffing situation is kept under review.</P>
      <P>In accordance with defence force regulations the Director of the Army Medical Corps may order members of the army nursing service to be transferred from time to time meet nursing requirements.  There is no provision for payment of subsistence if members are so transferred from one hospital to another.  The staff involved are provided with meals and accommodation.</P>
      <P>I have asked that the situation regarding the payment of subsistence be reviewed.</P>

      <P>As I previously indicated to the House on 6 March 1996, Parliamentary Question No. 42, the new proposals submitted by Galway County Council in relation to Tawin Island are being examined by the Department.  If they are found to be acceptable they will be <Col N="511" /> included among the projects to be considered for aid over the remaining years of the operational programme.  It is unlikely that funds will be available in 1996.</P>
