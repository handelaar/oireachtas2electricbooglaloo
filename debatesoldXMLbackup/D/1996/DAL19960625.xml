    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the peace process. I want to see a complete and final end to violence in Irish politics.  A peace process involves change, profound change &mdash; change in what people do, and change in what people think.  A peace process is not served by avoiding difficult questions, or pretending that things are different from what they really are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from the feelings of the recent victims, it is just not possible, if the peace process is to be genuine and strong, to continue to act as if Jerry McCabe was not murdered, as if the Manchester bomb was not planted, or as if arms, bombs and mortars had not been assembled in this State during the recently commenced all-party negotiations. Today I have been informed by <Col N="911" /> the Garda Síochána that among the finds in Clonaslee were dozens of bombs of a new type, which were in course of being assembled.  The Garda believe the bombs were intended for early use.  These events, and the questions that flow from them have to be faced, and faced publicly, if the peace process is to be robust, durable and honest.</P>
    <P>These events have changed the objective circumstances and context of the Government's previous relations with Sinn Féin.  There is a connection between the IRA and Sinn Féin.  No one denies that, and the IRA's involvement in three recent terrible events changes things.  It is these events, not the Government or the media, that are forcing Sinn Féin to face fundamental and difficult questions, to face the questions the Government has put to them.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Mitchell principles also poses these difficult questions in an open, public and unavoidable way for Sinn Féin.  They have to be answered satisfactorily and convincingly by any party taking part in the all-party talks.  Anybody who feels it is impolitic or inappropriate to ask these questions of Sinn Féin now, in the wake of Adare, Manchester and Clonaslee, should reread the Mitchell principles.  I will circulate the Mitchell principles in the Official Report to show how closely the Government's questions to Sinn Féin and the Mitchell principles relate to one another.</P>
    <P>The two questions the Government has put to Sinn Féin are: (1)  Does Sinn Féin continue to support the armed struggle of the IRA?  (2)  Has the Sinn Féin leader gone to the IRA to ask for a ceasefire, and if not why?</P>
    <P>The crucial question posed by Mitchell is one which asks participants to the talks to &ldquo;renounce for themselves, and to oppose any effort, to use force, or threaten to use force, to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The two questions the Government asked Sinn Féin are no more and no less <Col N="912" /> than the simple restatement of that Mitchell principle I have just quoted.  Sinn Féin has said it will accept these Mitchell principles in all-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>In light of Sinn Féin's links to the IRA, and the recent activities of the IRA, it is essential to know where Sinn Féin stands on the use or threat of force to influence the negotiations which started on 10 June.</P>
    <P>If, to use the Mitchell words, Sinn Féin &ldquo;renounce for themselves the use of force to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations&rdquo;, then it would simply not be consistent with the Mitchell principles if Sinn Féin continued to support an armed struggle by the IRA.</P>
    <P>Not only this, the Mitchell principles request parties to &ldquo;oppose any effort by others to use force, or threaten to use force, to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations&rdquo;.  Acceptance of the Mitchell principles, therefore, imposes a specific obligation on any party which has influence on a paramilitary organisation to go to that organisation and ask it to end its military campaign.  This demonstrates that the Government's two questions flow directly and inexorably from the Mitchell principles and are questions Sinn Féin will have to face once it enters the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The main lesson of the 1994 ceasefire is that it is vital to face difficult questions beforehand.  I want the next ceasefire to be more durable than the last, and that is why it is best to face difficult questions at this stage.  The Mitchell report raises the difficult questions honestly and publicly.  In answering the Government's questions, Sinn Féin will do no more than it will have to do in any event if and when it joins the all-party negotiations.  A peace process ultimately has to be based on truth.  Truth is at the heart of all peace-making, and out of truth comes trust.</P>
    <P>What the vast majority of people now want to hear from Sinn Féin is that it has persuaded the IRA to restore the 1994 ceasefire, and how it proposes, in <Col N="913" /> that context, to give practical effect to the six Mitchell principles.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that it is difficult for any movement to turn its back forever on violence, and on the evocative tradition that is sometimes associated with violence.  Such a movement must work its way through this transformation in its own way and using its own words.  That process has, in some senses, been under way for years.</P>
    <P>However, it is not an act of friendship towards such a movement to minimise the extent of the change that is necessary. The Mitchell principles, on which the Government's two questions were based, contain the most fundamental challenge the Republican movement as a whole will ever have to face.  There is evidence that some of those in leadership positions in Sinn Féin are endeavouring to bring the whole Republican movement around to a full and practical acceptance of the Mitchell principles. While the two questions posed by the Government have not yet been satisfactorily answered, I believe that these questions, and the Mitchell principles from which they directly flow, are now being seriously examined within the Republican movement.  For the sake of the peace process, I hope this examination of these fundamental questions within the Republican movement will culminate in a durable and irrevocable IRA ceasefire, with no misunderstandings or ambiguities remaining in the minds, either of the IRA itself or of those who could be victims of the IRA. This time, everyone must know it is over.  Otherwise trust will not be built.</P>
    <P>In line with previous practice, I do not propose to give details of official-level contacts with Sinn Féin.  I can, however, confirm that the Government decided on 18 June to keep under review the question of further official-level meetings, if any, in the light, <i>inter alia,</i> of Sinn Féin responses to the evolving situation and to the questions put to it.  In the meantime, lines of communication remain open.</P>
    <P>I had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister Mr. Major on 18</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> June, following the review which the Government carried out that day.  I expressed the Government's revulsion at what had happened in Manchester. We reviewed the situation following the events in Manchester and Adare, as well as progress in the talks under way in Belfast.  We also had a useful exchange on European affairs.  Subsequently, we met in Florence in the margins of the European Council.  We discussed the talks in Belfast, East/West economic co-operation, priorities for the Irish Presidency of the EU and co-operation against drug abuse and crime.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Extract from the Report of the International Body.</P>
    <P>20.  Accordingly, we recommend that the parties to such negotiations affirm their total and absolute commitment:</P>
    <P>a.&nbsp;To democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues;</P>
    <P>b.&nbsp;To the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations;</P>
    <P>c.&nbsp;To agree that such disarmament must be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission;</P>
    <P>d.&nbsp;To renounce for themselves and to oppose any effort by others, to use force, or threaten to use force, to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations;</P>
    <P>e.&nbsp;To agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all-party negotiations and to resort to democratic and exclusively peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of that outcome with which they may disagree; and</P>
    <P>f.&nbsp;To urge that punishment killings and beatings stop and to take effective steps to prevent such actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply.  The Fianna Fáil <Col N="915" /> Party is also dismayed by the IRA shooting of a garda, the bombing in Manchester, finding a bomb factory in Laois and the failure of the Republican movement to agree the conditions to allow Sinn Féin to participate in all-party talks.  We strongly favour the door being kept open as long as there is a glimmer of hope; that conditions should not be more stringent than they were to allow Sinn Féin to participate in talks, if there is a ceasefire.</P>
      <P>In demanding that Sinn Féin condemns the recent actions of the IRA is the Government effectively creating a split in the Republican movement? Does the Taoiseach consider this is helpful to peace?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated today and on other occasions that he would like the next ceasefire to be durable; so would I. Does he not consider it more important that Sinn Féin persuades the IRA to bring the movement which has been involved in the troubles during the past 25 years with it into the peace process rather than leaving a section behind that will continue to engage in violence?  The Taoiseach acknowledges there is a strong element in the Republican movement seeking to find a path to peace, does he agree we should all engage in encouraging them to continue to convince their colleagues, even those with a tendency to murder and destruction, along this path?</P>

      <P>The killing by the IRA of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe is the first murder by the IRA of a member of the Garda Síochána since Garda Frank Hand was murdered by the IRA at Drumree on 10 August 1984.  I hope Deputy Bertie Ahern is not questioning me for having asked Sinn Féin, including a Sinn Féin candidate for the Dáil, to condemn what happened in Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was appropriate to ask any public representative appearing on national television, who <Col N="916" /> failed to condemn what happened in Limerick to do so.  That was the only occasion on which I challenged Sinn Féin for its failure to condemn the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  I assume Deputy Ahern fully understands why I did so and that he accepts I was right.</P>
      <P>As far as a split is concerned, it is not in the interests of anybody that there should be a split.  We need the entire Republican movement in all its manifestations to accept the Mitchell principles in full.  If it is able to accept the Mitchell principles in full, it must be able to answer yes to the two questions put to it by Government.  It was in order to focus its attention on the essence of the Mitchell principles that the questions were put to it, but it is the ambition of the Government that the entire Republican movement should accept those principles and all that they imply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that there are some people in Sinn Féin committed to peace, does the Taoiseach agree that Sinn Féin is merely the political wing of the Provisional IRA, that it is the same organisation and therefore, for the Government to pose a question asking Sinn Féin to go to the IRA implies that the Government believes in some sense these are two different organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that supposition.  In my original reply I said that I believe there is a very strong link between Sinn Féin and the IRA and I said in response to Deputy Ahern that in posing the two questions &mdash; which summarise the essence of the Mitchell principles &mdash; the Government was asking the entire Republican movement to abjure the use or threat of force for political purposes.  It is only when practical effect is given to that commitment that there will be the trust necessary for success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has gone to enormous lengths to meet in a favourable way every single request put by Sinn <Col N="917" /> Féin in regard to the structure and nature of the talks that started on 10 June. Despite the bombing in Canary Wharf and the revocation of its ceasefire by the IRA we allowed official level contact with Sinn Féin to continue in order that we could hear what it needed in regard to the terms of reference of the talks to start on 10 June and seek to have that done so that there could be a ceasefire and it could be at the talks.</P>
    <P>We were successful on every particular question put by Sinn Féin in getting an answer along the lines it could accept.  Despite that, within a week of the talks starting, we had the first killing in 12 years of a member of the Garda Síochána by an IRA unit, the ignition of one of the biggest bombs ever in Manchester and evidence of the manufacture of arms which I have just announced.  To my mind, it is those events which require the republican movement as a whole to answer the two questions put to it by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in trying to be so nice that we do not ask the questions which need to be asked.  It is no favour to a movement, some of which at least us genuinely struggling to change, to pretend that the questions it is grappling with are any less than the ones it is in fact grappling with.  It was in order that the entire republican movement should understand what is at stake that I and the Government decided to pose these questions to it.</P>
    <P>We were influenced by the reaction in this House and elsewhere to the failure of the last ceasefire when one Deputy said: perhaps we could and should have done more to tie down firmly both Sinn Féin and the IRA.  That was the advice offered to me from across the floor.  I think it was good advice and a good reflection on what happened before.  It is important that the questions be put and answered now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Taoiseach listened to the first line of my question and what I said recently.  I will not, therefore, take issue with him in trying to turn it around.  In response to other incidents his predecessor made strong attacks on the republican movement. Let me mention but one.  On 10 March 1994 following the bombing at Heathrow he outlined in the strongest terms what he felt about the actions of the republican movement, but that was done without creating the tensions that the Taoiseach either seems to want to create or is creating in the republican movement.  Is the Taoiseach happy that the Government could be &mdash; perhaps we all are &mdash; in serious danger of losing any influence it might have with the republican movement by trying to force Mr. Adams in particular into condemnation of those he is trying to convince to move forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only event that I asked the IRA to condemn specifically was the killing of Garda McCabe.  I take it the Deputy is not saying that I should not have asked Sinn Féin to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the only occasion I asked it to condemn something. This was the first killing of a garda since Garda Hand was killed in Drumree in August 1984.  I asked a man who stood in the name of Sinn Féin for the Dáil to condemn it but he failed to do so.  Sinn Féin has not yet condemned that event in those terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the lesson of the last ceasefire, as Deputy Ahern said in the House after its collapse, is that we should have done more to tie down firmly both Sinn Féin and the IRA as to their intentions.  My predecessor said at the time of the last ceasefire: &ldquo;Yesterday's IRA statement is quite clear and unambiguous and can only have one possible meaning, that its campaign has ended for good&rdquo;.  That is what he, I and <Col N="919" /> every Member of the House believed at that time.</P>
    <P>On 16 September Mr. Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin said: &ldquo;I believe the IRA ceasefire will hold in all circumstances and that is a very clear statement&rdquo;.  We all know it did not hold in all circumstances.  Perhaps the reason is, as Deputy Ahern said, that we could and should have done more to tie down firmly both Sinn Féin and the IRA before the ceasefire which did not hold in all circumstances and which was not &ldquo;for good&rdquo;, to use the words of my predecessor.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that these questions must be put.  It gives added urgency to those questions when we discover that bombs are actually being manufactured and assembled at this time in this State for early use.  It might be desirable to allow the republican movement time and space without insistent questioning to come to its own conclusions in its own words and time about these matters.  In normal circumstances that would be reasonable, but these circumstances are not normal.  We have had the first killing by an IRA unit of a member of the Garda Síochána in 12 years just before the talks started, a bomb in Manchester and evidence of dozens of similar bombs being manufactured in County Laois.  This gives added urgency to getting these answers.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand also that private answers are not sufficient.  If the veracity of these answers is to be tested it is to be tested in the way in which the entire republican movement acts subsequently. It is very important that the public and the entire republican movement should know the questions that have to be answered and the answers that have to be given.  It is important that the entire republican movement should understand what the six Mitchell principles say and mean because it is not sufficient that there be a simple verbal commitment, a simple use of the Mitchell principles as if they were some form of empty formula.  It is important that the Mitchell principles are accepted for <Col N="920" /> what they mean in full by the republican movement as they have been by the loyalists. We will then have the conditions for genuinely inclusive talks based on trust aimed at reconciliation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that there is one republican movement with a provisional military wing and a political wing?  Does he further accept that that movement clearly believes peace and violence are interchangeable political tactics, each to be used when it suits?  The Taoiseach said it was regrettable that we did not pin the IRA down on the last occasion and find out what its intentions were. Does the Taoiseach accept that after what happened at Clonaslee &mdash; Sinn Féin should be asked to condemn that as well as the Manchester bombing &mdash; the IRA's intentions are clear?  That being the case, does the Taoiseach see any point in the Government maintaining links with Sinn Féin as long as it maintains its link with the Provisional IRA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, said on 20 May that in the context of all-party talks, if the other parties signed up to the Mitchell principles, Sinn Féin would make its commitment to these principles absolute. All the other parties have signed up to those principles.  Those principles include the use of democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues, the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations, such disarmament to be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission, and the renouncing of and opposition to any effort by others to use force or to threaten to use force to influence the course of the outcome of all-party negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the other parties signed up to the Mitchell principles, Sinn Féin has said it would make an absolute commitment to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all party negotiations and to the use of democratic and exclusively <Col N="921" /> peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of the outcome with which the organisation may disagree.  Finally, Sinn Féin said on 20 May that if others signed up to the Mitchell principles, it too would make an absolute commitment to urge that punishment killings and beatings would stop and to take effective steps to prevent such actions.</P>
    <P>The statement by Sinn Féin on 20 May saying that if others did so it would accept those principles is a basis for believing that there are people in the republican movement who seek not only to restore the ceasefire but to ensure that violence ends for good.  For that reason the Government has not closed off lines of communication to those people.  The Government believes that all members of the republican movement &mdash; those who provide safe houses, those who conceal arms, those who may feel that they engage in punishment beatings under some form of republican authority &mdash; must know the exact meaning of what the leadership is saying it is willing to sign up to when it says it will make its commitment to the Mitchell principles absolute.  That is why I am returning to the Mitchell principles and to the two very simple and relevant questions that the Government put to Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>It is important that there be transparency and accountability in a peace process, as in any other area of political life.  If there is to be transparency and accountability in the peace process, there must be clear answers to simple questions.  I have put those simple questions to Sinn Féin.  If there is tension, to use Deputy Ahern's words, in the republican movement because these questions are being put to them, perhaps Deputy Ahern should ask himself why that tension exists.  If tension exists in regard to being asked about the Mitchell principles, perhaps it exists because there is not yet a true commitment to those principles.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell principles have been published for quite a long time.  They have been the subject of extensive consultation. Sinn Féin was so attached to <Col N="922" /> the Mitchell principles that it protested that the British Government had binned them.  The republican movement knows what the Mitchell principles are and if there is tension within that movement perhaps it is a constructive tension which is needed to clarify the issue.  Perhaps the absence of tension on previous occasions was not a good thing.  Perhaps it indicated that the true questions were not being put by the leadership to the membership, that the membership was being told one thing while those who were dealing with the political leadership were being told something else. That type of ambiguity is not possible in matters of life and death, in this case the death of a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>There has to be clarity.  It is no exercise of charity not to put those questions clearly.  They are also simple, clear and definite that evidence of tension surrounding an inability to answer them can only be dealt with by those who feel that tension working out what their true beliefs are and recognising that any peace process involves a process of change.  It is not possible to continue with the beliefs and practices of the past if those beliefs and practices involve the continued option of the use of violence and, at the same time, to be involved successfully in a peace process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reminded the Taoiseach that there was a great deal of tension on the road to the ceasefire in August 1994.  The terrible atrocities in the fish shop on the Shankill and the bombings at Heathrow added to those tensions.  This is nothing new.  I do not have time to give a lesson on the recent history of the peace process, but things are no different now.  Everybody in this House agrees that a firm reinstatement of the August 1994 ceasefire and the signing of the Mitchell principles should be a first priority.  Sinn Féin has said that too.  It was not able to achieve that with members of the broader republican movement.  That is not the issue.  Notwithstanding the impatience of this democracy with the IRA, which is felt <Col N="923" /> by everybody in this country, I ask the Taoiseach to continue not to close doors to the republican movement.</P>
      <P>A group within the broad republican movement is trying to advance the peace process.  Perhaps it will fail.  I am sure the Taoiseach would agree with me that if in the short-term the IRA is determined to wreck the peace process there is little we can do to stop it, but perhaps we can in the long-term.  As long as some elements of the broad republican movement are striving to maintain a position of leading to a ceasefire we on this side of the House suggest that the Government should do everything it can to assist them.  It happened before that people who had been involved in violence were helped to move into the democratic system.  The Government cannot sacrifice the basic democratic principles, nonetheless much can be done.</P>
      <P>I urge the Taoiseach to maintain the Government's influence with the republican movement and not drift back into the way we have been for decades in this House &mdash; talking about it while having no influence.  We still have an apportunity to influence at least sections of the republican movement and I urge the Taoiseach to do all he can to assist.  It is the easiest thing on earth to get up here and to lecture an speak against the republican movement.  It is not easy for its members.  They are risking their lives. I ask the Taoiseach to continue to try to assist them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to tension in the republican movement. When he used the term &ldquo;tension&rdquo; earlier he did not refer to the tension arising from IRA military operations but to a tension he suggested had been created because of the questions the Government put to Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely appropriate that the questions the Government put to Sinn Féin should be put.  Those <Col N="924" /> question flow directly from the Mitchell principles and if there is tension resulting from an inability to answer them, that is aconstructive and necessary tension which must be eased by the movement.  To suggest the Government should not ask those questions is to suggest the Government should try to paper over cracks, to ignore realities and pretend things are other than they are.  The process of peace would not be served by a process of denial of the truth.</P>
      <P>As for the influence the Government might have on the republican movement it derives from the assurance it got on every one of the issues on which it sought to have assurance in regard to the talks.  This Government was successful in negotiating with the British Government to ensure we could give satisfactory answers to Sinn Féin in regard to the talks, in regard to every one of the issues it raised.  That practical record showing that politics works, and that if they come to us with reasonable requests we will pursue them reasonably and successfully, is the basis of any influence the Government has on the republican movement.  Any influence the Government has on the republican movement does not derive, as Deputy Ahern may suggest, from the Government failing to put hard questions to Sinn Féin.  It does not do credit to anyone or show respect for anyone to avoid asking a question because someone is not ready to answer it.  Talks have already started.  To take part in the talks Sinn Féin knows it has to sign up to the Mitchell principles and answer positively the two questions the Government put to it.  Sinn Féin has known for many months that those questions have to be answered.  The action of the IRA is an attempt by a section of the republican movement to answer those questions. The answer is basically, that it will not accept the Mitchell principles.  Certainly what happened in Adare and Manchester and in Clonaslee is not consistent with the Mitchell principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out to Deputy Harney, in contrast to that, the leader of Sinn <Col N="925" /> Féin said on 20 May he and his party were willing to make an absolute commitment to each one of the six Mitchell principles.  It is time for Sinn Féin and the republican movement to resolve that contradiction.  That is all that is being done at this stage.  It is owed by all of us to the victims &mdash; too many recent victims &mdash; of IRA and other forms of violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only ground for confidence is the statement by the President of Sinn Féin on 20 May that Sinn Féin was willing.  If others did so, to make its commitment absolute to the Mitchell principles.  Anything said since does not add to any confidence that might have existed in the past.  The actions of the IRA, with which Sinn Féin continues to maintain an organic link, do not add to the confidence there.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because on the basis of what was said on 20 May there is some ground for confidence. However, that confidence is being seriously diminished by events since, and by words used since.  I hope as a result of the very clear statement on the issue, those elements in Sinn Féin and in the republican movement who want to accept the Mitchell principles and <Col N="926" /> who want to put violence behind them for good will win the argument and a united republican movement will go irrevocably onto the path of peace and non-violent non-threatening politics.  It is a hope dimmed considerably by events and words uttered by the republican movement in recent days and weeks but it is nonetheless a hope which has some foundation in the words used by the President of Sinn Féin when he said on 20 May his party was willing to make an absolute commitment to the Mitchell principles.  We must return to that as a basis for some hope.  Obviously the questions I put on behalf of the Government to Sinn Féin were founded on the Mitchell principles to which Sinn Féin said it was willing to make an absolute commitment.</P>

      <P>Article 28 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;the Government shall consist of not less than seven and not more than fifteen members who shall be appointment by the President in accordance with the provisions of [the] Constitution&rdquo;. It is a matter for the Taoiseach of the day &mdash; not an independent review group &mdash; to decide on the allocation of functions among members of the Government within the constraints imposed by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, it would not be possible to have a stand-alone department for every area of economic activity.  Combining the tourism and trade sectors in one department means that both can be <Col N="927" /> tightly focused on aggressively seeking and delivering real and significant improvement in this country's foreign earnings and job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that many of the issues dealt with by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht also come within the ambit of the Department of the Marine?  Will the Minister further agree that because tourism has become such a huge money earner it is time it was dealt with by one Department?  So far as the Constitution is concerned I presume that the Minister is referring to is that it is for the Taoiseach to decide after the next election if there should be a stand alone Department.</P>
      <P>With the prospect of 4.5 million visitors this year, it will not be long before the tourism industry is bigger than agriculture. Does the Minister agree it is time to at least consider the possibility of a stand alone department for tourism and that trade should be sidelined to another Department?</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews was a member of the Government that set up the Department of Tourism and Trade in 1993 and it has been a great success.  There are 31 personnel dealing with tourism matters in the Department, staff in the personnel section, the finance unit and the press office cover the entire Department.  Trade and tourism have a common element.  Both sectors can be aggressive seekers and deliverers of real and significant improvement in the country's foreign earnings and, consequently, create jobs.  This is the first time both sectors have been combined in a single Department where their potential can be pursued in a focused and disciplined manner and I am happy to lead that charge.  In a recent contribution to a relevant committee Deputy Andrews stated that his party is committed to a stand alone department for tourism.  That would be a matter for a Taoiseach of his party, but I do not believe Fianna Fáil will <Col N="928" /> have an opportunity to set up such a Department for some considerable time.</P>

I was in Government when tourism and trade were linked under one Department, but there has been a change.  Tourism should be separated from trade and linked to another Department.  I can put my hand on my heart and say there will be a stand alone department for tourism when Fianna Fáil get back into Government, either as a single party Government or as part of a coalition, following the next general election.</P>

I agree that tourism is now an engine for economic development and I concur with the Deputy's sentiments in regard to the number of tourists that will visit Ireland this year.  Trade and tourism complement each other on the international platform and people who come here on trade missions also associate themselves with tourism.</P>

      <P>Inquiries to the Bord Fáilte London office dropped off by about 15 per cent and there was some slowdown in new bookings in the immediate aftermath of the recent bombing.  However, this year's tourism <Col N="929" /> season is performing strongly to date, in particular from Britain, and Bord Fáilte forecast about 4.7 million visitors by year end, including 2.5 million from Britain.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is, of course, continuing to closely monitor the situation in association with the key carriers, tour operators and product suppliers.  Appropriate strategies to deal with situations such as this have already been considered by Bord Fáilte and the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative who, notwithstanding the latest incidents, will continue to promote and sell Ireland as vigorously as possible on the British market.</P>

I compliment the Minister on his efforts to indicate to the greater British public that we are a civilised race and that only a small minority are plugging away on behalf of some spiritual effort, as they see it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Planning for the future needs, financial and otherwise, of the tourism industry is an ongoing process within my Department and inherent in that process is the monitoring of the impact of the main instrument for the development of the tourism sector &mdash; the EU supported Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.</P>
      <P>One of the principal objectives of this programme is to encourage and secure the active participation of the industry in developing and shaping its own future.  EU aid under the programme has, for example, been made available to stimulate and increase additional marketing activity such as the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative to ensure that Irish tourism develops on a self-sustainable basis in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While tourism promotion is always likely to require some ongoing support to sustain growth in tourist numbers and revenue, a careful review of developments over the period of the current and previous operational programme, <Col N="931" /> their impact on the level and quality of tourism facilities in this country, and on tourism operations, will be necessary before any considered views can be reached on future development needs and priorities.  Support for the tourism industry in future will to a large extent be determined by the impact of the existing measures under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, and the availability of resources.</P>
    <P>While it is likely that Government will continue to provide some ongoing support for the promotion of Irish tourism, it will be up to the industry to take increasing responsibility for the future marketing of its product.  The growth in industry support for the OTMI in 1996 over 1995 is an encouraging trend and while many business concerns benefit hugely from overseas tourists they make little or no direct contribution to attracting them.  Increasing participation and investment by the industry is a logical and natural progression which is most desirable for the development of the industry to ensure its viability in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The Government is currently developing its strategy for the next round of Structural Fund negotiations to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland in the negotiations on the financial perspective for the period 2000-2005. These negotiations are expected to commence in the second half of 1997 when it will be necessary to show that Ireland and the tourism industry, in particular, has put European Union money to good use and made its own contribution to ensure the continued successful development of the sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to business concerns that benefit from tourism but make little or no contribution to marketing.  Will he specify who they are and the plans in place to ensure they contribute in the future?  He also referred to the tranche of European funding for the period 2000-2005 which will be discussed in the latter part of 1997.  What are the Government's plans <Col N="932" /> to ensure Ireland in general, or at least some regions, continue to benefit from category one status?  Can those in the tourism industry feel secure in the knowledge that they will have ongoing EU funding, even if the Government must lay the groundwork for it during our Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Killeen raised a number of questions.  The position under the Operational Programme, 1994-99, is that Structural Funds will cease at that time.  I have started a debate in the tourism industry so that it understands it will have to shoulder an increasing sense of responsibility for its future development without the benefit of European assistance.  This debate is timely, opportune and necessary because there appears to be a perception in some areas that this will continue <i>ad infinitum</i> when in fact there are continued requirements for hard work, commitment and a high level of motivation and investment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killeen will be aware of the huge increase in property values and investment in hotel developments.  Allocations of approximately £300 million have made been under the European programme to the product investment area.  A large number of firms, including construction and hardware firms &mdash; those involved in the provision of capital facilities &mdash; benefit from this.  It is important to understand that this area of the industry is a direct beneficiary of the investment in the tourism product. The discourse I initiated is in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a Government strategy for the period 2000-05, obviously it has not formed its final view on this because these discussions will not commence until mid-1997.  It will be important to be able to show our colleagues in Europe that we have used Union funding which we received over the past two operational programmes judiciously, wisely and prudently and that we have in place a tourism product which is sustainable and of lasting benefit in which quality is the hallmark.  I hope to be able <Col N="933" /> to demonstrate that clearly when the time comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>An important factor in trying to promote and develop Ireland further as a tourist destination is the question of access.  While it has improved greatly as far as access from London, in particular, is concerned, from where there are frequent flights at low fares, will the Minister agree the position is not as satisfactory in terms of access to other airports in Ireland and from any other destination outside Ireland, apart from London?  In view of the huge upsurge in travel from the London area, will the Minister take steps to ensure an increase in travel to Ireland from the United States, continental Europe in particular, and provincial parts of Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to see a stronger operation to the regional airports in Ireland than at present.  The Dublin-London route is one of the busiest air routes in the world, so access has become very cheap on it.  This is really a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications with whom I have had a number of discussions, particularly in relation to further access from continental Europe and from North America.  I can give the Deputy details of what is involved if he tables a question.  Of the 170,000 charter seats from continental Europe this year, 130,000 are destined for the regional airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley is aware that Aer Lingus opened up Chicago as a third gateway from North America, which will prove successful.  The Deputy served in this Department and is well aware that these are commercial decisions for the airlines, we are doing everything we can to make it as commercially attractive as possible for them. We are in constant discussion with our colleagues in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the airlines as regards presenting Ireland as an attractive location for holidays.  The Deputy will be aware that <Col N="934" /> an airline has made projections of being able to bring in several hundred thousand extra people from continental Europe if certain changes are made in landing charges and fees.  These are matters for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications with whom I am in discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear what the Minister said but it is not enough for a Minister for Tourism and Trade to say these are matters for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Great pressure should be put on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and his Department to ensure these requirements are met, so we can see an increase in access transport. Is the Minister aware that the 170,000 charter seats from continental Europe &mdash; which sounds great &mdash; to which he referred is the equivalent of two to three weeks in one year on the Dublin-London route?  That puts the figure in perspective.</P>
      <P>The figure we should be talking about in terms of flights from continental Europe to airports like Shannon, Cork and Knock should be in the region of one million or more each year because there is a market to which people should have access, bearing in mind that it costs more than twice as much to travel to Ireland than to a corresponding distance to Spain from a location in continental Europe.</P>

The question refers to future investment in promoting Ireland as a tourism destination.  In that context I dealt with the operational programme and the Government's future strategy.  As I said, I can give the Deputy up-to-date details.  I am in constant contact with my colleague, the <Col N="935" /> Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, on this issue and I realise its significance.  However, the Government cannot dictate the final sequence in that commercial decisions are made by airline carriers.  If the Deputy wishes to table a question, I will answer it in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>During his initial response, the Minister mentioned some ongoing support from the Exchequer for tourism in the event of Euro-support ending.  Will he agree that a better approach by Government would be to say that given the importance and growth of the industry, it should receive substantial ongoing State investment to enable it to continue to bring the type of necessary investment into this country? As regards Deputy O'Malley's question, I put down in excess of 60 questions today of which about 19 referred to access and the ITIC report on regional distribution in tourism, all of which were ruled out of order.  It would be far more constructive and the tourism industry would be better served if such questions were answered in the House rather than being told they are matters for Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations.</P>

Deputies have an opportunity to raise these matters and to receive replies during discussions on the Estimates, on motions or at a committee.  I have no difficulty responding to any details.  The Department, through its own resources, and Bord Fáilte, through its marketing resources, fund the ongoing promotion of Ireland, which we intend to continue.  Following the Arthur D. Little report on the proposed new structures for Bord Fáilte, it has now become a top class international <Col N="936" /> marketing agency.  Its job is to market Ireland, North and South, internationally.</P>
      <P>It is doing that both through its own resources and by its involvement in the overseas tourism marketing initiative, which is proving very successful.</P>

      <P>The Minister tells me I should put down detailed questions about these matters but I would be wasting my time.  I have done it so many times and the questions have been disallowed &mdash; that is why he is inviting me to put them down.  Will the Minister send me the information on access transport without my having to put down questions? That would solve that problem. Will he agree that in promoting Ireland as a tourist destination, the greatest harm is done by events such as those in Canary Wharf, Manchester and Adare and that the people who act as the greatest disincentive to economic growth are those who carry out acts such as those in Canary Wharf, Manchester and Adare and those who support them?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right.  I witnessed the consequences of the Canary Wharf bomb &mdash; in two milliseconds £100 million worth of damage was done to the buildings, but potentially five times that much damage could have been done to the international reputation and perception of Ireland.  These were acts of lunacy which were not done in the name of this House or of the people of Ireland.  We must continue to work through the democratic process to ensure that these events are ended forever. I agree with the Deputy whole-heartedly in that regard.  The Deputy has been in this House for a very long time and knows how to phrase a question about air access, but I will endeavour to send him as much detail as possible relevant to his questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission's Green Paper on the Role of the Union in the Field of Tourism was published in April 1995. Ireland's general position on the various options set out in the paper is towards supporting a specific Treaty competence in tourism for the Union, along the lines of other policy areas which are the subject of detailed provisions in the existing Treaty, e.g. the industry chapter.  This issue is currently under discussion in the intergovernmental conference and we remain open to discussing with our Union partners the modalities of the inclusion of a title on tourism in a revised Treaty.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the European Commission has recently adopted a proposal for a Council decision, based on Article 235 of the Treaty, to establish the &ldquo;Philoxenia&rdquo; programme to assist European tourism.  This proposal, which is currently the subject of consideration at Council working group level, is a follow up to the first Community Action Plan to assist tourism, which expired at the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper does not, <i>per se,</i> have specific implications for the tourism industry in Ireland.  With regard to any development in the role of the Union <i>vis-á-vis</i> tourism that may emerge, however, my priority would be to ensure a framework which would allow for the creation of an environment favourable to tourism industry competitiveness, profitability and growth, and which would not lead to the development of a highly regulatory regime or enforced convergence of member states practices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am favourable to this matter being included in a revised Treaty which will be the subject of working groups of the Intergovernmental Conference, but I do not wish to see highly regulatory regimes introduced in our current tourism practices. On 30 April this year the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision to establish what is known as the Philoxenia programme to assist European tourism.  The objectives are to improve knowledge in the field of tourism, improve the legislative and financial environment for tourism, improve quality in European tourism and increase the number of tourists from third countries.  This programme was discussed at a Tourism Council of Ministers meeting on 13 May and the proposal was referred to a Council working group for examination.  I hope during our Presidency to progress work on this proposal with a view to discussion and possible adoption at the Tourism Council Meeting scheduled for 24 October. Given the delay in bringing forward the proposal, however, it may not be possible to meet that timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will have a constructive input in that matter as he will be chairman at that time.  He referred to Article 235 of the Treaty which deals with funding.  Will he have an opportunity to ensure that Ireland continues to benefit from European funding for tourism after the year 2000, by which time his colleagues may tell him that the country has benefited enormously and has shown huge growth in tourism?  Will he be in a position to argue that there is continued potential in this regard and that losses in other areas need to be offset by growth in revenue from tourism?</P>

The Government strategy for the adoption of funding, if any, for the years 2000 to 2005 will not begin until mid-1997 at which point I will be in a position to demonstrate clearly that we have used EU funding wisely, prudently and well for the benefit of tourism.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 46 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the Tour de France come to Ireland in 1998 as has been proposed. The scale of financial assistance required to make this possible, however, is beyond the resources of my Department. It would require a co-ordinated response on the part of Government, covering a number of Departments and State agencies and the relevant local authorities.  I have undertaken over the coming weeks to explore with appropriate Ministers the prospects of bringing the tour to Ireland.  As to the route the <Col N="940" /> tour might take in Ireland, this would be a matter for the tour organisers to decide in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from media coverage that the Minister has a particular preference with regard to the location that might be visited.  Does he agree with the Waterford Deputies in terms of their wishes in that regard? How realistic are the prospects of Ireland hosting a stage of the Tour de France and what progress has been made in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospects are real. The Tour de France is organised by a highly qualified professional organisation and there is no room for sponsorship outside those who have been involved for a number of years.  It is one of the largest sporting events in the world &mdash; with television rights extended to 100 countries, reaching an estimated 960 million people.  An entourage of about 3,500 to 4,000 people travels constantly with the tour.  Every second year the organisers offer to individual countries the opportunity to host the prologue and a stage or so of the tour, and an offer has been made to Ireland in that regard.  I have had a number of meetings, the most recent of which was with three eminent members involved in the cycling business, at which the options were discussed in a clear and realistic fashion.  I have undertaken to discuss the matter with my colleagues and to report back in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no scope for sponsorship from corporations or private companies in Ireland.  The money would have to be provided by State resources, State agencies or local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In France, for instance, towns, cities or boroughs are charged a substantial <Col N="941" /> fee for the start and for the ending of a stage of the tour and it is in that context I want to discuss the options with my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe his Department is ready to take full advantage of a decision that may be taken to hold stages of the Tour de France in this country having regard to the entourage he mentioned and the large number of potential tourists who may consider coming here to watch the event?  Their interest in cycling matters would be a major factor in their decision to visit this country.  Is the Minister aware that cycling tourists arriving in Ireland through Dublin Airport find difficulty in travelling to the city centre because the signposts indicate that the only route is along the motorway? Those problems should be addressed now rather than later when we may discover that we are unable to cater for such tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We are capable of catering for an influx of visitors to Ireland for large events such as this.  It is important that we not only market the country as a friendly and attractive location but that we are also in a position to host a series of important events around which tourists can plan their holidays.  The entourage to which I referred would not be travelling by air in this instance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were it to be realised.  I am sure this is a local authority and Aer Rianta problem and no doubt the Deputy has had discussions with them about it.  I will take note of the Deputy's comments, however, as I realise it would be frustrating for cycling tourists wishing to travel into the city centre to be directed down a motorway. These practical matters can be rectified.</P>

I would be in a position to make a strong case on the consequences for tourism were such a tax envisaged.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar questions, the Minister for Justice has primary responsibility for tackling the problem of crime, including crime against tourists. My colleague has, in the past, outlined measures to address the problem of crime generally.  In response to a Dáil question on 15 May last she indicated that the issue of crime against tourists received the highest priority from her Department and the Garda authorities and outlined measures taken in co-operation with Bord Fáilte and tourism interests to ensure that crimes of this nature are minimised to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>The level of crime against tourists is extremely low by international standards. For example, Department of Justice figures for 1994 show a total of 3,120 crimes against tourists or 0.80 per cent of the total tourism numbers of 3.63 million, predominantly petty crimes e.g. theft from parked cars, etc.  Last year a survey carried out by &ldquo;WHICH&rdquo; magazine showed that Ireland had the fourth lowest theft rate of 44 countries surveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> There is no acceptable level of crime and it is essential that tourists who fall victim receive as much support as possible. This is provided primarily through the Tourist Victim Support Service, which was set up in 1994 and operates from premises provided by the Department of Justice in Harcourt Square, Dublin.  Bord Fáilte provided £10,000 this year towards the service which provides emotional and practical support, such as assistance in replacing passports, travel documents, travellers cheques, etc. to tourist victims, who must be referred to it by the Garda.  Benefit-in-kind rather than direct financial aid is provided by the tourism industry.  This includes emergency accommodation, travel tickets, clothing and toiletries, meal vouchers etc.  The service has a full-time co-ordinator and some 30 volunteer staff with a range of foreign languages and specialist training in tourist victim support.  The success of the service to date is reflected in the rising level of support it receives from the business community and the positive feedback from tourists that it has assisted.</P>
    <P>Finally, it must be remembered that crime is a worldwide phenomenon and while Ireland is a safe and friendly destination people should take reasonable precautions as they would in any other country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been an appreciable increase in the number of people seeking help from the Tourist Victim Support Service in Dublin?  Is the sum of £10,000 which the Minister mentioned and which is provided by Bord Fáilte sufficient or will it be necessary to increase that funding?  What level of service is available to people who are attacked in cities outside of Dublin or in rural areas as happened in my area recently?  Can those people avail of the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>They can avail of the service but, obviously, there is a time factor involved in dealing with these requests.  I wish to outline a number of <Col N="945" /> initiatives being taken.  Regular liaison is taking place between the Garda authorities. Bord Fáilte and tourism interests.  There is deployment of additional Garda patrols in areas of high tourism interest.  A Garda office established in O'Connell Street acts as a centre for advising tourists on safety measures.  Safety leaflets in three languages and city maps are produced and distributed by the Garda.  Ten thousand pounds is a reasonable sum to be provided. The service has received good support from the business community and the feedback, particularly from those unfortunate enough to have been the victim of some crime, petty or otherwise, has been heartening.  I will give the Deputy some figures that may be of interest to him.  In 1988 the total number of crimes against tourists was 2,391, of which 2,121 occurred in Dublin.  In 1989 the figure decreased by 10 per cent to 2,365, of which 1,992, or 6 per cent, occurred in the Dublin area.  I have given the Deputy the figure for 1994. The total number of victims represents 0.005 per cent of total visitor numbers. In other words, 99,995 per cent of visitors who come to Ireland do so in safety. As I said in my reply, visitors should take the same level of caution here as they would in any other country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in response to previous similar Dáil questions, the Operations Programme for <Col N="946" /> Tourism 1989-1993 did not provide support for tourist accommodation projects. Based on the readiness of the commercial market to respond to growth in visitor numbers without grant assistance this policy was, in general, continued under the current operational programme.</P>
      <P>The current programme recognised, however, that there were a number of market segments where the quality of existing accommodation was deficient and included a provision to assist on a selective basis, investment in certain areas.  These are: accommodation related conference and leisure facilities; a limited scheme of accommodation improvements to existing small and medium sized hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star; limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation needs such as caravan and camping park facilities and upgrading and improvement of existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes; provision of new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuits centres in remote areas currently without appropriate accommodation; improvement of existing accommodation; at approved residential equestrian centres; horsedrawn caravan and motor-home investments; the additional cost of providing, in existing hotels, suitable accessfriendly accommodation for people with disabilities; and improved access for people with disabilities at hotels and major visitor centres.  In keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new development and all accommodation supported must be registered or approved, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds provided under the programme for tourism development projects are generally over-subscribed and, unfortunately, those available for <Col N="947" /> specialist accommodation related developments are fully committed.  These and other aspects of the programme's operations will be considered fully in the context of the upcoming mid-term evaluation of the programme.</P>
    <P>Other EU funded programmes such as the Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry and the Leader II Programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the local urban and rural development programme provide support for smaller tourism initiatives. In the Border counties assistance may also be available under the IFI and INTERREG programmes and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, again on a limited basis.  This includes limited provision for accommodation projects, including, in some cases, guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments, on a basis compatible with that in the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    <P>All registered and approved tourism accommodation has been deemed eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched last September by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  A sum of £52 million of this £208 million fund has been specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country. However, I understand that virtually all of the funds available under the scheme have been committed at this stage.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties, was recently introduced under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund. Investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax relief under the scheme.</P>

While a number of the schemes, particularly those that relate to the Border areas &mdash; the IFI, INTERREG and the Peace and Reconciliation Fund &mdash; do not have specific categories of tourism targeted funds available, it is possible to construct assistance, depending on the nature of the project, under the schemes.  If I can get details of the draw down of funds in the years involved, I will forward them to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that some of the accommodation referred to in the question is deficient in standard and needs improvement?  It does not help the tourism industry to have sub-standard accommodation in certain areas.  Does the Minister not consider it a priority to try to improve these standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the things that happened following the Little report on the future structure of Bord Fáilte.  The standards are those of Bord Fáilte but they are now being implemented by companies which tendered for that work.  Standards are rising rapidly.</P>
      <P>I agree we do not want sub-standard accommodation.  Any accommodation assisted under the programmes I mentioned must be registered and approved. I have said on a number of occasions that investment should be made on the basis of quality and commitment to a sustainable development of the tourism sector.  That is in everybody's interest because this is an area where the economic dividend can be paid to everybody. Experience of poor accommodation will not secure good ambassadors for our standards.  We try to project the image of quality in all we do &mdash; personnel, service facilities and product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's view that we must not pussyfoot around accommodation standards.  That is why there is a requirement that such accommodation <Col N="949" /> is registered and approved if it is to be assisted to any extent.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the level of funding for the Border areas reflects the additional funding due under INTERREG?  I am aware that the peace initiative funding is additional.  With regard to how the money is spent, does the Minister accept that of the six Border counties only Donegal and, to a lesser extent, Sligo, have a developed tourism industry and that they benefit to a greater extent than the other counties by virtue of the structure of funding for tourism?  Under that structure projects costing over £100,000 benefit to a larger extent.  Does the Minister agree that, while the better off counties in the tourism sector are doing well, the lesser developed Border counties which did not have a traditional tourism industry and suffered greatly as a result of the past 25 years do not have the same advantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It was difficult for people north and south of the Border to invest in a realistic way, particularly in view of what was required.  The outstanding exception was the development of the Slieve Russell, which was carried out during the troubles and was an outstanding success before and since the ceasefire.</P>
      <P>Everybody was eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme and these funds are now committed.  People told me on numberours occasions that they did not want grants and would prefer access to cheap money.  On meeting delegations from the Border counties, I find an increased understanding that this is the sector in which much of our future lies because of its economic importance and potential for job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the IFI fund, the hotel and guesthouse improvement scheme applied to projects in the Border counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo.  This scheme was aimed specifically at assisting one and two star hotels and guesthouses to <Col N="950" /> improve the physical standard of their accommodation and guest facilities.  On completion of works, hotels were required to have a minimum total of ten bedrooms with private bathrooms and guesthouses were required to have, at a minimum, a total of five bedrooms, four with private bathrooms.  A maximum grant of 33 per cent applied to eligible works for the various areas.</P>
    <P>New accommodation will probably not be funded under the INTERREG programme in view of the limited funds available.  With regard to the peace and reconciliation programme for the Border counties, under measure 1 of the sub-programme II for urban and village renewal and tourism, there may be assistance towards the improvement of tourist accommodation.  This area is being examined by a task force comprising representatives of the county councils, CEBs, RTOs, the Arts Council and other relevant bodies.  There may be scope for the provision of assistance for such accommodation under that heading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>Overall responsibility for the promotion and development of Irish tourism in overseas markets rests with Bord Fáilte.  I am advised by Bord Fáilte that it has set up a new market development unit to identify, evaluate and exploit opportunities emerging in markets outside Western Europe and North America. Bord Fáilte has also been undertaking a variety of activities in these markets such as participation at major consumer shows, travel trade seminars, trade advertising, media visits to Ireland and direct consumer advertising.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ellis inquires specifically about the number of Japanese tourists who visited Ireland in recent years.  The number of tourists from this market in 1993 was 18,000 rising to 22,000 in 1994 and 30,000 in 1995.  Overall, this represents an increase of 67 per cent in visitor numbers since 1993.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Marketing Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 recognises the opportunities to develop new business from markets such as Australia, Canada, India, Japan, South America, South Africa and South East Asia.  To this end, the marketing sub-programme envisages providing support for marketing programmes which are aimed at diversifying into new markets in Europe and further afield and the sub-programme allows for higher maximum aid rates for such new market activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that London, which is a 55 minute flight from Dublin, is chock full of tourists from these countries, particularly Japanese tourists who are readily identifiable as they tend to travel in groups.  Even though there may be an increase in the number of these tourists who visit Ireland, the figure is still tiny. Japanese tourists are among the most high spending tourists in the world and we should make an effort to develop that market.  Is the scheme which was operated some years ago under which visitors from these countries who travelled to London got a free flight to an Irish airport still in existence?  What specific steps does the Minister propose to increase the number of tourists from these potentially lucrative markets which are not being tackled at present? In his reply the Minister spoke globally and did not refer specifically to these markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is drawing on his experience of dealing with south east Asia and Japan when he was a Minister.  He is correct to the extent that the factors which have inhibited the growth of tourism from Japan include a low consumer awareness of Ireland, a lack of traditional family or ancestral links compared to long haul markets such as Australia and the US&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no ancestors in London either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the high cost of travel between Ireland and Japan and the absence of direct airlinks.  While discussions have taken place on this matter, it is unlikely that airlines would regard flights from Japan to Ireland as commercially viable.  On the question of a common air fare rating from Tokyo to London, this point has been made on a number of occasions.  Another inhibiting factor has been the absence of a full-time Bord Fáilte office in Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the matter in context, the number of Japanese people travelling <Col N="953" /> abroad increased from 100,000 in 1963 to more than 13 million in 1995.  Deputy O'Malley was accurate in his observation that Japanese people travel in extensive numbers to Rome, Paris and London which have internationally known landmark tourist attractions. Bord Fáilte has focused on the Japanese market to some extent and a number of encouraging developments have taken place in recent years.  For example, a part-time Bord Fáilte representative in Tokyo was appointed in 1992, packages to Ireland are now offered by 19 Japanese tour operators &mdash; ten packages include a few days in Britain &mdash; and a further five Japanese operators offer fully inclusive tours for individuals only and language study tours.</P>
    <P>A sum of £100,000 was allocated to Bord Fáilte from the Tourism Promotion and Development Fund in 1994 and 1995 to support additional promotional activities, including travel trade promotions, advertising etc.  These advertisements which were aimed directly at consumers were placed in Japanese national newspapers and included special product advertising, including golf, English language learning and support for travel trade media visits to Ireland.  The strategy has been to develop a relationship with leading tour operators in Japan and to secure steady and long-term growth by focusing on particular niche markets such as golf, sports and English language students.  I have discussed the matter with Japanese operators and, given their traditional attitude towards holiday periods, it is much easier, more economical and more convenient for Japanese people to engage in these activities in south east Asia.  I am aware of the potential of this market and I hope we can continue to develop it.</P>
    <P>This year £1.235 million was made available to supplement Bord Fáilte's promotion and marketing spend overseas. Bord Fáilte has finalised its plans for the allocation of these funds which are directed towards the development of the markets referred to in the question. I hope the Japanese and other <Col N="954" /> markets continue to improve as a result of these initiatives.  I have made the point at trade missions abroad and with inward buyer missions here that in future countries which send frequent trade missions to Europe should include either a half day or one day visit to Ireland both from an industry-business sense so that they can see the quality of our facilities and also to give them a flavour of how different we are from other European countries.  I hope we are making progress in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many other major tourist markets nearer home, particularly Britain, where we are not realising our true potential.  This is mainly due to the lack of interest by travel agents in organising package tours and charter flights.  Given the excellent airports in Sligo, Knock, Carrickfinn and Galway, will the Minister organise a special mission in so far as the west is concerned?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley's question referred to the revenue yield from high spending Japanese tourists. We have already discussed package tours.  A few weeks ago I attended the opening of the travel trade fair for 1997 in the Burlington Hotel and at least 5,000 interviews were set up between product buyers from Britain and Irish travel operators on the issue of package tours and other specific requirements. The aspects mentioned by the Deputy have been taken into account in a number of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The special EU support programme for peace and reconciliation envisages the provision of £48 million in EU funding for the first three years, 1995-97, of the initiative for the Border counties.

      <P>Does the Minister accept there is a great discrepancy in the tourism industry between the various counties in the Border region?  What plans has he to ensure that counties that do not have a tradition of tourism but have the potential to develop the industry, are afforded an opportunity to do so?  Will he review and refocus the various funds under the aegis of his Department to ensure they are given that opportunity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon will be aware that one of my priorities under the European Regional Development Fund programme administered by my Department and the independent product board is to ensure, so far as is possible, that these moneys are spread across as much of the country as possible. Obviously, the board is entitled to deal with applications submitted from various regions.  The troubles in Northern Ireland and the Border regions generally, resulted in a slow down, if not a standstill, in many facets of tourism development.  Under the programme for peace and reconciliation, three measures identified in sub-programme 2 (c) &mdash; urban and rural regeneration, in particular, identify tourism projects and facilities among many initiatives which may be eligible for assistance.  These three measures are: urban and village renewal and tourism, village renewal <Col N="956" /> and tourism and community-led development, in respect of which the EU grant rate is up to a maximum of 75 per cent.  At this stage it is not possible to forecast the final outcome.  A midterm review of the Operational Programme for Tourism will be carried out in the near future to ascertain how funds are being dispersed under the various headings, where they are being allocated and what value is being had for European Union assistance here.  In that sense I take note of the point the Deputy made, but my main objective and priority is to have such funds spread through as many areas as possible so that many regions and people derive an economic dividend from it.</P>

      <P>Regarding the taking of parliamentary questions during the summer recess, we have an extensive system of parliamentary questions in this House. Questions are answered at four day's notice for the bulk of the year.  In most other parliamentary jurisdictions, members must wait one, two, three or four weeks, in some cases, for answers to questions.  We have one of the shortest periods from the posing to the answering of a question in any parliamntary system in the world.  It applies for virtually the entire year with the exception of, effectively, the second half of July, August and the first half of September. The administrative burden involved in answering those questions is substantial.  Very significant procedures must be gone through in checking and cross-checking the factual position in regard to the replies.  Anything that goes on the record of the House must be accurate, as Deputies will rightly complain if something included in the most minor parliamentary reply is not fully accurate.  We should not change the existing procedure because Deputies have all the existing facilities for parliamentary questions during Dáil sitting times and the administrative burden of providing those facilities during the Dáil recess would be unduly substantial and out of proportion to any benefits that would be derived from it.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahern.  It is hard to believe that the Taoiseach is the same person who told the Dáil in November 1994 how much he believed in the supremacy of the parliamentary question and that the Ceann Comhairle should be given new powers to ensure that parliamentary questions were extensively and comprehensively answered.  The Taoiseach said the system is working satisfactorily but that is not the case.  Last week I tabled a question about the activities of the Government press secretary.  That question was transferred by the Taoiseach to the Department of Justice to be answered on 23 July but the House will not be sitting on that date.  The system is unsatisfactory with the Taoiseach transferring questions that are awkward for him at any given time.  There is no continuity from one week to the next regarding what the Taoiseach accepts.  I ask him to consider seriously what is being put forward by the Opposition which is in the interests of reforming this House and is surely more relevant to the people we represent.  It is something about which the Taoiseach felt strongly when in Opposition.  He was the champion of Dáil reform when in Opposition, and I do not see why he should justify abandoning it in its entirety now.</P>

      <P>The last remark was gratuitous.  A Dáil reform document was prepared by the Whips, and there has been agreement in that regard. Many of the proposals came from Fianna Fáil and the two things still at issue relate to written questions and matters of concern.  When the Taoiseach was in Opposition in 1990 he asked for and proposed, if he got into Government, to bring in written questions during the Dáil recess.  On matters of concern, we did not oppose the Government's proposal in early 1995. We queried the way in which Ministers were responding to matters of concern which were raised.  The Government was proposing that the Ministers should respond by letter.  We wanted them to come into the House to respond.</P>

We have over 20 committees, and small parties in particular have major difficulties in attending them all.  If we are to have committees, one of the best ways of informing oneself in preparation for dealing with a Bill is to table parliamentary questions.  It is not the case that because there are committees meeting during the summer we do not need questions.  The opposite is the case.  The Taoiseach should remember he researched this document many times over the years.  In fairness, would the Taoiseach not agree to a suggestion, which would be agreeable to everybody in this House, including Government Deputies, that on one day a week for three weeks in July and three weeks in September we have written questions? Will the Taoiseach answer?</P>

Since I tabled a parliamentary question on the matter last week we have had the Felloni case and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, on the radio last Saturday told the nation that if we want to find out about bail we should raise the issue in the Dáil.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce this Bill and I look forward to hearing Deputies' contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland must not lag behind other modern and progressive countries with regard to relevant current international standards of maritime law.  My purpose in introducing this Bill is to bring Irish law, in relation to the carriage of goods and passengers by sea, into line with current international standards as <Col N="1195" /> reflected in a number of relevant international conventions, namely the London Convention, the Athens Convention and the Brussels Convention.  The Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Bill, 1996, will put in place a charter for the providers and recipients of maritime transport services &mdash; that is the owners of Irish registered ships, and the passengers and shippers using these ships &mdash; as well as for those others who may suffer loss or damage caused by Irish registered ships.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important step towards levelling the playing pitch for Irish shipowners, shippers and exporters as against our international competitors. Our proximity to some of the world's busiest shipping lanes and our consequently enhanced exposure to possible compensation claims resulting from maritime incidents serves to highlight the necessity and the desirability of updating the legislation.  This Bill will give effect in domestic law to three international conventions on shipowners' liability.  The conventions establish the commercial relationship between shipowners and their clients, the passengers and shippers.</P>
    <P>The intention behind the introduction of the conventions and their Protocols was to remedy a number of deficiencies that existed in earlier conventions concerning claims for compensation in maritime incidents.  This was achieved by: (i) establishing a uniform international regime for determining the limits of liability and the methods by which these amounts would be computed.  The Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund was adopted as the &ldquo;currency&rdquo; for the purpose of stating the limits of liability; (ii) raising the limits of liability to a more realistic level but at the same time making it possible for a shipowner to insure at a reasonable cost; (iii) making the right to limit liability virtually unbreakable unless loss is caused by deliberate negligence or recklessness on the part of the shipowner, ship operator, manager, charterer or carrier.  A claimant must <Col N="1196" /> prove such negligence or recklessness through the courts; (iv) providing &mdash; in the case of the Athens and Brussels Conventions &mdash; a uniform means of establishing liability by clarifying the rights and responsibilities of carriers, passengers and shippers.  The London Convention deals exclusively with rules in relation to limitation of liability whatever the basis of liability may be.</P>
    <P>Shipping is vital to a small open economy such as ours.  More than 75 per cent of our imports and exports are carried by sea.  Shipping, in general, and certainly in so far as it affects us, is an international, even global business.  International fora and conventions play an important role in setting agreed standards in respect of ships of different flags.  While a small country such as ours could not claim to have tremendous power or influence on the international maritime front, it is important that nations large and small contribute towards international co-operation in the common interest.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a house-keeping exercise. It is a levelling of the playing pitch with regard to maritime law.  It will introduce into our law the three international conventions and Protocols already mentioned and will enable the State to accede to them in due course.  All these instruments are in force internationally. Accession to the conventions will mean shipowners will know the extent of their liability unless they are deliberately negligent or reckless in running their vessels. The limits of liability will apply whether they are involved in a marine incident within the jurisdiction or outside it.</P>
    <P>The fact that a Master made a mistake, was negligent in some respect or the navigation gear was faulty would not rule out limitation.  It is a matter for a claimant to prove deliberate intent to cause loss or damage in the courts.</P>
    <P>The London Convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976, came into force internationally in 1986, and to date 26 states including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, <Col N="1197" /> France, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium have become parties.</P>
    <P>The Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974, and the Protocol of 1976 came into force internationally in 1987 and 1989, respectively.  To date 22 states including the United Kingdom, Spain and Belgium have become parties to the Convention; 18 states including the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal have become parties to the Protocol.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Brussels Convention, the Protocol of 1968 to this came into force internationally on 23 June 1977. To date some 30 states including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands have become parties to the convention. The Protocol of 1979 came into force internationally in 1984 and 28 states have become parties.</P>
    <P>All three instruments provide for limits of liability.  The London Convention deals exclusively with rules in relation to limitation irrespective of who is liable.  The other two conventions lay down the rules for establishing liability. This Bill provides for the London Convention to take precedence over both the Athens and Brussels Conventions.</P>
    <P>Ships which operate in our waters but which belong to countries that have previously acceded to these conventions already enjoy the benefit of their terms. This Bill will extend these terms to the owners of Irish registered ships &mdash; currently numbering 73.  The terms will also extend to passengers and shippers using Irish registered vessels as well as to other parties subjected to damage or loss caused by Irish registered vessels.</P>
    <P>The limitation of shipowners' liability is governed by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, as amended.  Shipowners may limit liability in the case of: (a) loss of life or personal injury either alone or together with loss of or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise or other things to an aggregate amount not exceeding £15 per ton of the ship's registered tonnage; and (b) loss of or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise or other things, <Col N="1198" /> whether there be additional loss of life or personal injury or not, to an aggregate amount not exceeding £8 per ton of the ship's registered tonnage.  The right to limitation, however, is subject to the condition that the occurrence takes place without the carrier's actual &ldquo;fault or privity&rdquo;, that is knowledge that loss or damage will, or is likely to, occur.</P>
    <P>Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, a shipowner is at liberty to disclaim all liability for the payment of compensation to passengers under a contract of carriage.  I understand, however, that some of our shipowners have voluntarily incorporated the terms of the Athens Convention into their contracts of carriage.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the provisions of each of the conventions in turn.  The London Convention on the Limitation for Maritime Claims provides for the totality of claims which may arise from any one incident resulting in loss of life or personal injury, loss of or damage to property &mdash; including damage to harbour works and navigational aids &mdash; and loss from delay in the carriage of cargo or passengers and their luggage.  It deals exclusively with rules in relation to limitation of liability viz. who is entitled to limit liability, claims excepted form liability, conduct barring limitation, time bar for claims, the limits applying to personal, property, passenger and other claims and the global limits in respect of claims arising on any distinct occasion.</P>
    <P>Such claims can include damage resulting from the spillage of bunker fuel from a vessel.  They cannot, however, include claims arising from damage to or the loss of an oil tanker itself.  The Bill does not apply to tankers carrying oil as cargo.  Under the Oil Pollution (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988, oil tankers are already covered for claims of up to £14 million in respect of any one incident.</P>
    <P>The Athens Convention deals with the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea.  It specifically covers the loss of life or personal injury to passengers and the loss of or damage to their <Col N="1199" /> luggage through establishing a uniform international regime of liability.  Under its terms the burden of proving that an incident occurred in the course of carriage and the extent of loss or damage lies with the claimant except in the case of shipwreck, collision, stranding etc. when fault of carrier is presumed.</P>
    <P>The Brussels Convention specifically covers the loss of or damage to cargo where goods are carried under a bill of lading.  A bill of lading is a document issued by a shipowner to a shipper of goods.  It serves as a receipt for the goods, evidence of the contract of carriage and document of title.  As a receipt, it contains the description and quantity of the goods.  As evidence of the contract of carriage, it contains the terms and conditions of the contract.  As a document of title, it is used by a third party to take delivery of the goods from the ship.</P>
    <P>The 1924 convention is known within the shipping industry as the &ldquo;Hague Rules&rdquo;.  The 1968 amending Protocol is known as the &ldquo;Visby Rules&rdquo; and the 1924 convention so amended as the &ldquo;Hague-Visby Rules&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Hague Rules there was little law in existence that prevented the carrier of goods by sea trading under bills of landing from contracting out of virtually all liability in respect of loss or damage to cargo.  The Hague Rules standardised the conditions of carriage set out in bills of lading and have been incorporated into the domestic legislation of most maritime countries, including Ireland.  The Athens Convention and the Hague-Visby Rules, as well as providing for limitation of liability, lay down the rights and responsibilities of carriers and passengers and of carriers and shippers, respectively.</P>
    <P>The Hague Rules were incorporated into Irish law by means of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947.  Ireland acceded to the Hague Rules Convention in 1962. The rules were amended through the adoption of Protocols in 1968 and 1979. The 1968 Protocol amended and expanded the rules in a number of <Col N="1200" /> important respects in relation to: (i) <i>prima facie</i> evidence, (ii) time limits for claims, (iii) monetary limits of liability, (iv) liability in tort and (v) nuclear damage.</P>
    <P>The Protocol of 1968 provides that nothing in the Hague-Visby Rules shall affect the provisions of any international convention or national law governing liability for nuclear damage.  The Protocol of 1979 substitutes the Special Drawing Right, SDR, of the International Monetary Fund for the gold franc as the unit of account.  The texts of these conventions and Protocols are each included in the Schedules to the Bill.</P>
    <P>When it becomes law, this Bill will make it possible for passengers to qualify for realistic levels of compensation for loss, injury or damage either to themselves or their luggage.  It will put an end to existing inequities with respect to claims facilities as between travellers by sea and airborne passengers. Shippers, for the first time in almost 100 years, may seek and expect to receive realistic levels of compensation for instances of loss, damage or delay in the transit of their goods by sea. Shipowners will enjoy the advantages of knowing in advance the absolute maximum limit of compensation for which they are liable in the event of accidents and-or delays occurring in the course of their operations.  Most importantly shipowners will be facilitated in being able to arrange the necessary levels of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>In the case of a typical vessel of 3,000 registered tons, the absolute limit of liability will be increased for loss of life or injury from the present ceiling of £45,000 to the more realistic maximum of 1,580,000 Special Drawing Rights which is about £1.47 million.  Where loss of life or personal injury occurs on a passenger ship, the present maximum possible claim is £45,000.  The Bill will increase this figure to £50,000 per passenger up to an aggregate maximum not exceeding 25 million SDRs which is about £23 million.  In instances involving loss of or damage to goods or a vessel, <Col N="1201" /> the present maximum claim possible is a ludicrous £24,000.  Under this Bill, the maximum claim possible will be a more realistic 580,000 SDRs which is about £540,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to liability for removal of a wreck and its cargo, it is important to note that while the London Convention provides for limitation of liability in cases of wreck, it permits adhering Governments to opt out of this provision if they see fit.  It allows for such adhering Governments to provide for no limitation to apply in such cases.  This provision was availed of in section 53 of the Merchant Shipping (Wreck and Salvage) Act, 1993.  That Act provided for no limit to the liability of the owner of a wrecked or stranded vessel in respect of the cost of raising, removing or otherwise disposing of such a vessel.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to replace section 53 of the Wreck and Salvage Act with Section 11 of the Liability of Shipowners and Others Bill, 1996, and to strengthen the wording to cover &ldquo;the raising, removal, destruction or the rendering harmless of a ship which is sunk, wrecked, stranded or abandoned including anything that is or has been on board such a ship&rdquo;.  The new wording is designed to take account of experience to date with the enforcement of the Wreck and Salvage Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The London Convention further provides for an absolutely unlimited claim facility for loss or damage in respect of accidents to vessels powered by nuclear power or carrying nuclear materials. Given our position on the Sellafield nuclear processing plant and the vessels transiting the Irish Sea route to and from Sellafield, this provision is of particular importance.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide a balanced framework of obligations and rights for shipowners, shippers and passengers and will further facilitate the smooth operation of sea transport service for all the various interests involved, whether providing or availing of sea transport services.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends to Irish-registered vessels the benefits enjoyed heretofore <Col N="1202" /> only by vessels which belong to countries which have acceded to these conventions already.  Its passage into our law will balance this anomalous exposure and, indeed, prudent owners of Irish-registered vessels will have already insured against liability at a rate higher than provided for under our existing law on limitation and in line with the more practical limits which will now be introduced.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for the Marine in May of last year I have become very conscious of the need to redress the competitive disadvantages being endured at international level by the Irish sector.  Simultaneously, I must continue to ensure that reliable efficient services are available to industry, that we protect our marine environment and that safety standards on our ships meet the most exacting standards.  These targets while attainable will not be easily met.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore and I, as the House is already aware, have recently brought legislation through the Oireachtas on the management of harbours and on dumping at sea.  The Government on my recommendation approved a scheme to give grants during periods of shipboard training to deck officers and marine engineering cadets and trainees who are students at Cork Regional Technical College.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced to secure placement opportunities for our students who had found themselves during recent years at a severe competitive disadvantage when compared to students in other countries where subsidies had been introduced as an inducement to shipowners to ensure a continuing supply of good quality officers.  The scheme should overcome this disadvantage and ensure that we maintain and develop the maritime skills base which is essential for an island country.</P>
    <P>Provisions are included in this year's Finance Act which are aimed at encouraging good quality tonnage onto our register.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn has also agreed <Col N="1203" /> to have the situation in relation to PAYE and PRSI as it concerns seafarers examined during the coming year with a view to determining what action may be taken to enhance employment opportunities and the competitiveness of our fleet.</P>
    <P>I am committed to pursuing all avenues to achieving a level playing pitch in the international maritime sector. That implies a commensurate input from small as well as large countries on the international scene.  In Ireland's case this includes updating our laws, having due regard to our situation.</P>
    <P>Concerning cost implications for shipowners and the export industry, the advantages derived from a shipowner knowing the full extent of his liability whether he is involved in a marine incident in Irish territorial waters or in waters under other jurisdictions, and facilitating the shipping industry by way of ready availability of insurance cover, early settlement of claims etc. outweigh the cost implications.  It gives me great pleasure to recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has become very quiet after a robust afternoon as we debate the Second Stage of this Bill.  I hope it is not an indication of any lack of interest in shipping and marine matters in the House.</P>
      <P>More than 70 per cent of the earth's surface is covered by water.  We receive food, transport facilities, fishing resources and numerous other natural advantages form these seas and oceans. As a former Minister for the Environment with some responsibility at the time for road improvement, I can see the advantages of using the natural assets of our seas and oceans for transport when we compare the cost of sea transport to the massive cost of road and infrastructural development and the effects of this development on the landscape. Needless to say, it is a fragile asset and needs to be protected and preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> Ireland's waters are a vital part of our industrial anatomy, carrying up to 80 per cent of our exports and imports. When experiencing the buzz at an Irish airport, it is sometimes very hard to realise that only a very small proportion of our trade, including the most expensive and lightest goods, is transported by air.  The more weighty, less expensive but nonetheless very necessary business is transported via our sea routes and therefore the vital importance of shipping and its safety to our national well being is very clear.  Any Bill introduced here, however belatedly, in respect of shipping conventions and Protocols is a necessary part of growing up and understanding what international co-operation can do to improve standards which are so necessary to ensure that people act more responsibly.</P>
    <P>It is clear that new incentives will be necessary to underpin the expansion of the Irish shipping fleet and the refurbishment of older vessels.  We need to see to what extent this area can help in dealing with our unemployment question. I compliment the Minister on the scheme to provide grants during periods of shipboard training to deck officers and marine engineering at Cork Regional Technical College.  It is clear they were at a disadvantage compared with their colleagues across the water. The Minister's response is welcome.</P>
    <P>Since the demise of Irish Shipping, sufficient emphasis has not been put on restoring our merchant fleet.  The opportunities for bulk cargo at Aughinish and Moneypoint and all the bulk carrying of grain and foodstuffs to Cork, Dublin and Foynes, which is done to a great extent by international companies, will have to be addressed, otherwise we are not serious about creating employment in this business.  We are seriously lacking in a fleet of our own and successive Governments have not been given much encouragement to redress that.</P>
    <P>Despite its size, in many respects Irish shipping has been successful in the competitive world.  The Minister has indicated it is at a disadvantage, but it has <Col N="1205" /> been able to prove an expertise and an ability to operate effectively.  We could become a much more significant seafaring country.  In this regard we need to invest more in our young people.  The evidence is that they make excellent seafarers.  They have a good attitude, the dropout rate once they commence their practical training at sea is negligible, there is fairly good career advancement and the remuneration is reasonably attractive.  Ireland enjoys a number of advantages in the expansion of its maritime operations.  As a member of the EU we have a well established and reputable maritime infrastructure and more investment is being made in our ports.  Some extensive development has taken place in the past four or five years and this will continue.  We have an excellent communications network.  I want to emphasise that point because we underestimate and undervalue these assets.  This is not a condemnation of the present Minister or of the Department of the Marine.  For a young Department many major steps have been taken in the past seven or eight years, not least of which have been updating and modernising the legislation but also fighting a number of major battles on the international front.  It is time for another injection of new resources to tackle the many problems that remain to be solved.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to draw together in one Act various international conventions such as Limitations of Liability for Maritime Claims, Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading and to make provisions for other related matters.  The intention behind the introduction of the conventions and their Protocols was to remedy a number of deficiencies concerning claims for compensation in maritime incidents that existed in earlier conventions.  It establishes a uniform regime for determining the limits of liability and the methods by which these amounts would be computed.  The limits for liability are raised to a more realistic levels and at the same time it should be <Col N="1206" /> possible for ship owners to insure at reasonable cost.  The Minister has again emphasised the fact that he is endeavouring to level the playing field.  That is the crucial aspect of how we move forward in a business that is becoming increasingly global.  We have to co-operate with and seek co-operation from the international community in devising the best and most practical and efficient way to manage this resource.</P>
    <P>Many of our partners have already adopted these conventions.  They have been in force in many countries for many years and they have enjoyed the benefits.  We are at the rear of the posse but we are beginning to catch up.  The London Convention on the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims provides for the totality of claims which may arise form any one incident, resulting in the loss of life or personal injury, loss or damage to property including damage to harbour works and navigation aids etc.  The Athens Convention deals with the carriage of passengers and their luggage by sea.  The convention specifically covers the loss of life or personal injury to passengers and loss of or damage to luggage and establishes a uniform international regime of liability.  The Brussels Convention covers the loss or damage to cargo where goods are carried under a bill of lading.  When it becomes law the Bill will make it possible for passengers to qualify for realistic levels of compensation for loss, injury or damage either to themselves or their luggage and it will put an end to the existing inequalities in terms of claim facilities as they exist between air and sea borne passengers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the fact that we have 73 ships, that we operate in a competitive environment, that we have some disadvantages and that he is endeavouring to see how these can be redressed.  We also have to ensure that we have the highest possible environmental standards.  We must encourage the raising of these standards.  Maritime safety, efficient navigation, the control and prevention of pollution as well as a <Col N="1207" /> wide variety of technical and other matters have to be dealt with.  In the Seanad, Senator Brendan Daly gave an outline of some of the problems which perhaps do not come to notice as much on the sea as they might if they happened in the air or on the roads.  For example, one ship per day was lost between 1970 and 1980 across the world.  In one year alone 378 ships were lost but the number has now been reduced to about 200 per year.  It is still a massive problem involving death and injury.  How many uninsured and underinsured ships are there?  What is the age of the fleet?  Is there an old fleet in some countries, resulting in risk and massive loss of life and injury?  Against that background it is important that the international community, in terms of conventions and the domestic legislation being changed, seek that total co-operation across the world as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>While the London Convention provides for limitation of liability and for the adhering government to opt out if it sees fit, it also allows for such adhering government to provide for no limitation to apply.  In this instance, the Government has sought to replace section 53 of the Merchant Shipping (Wreck and Salvage) Act and to strengthen the wording in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the London Convention provides for unlimited claims in respect of loss or damage arising from accidents involving vessels fuelled by nuclear power or carrying nuclear materials.  We must do everything possible to prevent such accidents and deter further risk in what is an extremely risky business.  Any disincentive put in place in that regard will be supported.</P>
    <P>A ship can do considerable damage in a harbour, the cost of which can often be greater than the value of the ship.  It appears from recent reports that some ships have caused massive damage to ports and harbour companies are concerned about whether underinsured ships will be able to cover the cost of <Col N="1208" /> such damage.  Will the Minister clarify the position in that regard?</P>
    <P>I am not sure if interaction between ships and seabed pipe or power lines is covered under this legislation or the Oil Pollution at Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988.  The increasing number of seabed pipelines in the Irish Sea and off the west coast could be damaged by direct impact at low tide or when anchors are used in emergencies. Extreme rupture to a pipeline could lead to a serious oil discharge.  Under what legislation are such matters covered?  I hope we discover more oil and that technology will allow us extract it at economic rates.  As the number of oil platforms off the west coast is likely to increase, will the question of collisions, fires and so on, arising from interaction between merchant ships and fixed oil platforms be dealt with in this legislation or elsewhere?</P>
    <P>Legal experts have informed me that the Civil Liability Act, 1961 has proved ambiguous and while it was intended to deal only with collisions, it has been interpreted more liberally.  Is it necessary to rectify that matter under this legislation?</P>
    <P>I understand Committee Stage of the Bill will be dealt with during the summer recess.  The legislation dealing with drink driving, with which I was involved, was also taken during the summer recess.  I look forward to debating amendments to this legislation on Committee Stage.  We have no hesitation in supporting these provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for initiating it in the Seanad.  The Upper House could be used more frequently for initiating legislation. While I am sure the Bill will receive broad support, by any standards it is long overdue.  The purpose of the Bill is to give the force of law to a number of international conventions and Protocols.  It is remarkable that in 1996 we are giving legislative effect to the international convention on bills of lading, which came into effect in 1924.  This <Col N="1209" /> delay is a reflection of our general attitude towards all maritime matters.  It is remarkable that we, as an island nation, take such little interest in maritime affairs and fail to develop our maritime potential in economic and employment terms.  We do not have a large Naval Service, landlocked Switzerland may have a bigger one.  Despite the coastal waters at our disposal our fishing fleet represents only a fraction of the Spanish fleet.  Unlike the Greeks and the Scandinavians we have not produced great shipping companies.  Our State-owned shipping company has gone to a watery grave.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures for registered tonnage of motor vessels relate to 31 December 1994 and they show a total tonnage of over 109,000 tonnes, a fall of 15,000 tonnes on the figure three years previously.  To put this statistic in context, the net tonnage of the entire Irish fleet would be almost equal that of a single bulk carrier delivering coal to the Moneypoint power station.</P>
      <P>We have failed to take advantage of our geographical position between Europe and North America and develop a large European trans-shipment centre, like Holland and the port of Rotterdam.  Many containers leaving Ireland for the American market are first sent to British or continental ports for loading onto larger transatlantic vessels. The importation of bulk products such as animal feeds often involves trans-shipment, with break-bulk activities undertaken at other ports such as Liverpool and Rotterdam, so that loads can be brought here in small vessels.  In both cases Irish Industry incurs additional costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither are we to the fore in maritime engineering.  High speed catamarans operate on many cross-channel ferry routes, but development work on such craft is carried out mainly in Australia and Scandinavia.  The new state-of-the-art high speed vessel recently introduced on the Dún Laoghaire-Hollyhead route was built in Finland, a small country like Ireland but with an infinitely superior track record in exploiting the <Col N="1210" /> economic potential of the maritime sector.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any simple way to change our national attitude to maritime affairs.  The fishing industry appears to be going backwards rather than forwards.  Individual skippers have bought new state-of-the-art vessels capable of venturing far from their home ports for long periods.  However, by and large, the industry is still underdeveloped and its employment potential has not been fully exploited.</P>
    <P>Strategic plans have been devised for various sectors of the economy in recent years.  The tourism plan has been the most successful.  Why can we not devise an integrated development plan for the fishing industry?  Why can we not set clear targets for employment, exports and import substitution in the sea fishing sector and set a realistic timetable for achieving them?</P>
    <P>As regards wider maritime issues, the Government should be prepared to give a lead as to how this sector of the economy can best be developed.  For example, it seems the full potential of the Shannon estuary has not yet been exploited.  This is one of the finest deep water facilities in Europe and already caters for huge bulk carriers bringing coal to Moneypoint power station and bauxite to the Aughinish Alumina plant.  Will the Minister say if his Department is looking at any plans for the strategic development of the Shannon Estuary as a commercial harbour capable of handling large vessels?</P>
    <P>Despite the publication of operational programmes for transport, we lack a strategic approach to port development.  On the stretch of coast between Greenore and Waterford, for instance, there are no fewer than nine commercial ports, a large number to cater for such a small economic catchment area.  It is ironic that despite the availability of so many ports, much of the Republic's trade is channelled through Northern Ireland, via the ports of Warrenpoint, Belfast and Larne, all of which engage in significant marketing of their services here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> Each of the former State ports is now constituted as in independent commercial entity in its own right, which is a welcome development.  The granting of operational autonomy to the ports will help them to prosper.  However, I understand the newly constituted companies may not be in a position to meet their pension liabilities to their employees, and that they may approach the Exchequer for the money needed to make up the shortfall.  There have been suggestions that the amount involved could be as high as £100 million.  If this is the case, it would represent a considerable charge on the public purse. Perhaps the Minister will use this opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the pension liabilities of the harbour boards and to say how much public money will be required to remedy the funding deficit.  This Bill is largely uncontentious, it is long overdue and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important to bring our laws in line with what is happening elsewhere in the Community.  We are all aware of the need for safety at sea about which I would like to speak.  Safety is important for those at sea, including fishermen and yachtsmen, and for those working in the gas fields off the Cork coast.  The main lifeboat covering the south coast, the Cork ferry port and Cork harbour is located in Ballycotton.  Cork harbour is very busy as the oil refinery at Whitegate, the Kinsale gas fields and the main western sea route to England and continental Europe are located in this area.  The best boat should be available to the lifeboat service to ensure safety for those at sea in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lifeboat at Ballycotton is an Arun class boat which is 52 feet long and carries a dinghy.  It is due to go out of service in a year.  A new boat, known as a Trent class life boat, has been designated to Ballycotton by the RNLI.  That class of boat is only 46 feet long and it will not be able to carry a dinghy on board.  Given that it is a smaller boat, it <Col N="1212" /> will not be able to take as many casualties on board as the Arun class boat. People would prefer the Severn class boat, which is 56 feet long and is able to carry a dinghy.  Because of its size, it would be able to carry more casualties.</P>
    <P>The reason the Trent class boat is being allocated is because of the additional draft required for the Severn class boat in terms of berthing and operation. That problem could be solved by the dredging of Ballycotton harbour and by the repair of the pier.  The Minister's predecessor, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, visited Ballycotton and looked at these problems.  I would like the Minister to look at this as soon as possible because there is a huge amount of traffic in this area and there is a need to ensure the best possible boat is provided in a year's time.  I hope the Minister will visit Cork soon when I will point out to him the problems in Ballycotton. I hope he will check up on the progress made since the former Minister's visit.  Like the people of Ballycotton, I look forward to hearing good news in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their positive contributions and in particular, for supporting this legislation.  I noted the points made by Deputy Michael Ahern.  I am always delighted to visit beautiful places like Ballycotton and I hope to do so in the not too distant future.  The question of lifeboats is a matter for the RNLI, although we are in regular contact with that organisation.  I have just received the report of the fishing vessels safety review group, which I will publish with the consent of the Government.  It is a unique report in that it is the first time all those involved in the industry got together to look at the problem and to produce recommendations.  If and when I publish that report, I am sure the Deputy will find its contents very interesting and challenging for us in terms of dealing with what is a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Michael Smith for his <Col N="1213" /> positive and constructive contribution.  I agree with him as regards opportunities available to us in the shipping sector.  It was for that reason I persuaded the Government and the Minister for Finance to introduce amendments to the Finance Act, 1996, which I hope will add new tonnage to the merchant shipping fleet.  I also got the support of the Government in relation to grant aid for cadets.  If one manages to qualify as a naval cadet, it is the one area in which one is certain of employment.</P>
    <P>At a recent Council of Ministers meeting on maritime transport, we touched on the Kinnock White Paper on this area.  It is clear there is a shortage of personnel to supply labour for European merchant shipping.  I would be interested in tackling this and arranging courses to encourage people to seek employment in that sector which would be guaranteed in Europe.  The Deputy is right in that since the closure of Irish Shipping very little has been done to retain the expertise of those involved in the commercial shipping area.  It is about time we started doing something positive and constructive so that people are made aware there are job opportunities in the merchant shipping area. It would be of great benefit to the economy if we put in place suitable courses so that people can qualify and take up job opportunities.  I intend pursuing that matter during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>The question of damage to harbours is covered under the Bill.  Compensation is subject to the overall limits on liability in terms of tonnage, which I will discuss in detail on Committee Stage.  There is no question of compensation for damage being limited only to the value of the ship involved.  From time to time inspections are carried out of foreign vessels visiting out ports and if they are not up to standard we have power to detain them.  We play an active role within the IMO in trying to improve standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Through our own inspectorate we inspect ships at various locations and at certain times.  Damage to harbours or to the coastline is a very serious matter for us and we have played a major part in trying to improve standards at all times.  On the Deputy's question about the civil liability Act, I will have that question examined and it may be discussed on committee Stage. The question of seabed pipelines is a matter for the Department of Energy and, I understand, is covered by legislation in that area.  I will get the details of that matter and pass them to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Clohessy, in regard to the potential in the marine area that has been ignored. In the short time I have been in this ministry I have learned something new every day about the potential of the marine resource and that we fail to grasp opportunities.  The Harbours Act is in place and we will be setting up harbour companies which, I hope, will maximise commercial opportunities available to them for expansion, making business more competitive and attractive.</P>
      <P>There have been considerable improvements in Dublin Port and freight lost to ports in Northern Ireland in the recent past has been won back. There is a significant improvement in terms of tonnage through the port and receipts to the Port and Docks Board, which will become the Dublin Harbour Company.  The great advantage is that profits are used to reduce costs, making Irish business more competitive.  It is vitally important to develop our ports and harbours in such a way that we become competitive and use the profits to lower costs, thereby improving attractiveness for Irish exporters and those who import raw material to manufacture goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that Deputy Smith, Deputy Clohessy and others who debate this matter from time to time approach development of the marine resource in a positive way.  I hope we have succeeded in creating an awareness of the <Col N="1215" /> potential there.  We cannot do everything, but we can certainly create awareness and co-operate from time to time in improving legislation, whether this Bill, the Harbours Act or the Dumping at Sea Act.  Those measures help in no small way to make people realise the value of the marine resource and the vast potential to be explored.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleagues for their positive contributions and look forward to answering detailed questions on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said the previous day we debated this Bill, I very much welcome its introduction after a long delay.  The issue of wandering horses is a very big one in my constituency, as it is in many Dublin constituencies.  I make no apology for raising this issue on a number of occasions by way of parliamentary question and Adjournment debate.  I was very angered at the undue delay in bringing forward the Bill.  It seems issues affecting the Dublin area, particularly working class areas, do not get the priority they deserve, and part of the reason relates to the rural bias <Col N="1216" /> that is reflected in the composition of this House.</P>
      <P>My interest in this matter and the reason I raised it on a number of occasions is that many of my constituents have brought it to my attention.  It is an issue that affects at least 50 per cent of my constituency.  Many residents experience difficulties in terms of resources to deal with issues which have been neglected by Dublin Corporation in the environmental, housing and services areas.  In recent years there has been a distinct fight-back by communities in taking charge of their areas and making efforts to improve the amenity value of the area.  In my area of Finglas there has been a huge success rate in that regard.  Many Dublin Corporation housing estates were award winners in tidy district competitions.  That came about as a result of enormous effort on the part of individual residents and residents' associations.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, however, in recent years much of that work has been seriously undermined.  Residents involved in cleaning their areas, planting shrubs and trees and tidying grass verges have experienced great difficulty because of the presence of large numbers of horses in their areas.  This issue was raised at practically every residents' association meeting I attended.  It is very demoralising for people trying to improve their areas to see their work undone by wandering horses.  In addition, the presence of wandering horses in gardens or in open green spaces, together with joyriding and motorbike riding by underage teenagers, adds significantly to the sense of lawlessness that pervades many Dublin Corporation housing estates and damages morale among local people who are trying to improve their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received an increasing number of complaints from sports groups whose pitches are being seriously damaged and fouled by wandering horses.  This is common in areas of my constituency such as Ballymun, Finglas West and Finglas South where people are putting <Col N="1217" /> enormous effort into developing community and sports facilities.  Much of that good work is being undone because of the presence of wandering horses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am concerned this is only the second stage of controlling the problem of wandering horses.  It seems it will be quite some time before new laws are in place and operating on the ground and it probably will be a long time before we see any concrete results from this Bill.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister not to delay in dealing with this matter.  I do not simply mean the passage of the Bill through this House.  There are a number of areas in which regulations will have to be introduced and local authorities must ensure that they introduce the necessary by-laws with sufficient haste to deal with the problem in the near future.  Much follow-up work needs to be done after the passage of the Bill and I hope the Minister will see that work to fruition.</P>
    <P>When I contributed to the earlier debate on the Bill I referred to my frustration, as a Dublin Deputy, at the delay in bringing this legislation before the House.  We must consider the problems that have been caused by the delay in dealing with this issue, which was brought to the attention of this Government and the previous Government. Ideally we should have dealt with this issue comprehensively five years ago when the problem was only beginning, but many additional problems have arisen in that period in relation to horse ownership.</P>
    <P>The practice has developed whereby children who have acquired a large amount of money, say, when they make their confirmation or first holy communion, are buying a horse instead of a bike, which was the tradition in the past. Horse ownership has become extremely common among young people in many working class Dublin communities. There is now enormous interest in horse ownership and every aspect of horses.</P>
    <P>A positive aspect of horse ownership among children is that many of them <Col N="1218" /> had little interest in school and, therefore, had few opportunities to come into contact with nature.  That is understandable given the concrete jungle surroundings in which many people in the Dublin area live.  These children now have an opportunity to become involved with animals, their care and welfare. They learn equestrian skills and many of them are involved in <i>ad hoc</i> horse projects which are interesting pastimes for them.  Those projects are a source of motivation for the children and, as my colleague Deputy Broughan remarked, it is not a coincidence that since horse ownership has greatly increased in the Dublin area, the incidence of joyriding has reduced significantly.</P>
    <P>It is important that we recognise the favourable developments that have taken place in the recent years and the new traditions that have developed.  The unfavourable aspect of horse ownership is the cruelty inflicted on some animals, the damage they cause to property and the danger they pose to young children and to motorists.  For those reasons it is important that there be no delay in introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister of State is probably not very enthusiastic about this idea, given that he is in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  That is not a reflection on him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>He is very interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Issues relating to projects in urban areas do not normally come within the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but I ask him to take a further step and examine proposals that can be developed in terms of community projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had discussions with horse owners in my constituency who are keen to have an opportunity to develop this interest among young people.  I have had discussions also with representatives of FÁS and various youth services and I believe there is enormous potential for developing community projects with all the benefits that accrue from <Col N="1219" /> those.  FÁS has expressed an interest in this regard and aspects of that involvement have been developed in areas such as Cherry Orchard and Fettercairn.</P>
    <P>There is great potential to provide a community facility so that children and teenagers can enjoy all the benefits of the equestrian world that many other people enjoy as a matter of course.  They will learn about nature as well as horse care and welfare.  Priority should be given to such a development which could be sponsored by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>A number of horse owners in my constituency are concerned that a development such as the one I mentioned would not go far enough in meeting their demands.  When this legislation is introduced many people will protest that they have the right to own a horse&mdash; they may have owned an animal for the past two or three years.  That right cannot be upheld because people should not have the right to own a horse when they do not have suitable surroundings in which to keep the animal.</P>
    <P>There is a need to draw the line with horse owners and the various organisations with which they are involved.  We cannot expect local authorities to provide stabling for horses as demanded by many of the groups involved in this area.  They want local authorities to provide stabling and sufficient land in the vicinity of the stables to enable them to keep the horses.  That is not possible because our local authorities, and particularly Dublin Corporation, are not able to cope with the demand for housing for people.  We should not therefore, expect our local authorities to be responsible for providing stabling.</P>
    <P>Many young children and teenagers in working class areas in particular have access to horses.  They have opportunities to share in the ownership of horses but that does not mean everybody should have the right to own their own horse and that a stable or land should be provided to enable persons to exercise their horses.  It is important to <Col N="1220" /> draw that distinction.  We must recognise the positive aspects of the habits and traditions that have developed in the past five years in the Dublin area and make provisions for them by encouraging community projects.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the implementation of this measure will be shelved.  It must be driven by the local authorities. I would like to see control areas extending to the full county area and Dublin Corporation will be one of the first local authorities to do that.  As the problem spreads to surrounding counties their county councils will put bylaws in place so they too can operate control areas.</P>
    <P>The Estimates probably underestimate the cost of implementing this legislation. Local authorities will have to employ horse wardens because the situation is out of control in many areas. It is all very well to have legislation in place, but unless we have the personnel to implement it, it will not have an impact.  I urge the Minister of State to make sufficient resources available to ensure that local authorities can employ designated staff to tackle the problem. I also ask the Minister of State to give favourable consideration to the reasonable request that working class children who have access to horses at present will continue to have such access, although in a more regulated fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on the Bill. Deputy Shortall referred to the equestrian industry and equestrian activities for young people.  There is an excellent international equestrian centre in Cavan &mdash; the Cavan Equestrian Centre &mdash; which provides substantial employment for people in the local area.  It has an ongoing programme of showjumping and sales throughout the year.  Purchasers come from all over Europe for the sales.  There is also a substantial breeding programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the young people in my constituency have developed a great interest in the equestrian industry and <Col N="1221" /> some of them have attended Thomastown vocational school which provides a post leaving certificate course in equestrian studies.  I agree with Deputy Shortall that this sector could be of tremendous benefit both from the point of view of tourism and from the point of view of recreation for our young people.  It also has the potential to create employment on a large scale. More emphasis should be put on equestrian studies, particularly in centres where post leaving certificate courses are available.  Equestrian studies have been a phenomenal success.  Courses are adaptable to local employment opportunities and this is an area that should be given greater attention.  Students who attended the courses in Thomastown told me they were very satisfied with the course content and management and, on completion of the courses, with the subsequent availability of employment.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State will be receptive to worthwhile, positive amendments from all sides of the House.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Kenneally, who introduced an earlier Bill, the Control and Regulation of Horses Bill, 1996.  It is not easy for the Opposition spokesperson, without back-up facilities, to draft legislation. Deputy Kenneally's legislation was comprehensive and dealt with the issues covered by the Bill currently before the House.  The Government's Bill is substantial and is generally supported by this side of the House.  Deputy Kenneally said he would put forward amendments on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister of State will give them practical and reasonable consideration.</P>
    <P>Listening to one of the programmes on our national radio station as I drove to Dublin this morning, I was appalled to hear about the number of animal deaths this year.  A representative of the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals spoke about the number of animals that have died and the number of telephone calls the organisation had received before noon today reporting instances of animals <Col N="1222" /> lacking the necessary food and water.  It is appalling that animals are being treated in such a manner in the suburbs of this city and, unfortunately, throughout the country.  The problem of stray animals and wandering horses is not confined to Dublin.  They are also a problem in other urban centres although not on the same scale.  The Minister of State said all worthwhile suggestions would be considered favourably and I hope he will incorporate practical suggestions from this side of the House, particularly from Deputy Kenneally, on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This issue has been a major concern to many Deputies in recent years.  Many of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil have called for the enactment of legislation to control wandering horses in urban areas.  It is unacceptable that this problem has been allowed to continue for so long.  We are aware of the fatalities that have occurred as well as the damage to persons and property, all of which could have been avoided had the proper controls been in place and enforced. Deputy Kenneally introduced a practical Bill and some of the sections in it and in the Government's Bill are similar. At present we have the intolerable situation where we do not have proper controls for keeping horses.  The controls provided for in this legislation must be enforced.  It is highly dangerous that horses can roam freely in public places and be a menace to persons and property. A licence or identification system for animals of such size and mobility must be put in place.  Section 28 will empower the Minister to make regulations for the identification of horses. A standard nationwide identification system is essential.  It is not practical that local authorities should decide their own means of identification as both the horses and their owners may move from one local authority area to another.  The Minister of State said this provision is intended to facilitate the prescription of a nationwide means of identification so that straying over county borders can be detected.  That is a welcome and practical measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> Over the weekend I spoke to people who have worked with horses for many years.  They believe the best means of identification is to mark the horse under its mane.  They believe other suggestions, such as tattooing the lower lip, will not be practical and they have expertise in veterinary practice in the equestrian industry.  I ask the Minister and his officials to give special consideration to their views.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally referred to all the sections of the Bill, particularly section 42 which deals with the attachment of criminal liability to the owner or person in charge of a horse.  It is important that the legislation strikes a balance between the right to own a horse for recreational or economic purposes and the need to protect citizens and curb the menace of wandering horses in built-up areas. Deputy Kenneally referred to the well managed partnership project between the local authority and horse owners in the Fettercairn area in Tallaght which has enabled many young people to engage in their favourite recreational activity.  It should be possible in a country of this size to set up a number of similar projects which could be incorporated in equestrian courses and involve a teaching a well as a recreational element.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally referred to the need for a proper pound for horses.  The Minister and his Department should give consideration to the establishment of regional pounds with proper facilities. In recent years many residents' associations have been appalled at the damage done by horses to green areas and recreational facilities built up by them through voluntary effort and the failure to enforce the law to prevent them destroying property and presenting a threat to children and adults.</P>
    <P>A person in the horse industry to whom I spoke said he was glad the Department had decided two or three years ago to abolish the grant for keeping more horses on farms as he believed this was the cause of the increase in the <Col N="1224" /> number of bad quality animals.  I am not familiar enough with the industry to know how valid that criticism is but this person believes that the number of animals increased too rapidly and the quality was not maintained.  It is unusual for a person to welcome the abolition of a grant scheme.  He also referred to the need for a horse factory in the north east to replace the factory in Dundalk which was closed some years ago.  I think there is a facility in Sallins but this person is anxious that the Department and the relevant industrial agencies give consideration to opening a factory in the north east.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which deals with the identification system for animals. I hope the necessary funding will be provided so that local authorities can implement the provisions in the Bill. There is no point in enacting legislation and putting in place well thought out and structured regulations if the necessary funding is not made available to implement them.  I hope the necessary funding will be provided and that the Minister will favourably consider my Committee Stage amendments tabled by Deputy Kenneally.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare was one of the first people to highlight this problem in his 1990 Private Members' Bill.  This gives an indication of how long this has been a problem.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, for introducing the Bill which I hope is enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In drafting the Bill the Minister engaged in wide-ranging discussions and set up a consultative committee representative of the Department of Justice, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture, <Col N="1225" /> Food and Forestry, South County Dublin Council and Dublin County Council. While the committee is representative of Dublin where there is a problem with wandering horses, I would like to think it will take into account the position in rural areas where there is also a problem with wandering horses.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the problem in north Kerry.  It is proposed local authorities will be the licensing authorities and that tagging arrangements will be put into operation.  This will require significant expenditure by local authorities and I am glad the Department, through the Department of Finance, will provide funding for the implementation of this very important legislation.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community I referred to the efforts of local authorities to integrate travellers in the community.  I am in favour of giving travellers houses in housing estates rather than providing halting sites for them.  During such debates there was a reference to the cultural and other rights of travellers.  While this is important, it is often forgotten that the settled community also have rights, and the one issue which can lead to a problem between members of the settled community and travellers is the keeping of horses in estates.  I am not opposed to the keeping of horses but they should not be allowed to wander around estates where they ruin green areas and frighten children.  If the travelling community wants to secure the good will of the settled community it will have to confront this problem.  I do not have any objection to members of the travelling community camping on a green area outside a town or village but one often sees them riding horses at great speed through the main street of a town or village, leading to additional hostility on the part of members of the settled community and motorists.</P>
    <P>I have strong views on this issue which I have expressed at local level.  I genuinely believe that the provisions of this Bill will give local authorities the <Col N="1226" /> teeth they have lacked to date in confronting the problem.  A previous speaker referred to the necessity to establish regional pounds which is probably also desirable.  There appears to be a bush network type of communication among the travelling community when it comes to the seizure of horses in housing estates.  They appear to know in advance and continue to move them about.</P>
    <P>It is also important that there be some licensing system introduced in respect of wandering horses.  If local authorities can monitor horse owners, that will help in eliminating the problem.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to implement the provisions of this Bill as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly glad to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on this Bill which could be described as a hobbyhorse of mine, a cause I have championed for a long time.  In 1990 I introduced a Private Members' Bill on this very subject when, for some strange reason, the then Fianna Fáil administration was less than fulsome in its support of my efforts.  Perhaps that administration did not see it as a pressing issue about which people would become excited but, of course, they were wrong.  I was interested to hear Deputy Brendan Smith remark that sections of this Bill are similar to those of the Fianna Fáil Bill published a few months ago.  The Deputy must have been reading the wrong Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Bill was almost a straight lift from the one I introduced in 1990, whereas the current one is significantly different from mine and has been redrafted on something like 20 occasions.  An enormous amount of work has gone into its preparation and drafting, particularly in terms of consultation by the Minister and his staff, to ensure it is adequate to tackle the task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall how recently representatives of a number of political parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to be precise &mdash; suffered a form of <Col N="1227" /> shell-shock at the extent of the problem of wandering horses in a certain Dublin constituency.  They were stunned at the extent of anger and frustration it generated. I am prompted to wonder where these people have been all these years. Have they been so out of touch with the realities of life for so many urban communities. This should not have come as a surprise to these same representatives, who appeared to be equally shell-shocked at the extent of poverty, alienation and disenchantment being experienced by these communities, not to mention the grinding oppression of unemployment and crime.</P>
    <P>For years there has been a failure to acknowledge that wandering horses posed any problem at all.  I well remember endeavouring a pin down some responsibility for it.  I discovered that the Department of the Environment was not responsible, neither were local authorities, the Department of Agriculture or Board na gCapall.  Nobody was responsible.  This led to my decision to introduce a Bill to focus responsibility where it ought to lie, with local authorities. This is being provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The fact that this is an urban problem seemed to have escaped the notice of our legislators who did not appear able to comprehend the scale of the problem. In many ways, it is a damning indictment of our system that it has taken so long to introduce this Bill.  The harsh reality is that it has taken five years and a number of changes of Government to bring this to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Bill is based on my 1990 Bill and the fact that Democratic Left had its inclusion agreed in the programme for Government in December 1994 is a matter of some pride and satisfaction to me.</P>
    <P>The problem of wandering horses has been a terrible one for urban communities as far apart as Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  Serious injuries have been suffered by children, public and private property &mdash; parks, gardens and <Col N="1228" /> cars&mdash;have been damaged and the general quality of life for people in these areas has suffered.  Henceforth local authorities will have to license persons annually to keep horses in urban areas. These horses will have to be identified, registered and kept under control.  Liability for damages and injuries will also fall on the owner.</P>
    <P>For the first time local authorities will have power to answer the demands of local communities and act to tackle this problem.  Children will be safe playing outside their homes; motorists will be free to drive and people with cars parked outside their homes will no longer be afraid of their being damaged by galloping horses.  Perhaps most importantly, the cruelty caused to many of these horses will end.  There have been horrific examples of cruelty to and neglect of these animals over the years. It is hoped that this Bill will not only provide the necessary powers to tackle this problem at source but will also lead to greater public awareness of the need to care for these animals.</P>
    <P>Many of these horses have been under the control of young people who do not have the knowledge, experience, facilities or resources to look after them. Some of these animals have been kept in gardens, in tiny sheds, even in houses. It could be claimed that they were the lucky ones since many more were left to roam freely, uncared for, without adequate food and water.  Small wonder, then, that they eventually became a problem nobody was willing to address. Let us hope this Bill spells the beginning of the end of such needless cruelty.</P>
    <P>In this regard I pay tribute to the work of voluntary organisations, the most exemplary of which is the DSPCA which has provided practical help and assistance over many decades.  Despite its limited resources and staffing the society moved to cope with individual cases of cruelty and neglect and tried, often in vain, to education the public on this growing problem.  I should also give that society credit for its work in helping to draft the Bill I introduced in 1990.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a worrying trend <Col N="1229" /> which has accompanied the pioneering work of organisations like the DSPCA which, ironically, has also accompanied the birth and progress of this Bill.  That is the threats to and intimidation of volunteers and officials as they go about their work of preventing or dealing with cruelty to horses.  These serious threats gathered pace when this Bill was first mooted and there have been incidents of various threats of violence or intimidation against individual members of the DSPCA.</P>
    <P>The word should go out from this House that such actions will not be tolerated. If members of voluntary organisations cannot conduct their activities free from the threats and actions of thugs, this State has some serious questions to ask itself.  The problem is rendered even more serious by the fact that organisations like the DSPCA have been forced to step into the gap, the State having failed to take action when and where necessary in relation to wandering horses.  I commend the DSPCA and its staff on their continuing dedication and bravery in continuing to do what the State has failed to do to date.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the attraction horses hold for young people and endeavour to channel this in a positive and constructive way.  We must first enact this Bill to tackle the problem and thereafter work to ensure that children from these urban areas have access to horses in controlled conditions, thus ensuring no ill-treatment of animals and no danger or inconvenience to the general public.</P>
    <P>This is a serious Bill, a real attempt to deal with a pressing problem for far too many communities.  It is in line with this Government's commitment to address people's real needs.  It strikes the right balance in drawing together the various elements involved in tackling this problem and, while it had a long gestation period, it was worth awaiting.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of contributing to the debate on this Bill.  I accept that its introduction honours a commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  I also acknowledge the involvement of the Minister for Social Welfare in this issue over many years.  He tabled a Bill some years ago which I understand was published but never introduced.  I was not a Member at that time.  I do not understand his criticism of the then Fianna Fáil administration.  As happens weekly, Opposition Members ask if a matter of grave importance can be taken in Government time, but it always kicks to touch and states that the Opposition can raise it in Private Members' time.  I accept this is a major problem in parts of Dublin, particularly in the constituency shared by the Minister and me, and it is disgraceful that it has been with us for many years.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil is a large democratic party and its members must fight their corner.  It is a disgrace that it has taken so long to address this issue which is a problem in many parts of Dublin, particularly in suburban areas where the city meets the county.  Failure to address the problem of wandering horses has given rise to a history of accidents and motorist fatalities.  I listened to party colleagues from Dublin North <Col N="1231" /> East and Finglas discuss this problem for many years and I recall at one stage a letter being received from the then Minister for Justice advising that the solution to all our problems was at hand &mdash; a single horse box had been delivered to Finglas Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might well be correct.  That solution was a joke.  This serious problem has not been tackled.  The problem comes in waves, it is very bad at times and then drifts into the background.  Horses grazing on land on the north side of Dublin which was earmarked for the northern cross route and the Finglas bypass were, to a large extent out of public sight, but as the construction work was completed they were chased off and could only graze on green patches along roads, avenues and groves.  It is disgraceful that was allowed to happen.  Wandering horses cause accidents and it is extraordinary that action to address this problem has only been taken in the past two years following campaigns by people more concerned with animal welfare.  This is a major problem and the efforts of the two groups involved has resulted in something being done about it.</P>
      <P>Keeping horses is big business.  It is not only a case of every 14 year old having a pony; some families breed horses, keep a few dozen or so and make a good deal of money out of the sale of them. It is a lucrative business.  Those families must be made aware of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable that some families have had to put up with the nuisance of horses wandering the roads, wrecking their front gardens and grazing on any available greenery, including that in school yards.  They also have had to deal with threats and intimidation from the owners of horses.  I spoke to some school principals about this problem.  It is well known that some families put their horses into school yards at 4.30 <Col N="1232" /> p.m. and take them out again at 8.40 a.m. the following morning, leaving the teachers to clean up the mess before the children arrive for their day of learning.</P>
    <P>The problem is worse at certain times of the year.  As a result of the lack of growth this spring horses wandered nearer to built-up areas in my constituency, beyond Finglas and Ballymun.  I heard stories that in March or April when there was a harsh east wind and no grass growth the wandering horses interfered with shopping bags carried by women on their way home from shopping centres.  They are intelligent animals and have learned to live in an urban setting.  They know that the goodies in shopping bags are the next best thing when there is very little grass.</P>
    <P>The problem has been raised at local level over many years.  As a political activist in the past, I raised it with my public representatives and I received various answers such as that the Departments of the Environment and Justice did not want to know about it.  Local authorities have a certain role to play in addressing the problem, but they do not have the necessary manpower. Occasionally, they organise a roundup of wandering horses at 5 a.m., but the workers involved have to travel in an unmarked lorry because, if recognised, they would be attacked by the families who own them.  They must be paid overtime for this work.  It has always been a wild west type of business and passing legislation will not solve it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, irrespective of whether it has willingly taken on this mantle or it has been forced on it, for dealing with the problem.  It reminds me of another issue the Department addressed &mdash; it had been a problem for many years &mdash; that of hare coursing.  For many years nobody knew who should be dealing with that problem. In recent years the Department tackled two problems that concerned many city people.</P>
    <P>Legislation usually regulates an activity, lays down controls and measures governing it and provides the <Col N="1233" /> necessary policing.  I welcome the legislation, but will it be enforced?  In many respects it is a million miles away from addressing the problem.  I am concerned that the Department will consider it has successfully completed its work, as set out in the programme for Government, by introducing legislation on what for many years has been a burning issue and will leave matters like that.  While I have not considered the details of the Bill &mdash; we will deal with that on Committee Stage &mdash; it appears to be in order. Will resources be made available to tackle the problem?  Does the political will exist to deal with it?  To some extent we have had the necessary legislation to deal with this problem, but the local authorities and the Garda had little will to solve it.  I am concerned that neither group has the interest or the time to tackle the problem.  They have done an occasional early morning round up of a couple dozen horses and put them into the pound in Baltinglass.  However, the owners could go to the local solicitor, sign an affidavit, pay the £35 and get the horses out in no time.  This type of early morning run frightened the owners, and horses were hidden in school yards for a couple of weeks, but when the heat was off they went back to letting their horses wander the streets.  This legislation is meaningless if the Minister cannot spell out what resources will be provided to the Garda Síochána and the local authority to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Some months ago when we had our first briefing on this legislation, we talked about horses in urban areas.  I note the word &ldquo;urban&rdquo; has been dropped.  I note also that we seem to be speaking about stray horses.  Many of the horses in my area are not stray horses.  The owners tie the horses to a tree planted by the corporation the previous winter &mdash; the fact that the horse might pull the tree down within a few hours does not seem to matter.  I hope this legislation will apply to all horses. A horse that is tied to a tree planted by the local authority should be treated as a stray and not excluded from the legislation, because that is how some owners <Col N="1234" /> get around the legislation &mdash; they tie the horse to a stake in the ground, allowing the horse to eat within a radius of five yards or so, move him the next day and tie him to a tree.  The law will have to cover all horses, and a horse should not be excluded because he is not running loose.  The legislation must be strengthened by the provision of resources. Otherwise it will be a joke.  It will meet a commitment but no more.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that up to now a licence was needed for a dog but not for a horse.  That was scandalous, and I am delighted the matter is being dealt with. The ownership of horses does give meaning to the lives of some young people.  It is extraordinary that some of them have taken such an interest in horses and care so impressively for them.  Others, however, have not got a clue.  They may not set out to be cruel and although their treatment of horses is shameful, one has to forgive them because they know no better.  They need education and training.</P>
    <P>In my area a horse owners' club has confiscated a building which is the property of the Department of Finance and is now making demands on the local authority to provide water and bins to take away horse manure.  Although the legislation is good, I have some concern about it because my area borders that of another local authority, Fingal County Council.  Such problems tend to be concentrated on the fringes where two areas join, and there is no point in Dublin Corporation declaring its area a controlled area if the local authority for the adjoining area does not bother because the people in its area live some distance from the boundary.  Co-ordination between the local authorities is necessary. We must also deal with some of the horse owners' groups, many of whom seem to think they have a divine right to confiscate any building and demand huge tracts of land, services etc. Some of them may do good if their membership includes people who can give supervision, advice, training and education to young people who have an interest in horses but letting them run <Col N="1235" /> wild is not the answer.  I hope these matters will be dealt with and that on Committee Stage the Minister will be in position to outline what resources will be provided.  If he cannot do that the legislation will merely have fulfiled an undertaking in the Programme for Government and no more.  Throwing the problem back to the local authority looks fine in legislation, but it is not practical.  It has failed before and will fail again unless the resources are provided. Up to now the Garda Síochána and the local authorities have regarded this issue as being way down their list of priorities.  I hope this legislation will change the emphasis and that this problem, which has been a scourge in many suburbs of Dublin, will be dealt with in a meaningful way.  I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing in this legislation. It is a big step forward but we need the resources to see that it is properly enforced.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which was part of a commitment in the Programme for Government.  I congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he delivered on this commitment by initally inviting Members who had a particular interest in the legislation to look at the proposals and giving people who experienced the problem in their own areas the opportunity to have an input at that stage.  That is a useful way of dealing with legislation.</P>
      <P>The problem is largely urban and has given rise to much difficulty, annoyance, inconvenience and, indeed, injury to people in urban areas over the past number of years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I reserve the right to share my time <Col N="1236" /> with my colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell.</P>
    <P>This is the first major conservation Bill since the foundation of the State.  Its purpose is to give proper protection in law to our built environment.  The provisions of this Bill extend not only to buildings of particular architectural importance but also to buildings of historic, cultural an artistic significance. The Bill amends and extends the powers of local planning authorities.  Armed with these new powers the local authorties will be required to act as custodians of our built environment.  The Bill puts in place a package of planning controls on the one hand and recommends a range of tax relief type incentives on the other.  We are confident this is the proper balance and will put a halt to the wilful dereliction and wanton demolitian of our rich architectural inheritance that is rampant in our cities, towns and villages.  The house in which James Joyce set his hauntingly beautiful story, <i>The Dead,</i> at 15 Usher's Island was vandalised in recent weeks and is now stripped of its top storey.  There is no law to require any developer to restore and repair that building.  I could cite a dozen similar examples from this and other cities up and down the country. There is an urgent need to enact this legislation without delay.  In that spirit I appeal to the Minister not to vote down the Bill but to seek to get all-party support for it before referring it to a committee where it can be improved upon, if that is deemed fit.  Time is not on our side.  I hope the Government will see its way to supporting this Bill.</P>
    <P>Our built environment is a central part of our heritage and a significant segment of our cultural legacy.  Down the ages man has always been inspired and awe-struck by fine craftsmanship and fine buildings and the human spirit has been demeaned by being required to live among dingy buildings.  Fifty years ago the Northern Ireland poet, Louis MacNeice wrote the following poem, Dublin:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> This was never my town.  I was not born nor bred nor schooled here.  She will not have me alive or dead but yet she holds my mind with her seedy elegance and all her ghosts that walk and all that hides behind her Georgian facade.  Yet she holds my mind.</P>
    <P>That is the grip that good architecture can have on the fine mind of a good poet.  I wonder if MacNeice were alive and writing to Dublin today, would he write in that vein, in that tone or would he write at all?  It is a fact that buildings define our values, demonstrate our appreciation of the past and declare our expectations of the future.</P>
    <P>The conservation of interesting buildings and streetscapes is a well recognised precondition for a successful tourism trade.  Despite all that, in the past 30 years there has been wanton and widescale destruction and despoliation of much of Dublin's Georgian heritage. In addition, buildings of unique historic significance and architectural merits have been razed to the ground.  I could list the buildings but that would hold me here for a long time.  I will mention but a few important buildings that ought to be still with us but no longer are. Among them I would mention the Weaver's Hall in the Coombe, the Peasants' Asylum in Camden Street, the Female Orphan's Home in North Circular Road, Woodhill House in Tivoli in Cork, the house where Sarah Curran held tryst with her romantic hero, Robert Emmet.  A host of other fine buildings have been razed to the ground, among them the Talbot Lodge in Black-rock where Eamon de Valera spent his final days.  This wilful dereliction and wanton destruction is going on under our very noses.  The Hilton Hotel scheme for College Street proposes gross interference in an area that, above any urban area, ought to be designated as a conservation area.  Under the proposal in question it is proposed to demolish no less than four list one buildings, two, list two buildings and three further buildings in the immediate area.  That proposal further entails the <Col N="1238" /> unnecessary and complete demolition of three wide street commissioner's buildings on Westmoreland Street and of numbers 3 and 4, College Street.  That is a loss that cannot be repaired.  There is nothing in law to prevent that irreversible destruction from taking place.  As well as that, there is a proposal to demolish the house at number 2, Millbourne Avenue, Drumcondra, a house where James Joyce lived.  The house in question has been described by a nephew of James Joyce, Mr. Ken Monaghan, as &ldquo;the most important of the Dublin houses of James Joyce&rdquo;.  I mentioned already the Joyce house at 15 Usher's Island.  I have been told that an application has been lodged for the demolition of another unlisted house in Philsboro, where Joyce spent an important part of his childhood.  Where lies the logic in spending million of pounds of taxpayers' money in marketing this country as a tourism destination on the one hand and simultaneously destroying the very item tourists want to see?  Surely of all items of importance in this city and of all cultural and tourism assets in this city among the most important have to be anything tangible to do with James Joyce.  Houses associated with him ought not alone be preserved but promoted and jealously guarded.  Can it be that we alone among civilised countries have such a poor appreciation of our built environment?  I wonder why.  These are those who might argue that the Irish people are capable of being passionate only about our poetry, our songs and our literature and if that was the case it would be to dismiss us as nothing more than a nation of word merchants, who are visual illiterates. We would not like if other people said that about us but they would have plenty of reason for so doing, considering our history in relation to our built environment.  There are historical reasons for our lack of cultural affinity particularly with fine buildings and streetscapes that predate the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>In the early 1920s the Government of <Col N="1239" /> the fledgling Free State set about restoring the Four Courts, the Custom House and the GPO to their former grandeur at a time when Exchequer funding was scarce.  It had, at least, a sufficient sense of their importance.  O'Connell Street was also restored, as was Patrick Street in Cork.  What has gone wrong in the meantime?  Why was its good example not followed through?  That is not to say that there have not been a number of remarkably successful conservation projects throughout the country since.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny city is a model of good practice. Major restoration of houses has yielded significant success in my own city and county.  These include Doneraile Court which has been magnificently restored, Barryscourt Castle, Queen Anne House in Pope's Quay where the leader of my party opened an architectural exhibition a number of years ago and Skiddy's Arms House in Shandon, to mention but a few.</P>
    <P>With its splendid collection of 18th century houses, Kinsale, happily and deservedly in the news today having been voted the best kept town in Ireland, is a classic example of what can be done when an innovative county architect interacts successfully with a sophisticated and discerning local commercial community.  This community has demonstrated without doubt that conservation pays handsomely in terms of economic return and has given fine example to the rest of the country. Other coastal towns in County Cork such as Clonakilty and Skibbereen, as well as Kenmare in County Kerry, are fine examples of good conservation and architectural practice.</P>
    <P>We have much to learn from the building conservation policies pursued in Northern Ireland where since 1974 the Department of the Environment, with the advice of its Historic Buildings Council, has listed more than 7,000 buildings as being of special architectural or historic interest, 26 conservation areas have been designated and more than £20 million has been disbursed in support of conservation schemes.  This <Col N="1240" /> policy has worked remarkably well there.</P>
    <P>The city of Edinburgh has set a fine headline for the preservation of a Georgian heritage which in its case is still largely intact.  A rolling programme of restoration has been under way for almost 20 years based on a partnership between the state, the local authority and conservation groups.  There are, therefore, many models to which we can look for inspiration when framing legislation.</P>
    <P>Some people have said to me that this Bill has come 30 years too late.  In one sense it has when one considers the sheer scale of the fine buildings which have been lost in that time, but in another sense this is a Bill whose time has come.  I set its demands in the context of the promise made by the Government to reform and revitalise local government.  If the Minister's word means anything, local government will be reformed and revitalised, given proper functions and adequate finance sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>We believe that this work can best be done in a local setting where local people can be enthused and their support enlisted for the preservation of items worth preserving in their area. This is entirely consistent with the philosophy of the Progressive Democrats. We do not believe that every time there is a new idea a new body should be set up to put it into practice.  That goes against everything we stand for. Responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of this legislation would rest with the newly revitalised and reformed local government.  In that sense there could hardly be a better time to introduce legislation of this kind in terms of its implementation.</P>
    <P>The objectives of this Bill would best be met if we had a system under which the mayors of cities were directly elected by the people, given executive functions and five years in which to achieve their objectives.  The experience of other cities across Europe and America shows that where public opinion is led by a concerned and enlightened <Col N="1241" /> mayor good preservation and conservation policies are put in place and maintained.  We see the two as coming together.</P>
    <P>We see this Bill as an opportunity to give the art and science of architecture a proper lift.  It saddened me greatly that architecture scarcely merited a mention in the arts plan, the bible for art development and funding over the next five years.  That is indicative of the attitude at official level towards architecture and its importance in society.</P>
    <P>The Bill would give a new range of responsibilities and powers to local authorities.  Part I contains the definitions section which features a number of innovations.  Part II deals with development plans and planning permission. Part III provides for new enforcement measures to ensure adequate day to day protection for the built environment. Part IV contains a number of important miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>One of the most important definitions in the Bill is the definition of what constitutes a building.  It states that a building constitutes the exterior, the interior and the curtilage.  If a building is to be conserved, it should be conserved in its natural historic setting.  That is a new concept.  Under existing law there is no requirement to conserve or preserve the interior of a listed building, only the exterior.  That would change under this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are also putting forward a new concept of the built heritage which is defined in the Bill.  The detail will be provided later.  Married to this in a single planning code is the concept of cultural importance.  We rate them as being of equal importance.  There is a further innovation with the inclusion of the concept of internal spatial arrangements in deference to the importance of retaining the exterior of a building.</P>
    <P>A pointer as to what constitutes architectural or historic interest is included, namely, anything which dates from 1850 or earlier or is distinguished by the use of unusual or innovative technology, techniques or material, or is associated with a person or event of local, national <Col N="1242" /> or international importance.  The definition of buildings is of key importance.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the development plan and section 4 proposes to extend the duties of a planning authority when preparing a development plan.  The compilation of the list of elements of built heritage will be mandatory under this Bill, rather than optional, as is the case at present.  Furthermore, the planning authority is obliged to include all items of artistic, architectural, cultural or historical interest; this casts a new and much more comprehensive duty on local authorities.</P>
    <P>The concept of the conservation area is placed on a statutory basis.  Planning authorities will be required to establish conservation areas and to draw up plans for the preservation and enhancement of these areas.  Applications for the development of these areas will be judged on the criteria of environmental improvement.  A planning authority would be obliged to have regard to a list compiled by the heritage council of elements of built heritage or conservation areas within the authority's area. The planning authority must include anything on the heritage council's list or on its own list unless there is good reason for not so doing.  If a local authority refuses to put an item recommended for inclusion by the heritage council on the list, the Minister may intervene and require the local authority to include that item on its list.</P>
    <P>We have brought together the powers of the local authority and the heritage council.  Initially we thought to give the Heritage Council the sole right of requiring the local authority to include an excluded item on its list but we thought better of it.  It is better to reserve that power for the Minister and thus keep democratic accountability in place from the Minister to the local authority.  We have given the Heritage Council largely an advisory and monitoring role in this Bill.  In the interest of democracy it is better to give all the responsibility and power to local authorities. We have brought together in a <Col N="1243" /> very clever way the expertise of the Heritage Council and the authority of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>A planning authority will be required to include a proposal for a scheme to establish a revolving fund to be used in the acquisition and refurbishment of elements of built heritage.  The availability of such a fund is of key importance and has worked very well in other jurisdictions.  All the other existing provisions of the planning code in respect of public participation in the making or variation of a development plan will be retained.  References to dedicated bodies like An Taisce will continue to apply. The key element is that local authorities will be required to list buildings which will then be enshrined in the development plan.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill, which is very short, has two features one of which I already mentioned.  The interior of buildings has previously been exempt from planning permission.  We removed this exemption and planning permission will also be required for the demolition of listed building or the demolition of any building, listed or unlisted, in a conservation area.  A developer can no longer demolish a listed building or an unlisted building in a conservation area without first seeking planning permission.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with planning permission and environmental improvements. The criteria usually applied to an application under existing law is the proper planning and development of the area of the planning authority.  We propose, following in that vein, to institute a new step in the planning process as it applies to an element of the built heritage. A planning authority, before it considers the proper planning and development of the area, must be satisfied that the proposed development of the element of built heritage will confer an environmental improvement.</P>
    <P>The proper planning and development of the area is not defined in the Principal Act and in the same way we have not attempted to define what is <Col N="1244" /> meant by the term &ldquo;environmental improvement&rdquo; in this Bill.  However, it will have to be construed and applied efficiently by planning authorities so that a developer who wants to get permission to in any way change, build, rebuild, restore or repair a building in a conservation area or a listed building will have to demonstrate when seeking planning permission that such alteration will achieve an environmental improvement. This will have to be proven by the developer and the use of the words &ldquo;be satisfied&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; places the onus on the developer to satisfy the planning authority as to the environmental improvement in question. This requirement is a feature of most progressive planning regimes in Europe.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill for the application for planning permission in circumstances in which there is not a list of elements of built heritage.  It is also proposed &mdash; this is of fundamental importance &mdash; to give planning authorities a specific power when granting planning permission to attach conditions relating to preservation, protection, guarding or inspecting of an element of built heritage during the carrying out of the work authorised by the development.  Thus, a planning authority could require a developer to take specified steps for guarding a building during its development.  If this had been a requirement of law when planning permission was sought for the current development in Usher's Quay, the James Joyce house at 15 Usher's Quay would not have been destroyed, allowed to fall into dereliction or vandalised, as is now the case.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the duty of owners.  A duty is imposed on the owner or occupier of a listed element of built heritage to prevent it from becoming endangered.  The provisions of the 1976 Act are extended to a material breach of the duty imposed by this legislation. The effect of this is that the planning authority or any person can apply for an injunction restraining the endangerment of an element of built <Col N="1245" /> heritage.  It is envisaged that the Minister for the Environment will make regulations as to what steps must be taken in this regard when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Section 2 sets out the planning authority's duty.  A duty is imposed on the planning authority to ensure that a listed element of built heritage does not become or continue to be endangered. A planning authority will be able to give grants to prevent a listed building from becoming or continuing to be endangered in certain very restricted circumstances.  Section 12 deals with enforcement notices.  A planning authority will not be restricted to seeking injunctions.  It is proposed under the Bill that the planning authority will be able to serve a notice on the owner or occupier of an element of built heritage where the authority feels that it has become or is continuing to be endangered.  Alternatively, the planning authority may be instructed by the Minister to serve notice in these circumstances. If the notice is not complied with within the specified time the planning authority may do the work specified therein and recover the costs from the owner, the occupier or the addressee of the notice.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that elements of the built heritage which are dangerous structures within the meaning of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act will be dealt with under this new Bill rather than under the 1974 Act, in other words that they will be preserved rather than demolished unless demolition is absolutely necessary.  If there is one phrase that sums up the essence of this Bill it is that buildings, where at all possible, should be preserved rather than demolished.  That is the central thought of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the role of the Minister.  This section empowers the Minister to order a planning authority to serve a notice under section 9.  While a planning authority is confined to listed elements of built heritage, the Minister may order the planning authority to serve a notice in respect of lands on <Col N="1246" /> which any element of built heritage is situated, whether or not it is listed.  The Heritage Council is empowered to advise the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with compulsory acquisition and compensation.  A planning authority will be able to compulsorily acquire any land in respect of which a notice under section 12 has been served and compensation will be payable, but important qualifications are introduced in this Bill in relation to compensation.  Where expenditure is required either under the general duty imposed on an occupier or owner or under a notice issued by the planning authority to prevent an element of built heritage from becoming or remaining in danger, that expenditure is taken into account when assessing compensation. The amount of compensation payable in respect of a site which contains an element of built heritage which has been deliberately endangered in order to justify demolition and development of the site or an adjoining site shall be assessed on the assumption that planning permission for the development of the land or anything thereon would not be granted.  That is an important provision because in the past developers have allowed buildings to become derelict or have hastened the dereliction deliberately in order to put themselves in a position where they would enhance its value and then apply for planning permission for the property.  That cannot happen under this Bill.  Compensation will now be assessed by the planning authority as if planning permission would not be granted.  A local authority can move in if it wishes and carry out the work.  If the planning authority has to carry out the work itself it can offset the cost against the owner or the occupier.</P>
    <P>Part IV sets out a range of incentives which are essential if the objectives of this Bill are to be met.  It is proposed to widen the definition of &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; in respect of which tax relief for repair, restoration or maintenance is given pursuant to section 19 of the Finance Act. Under the current wording of section 19 <Col N="1247" /> the owner or occupier of a building must apply to the Commissioner of Public Works for a determination that the building is &ldquo;intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest&rdquo;.  It is proposed to amend that requirement and to establish a presumption that if a building is listed it comes with the definition and would qualify if all other conditions are met for section 19 type tax relief.  That is the most efficient way to use incentives rather than giving direct grants, except in exceptional circumstances.  Tax reliefs put a requirement on an owner or occupier to make an effort and to make a financial arrangement on, for example, a pound for pound basis.  It is a joint venture between the Department of Finance and the owner of the building.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that some important buildings are still in private ownership and are used as residential buildings they are not eligible for section 19 type tax relief because there is a requirement that the house be open to the public for 60 days.  If we want to repair and restore houses of artistic merit, listed buildings that are currently used as residential properties, we will have to make some concessions to owners who are not in a position to carry out essential repairs and restoration work themselves.  We would extend section 19 type tax relief concessions but only for repair and restoration, not for maintenance.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill is mainly a series of miscellaneous provisions and abolitions of certain compensations. The Bill is an attempt to put in place legislations that would give proper protection to elements of our built environment. In the course of preparing this Bill I put much time and thought into it. I conferred widely with people who have much expertise in this area, people who are concerned that our conservation programmes are not up to speed as opposed to other countries.  From them I received support and advice which is incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>By any standards this is a good Bill. It meets the requirements of the time.  It <Col N="1248" /> is carefully crafted and for the reason I appeal to the Minister not to vote it down.  When one considers the number of buildings in this city which are in danger, time is of the essence.  Every week there is some development in place in this city and in other cities throughout the country that is endangering buildings that ought to be preserved, buildings that are part of our heritage which we hold in trust for this and the next generation.  There are those who would argue that this legislation is a luxury, that it is not terribly important to the economy, but that is a short-sighted way of looking at the assets that are our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>In a country that is so dependent on tourism for jobs and economic success one of our best assets is our built environment. It is short-term economic thinking not to put this legislation on to the Statute Book sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Quill's contribution and I appreciate her genuine concern.  She began by quoting from one writer and referring to another.  It might be worth noting that both writers chose to live elsewhere. Considering his perspective and outlook on life, I think Louis MacNeice would have quite happily exchanged the seedy elegance of Dublin for the vibrant city that is so rich in cultural life today.  Certainly James Joyce chose exile because of the stifling effect the city had on him. We have to ensure that what we are talking about is a living environment.  I agree with Deputy Quill that in this changing world the importance to present and future generations of protecting our built heritage cannot be overstated, but it sets out certain challenges and requirements that have to be met realistically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill has underlined the need for vigilance and action if we are to ensure that our architectural heritage is <Col N="1249" /> preserved.  The increasingly rapid pace of change in our cities, towns and villages has brought about a wider acknowledgment of the need for effective measures to conserve our built endowment.  At the same time, the growing economic importance of tourism and culture, and the increased appreciation of the importance of the physical elements of our history, have led to a wider recognition of both the social and economic benefits of conserving this essential part of our cultural inheritance.'</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that the present system of protecting buildings of artistic, architectural or historic importance under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts is inadequate.  Deficiencies have been highlighted in recent years by the public and by the many bodies who have an interest in this area.  In response to these perceived weaknesses, the Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contained a commitment to improve the protection for listed buildings and to introduce incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards giving effect to this commitment, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht established an interdepartmental working group, comprising officials of their Departments and of the Office of Public Works, to examine the complex issues involved and to report back to the Ministers concerned with recommendations.</P>
    <P>The two Ministers have just this week received the report of the working group which contains a series of extensive and detailed recommendations to improve the protection of our built environment.  The report will be given careful consideration by the Government Departments and Ministers concerned and will be published as soon as this process is complete.  I will come back to the report of the working group later.</P>
    <P>This Government already has a proven track record in responding to the <Col N="1250" /> many factors contributing to neglect and decay of the built environment of our cities and towns.  We are conscious of the fact that our architectural heritage is a physical link with our past history and that our care and preservation of it is our gift to future generations, but conservation for conservation's sake is not enough.  If these buildings are to be truly preserved, new uses will have to be found for them.</P>
    <P>Since 1995 significant financial support has been provided through the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994 to 1999 for the conservation of our built heritage, complementing the existing programme of urban renewal incentives. The urban and village renewal sub-programme provides a framework for a range of measures to revitalise the social and economic life of towns and villages, rehabilitate the built environment and conserve important examples of our architectural heritage.  It offers an opportunity to make a decisive intervention over the next five years to improve the physical appearance of our cities, towns and villages.  Total spending over the life of this sub-programme will total more than £110 million.</P>
    <P>Within the sub-programme, there are five separate measures.  These include implementation of a flagship project in each of the five main cities; urban improvements, including environmental works and small scale infrastructure; village improvements; urban conservation projects, through restoration of urban architecture and heritage buildings; and completion of the Temple Bar cultural quarter.</P>
    <P>The areas to benefit under the terms of the urban and village renewal sub-programme have been identified by the local authorities in their action plans. Allocations for 1996 include £2.7 million for the five major initiatives and urban and village grants totalling about £5 million have been notified to county councils.</P>
    <P>The grant assistance, under the fourth measure for building conservation, in particular, will make a vital contribution <Col N="1251" /> to town conservation in its widest sense. These conservation grants are allocated to local authorities and conservation groups, on the basis of matching funds being provided locally.  This year, I allocated grants amounting to £900,000 to local authorities and conservation bodies for the conservation of our architectural heritage.  In all, a total of 29 project are being assisted this year and a similar level of activity will be continued for the remaining three years of the operational programme.  Examples include grants of £75,000 to Green Street Trust for work on the Debtor's Prison and £50,000 to Limerick Corporation for St. Mary's Cathedral.  A sum of £3.5 million is also being made available for urban and rural regeneration measures in Border counties, under the peace initiative.</P>
    <P>I have established an advisory panel to advise and assist me on the selection of individual projects for conservation grants and on architectural conservation generally.  The panel is composed of persons nominated by a dozen professional and cultural bodies and it is currently engaged in the preparation of advisory guidelines dealing with a range of conservation topics.  These will take the form of booklets dealing with best practice in conservation.  Topics will include the principles of conservation as well as technical advice in relation to ironwork, plasterwork and so on.</P>
    <P>The measures in place under the operational programme complement the existing tax based urban renewal scheme.  The second phase of that scheme, launched in 1994, focused more sharply on residential and refurbishment works rather than new works. The floor area limit for apartments has been raised for refurbishment and conservation works, to encourage conversion of former Georgian-style houses into multi-residential use without loss of their overall character and appearance. Similarly, the living over the shop initiative is intended to encourage rehabilitation and beneficial use of existing buildings.  On a recent visit to <Col N="1252" /> Cork I was very impressed by the way such a scheme operated there.</P>
    <P>Tax reliefs are also available for repair, restoration and maintenance works to buildings that are intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.  Under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, as amended, such expenditure is allowable against income tax, subject to reasonable access being provided to the public for a minimum of 60 days per annum. Relief is also available under the Capital Acquisition Act, 1976, subject to a public access requirement of 90 days.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> also gave a commitment that a full architectural audit would be undertaken.  This work, in the form of the National Inventory of Architecture, is being carried out by the Office of Public Works.  This complements the Archaeological Survey of Ireland which has a rough cut-off date of 1700.  The National Inventory of Architecture involves the recording of buildings and structures constructed after that date.  A total of 19 towns have been recorded so far; the inventory for one town has been circulated and it is hoped to circulate six more by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The National Inventory of Architecture will involve the recording of buildings and structures in a consistent manner throughout the country.  In turn, the inventory will be a valuable resource when judgments are being made on which buildings and structures should be preserved and protected in development plans.</P>
    <P>This range of schemes and incentives shows that the Government is taking practical action aimed at conserving and preserving our built environment.  In relation to the specific issue of listing of buildings, there is broad agreement on the major issues that have to be addressed in order to improve the system which currently applies.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater consistency in the approach adopted by local authorities to the listing of buildings of artistic, architectural and historical <Col N="1253" /> interest.  This relates to the actual mechanisms used by local authorities in listing buildings and to the importance local authorities attach to preserving their architectural heritage in the first place.  The listing of buildings is an optional objective of local authority development plans under present legislative arrangements.  That listing should now be mandatory.</P>
    <P>Present arrangements are also deficient in regard to the protection that listing affords to the interiors of listed buildings.  At present, protection can be extended only to the specific fixtures or features of a listed building which are set out in the development plan.  Work on interiors not specifically listed is considered to be exempted development. This has meant that the interiors of many listed buildings have not enjoyed the protection they deserved.  The whole question of exempted development in relation to listed buildings, therefore, needs action.</P>
    <P>There can be conflicting interests regarding the need to conserve important buildings which may have become dangerous due to fire damage or neglect, while at the same time ensuring that the public is not put at risk by any dangerous building.  While the safety of the public is paramount, there is a need to look at the interaction of procedures under the law which governs dangerous buildings, and the protection of listed buildings under the planning and development Acts to see how current arrangements might be improved.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at the obligations imposed on the owners of listed buildings to ensure that buildings do not fall into disrepair in the first place.  Obligations of this kind have financial implications which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>If we accept that deficiencies exist in the present arrangements, we must then address several fundamental points when considering how best to deal with these deficiencies.  Should the listing of buildings remain within the local government system?  Should it remain part of the planning code as at present? Is there a need for a separate national <Col N="1254" /> body to take charge of protecting the built heritage?  There is the question of costs and how they might be met; these would include the cost implications for local authorities of additional legal obligations, the costs of any new administrative structure, the direct costs on the State and local authorities of any grant scheme and the indirect costs of any tax incentives through lost revenue.  It is interesting that the Bill was brought forward by the Progressive Democrats who have stated their opposition to increases in public spending and who have argued for tax reform.  Yet these issues were not addressed in Deputy Quill's speech.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental question that needs careful consideration relates to the constitutional protection given to private property rights, especially the imposition of any obligation on owners to maintain their property.</P>
    <P>These complex issues were given detailed and careful consideration by the interdepartmental working group to which I referred earlier.  The group has now completed its work and submitted its report.</P>
    <P>In preparing the report, the working group consulted extensively with local authorities, non-governmental organisations and other statutory bodies and also looked at arrangements in other jurisdictions.  In their deliberations, the members of the group explored a range of approaches to improving the protection of our architectural heritage covering legislative, administrative and financial matters.</P>
    <P>The group addressed the question of how the planning legislation could be amended to more effectively support conservation measures and controls.  It looked at how a more coherent listing system might be put in place, while at the same time ensuring that any new system retains the key elements of subsidiarity, local accountability and public participation.  It looked at how the process of listing could be made more flexible and responsive than under current legislative arrangements.  The group also considered how a better knowledge and <Col N="1255" /> understanding of listing and its consequences could be communicated to the owners of listed buildings.</P>
    <P>The whole question of how a broader range of more effective financial incentives should be put in place, to facilitate both public agencies and private developers in conservation, was also examined at length.  I am advised that a comprehensive and costed set of recommendations has been produced, looking at taxation and grant-based measures, within a framework that would ensure resources were effectively targeted and applied.  The group also looked in depth at the areas of training, education and advice.  The need to ensure that human resources were made available to supplement and give effect to the proposed measures was also addressed.</P>
    <P>We are all in general agreement that a package of measures is needed to ensure the preservation of buildings that are of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  Improved legislation must form part of that package.  However, legislation alone will not suffice.  There is little point in introducing legislation such as is proposed unless the local authorities have the resources to implement it.  This means staff to draw up the lists, staff to deal with planning applications for such listed buildings and to enforce the provisions of the Act. If we enact legislation without the necessary administrative and financial support, we only bring our legislation into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that we should not enact legislation on the protection of listed buildings until we have decided on the range of measures required.  It is the Government's responsibility to implement legislation passed by the Oireachtas and it therefore also has a duty to ensure that legislative proposals are workable and well developed to achieve their objectives and that it will be possible to provide the resources required for implementation.  We must look at the provisions of the Bill in the <Col N="1256" /> light of the obligations I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>While the general objective of the Bill is acceptable, some of the provisions are a cause of some serious concern.  For instance, further consideration needs to be given to the role proposed for the Heritage Council.  The Bill would make it obligatory to list buildings in development plans.  It envisages that in drawing up lists planning authorities would be required to have regard to lists compiled by the Heritage Council.  Such a role for the council is new and, while it is likely that some authority at central level will be needed to offer technical advice and to ensure consistency of approach among planning authorities, there are options available other than the Heritage Council.  For example, there is a corps of expertise available in the Office of Public Works which could be drawn on.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that the Heritage Council may advise a planning authority on the exercise of its functions in relation to an endangered element of the built heritage and that it shall be the duty of the planning authority to implement such advice.  Such a role for the Heritage Council is contrary to the Government's policy of devolving as much decision making as possible to local authorities.  It also contravenes Deputy Quill's views, as stated tonight, on the need to strengthen local government. While local authorities should have the best advice available to them, it should be left to them as local democratic bodies to decide ultimately what is in the best interests of their area.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with the Deputy's wish to establish conservation areas, I have serious doubts regarding the way the Bill approaches the issue.  While there is a need to ensure that the system offers protection to groups of buildings, streetscapes, etc., the definition of conservation areas, which local authorities would be obliged to establish, is cast so widely that the central core of every town or village could conceivably be contained in such areas.  This could in fact be counterproductive and might <Col N="1257" /> discourage developers from getting involved in urban regeneration schemes which could improve employment prospects in the area while protecting listed buildings and giving them a new lease of life.</P>
    <P>The Bill would require planning authorities to establish a revolving fund in the development plan for the acquisition and refurbishment of listed buildings. While there is some merit in a planning authority operating such a fund if it wished, it should not be mandatory, nor should it be included in the development plan, which is a statement of local land use policy.  The Bill does not mention where planning authorities are to find the capital resources to establish such funds or the resources to implement section 11 which enables planning authorities to make grants to owners of listed buildings to assist in the preservation of such buildings.  These two proposals impose financial burdens on local authorities without giving them any new possibilities of raising additional revenue.  This is a serious shortcoming of the Bill.  It is surprising the Progressive Democrats have not addressed the issue of public spending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Financial burden would be placed on local authorities if this Bill was passed.  It would be wrong of me not to make that clear to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also staffing implications for planning authorities.  Specifically, the Bill places a new duty on planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, to deploy persons with conservation expertise.  Such a legal provision would be ineffectual on its own and could leave the planning authorities open to legal action.  Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have discretion in relation to the expertise which they wish to employ.  Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála in any event engage consultants for specific tasks where they <Col N="1258" /> have no expertise and they also consult with relevant national bodies.</P>
    <P>The requirement for planning applications relating to all listed buildings and areas to demonstrate &ldquo;environmental improvement&rdquo; is difficult to interpret, would give rise to a lot of difficulties in practice and, contrary to its intention, is likely to discourage rehabilitation of listed buildings.  The Bill also proposes to alter the basis on which planning applications relating to listed buildings or conservation areas are to be treated.  Before considering planning applications relating to listed buildings or conservation areas, planning authorities would have to be satisfied that the proposed development would confer an &ldquo;environmental improvement&rdquo;.  Thus, the local planning authority would first have to decide on the issue of &ldquo;environmental improvement&rdquo; before deciding on the totality of the application.  The decision on environmental improvement could then be appealed to An Bord Pleanála and it would only be at this stage, given a positive decision by the board, that the substantive planning issue could be dealt with.  This could lead to a decision-making period of up to 12 months and would lead to a serious disincentive to developers to redevelop or rehabilitate listed buildings or buildings in proposed conservation areas.  This well intentioned provision could have the opposite effect to that desired.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a duty on the owners of all listed buildings to ensure that the building does not deteriorate or become neglected.  It further provides that failure to meet this obligation could result in a court action.  While I understand the reasoning behind such an obligation, I believe it needs careful consideration. It is likely that without provisions for financial support or other compensatory mechanisms, it would be open to legal challenge as it would have very significant effects on property owners, regardless of their means.  The proposed restrictions on compensation in the compulsory purchase provisions <Col N="1259" /> of the Bill would also need very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I accept that the provisions of the Sanitary Services Act must be looked at in the context of listed buildings. However, the proposals before us are not an appropriate response.  The Bill states that the provisions relating to dangerous buildings in the 1964 Sanitary Services Act would not apply to buildings on land subject to a notice under the Bill.  Consequently, local authorities would be unable to take immediate action in the interests of public safety where a building is found to be in a dangerous condition, for example, due to fire.  I am not sure this is realistic.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, as amended, provides tax relief for works to buildings of intrinsically significant interest.  The Bill would greatly extend the scope of the existing concession by entitling all listed buildings to this generous relief.  It would also exempt listed buildings from residential property tax.  The use of tax relief to support the preservation of listed buildings has merit and this has been addressed by the interdepartmental group.  However, the question of extending tax reliefs to all listed buildings can only be considered by the Government in the context of costing the complete package of measures to protect important buildings.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Building Control Acts would be amended to facilitate listed buildings.  The legal effect of the amendments proposed is unclear at this stage.  However, the impact of the building control system on existing buildings is being considered as part of the current review being undertaken by my Department of the technical guidance documents.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the concerns that we have identified in relation to the Private Members' Bill before us.  While we share the objectives of improving the statutory protection for buildings of artistic, architectural or historic interest, the Government cannot accept the Bill. <Col N="1260" /> There are major concerns about some of its principal provisions and it would not be possible to deal satisfactorily with these in Committee because of the fundamental nature of the concerns.</P>
    <P>The report of the interdepartmental working group on listed buildings was submitted to the Ministers for the Environment and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the past few days and will now be considered in detail.  Deputy Quill's Bill, and the debate on it, will make a very valuable input into the consideration of the total package of measures which the Government is committed to bringing forward.  In these circumstances I trust the Deputy will be able to accept the reasons for the Government's inability to accept her Bill are genuine as are her motives in introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Quill on taking the initiative of bringing this Bill before the House.  It is a welcome and comprehensive Bill.  As Fianna Fáil spokesperson on arts, culture and heritage, I support it and urge the Government, even though we have had a negative response from the Minister, to accept it as a step on the road to preserving our past.  Heritage is important in securing the identity of a important part of the overall framework that identifies us and our past.  Up to now we have been careless in maintaining that heritage.  Shameful acts were perpetrated and much important material has fallen victim to the demolition ball.</P>
      <P>This Bill points out many of the weaknesses in current legislation.  It is an indictment of the Ministers for the Environment and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that it is an Opposition party that brought forward the Bill.  The Government, with its resources and parliamentary draftspeople, should have introduced legislative proposals before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has notable achievements under its belt in terms of conservation issues.  Some people may <Col N="1261" /> think we made mistakes in the past in terms of conservation work, but I am sure everyone in every party could point to mistakes made by their parties with regard to conservation.  There is now a much greater understanding of the meaning of conservation and for that reason this discussion is taking place this evening.  Among Fianna Fáil's notable achievements in this area is the preservation of Temple Bar.  My party also brought forward a policy document on the preservation of Georgian Dublin. That was due in great part to Deputy Eoin Ryan.  These works are part of a new and continuing enlightenment on conservation and preservation.  I hope to bring to fruition in the near future a position paper on heritage.</P>
    <P>This Bill has many strong features. The decision to include the curtilage in the definition of a building for preservation purposes is a very good one.  In this way conservation may apply not only to the actual physical structure but also to the environment within which it is set.  This would have major significance for many great Irish houses which have seen new houses encroach on their doorsteps.  The definition of &ldquo;element of built heritage&rdquo; is a good and encompassing one.  This has been a major weakness of conservation provisions in the past, with important elements of the built heritage not preserved. Staircases, plaster work, wood work, fixtures and features often disappeared during renovations.  In some instances, developers took a minimalist view of conservation.  Elements of built heritage also fell victim to State vandalism.</P>
    <P>The threat to built heritage continues. The Irish Georgian Society recently highlighted the planned development of Nos. 82 and 83 Merrion Square, which poses a threat to the built heritage in these fine houses.  The threat is not just to the two houses involved but also to other such fine squares.  If permission is given for this development, the integrity of all such houses will be threatened. Mountjoy Square and St. Stephen's Green are examples of gradual decline. <Col N="1262" /> One third of the houses in Mountjoy Square have been demolished and it now resembles a mouth with missing teeth, with massive gaping holes in its landscape.  While many would argue that Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square seem intact, beyond the hall door it is a different story.  While the external fabric of the buildings may be listed, internal features are not so.  I understand from the Irish Georgian Society that the interiors of only four houses in Merrion Square and one in Fitzwilliam Square are listed.  These fine examples of 18th century Dublin squares must be preserved and their interiors should not be left vulnerable to careless development.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil previously emphasised the necessity for a national authority for listed buildings, including interiors, and will continue to urge that course of action.  There have been instances in the past where listed buildings, or about-tobe listed buildings suffered atrocities and had to be demolished.  Mysterious fires and other such disasters have struck at key times.  Special provision is made in the Bill for buildings and listed built heritage within conservation areas which are maliciously destroyed, and that is a welcome inclusion.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed not only to hear that the Minister is not happy with the references to conservation areas because they seem to be too wide in defination but even more so that she did not put forward proposals in this regard. She could have taken the opportunity to explore that aspect in her contribution.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes the list of elements of built heritage mandatory rather than optional as at present.  It is worth considering that proposal.  The onus is now on the planning authorities to establish conservation areas and to draw up plans for their preservation and enhancement. Applications in these areas will be judged on the criteria of environmental improvements.</P>
    <P>I support the further links the Bill proposes between the National Heritage Council and the planning authorities. I welcome section 5 which <Col N="1263" /> makes it clear that demolition requires planning permission either for a listed element of built heritage or for an unlisted building in a conservation area. It is a positive step that a planning authority could require a developer to take specified steps for guarding a building during its development.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Quill's concern for buildings which in the past have been allowed to become endangered which, in turn, led to dereliction.  The Bill will call a halt to this regressive behaviour which is, as Deputy Quill points out, the very heart of the Bill.  I welcome the extension of the powers to local authorities to deal with this matter.  The references in the Bill in this regard are to injunctions, the ability to serve notices on the owner or occupier, the powers of the local authority to recoup costs if necessary from the addressee of the notice and the question of compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said the Bill placed great emphasis on the need for further action from local government and that for local government to take up that challenge there would be a great need to examine the whole question of staff and resources.  She also outlined the need for strengthening local government and we all share the view that cannot be done without additional resources.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister of State to simply make a bald statement in this House.  She represents the Government and I hoped she would have given some inkling of the resources that would have been made available by the Government to help promote this Bill and matters of heritage generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement that the references in the Bill to grants and tax incentives did not take account of the difficult economic realities we now face was disappointing.  As Deputy Quill said in reply to the Minister of State, that was not the business of a Private Member's Bill and, in any event, the references would not have prevented the Minister putting forward her views on <Col N="1264" /> the way in which tax incentives or grants could be made available.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the contributions of the Minister of State and Deputy Quill and I was struck by the differences in approach.  Deputy Quill expounded a committed view but, unfortunately, that could only be matched by a type of nit-picking by the Minister.  The Minister is correct in saying legislation is needed and that such Bills should be given every consideration but in doing so there must be a recognition that action is needed now. We do not need more consideration that does not lead to action.</P>
    <P>In addition to legislation from the Government we also need to examine the importance of education in regard to our heritage.  At every available opportunity in the debate on the arts plan, the White Paper on Education or discussions in the House on matters of heritage, I have said we must encourage our young people to not only recognise but appreciate more deeply our heritage. We can do that by giving them an opportunity to experience our heritage through primary, secondary and third level education.</P>
    <P>I should have said I wish to share my time with Deputy Eoin Ryan.</P>

      <P>I want to highlight the importance of education in regard to our heritage.  Although the proposal has not met with a positive response from the opposite side of the House, I hope the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, and the Minister for Education will get together to discuss a common approach with regard to our education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the important issue of conservation and preservation which is not confined merely to towns and cities. It is important to refer to the commitment in the programme for Government in relation to legislation for the <Col N="1265" /> national heritage areas because no such Bill has materialised.  Our built heritage is not confined to urban areas; many other aspects of our heritage need to be preserved.  Further legislation, not more promises, is required to do that.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht introduces legislation with regard to the proposed national heritage areas on which we can have an open and frank debate.  This issue is causing great concern, particularly among farmers, many of whom believe they have not been consulted with regard to these proposed national heritage areas.  Farmers could be regarded as the first conservationalists.  They should be recognised as such and given an opportunity to take on this task. Farmers have been working the land for many generations and the only way the national heritage areas will operate effectively is through consultation and co-operation with them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil favours a balanced approach to conservation where the rights of landowners are respected. Farmers have a key role to play and the development of heritage areas must take place in conjunction with them. The conservation proposals must be developed in such a way as to ensure farmers' incomes are not jeopardised. Fianna Fáil is proposing that development of the areas should be carried out in the context of an overall plan for economic and rural regeneration under which farmers would have an opportunity to replace lost farming income with income from conservation duties. Fianna Fáil had a number of discussions with experts in this field and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Quill for introducing this important legislation which provided us with an opportunity to discuss what should be a major element in any Government's armoury.  I am disappointed at the lack of a positive response from the Minister of State, Deputy McManus.  I hope that as she listens to further contributions she may change her mind and, in turn, convince her colleagues this is a worthwhile Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy de Valera, for sharing her time. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I welcome and support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Quill on bringing it forward.  It is obvious the Deputy put an enormous amount of work into the preparation of the Bill which is a timely move by herself and her party.  I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.</P>
      <P>The principle of this Bill, which aims to protect the interiors and surroundings of buildings not protected at present and to strengthen existing provisions for listed buildings, has already been strongly advocated by Fianna Fáil. As my party's spokesperson on urban renewal, I recently published Fianna Fáil's policy position on Georgian Dublin. That policy, which my party is committed to implementing in Government, aims to rejuvenate as a living quarter the heart of Dublin, which is its Georgian squares and streets.  Fianna Fáil also recognises the potential for similar schemes to be put into operation in many provincial towns.  In proposing a package of tax measures to encourage the conversion of Georgian houses from offices and bedsits into family homes and some measure of mixed usage, the need for legislation such as this was recognised as a vital plank in the development of our built heritage.  This Bill is timely and worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is recognised by all sides as inadequate.  The listing of buildings is totally inadequate and provides little practical protection.  The destruction of our built heritage, once wholesale, continues at a steady and corrosive pace.  Ireland, in comparison with other European countries, has a relatively small stock of historic buildings. Consequently, we must exercise a special duty of care.  There is palpable anger and considerable shame among this generation at the historical neglect of our built heritage.  Remarks about &ldquo;belted earls&rdquo; and the &ldquo;blue rinse brigade&rdquo; that at one time roused a cheer are now rightly viewed with embarrassment. This Bill seeks to address the fact that, <Col N="1267" /> although opinion has moved on, the law has not.  The law is entirely inadequate to protect our heritage.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was published, I was working on introducing a similar Bill.  I congratulate Deputy Quill on her work and timing.  There is an urgent need to tackle the problem whereby listing a building gives no protection to the interior and surroundings of an historic structure.  Dublin has been scarred forever by gaping holes where once stood beautiful and historic staircases, carved marble fireplaces and stunning plaster ceilings.  What has replaced these fixtures, when the entire structure has not been destroyed, has been infill that varies from the inadequate to the appalling.</P>
    <P>The latest victim of the present official malaise is 15 Usher's Quay. Famous for its role in James Joyce's short story <i>The Dead,</i> it has been allowed to fall into decay.  Similarly, the Regency gothic interiors, including magnificent plasterwork ceilings, in the Church of St. Michael and St. John beside the civic offices on the quays were taken out without recourse to any regulation or law.  This was to make room for a museum featuring Viking relics and some thatched Viking cottages. While neglect and chauvinism were once the main enemies of preserving heritage, the danger now comes from unrelenting commercial pressure, an unnecessary side effect of our recently acquired prosperity.</P>
    <P>Vigilance is required to preserve a building which misplaced development can destroy forever.  Eternal vigilance is the price we must pay to preserve our heritage.  In Dublin the external fabric of Merrion and Fitzwilliam Squares remains intact.  Every house on both squares is listed for preservation in the Dublin city development plan, list 1. Unfortunately, this listing does not encompass the interiors.  The separate listing for interior, list, 4, deals with the interior features of buildings.  Incredibly, interiors of only four houses on Merrion Square are on list 4 and no houses in Fitzwilliam Square are on it. <Col N="1268" /> This means that our Georgian squares, a vast wealth of historical detail and an internationally recognised image of our capital city, are vulnerable to crass and poorly planned development.  A great deal of damage has already been done. In 54 Fitzwilliam Square, for example, the internal walls and stairs at second and third floor levels were removed and replaced with open plan offices and a spiral staircase.  This legislation would prevent this all too frequent occurrence.</P>
    <P>The Government needs to take a number of actions simultaneously.  First, it must ensure there is adequate legal provision for historic buildings, their interiors and surrounds.  This Bill achieves that objective.  Second, there must be provision for an integrated regime of tax incentives to secure a general change of use of historic houses from offices and bedsits to family homes.  Fianna Fáil recently published a policy paper outlining how this can be done.  Third, the Government, as the biggest landlord of historic buildings, should lead by example.  Historic buildings in Government ownership are usually in offices, closed to the public and furnished in a way that is oblivious of the buildings' historical features.</P>
    <P>Recently I tabled a number of questions to Ministers about historic buildings used by Government Departments. It was amazing to find out how many are not open to the public.  The Government could make more of these historic buildings accessible to the public. Among the properties in the ownership of the State are 21 and 31 Fitzwilliam Square and 5, 6A, 16, 44, 45, 73, 88 and 89 Merrion Square.  Is it any wonder that the light goes out of Georgian Dublin at 6 p.m. every evening?  If the Government is serious about preserving our heritage it must develop a co-ordinated policy for its property portfolio. The best hope for the long-term preservation of Georgian houses is reconversion to family homes with, where desirable, a limited element of mixed usage. Fianna Fáil, as it has clearly set out in its policy document for Georgian Dublin, is committed to doing this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> This Bill seeks not only to protect the building and its interiors but also its curtilage.  I welcome this.  Intrinsic to a building is its surrounds.  A great deal of bungled building on historic grounds might be prevented if this measure is enacted.  However, I am concerned that the term &ldquo;curtilage&rdquo; might not be sufficinetly defined and might not be sufficiently wide.  An architectural encyclopaedia I consulted defined curtilage as &ldquo;the grounds adjacent to a dwelling and appertaining to a yard, garden or court&rdquo;.  Would this be sufficient to prevent the proposed building of houses on the mall approaching Carton House from Maynooth, for example?  The mall, strictly speaking, might not be part of the curtilage of Carton House.  It is, however, absolutely intrinsic to the integrity of the building.  This issue should be looked at on Committee Stage with a view to strengthening the provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill also highlights the need for authorities to have trained and qualified personnel to deal with historic buildings. Local authorities, in particular, have much responsibility for the preservation of historic buildings.  However, they seldom have the resources they require to carry out these duties properly. If the Government is serious about preserving our built heritage, it must act through a broad range of measures. Good intentions and <i>ad hoc</i> actions did nothing to stop 15 Usher's Quay from falling into disrepair.  Can we wonder that James Joyce chose silence, exile and cunning as his weapons?</P>
    <P>Up to today the inter-governmental working group's report on listed buildings has not been published.  The Government has put this issue on the long finger since it came into office.  We are continually lectured on the importance of our heritage but the Government is not supporting its talk with action.  The Opposition parties, on the other hand, have published policy papers and legislation.  There is no shortage of suggested remedies.  What has been conspicuously lacking to date is the will to act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> It is strange that the interdepartmental working group's report is available to Government Ministers but is not before the House tonight.  If the Government was really interested in this subject it would have made the report available as it would have added greatly to this debate.  There is a huge amount of information in it which Members could have used.  We are continually told the report will be released and, as the Ministers already have it, I cannot understand why it has not been made available to Members.</P>
    <P>No political debate about the future of our built heritage should be completed without paying tribute to the voluntary organisations and concerned individuals who campaigned tirelessly to ensure that our built heritage passed on intact.  All political parties should face the fact that we were latecomers to the idea of historical preservation.  Together with the general population, we have only gradually realised the damage we have done to our heritage by neglect and poor development.  Future generations owe a debt of gratitude to the foresight of a small number of individuals who fought to highlight the importance of our historic buildings and the danger that faces them.  That danger is ever present.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be a useful measure in ensuring that the present situation is improved.  The Minister of State said that conservation for conservation's sake is not enough and that if these buildings are to be preserved new uses will have to be found for them.  If tax incentives are provided and there is the right attitude, the market will look after the rest.  A few years ago nobody would have thought that Temple Bar would contain children's theatres and breweries. The market takes care of such developments.</P>

Her party is coming round to seeing the great benefits the market can provide and is slowly dropping the ideological positions of old.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This welcome Bill addresses many of the anomalies in the procedures for dealing with horses in urban areas.  The problem of wandering horses in Dublin has been growing in recent years, and there is a similar problem in Limerick, Cork and other urban areas.  For whatever reason, we have not put in place measures to deal with horses similar to those for dealing with dogs.  For example, there is no registration or licensing system for horses and it is not possible to monitor their care, ownership etc. in urban areas.  As a result there has been a proliferation of horses in these areas.  Some of them are wild while others are left by their owners to wander on the streets and feed in green areas in estates.  This is a widespread problem in areas such as Ballyfermot, Finglas and Tallaght. We have heard horrific stories about people who have been injured by wandering horses and about horses which have been seriously mulilated or killed. Only yesterday there was a report in the newspaper about a horse tied to a tree which went around in circles until the rope eventually strangled him.  Unfortunately, such incidents are becoming more common.  The number of wandering horses has increased to such an extent that they dominate the quality of life in housing estates.  When this happens it is time to deal with the problem effectively.  Families living in estates <Col N="1272" /> where wandering horses are a problem want to see regulations in this area.</P>
      <P>The 1985 Animals Act attempted to deal with animals which were inadvertently let loose in urban areas and made provision for the establishment of pounds.  However, this legislation did not have many teeth and it has not dealt effectively with the problem.  Last year £40,000 was spent in maintaining and operating the Dublin Corporation pound in Churchtown.  A total of 151 horses were impounded during the year but there was no adequate means of identification, no penalty could be imposed for the damage done etc.  This is an indication of how difficult it is to deal with the problem effectively.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out a comprehensive set of procedures for dealing with the problem and proposes the establishment of a statutory body and the introduction of penalties.  It is necessary for the problem to be dealt with on a statutory basis and to put in place a service for owners, many of whom are young, so that they can care for their horses properly.  Consideration must also be given to the Smithfield fair in Dublin.  Obviously the legislation will not cover all these areas and the other services will have a role to play in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Bill reflects the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce legislation on the control of horses, particularly in urban areas.  It provides for a licencing, identification and registration system and a ban on the sale of horses to minors.  These are important provisions as many youngsters pool their money and buy horses independently of adults.  By enshrining the adult dimension in the legislation there will be the necessary element of control and responsibility.  The Bill also deals with the disposal and seizure of horses and the attachment of criminal liability for injury caused by them. These issues can be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the 1985 Animals Act had been effective we probably would not be here today discussing the legislation. <Col N="1273" /> However, that Act did not deal specifically with this problem.  It is important that responsibility for the implementation of the legislation is delegated to local authorities and the revenue from fines is retained by them.  The administration of the procedures will be funded to a considerable extent by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  If we do not provide the necessary facilities, staffing and funding at local authority level, then the legislation will not be properly enforced.  A considerable amount of funding will be required to deal with this problem which involves thousands of horses in urban areas.  There are many people, set in their ways in terms of horse ownership, trading in horses in urban settings as part of their occupational activities.</P>
    <P>The control of horses will involve much administration and a firm attitude to the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill.  The yield from fines will be welcomed, as will the funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  There should be a section in each local authority, with the requisite medical and other professional staff, responsible for tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>The Garda, who have responsibility for collecting many of the fines stipulated in this Bill, will have to be willing to address the problem constructively and liaise with the relevant local authorities. As legislators very often we enact legislation, sought by the Garda or other sections of the community, but thereafter are frustrated by its lack of enforcement.  Unless the provisions of this Bill are enforced from the beginning, with those responsible making every effort to resolve it, this widespread problem will continue.</P>
    <P>What can we do to tackle the proliferation of wandering horses in urban areas?  We must ask how it came about and why it is getting worse?  It appears that involvement with horses has a big influence on the lifestyles and interests of youngsters generally, thousands of whom live in deprived areas, whether it be in Ballymun, Finglas, Ballyfermot, Tallaght or Clondalkin.  We owe it to <Col N="1274" /> those youngsters to endeavour to replace that interest in some way without necessarily eliminating that involvement with horses.</P>
    <P>There is enormous scope for what have been described as corral projects, under which local authorities, vocational education committees, local FÁS and partnership boards would liaise and allocate tracts of land for their establishment.  Horses could be made available for youngsters who do not have them.  Those young people could be educated on the handling of horses, caring for them, saddling and riding them in addition to being encouraged to compete in gymkhanas.  Likewise vocational education committees or FÁS could initiate employment projects. It should be possible to provide training for youngsters on equine care, nourishment and so on and promote a positive approach to the care of animals. If we do not encourage youngsters' involvement in some type of physical activity, whether it is football, boxing or horse-riding, they will become involved in harmful activities, such as drugs which are endemic in many such communities.</P>
    <P>The greatest proliferation of wandering horses is in local authority housing estates or high rise complexes where there is a very high level of unemployment and poverty.</P>
    <P>We must examine the traditional fair that takes place in Smithfield on the first Sunday of each month.  It is not subject to any legal control and members of the travelling community, farmers, youngsters and citizens of rural areas and Dubliners attend to purchase or sell horses.  Up to approximately 12 months ago, that fair was badly controlled but, since the involvement of bodies such as Dublin Corporation, the DSPCA, horse owners, the Dublin Horse Council and the Garda &mdash; the fair ground has been fenced off and youngsters are not allowed to gallop horses or cause any harm or inconvenience to local residents.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new heritage areas rejuvenation programme, HARP, <Col N="1275" /> devised by local authorities and subsidised by EU funding, incorporated the Smithfield fair in its long-term projects for the city, an interesting development. It is a tourist attraction, is part of our urban and national culture and I hope it will continue to flourish.  While this programme may necessitate the drawing up of additional regulations and by-laws by local authorities it will represent an integral part of our response to the need to control wandering horses.</P>
    <P>Occasionally members of the travelling community are blamed for horses wandering around the city.  Seldom have I come across horses belonging to the travelling community in areas in which I am involved, certainly not in Ballyfermot although very often members of the travelling community are blamed or used as easy scapegoats.  They have a traditional love of horses and I do not want the problem attributed to them.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill and look forward to further discussion of its provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, on introducing this long-promised Bill.  People in many urban areas in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and elsewhere will be grateful that at last legislation to control wandering horses is being placed on the Statute Book.  I will speak later about its enforcement because, legislation in itself amounts to nothing unless it is enforced.</P>
      <P>The Bill prescribes tough medicine for the unsolved problem of wandering horses in urban areas.  Its provisions are wide-ranging establishing, as it does, controlled areas where horses cannot be kept without licence.  In other areas horses can be kept with licence under certain strict conditions only.  Through this Bill an effort is being made to bring order to a problem that has been a source of major grievance to many urban residents for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> The Bill provides for disqualification from keeping a horse or obtaining a licence in addition to a provision for banning the sale of horses to minors under 16 years of age.  Most important this Bill provides for the seizure, detention and disposal of stray, unlicensed, unidentifiable horses or those causing a nuisance or posing a danger to the public.</P>
    <P>Section 42 attaches a criminal liability to the owner, keeper or person in charge who wilfully or recklessly permits horses to pose a danger to any person or property, to cause injury or to damage the property of any person. Provision is also made for powers of enforcement, powers of arrest and the issue of search warrants in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>All these measures are long overdue. I welcome, in particular, the penalties provision.  The penalties are substantial providing for a £1,500 fine or six months' imprisonment or both on summary conviction and for fines of up to £10,000 or two years' imprisonment or both on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>To assist the Garda in the detection process arrangements are being made in the Department to consider the issue of tagging to help with identification.  If we cannot identify the owners, we will be hampered in our efforts to pursue a prosecution with a view to sustaining a conviction.  I am surprised that the Department has not been able to bring to a conclusion its views on the best form of identification.  I know it is considering freeze-branding, tattooing and microchip implanting and maybe a combination of all those measures will be required, but I am disappointed it has not been possible to bring consideration on that matter to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the crucial power local authorities will be given under the legislation to dispose of horses that have been impounded on one or more occasion.  It is important that the right balance is struck between animal welfare rights and the rights of ordinary citizens to public safety.  If horses have been impounded on more than one <Col N="1277" /> occasion, clearly their owners are not concerned with animal welfare issues.  It may well be in the best interests of the horse and the public for that animal to be put down.  That may seem a tough measure, but tough measures of that kind will have to be imposed.  Sometimes in our society the rights of animals often take precedence over the rights of the public.  We need a sense of balance, but at all times public safety must come first.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of this legislation will cost money and the Bill proposes that the finance will come from a number of sources.  The proceeds from licence fees, fees for inspection of registers, fees for horses impounded and fines imposed on summary conviction will go to local authorities.  There is provision for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to make special grants to local authorities to financially assist them to enforce this legislation.</P>
    <P>In all, the Bill provides an elaborate plan to rid us once and for all of the scourge of wandering horses, but it is worth nothing unless the commitments in it and the commitments from statutory authorities with powers to enforce it are fully implemented.  There have been many false dawns regarding the implementation of legislation.  Many owners who have their horses impounded can promptly pay the fee and have their horses back on the streets very quickly.</P>
    <P>We all know of sad cases where children, in particular, have been scarred for life as a result of a kick from a wandering horse.  In many parts of my constituency and other parts of Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Galway and Limerick parks and greens are no-go areas.  Often local people must make long detours in their localities to catch buses and to avail of public utilities and shopping facilities because they are afraid of wandering horses in open spaces.</P>
    <P>An example worth noting is St. Aidan's School in west Tallaght where the trees, hedges and shrubs have been <Col N="1278" /> wrecked by wandering horses.  Excrement has been found on the paths and school grounds and the staff and principal have all been attacked by them.  The school's football pitch has been ruined and will cost £20,000 to resurface.  During the past two years the school has had to spend £5,000 landscaping and undoing the work of roaming horses. The staff and principal have asked me why they should have had to deal with that problem and why they and the children should have been endangered by wandering horses.</P>
    <P>Members of Raheen Residents' Association, another group in Tallaght, whom the Minister met on one of his recent visits to the area, said at a recent large public meeting that the biggest issue in the area was not crime or unemployment, but wandering horses.  It is frightening that for some communities wandering horses was a bigger issues than the serious escalation of crime and the high levels of unemployment.  That should put in context the necessity for this legislation.  I know that many people and Deputies do not realise how necessary and vital it is.  Many people throughout the country wake up in the morning to see their gardens ruined from hoof marks or excrement and a horse in the garden.  Those horses do not just destroy gardens and green spaces, they pose a major safety problem for children and many of their owners do not have regard for animal or public safety.  Recently residents in a housing estate on the Blessington Road near Saggart pleaded with their politicians to have the green space they demanded fenced off because they could not cope with the wandering horses constantly grazing on it.</P>
    <P>Many residents wonder if the State is on their side and while they welcome the publication of the Bill and its speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, they really only judge a commitment when they see that the tough measures proposed in the Bill being implemented.  Serious problems, like the issue of wandering horses, <Col N="1279" /> demand radical action.  We cannot continue to take a softly, softly approach. Occasional efforts at rounding up and impounding horses will not be enough. We must be prepared to put these animals down if that is the only way of dealing with the public safety issue and the menace they pose to many local communities.</P>
    <P>In some parts of Dublin, in particular, a culture has emerged among teenagers who consider that they should have horses to play with and with which to excite their fellow neighbours.  That is regrettable because traditionally children, in particular, had a great appreciation of all kinds of animals.  That is not always the case, but I know successful programmes were undertaken with children to teach them management skills and respect for and appreciation of animals. That has played a constructive and positive role and I hope such programmes can be encouraged.</P>
    <P>It might be better if the pounds were privatised or private security firms took charge of them.  Local authority resources are always scarce and there are many demands on them.  Local authority officials can often be intimidated by irate owners of those animals. Private security firms may have a greater capacity to enforce this legislation and to deal with the irate owners who may demand the return of their horses.</P>
    <P>Our laws are littered with legislation that is not enforced, such as the enforcement provisions on the removal of sand and gravel from the foreshore.  Similarly, our litter Acts to prevent indiscriminate dumping of rubbish and, in many respects, the criminal law, is often not enforced.  I hope this worthy and important legislation will not simply be a threat rather than enforced.  If that were to happen, it would be roundly condemned by the people who have demanded this legislation.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced a few weeks ago a considerable number of people from the Tallaght-Clondalkin area were in the public gallery to hear <Col N="1280" /> the opening statements.  It is not often that constituents contact politicians to come to this House to hear a debate. This legislation is considered so important in certain areas that people demanded to come here because they did not believe it would be introduced.</P>
    <P>Wandering horses are generally a problem in working class areas of high unemployment, areas that must deal with high levels of crime, drug pushing and other problems.  Those people have enough to cope with and should not have to deal with the extra burden wandering horses cause to their communities. If the House will excuse the pun, the owners of these horses have ridden roughshod over these communities for far too long.  People's basic rights and public safety must always be protected. If the penalties are meaningful and if they are imposed, we could by the end of 1997 deal in a substantial way with wandering horses.  That is 18 months away, but it will take that long to pass the legislation and put in place the enforcement, tagging and identification process and all the other things that are necessary if this legislation is to be practical and workable.  If the Minister were to set himself a target to have this legislation fully in place and the issue of wandering horses dealt with in a meaningful way by the end of 1997, it would be a very welcome and ambitious target.</P>
    <P>The pressure to enforce the legislation must come from the Government down, not the other way round.  The Minister must ensure there is continuity, consistency and uniformity between local authorities in the enforcement of this legislation.  If some local authorities enforce it and others do not, the owners of the horses will take them to the greener pastures where the law is weakest, where it is not being enforced.  That happens at the moment in the context of travellers.  The record of some local authorities is appalling.  As a result, those local authorities that have tended to deal with the problem have had the problem escalated over and over again as the travellers move to areas where <Col N="1281" /> they tend to be more favourably treated.  The same will apply to wandering horses.  I hope that when the Minister is responding this evening he will give an undertaking to ensure that there will be no gaps in the way this legislation is enforced, that right across the country there will be consistency in enforcing the legislation.  If we have that commitment, if we have a co-ordinated approach, and if we have a top down commitment to its implementation, its policing and its enforcement, this legislation will play a significant role in dealing with a problem which has been a scourge for 20 years and which has been mounting every year.  It is only in the past 18 months to two years that I realised how serious a problem it has become.  When one goes to a residents' meeting of 200 to 300 people in a small housing estate in west Tallaght and is told the most serious issue on their large agenda is that of wandering horses because they are worried about their children's safety, their own safety and their property, then one really realises how significant, important and necessary this legislation is.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and his officials well in implementing it.  The Minister has already served a very worthy purpose by bringing it forward.  When I first raised the need for this legislation it was not clear which Department had responsibility.  No Department wanted to take on the issue.  It was wandering legislation, wandering around from Environment to Agriculture, Food and Forestry and any other Department that would take it.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry now has responsibility.  The Minister has spearheaded this comprehensive legislation. He deserves all our thanks and congratulations for that.  This legislation has resulted from extensive consultation with the affected parties.  Because of that it is, on the whole, positive and comprehensive.  I am happy to support it.  I hope it gets a speedy passage through the Oireachtas, which my party will facilitate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is not before its time.  It deals with a problem which has arisen in urban areas in particular where the keeping of horses in housing estates has become almost part of a new youth culture.  This began in the early 1990s.  It became fashionable as a result of the screening of some films, one of which, &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo;, showed a scene depicting a horse being taken up in a lift at the Bally mun flats.  In the film &ldquo;Into the West&rdquo; the actor, Gabriel Byrne, played the part of a horse dealer or tangle, and young boys played with horses.  This, perhaps, captured the imagination and keeping horses became a fashion.</P>
      <P>Previously the keeping of horses was very much a rural pastime.  In cities it was only a wealthy person who could afford to purchase a horse, rent a paddock, buy a stable and engage in the sport of keeping horses.  That has changed, and throughout our city there are hundreds of horses roaming around in open spaces, in public parks and on waste ground.  It is not a pretty sight. One sees horses hobbled or tied up on wast ground in some of the suburbs. Often the condition of these animals does not speak well for their owners. This goes against a trend, because being an animal lover is very much part of human nature.</P>
      <P>What has been happening lately is ridiculous and very dangerous.  On public open spaces, horses and children do not mix well.  There have been countless cases of injury to children.  Dublin Corporation is paying out, on average, £20,000 per claim for injuries suffered by people who have been kicked or trampled on, and there is a list of claims pending.  Horses also create a problem for private soccer and GAA clubs when animals wander on to the pitch.  If somebody is injured the liability is on the owner of the land, not on the owner of the horse.  This creates certain financial problems for the clubs.  This Bill addresses that problem and makes the owner of the horse liable for what happens to the horse or to anybody who comes into contact with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> It is frustrating for sports clubs when horses roam through their pitches and make the pitches unplayable so that matches have to be called off.  Pitches are often made permanently unplayable. In my constituency many of the pitches in Darndale Park and Belcamp Park were completely unplayable for most of this winter and right up to the present time because of the damage caused by horses' hooves.  Horses fouling pitches is also a problem, creating a possible health risk for people who are subsequently injured on the pitch. Horses fouling streets and roads in densely built up areas is a problem too.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation's parks department has been attempting to deal with this problem in the city by rounding up horses left in public open spaces, but their staff are often physically threatened, verbally abused and prevented from taking horses away.  The cost of trying to deal with that has been a financial millstone around the necks of local authorities who are constantly strapped for funds.  The new legislation addresses that issue also.  It imposes fines and penalties which when collected will become part of the revenue of the local authority, putting it in a position to fund the rounding up of horses and dealing with the problem generally.</P>
    <P>A most important aspect of the Bill is the provision for the amendment of the Protection of Animals Act.  Animals straying on to roads and motorways have been injured and even killed.  A horse was killed on the Malahide Road at the Darndale roundabout the day before Christmas and was lying on the road for several hours before it was possible to have it removed.  The owners of the horses must have regard for the safety of the animals.  It is now commonplace to see horses looking unfed, not properly shod and being abused. Last week I saw horses which were hobbled being stoned by youths who seemed to think that was fun; the horses were startled and frightened.  In winter time horses are left out in the open in all kinds of weather.  This causes ill <Col N="1284" /> health, and anybody with any basic knowledge of animals knows that in bad weather animals have to be fed and stabled in dry accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the question of the requirements of those interested in horsemanship, the need for equine parks, the skills required to look after horses and proposes training schemes to encourage people who have a genuine interest in horses and animals generally to develop the proper skills and knowledge to look after animals and to engage in the pastime with due care to the animals and everybody else.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  Members have referred to other Acts such as the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, and so on where the implementation of the law has not been all that it should be.  We should learn the lesson from that.  The implementation of the legislation needs to be monitored and requires the involvement of the local authorities and the Garda Síochána where the animals have to be confiscated.  To do this successfully there would have to be a system in every local authority area and in every Garda division involving somebody with responsibility to deal with the problem.  We can then look forward to the implementation of the legislation when enacted.  People have been waiting patiently for this legislation and can now look forward to being able to walk freely in the parks and children and youths can play safely on the pitches knowing there will be controlled areas for those who want to ride horses.</P>
    <P>Sometimes travellers are blamed for the problem caused by wandering horses.  In the constituency of Dublin north east there is a number of halting sites and group housing schemes but one rarely, if ever, sees horses around these locations.  Animal drawn transport went out with the stagecoach and now travellers use other vehicles.  Animals are no longer required as beasts of burden. This is not a traveller problem but a problem caused by young people who are not aware of how to deal with animals, particularly with horses, and rush <Col N="1285" /> headlong into buying a horse at the Smithfield market, bringing home and showing it off to friends, allowing them to gallop off on the horse, having no regard for the welfare of the animal or of anybody else who might accidentally come into contact with the animals.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan for introducing this Bill.  I support it and look forward to its speedy implementation.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Government has reacted to the Bill published by my colleague Deputy Kenneally dealing with the control and regulation of horses by introducing this Bill.  Dogs are not allowed legally to roam in public places but horses which are a source of greater danger to the general public are largely uncontrolled.  It is unbelievable that no form of registration or licensing was ever introduced for horses.  The Control of Dogs Act, 1986 is working well in County Kerry under a veterinary officer from Kerry County Council who is doing an excellent job and making sure that very few dogs are roaming the countryside.</P>
      <P>The problem of uncontrolled horses roaming the countryside has not been put into perspective and we do not realise the extent of the danger, anger and frustration until there is a mishap. We have allowed a very dangerous situation to develop or continue for decades with consequent loss of life.  Such incidents were conveniently classified as road accidents and there seemed to be no urgency about dealing with the underlying problem.  It occurs mainly in large urban areas in cities but in certain cases it occurs in towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main experience of this problem has been in the urban context.  I realise there is a problem also in rural areas.  In trying to deal with the problem we must <Col N="1286" /> legislate not only for the current difficulty but also to cope with future difficulties and the way some horse owners might try to circumvent the law.  It is very important that the regulations should be enforced throughout the entire country and not just in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kenneally's proposed system of identification.  A tamper proof method must be introduced if at all possible.  There is a number of systems of identification such as freeze branding, microchip implant, lip tattoo, hoof tattoo or other methods but the least likely one to be interfered with is the microchip implant.  A microchip is implanted during minor surgery and is replaceable only by the same method, which is probably the only system with any chance of success, given the expertise involved.  While it may be a paying proposition to insert a temporary replacement in the case of a valuable recehorse, it is a far more remote possibility in the case of a horse that is kept as a pet.  The regulations should be enforced for all horses with the exception of thoroughbred racehorses.  It should be an offence to keep any horse over the age of six months unless he can be properly identified.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the definition of foal in the interpretation section of the Bill altered.  It states that a foal is a horse under one year being nursed by a dam or foster dam.  It should be specified as six months.  A nine or ten month foal could roam free, causing extensive damage.  Will the Minister of State look again at this on Committee Stage?  We have been able to effect such controls in the case of cows and cattle for the purpose of eradicating disease.</P>
    <P>Registration should be carried out by the local authority for the functional area in which the horse is to be kept. There should be restrictions on the type of person who would qualify to own a horse.  I envisage that this registration procedure would be operated somewhat along the lines of the present motor vehicle registration whereby the Garda would have easy access to the records to <Col N="1287" /> establish the ownership of an impounded horse.  As regards the ownership of horses I query whether 16 is too young.  Will the Minister look at this on Committee Stage to see if he could see the logic of raising the age to 17 years.  This is a very reasonable request.  The most important aspect of this legislation is the control of the horses.  They should not be allowed to be in any place other than the premises of the owner, the premises of any other person in charge of the horse, the premises of any other person with the consent of the person and the owner or such other person in charge of the horse keeps it under effective control.  The application of such criteria would immediately preclude horses from straying on public roads, private property or lands in the control of a local authority. Impounding a horse should be carried out by the local authority in liaison with the Garda Síochána and an ISPCA inspector.  These bodies should agree on the most appropriate arrangements.  All costs incurred in the removal of a horse to the pound, in the provision of sustenance while in the pound and veterinary fees should be paid before release.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>Although each local authority is required to provide a horse pound most have failed to do so.  From a financial point of view, this would not be feasible. Apart from the financial implications, the main problem is security.</P>
    <P>The legislation dealing with the sale of horses also needs to be tightened to ensure the permission of the local authority is required before a horse fair, sale or mart is held, to prohibit the sale of horses to any person under 18 years of age and to ensure the attendance of a veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>In keeping a horse one should be required to provide sufficient grazing land. There have been instances where horses have been kept in a house or garden.  This should be allowed only where the owner can prove that the animal is a workhorse on which he depends for a substantial part <Col N="1288" /> of his income.  There is a need for regulation in this respect.</P>
    <P>Regulations are needed also to ensure horses are exercised in a reasonable and disciplined manner.  It is ridiculous to think a horse can be cared for properly on the side of a street.  In urban areas one should be required to provide proper quarters to ensure horses are not mistreated.</P>
    <P>The owner of an animal will be held liable for any damage or injury caused to a person, motor vehicle or other property in the event of an accident.  I am anxious to know from where the resources will come to pay compensation. More often than not the owners of wandering horses are unable to come up with a realistic amount of money and the likelihood of insurance cover is slim. We should consider introducing a scheme of insurance similar to car insurance to provide adequate cover. Innocent pedestrians, cyclists, motorists or householders who suffer serious damage to their home, land or other property should not be at a loss.</P>
    <P>From where will the local authorities get the necessary finance to implement the provisions of this Bill?  I note that the Minister of State may make grants available but I would like to see the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; removed and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the making of by-laws will be a reserved function of members of local authorities.  I am glad also that the powers of the Garda Síochána will be greatly strengthened as they will now be able to carry out searches without a warrant in certain instances.</P>
    <P>This legislation and any by-laws, regulations and licensing systems arising should be put in place at the earliest possible opportunity.  I look forward to the Minister of State implementing its principal provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, on its introduction.  I also compliment and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Kenneally, for prompting this action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> This Bill is pro rather than anti-horse. Unlike some of my more illustrious colleagues in my constituency, I am not a horsey person.  Horses have given us so much joy.  Children take great pleasure in feeding, cleaning, trekking, hunting and racing them.  They are of tremendous importance to the economy.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to exercise control over the percentage of horses which for one reason or another are owned &mdash; I am kind in saying this &mdash; by people who care little for them or about the way they are treated.  We have a tremendous opportunity to do something about this problem.  Laws are often made as little more than a public relations exercise.  I am aware of the Minister of State's conviction but we should ensure this is not a wasted effort by doing what my colleagues and Government backbenchers have suggested, to take animals off the road.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in urban areas.  I fully admit this but, as the Minister of State is aware, there is also a problem in rural areas.  The horse is a sensitive animal and, unlike bovine animals when loose on the roadside, will react to the slightest sound.  This has to be taken into account in considering this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is essential that horses are kept under control.  As we are all aware, deaths have been caused by wandering horses in urban and rural areas when they suddenly crossed the road in front of oncoming traffic or were unseen at night.</P>
    <P>In 1970 on my way home from the All Ireland final when Cork beat Wexford &mdash; things will be different this year &mdash; I had the misfortune to hit a horse.  Luckily, I was not hurt but the four passengers in the car were.  There was substantial damage to property and the cost was enormous.  Sadly, the horse died having been left on the roadside by its owners who cared little for it.  Many people said to me that it could have been worse, that someone could have been killed. Many people have been killed and that is why it is essential for us to ensure that <Col N="1290" /> horses are now allowed to roam freely on roadways.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the only control is that horses are impounded.  The only question is who will impound them when they are found wandering on the side of the road.  Gardaí do not think it is their job.  The local authorities think it is up to the Garda.  At end of the day, nobody does it.  In instances in my county where the horses were impounded a group of people broke into the pound with sledgehammers on the night the horses were impounded.</P>
    <P>If impounding is to be one of the solutions to the problem, we must have a pound that is policed and which cannot be broken into, otherwise this legislation is not worth anything.  We have to take account of the fact that we are talking about people who have made a career of circumventing the law.  There is little point in continuing to take a soft attitude but if we do otherwise, people will say that we are right wing and that we must allow for cultural development. Cultural development seems to be a very popular phrase these days.  Either we are interested in the protection of humans, property and animals, or we are not.  It is time to say where we stand. I agree with Deputy Kenneally's request for a national pound.  It must have walls as strong as those of Fort Knox and it must be policed so that when horses are impounded the only way to get them out is to pay dearly for them.  If that principle were applied in this Bill we would have gone a long way towards winning the battle.</P>
    <P>We know of horses being maintained in housing estates in rural areas and in Dublin.  We know of people who bring their horses upstairs in their houses.  It is hard to credit that it is possible but it is happening.  The following day or night that horse is put into someone's field or into a local authority land bank without permission and if there is any attempt by locals to remove the horse, they are intimidated.  The soft option for people is to pretend they never saw it happen.</P>
    <P>Wexford, like most other counties, is <Col N="1291" /> becoming more environmentally conscious. We intend to plant one million trees between 1990 and 2000 and we are well on the way to doing so.  We have planted trees in our open spaces and they are becoming more mature as the years pass.  However, horses are now tied to the trees, pulling them out of the ground and nothing has been done about this yet.  This is why I say that we must hit these people hard while we have the opportunity.</P>
    <P>We do not know how many horses are wandering.  It may be 10 per cent of the horse population, it may be more. We have to take on the people who allow this to happen.  The Government should build a pound which cannot be penetrated by sledgehammers or diggers because, as I said, these people make careers out of circumventing the law.  Fines must be such that when they are taken from the pound, owners will be discouraged from allowing horses to wander again.  Identification has been mentioned and I agree with my colleague in this regard.  Unless identification is tamper proof, a method will be found to change it.  I do not know how the Minister is to do it, but we have an opportunity now and this Bill should succeed, whatever the cost.</P>
    <P>What is to be the qualification for the ownership of horses?  Let us make it stiff.  Let us say that a person must own or show certification of land before he or she can own a horse.  We should not take the soft option of allowing owners to say they will buy hay for the horse because we know that will not work.  If that is allowed, these people will turn their horses into the first field they see, irrespective of who owns it, what is in it or what damage might be caused. Intimidation will keep the owner very quiet.</P>
    <P>We built a house in County Wexford recently for a person who later admitted in court that he owned £250,000 worth of horseflesh.  It may sound like an unbelievable statistic but this is where the whole situation has gone wrong.  The man had no land.  He had £250,000 <Col N="1292" /> worth of horseflesh and to add insult to injury we built a house for him.  Let this not be a public relations exercise.  Now that we have the chance, put a law in place that will prevent horses from wandering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue.  It has been called for time and again on the Order of Business. Part of the disappointment at its delay was because it was felt the Bill was ready many years ago, given that the Minister for Social Welfare, who at the time was a member of The Workers' Party, had prepared a Bill which aimed to do much of what this Bill tries to achieve.  It was a puzzle as to why there was such a delay.</P>
      <P>I understand there was some question between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of the Environment as to who would pick up the tab.  I am glad the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry seems to be in a position to prosecute the Bill.  This question essentially needs to be dealt with in the wider context of the horse industry and it is important that horses in urban and rural areas should be subject to the same controls.  All horses should be given the consideration and conditions which they require for their welfare. However, I understand the different arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some limited experience in the area of horses.  This would not be adequate to give me sufficient information so I have sought information from others.  When I was a principal teacher in Balbriggan we had some travelling families in the school who owned horses.  I know the issue being addressed in this debate is very much an urban problem which does not relate to travellers in the main.  However, my experience there gave me some insight into the beneficial aspects of ownership of horses.  Those I met who owned horses really knew how to look after their horses.  I knew that from the condition of their horse and the way they talked about them, as well as the way they <Col N="1293" /> made their horses available on sports days.  The horses were a source of pride for their owners and the horses seemed to be extremely happy.</P>
    <P>However, all is not so well in other cases, as the Minister knows.  The situation has been getting worse as time goes on.  Over 65 horses have been put down since Christmas.  This number is much higher than in any other year.  Large numbers of horses have been found in very distressing circumstances.  This Bill is long overdue and there was a great deal of suffering while it was delayed. Its remit is the control of urban horses and it must be addressed as a priority. Yet it fails to confront a fundamental cause of the urban horse problem, that of over breeding.  The Bill should have looked at various ways of discouraging the breeding of horses rather than at ways of controlling them, as the old adage states: prevention is better than cure.  This omission is startling.</P>
    <P>There is some hope given that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has taken charge of the Bill as it has expertise at its disposal in encouraging breeding of livestock.  I assume that same technology can be used where necessary to discourage breeding horses in circumstances where it would lead to further suffering.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is too narrow and must, therefore, be seen as a missed opportunity to deal with the horse problem in a wider context.  A better starting point would have been to name the Bill The Control and Protection of Horses Bill.  While the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, is a proper legislative tool for the protection of animals there was an opportunity in the formulation of this Bill to embrace the needs for the horses' protection from society and not simply the other way round.  We have heard a great many people talk about how dangerous horses are, the damage they can do and the nuisance they cause.  It is important to remember also that horses are extremely vulnerable to predatory human beings who consider they are no more than toys to be taunted and cruelly treated.  Perhaps the <Col N="1294" /> Minister will accept that the title should reflect that principle, that it is not simply a control of horses Bill but a control and protection of horses Bill.  The same happened when the waste Bill was introduced. At first reading it was difficult to understand whether it was simply a Bill to deal with the waste created or if it had any other role.  The name was changed and various parts of the Bill expanded to take account of the new principle enshrined in the name, the Waste Management Act.  The Minister has an opportunity to follow suit in expanding the title of this Bill to include the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to look beyond the straying urban horse to the much wider use of horses in society, particularly for entertainment purposes.  For example, what happens to many of the racing horses whose racing career is over, thoroughbreds who were never fast enough to run in competitive races, the hundreds of show horses whose career is finished and the thousands of horses whose employment in riding schools throughout the country has been terminated?  The Minister may say that information is not available to him but the Bill allows for licensing, identification and, I hope, electronic taggins of a type that cannot be tampered with and various other more sophisticated means, where the law has been broken, to ensure that the history of horses, in the same way as the history of animals in the BSE crisis, can be measured.  That is important and will not only ensure the law is complied with but will provide the Minister with information on what happens in the lifespan of many of the horses here which come to public notice only when they are winning races, performing competitively or at the high point of their career.  This is similar to greyhound racing where many people are unaware of what happens the grey-hound after the competitive life of many of these animals is finished.  The information needs to be assimilated so that policy can be driven as a result of having all the information.  Much of the policy in this Bill was brought about through <Col N="1295" /> pressure from people who are experiencing problems as a result of horses rather than as a consequence of genuine concern for the lives of horses, although I am sure that was a factor.</P>
    <P>Many of the horses traded through the markets and fairs can end up in Straffan slaughter house, neglected in a field, on a boat to the Continent where they will be slaughtered for human consumption, traded on the streets of Dublin or in countrywide horse fairs.</P>
    <P>The most alarming aspect of the Bill is the wide-ranging power it confers on &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo;?  Will the Minister elaborate on whom he intends to call an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;?  It seems the Bill confers powers on people who are not a member of the Garda Síochána, or other legitimate persons, to hold such power which include entering premises and, if necessary, the use of reasonable force &mdash; which is a subjective term &mdash; without being accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  We have already heard how Garda protection is needed in many situations where inspectors from local authorities have gone to investigate horses being cruelly treated or where conditions were unsuitable for horses to be housed or located.  If Garda supervision is needed in those cases it is fanciful to talk about &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; being able to act in a forthright manner and yet not need to be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  We need to bear in mind the circumstances in which many of these visits are carried out and experience shows we need to involve the Garda Síochána more often than not.</P>
    <P>While the Green Party has no problem with the principle of forced entry to prevent any animal being injured or maltreated, it is surely not in the interests of civil liberty and natural justice to confer these powers on an individual or organisation other than those directly authorised to carry out such duties by and on behalf of the State &mdash; the Garda Síochána and the Army. Garda protection has been critical in <Col N="1296" /> many of the cases where inspectors have been sent out.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to take expedient action because the Bill will not be in operation before the end of summer. Because of the deteriorating conditions in which horses are held and the higher than ever mortality rate in the Dublin urban region, it is important that horses are not subjected to cruelty directly as a result of maltreatment, attacks, taunting and torture, ridden when they are too young and other forms of abuse.  They are also subject to cruel treatment as a result of complete ignorance and neglect. If we have a hot summer many horses will suffer due to inadequate grazing and water facilities and during the winter months many of them do not have proper shelter.  I understand there are between 2,000 and 3,000 horses in the Dublin area, I do not have information for the rest of the country.  A horse needs approximately one acre of grass on which to graze during the summer months.  Many horses in Dublin graze along the roadside and do not have adequate water or shelter.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister assist local authorities in, for example, operating a water vehicle to provide water for horses?  Such a vehicle is used to provide water for human consumption when supplies run short or are interrupted. It might be necessary to have members of the Garda present when distributing such water because when a person tries to help, but is seen to interfere, violent scenes can erupt.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to enact the legislation as soon as possible, to accept that the Bill is long overdue and that many horses in the city and other urban areas live in unacceptable conditions.  While acknowledging that the Department of the Environment is the usual custodian of local authorities, as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has custody of this Bill it should make direct contact with local authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with effectively. Some local communities in the Dublin area have set up horse clubs where young people interested in owning <Col N="1297" /> horses are taught about their needs and the responsibility of owning a horse.  I hope they are also dissuaded from buying a horse when it is obvious they would not fulfil that responsibility. Those communities have taken the lead in this regard because they were too long waiting for the Government to do so.  Local authorities also want better training facilities for horse owners in their areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill will fill an enormous vacuum. There are fairly strict regulations governing dog ownership, but the responsibility of owning a sensitive large animal such as a horse is much more onerous. It is about time this legislation was introduced and I hope my views will be considered before Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  While I agree a Bill of this nature should have been introduced years ago, I disagree with Deputies who accused the Government of being negligent and delaying the introduction of the Bill.  A commitment to introduce such a Bill was given in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> and approximately one year ago I was entrusted with the responsibility of introducing a Bill.  The two officials present tonight and I engaged in a wide process of consultation and formed a consultative group.  We consulted with every interest group that contacted the Department and groups that did not contact us.  Rather than engaging in delaying tactics, we were always under pressure to introduce a Bill.  We did not produce a Bill before the Dublin West by-election merely to win votes.  We waited until we believed we had all the necessary information.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's Bill was not around before his party left office. We have produced a comprehensive Bill <Col N="1298" /> and I am prepared to consider amendments on Committee Stage.  I accepted some of the proposals put forward when the matter was discussed in special committee. We have not been negligent in introducing the Bill.  I acknowledge the efforts of Deputies De Rossa and Kenneally in introducing their Bills, which were similar.  This one is different and was almost ready for publication when Deputy Kenneally introduced his Bill. Both the earlier Bills served as useful guidelines in drafting this one.  I hope I do not have to clarify that matter again.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their positive and constructive contributions to the discussion on this Bill on Second Stage. Their various views and comments have been a generous source of ideas and I intend to reflect on them in preparation for Committee Stage.  However, some of the ideas are problematic and I would like to clarify my position on them.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the substantive issues raised by Members, I thank Deputies Kenneally and Browne for drawing attention to an apparent contradiction between section 28, which gives the Minister powers in relation to the identification of horses &mdash; as recommended by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy &mdash; and the explanation of section 43 in the explanatory and financial memorandum, which confers such powers on the local authorities.  There is no real contradiction here.  The position is that the memorandum had been drafted before I went before the select committe on 17 April and it was inadvertently left unamended following the insertion of section 28.  Deputies will be glad to know that, in my opening statement on 29 May, I gave an interpretation of section 43 which is compatible with section 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to mention at this juncture that, contrary to Deputy Kenneally's observations, I have made a number of changes to the Bill as a result of my appearing informally before the Select Committee.  Taking these changes section by section, they <Col N="1299" /> are: section 20 (4) giving the Minister rather than the local authority the power to decide the format of the horse licence; section 22 (5) providing for the striking of a licence fee by ministerial regulations rather than local authority by-laws; section 28 empowering the Minister to require that a horse kept in a control area shall be identified or be capable of being identified in such manner or by such means as may be specified in regulations; and the removal of the contradictory subsection of section 43 in relation to local authority powers of horse identification.</P>
    <P>The question of support for projects such as the Fettercairn Horse Project has been raised in a number of contributions. While I am generally in agreement with any measures to engage the young people from disadvantaged areas in useful and wholesome activities, I must emphasise that the proposal before the House is for legislation for the control of wandering horses.  The Bill is regulatory rather than developmental and is hence an unsuitable vehicle for the furtherance of projects like the Cherry Orchard or Fettercairn Projects.  The fact that these projects can be launched and progressed ahead of the Bill is indicative of their separate nature and their suitability for consideration under existing local authority schemes.</P>
    <P>I might mention here that the leaders of these projects will have nothing to fear from this legislation if they are in a position to comply with its requirements. As I indicated in the House on 29 May, I recognise horse ownership as part of the traditional fabric of urban life and I have no intention of upsetting that tradition.  My objective when the legislation is in place will be to secure reasonable and responsible ownership of horses and good horse management. The projects in question are a commendable step in that direction.  It also merits mention here that, far from being discriminated against, the young people in question are the subject of positive discrimination in having horse projects <Col N="1300" /> organised for them.  I laud local leadership in its endeavours to ensure these young people are not excluded from horse ownership.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that thoroughbred horses should be exempt from the legislation.  The implication is that they should be exempt from licensing in a control area.  I cannot accept this.  The legislation is intended to deal with problems caused by wandering horses in urban areas.  Any horse can stray and be liable to cause damage or injury.  If the horse needs to be seized for being a source of danger, it is of no consequence that it is a thoroughbred.  It is also essential that in introducing this legislation, we act in an even handed manner by ensuring all classes are treated equitably.</P>
    <P>The question of a national pound has been raised.  I am not opposed in principle to having one secure pound to meet the needs of the country but I would advise against writing it into the legislation as the only solution to the problem.  The logistical, transport and indeed welfare difficulties that could arise if we were to rely on a single pound may prove insurmountable and may render the operation of such a pound impracticable.  Deputy Kenneally and I are of like mind in recognising that good pound facilities will be needed if this Bill is to work.  Accordingly, I am considering the option of setting up a number of regional pounds.  I have not decided the number.  If Deputies wish to put forward suggestions in this respect, I shall bear them in mind for consideration when the legislation is in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally inquired about the meaning of section 11 (1).  Similar sections are found in other enactments and arise from the fact that we are living in the electronic age.  Nowadays information is kept in either conventional written form or in electronic, machine readable forms.  The conventional written form includes books and other records of this kind.  The machine readable forms include computer discs, audio tapes and compact discs.  The intention in section 11 (1) is to ensure <Col N="1301" /> the machine readable forms are capable of being converted into conventional records so as to give the person in the street access to a document which can be read without needing a computer or other electronic means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory wished to know what help and financial assistance the Government gives to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. I regret my Department does not operate a scheme of funding to provide financial assistance to bodies such as the DSPCA.  I am glad, however, to report that &mdash; as already indicated in the Official Report of 16 April &mdash; the Minister made a once-off grant of £50,000 to the society last year to enable it to meet its immediate needs.</P>
    <P>The issue of criminal liability for injury or damage caused by horses, as dealt with in section 42, has been raised in the context of a query as to how compensation for the victims of wandering horses will be sourced.  Compensation does not arise.  A person guilty of an offence under section 42 is liable only to fines or imprisonment, that is, a maximum of £1,500 or six months imprisonment or both on summary conviction, and a maximum of £10,000 or two years imprisonment or both on conviction on indictment.  Deputies will appreciate that section 42 provides for hefty penalties but it does not, and cannot, deal with compensation.</P>
    <P>It had been my original intention to provide that the owner of a horse which causes damage or injury would be subject to civil liability leading to compensation. I have decided, however, that this legislation should not deal with compensation.  Deputies will wish to be aware that section 42, which has been inserted in lieu of a provision on civil liability, does not undermine a person's access to a remedy under the general rules of tort.</P>
    <P>I have given consideration to providing for a scheme of insurance against damage or injury caused by horses.  On detailed examination, however, I am now convinced that such provision may <Col N="1302" /> prove inoperable as insurance companies may not wish to embark on such business.  It came to my attention during the examination that there are insurance provisions in other legislation which have proved inoperable because the insurance companies were not prepared to get involved.  There is also the point that the Minister could be placed in an invidious position if this legislation confers on him a responsibility for the implementation of insurance provisions which, despite his best efforts, he cannot implement.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to clarify one aspect of the Bill.  Members seem to believe seizure of horses will be possible only by court action under section 8. However, section 36 empowers the local authority or the Garda Síochána to seize and detain a horse at their own discretion for a variety of reasons, including straying, causing a nuisance or posing a danger.  Section 8 does not displace section 36; these are complementary provisions.  Section 8 becomes active only on the commission of an offence under the legislation and where the local authority considers forfeiture of the horse desirable.  Section 36 will be the central provision in ridding our urban areas of uncontrolled horses.  On some remarks made by Deputies this evening, Deputy Shortall referred to corrals, which I too mentioned.  She also referred to the appointment of horse wardens.  Local authorities have general powers to appoint officers, including wardens.  The only requirement under this Bill is that they be authorised persons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith suggested putting identification under the mane.  As I said on 29 May, I have arranged for officials to examine the general issue of identification. The Deputy referred to regional pounds.  I have already addressed that matter.  He also referred to the opening of a slaughter plant in the north-east, but that does not arise in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern raised an interesting point.  He was concerned that local authorities may not co-operate and that horses may travel over the <Col N="1303" /> border from a co-operating local authority area to a non-co-operating area. That matter is addressed in the Bill. There may be a case for ministerial power to enforce the declaration of control areas.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Harney for her positive contribution and support for the Bill.  She referred to the issue of identification. That is a topic for detailed examination only when the Bill is in place. Parties have strong views on the various types of identification, and they must be consulted.  I have arranged for my officials to investigate the general issue of identification.  Local authorities must also be consulted about this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary raised the question of the definition of a foal.  The definition in the Bill was inserted following expert advice made available to the Department. I am, however, prepared to reconsider the definition to see whether six months is more appropriate than one year as a maximum age for a foal.  A technical point should be borne in mind in this regard, that is whether an identifiable mark can be applied to a foal as young as six months.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary also raised the question of minors and referred to 16 as the age at which a person may possess a horse.  I have given some thought to this issue and, on finding that people in their late teens are legally entitled to engage in a variety of activities such as marriage, driving a motor vehicle, voting and joining the Army, felt that midteenage years would be the most appropriate for this Bill.  I was also mindful that UK legislation on animals sets down an age of 16 years.  Taking all these considerations into account I decided to opt for the age in question.  I am sure it will be further referred to on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugh Byrne made a number of interesting points.  As regards car accidents, I share the Deputy's concern about fatalities and serious injuries caused by horses.  I referred to this matter in my opening speech.  The problem of uncontrolled horses could give rise to <Col N="1304" /> horrendous carnage on our roads, particularly on the new by-passes and dual carriageways being constructed around our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also raised the question of stray horses.  When drafting this Bill I issued a circular to local authorities on this matter.  Countrywide there are 3,000 such horses, 1,000 of which are in the greater Dublin area, with an estimated 600 in the South Dublin County Council area.  The stray horse population is a minor percentage of the general horse population.  Despite their relatively modest numbers, however, they are a major problem in urban areas.  The urban horse population must be subject to control in the interests of the safety of life and limb.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to control of breeding.  I expect that when this Bill takes effect the urban horse population will be reduced to manageable numbers and that in turn will control breeding. It has been recognised that urban horse ownership is a perfectly legitimate pursuit and, therefore, breeding must also be recognised as an acceptable aspect of ownership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to the protection of horses.  It is unnecessary to provide detailed welfare provisions in this Bill.  Instead I decided the penalty provisions of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, should undergo a major recasting to include penalties for conviction on indictment.  Section 45 provides that the maximum penalties under section 1 (1) of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, will be as follows: on summary conviction, a fine of £1,500 or six months imprisonment, or both and on conviction on indictment, a fine of £10,000 or two years imprisonment, or both.  This provision seeks to address a limitation of the existing section 1 (1) in that it contains only minor penalties on summary conviction.</P>
    <P>The table accompanying section 45 shows section 1 (1) of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, following insertion of the new penalties.  The Deputy will find the provisions of the table to be a strong defence of the horse.  The new <Col N="1305" /> provision is sufficient to deal with cases of cruelty to all animals, including horses.  In proposing this new deterrent against acts of cruelty and in restating by table the relevant provisions of the 1911 Act I am reminding horse owners and users that any act of cruelty against horses will not be countenanced.  I believe that will be effective.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who contributed usefully and constructively to the debate.  It is clear there is a general welcome for the legislation and there is understandable frustration at the delay in bringing legislation of this kind before the House.  I have responded with all possible speed to the undertaking in the Programme for Government to introduce legislation to control wandering horses in urban areas.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister for coming in to reply.  I put down a question on this matter this day week and was very dissatisfied with the Minister's reply.  He referred to the law and went on to point out that if a shop front is improved it <Col N="1306" /> might or might not lead to a change in the rateable valuation.  He said the urban renewal scheme has been instrumental in transforming many formerly derelict areas of our larger towns and cities.  He pointed out that the availability of a sliding scale of rates relief to businesses has been an important element of the urban renewal scheme.  I fully accept that but if somebody improves their shop front, for example, without increasing the retail space, they may have their valuation increased. Many business people in my constituency have had their rates increased in this way and I believe any logically thinking person will accept that is grossly unfair, particularly to people in Border areas who have experienced many difficulties over the years.</P>
      <P>A person living in a town with a designated area or in a small town which does not have a designated area should get some tax relief if they improve their premises.  They should not be penalised for so doing.  It is wrong that a person who improves their premises without increasing their selling space should have to pay increased tax.  In many smaller towns which are close to larger towns with designated areas people are being penalised, yet if they moved to the larger area they would have the benefit of tax relief for ten years.  There is no equity in that.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments were committed to decentralisation to the counties. This policy has been successful, particularly along the west coast and in Cavan in my own constituency.  With regard to the counties, however, there seems to be a positive policy of centralisation in the major towns.  This is just another example of how people in the smaller towns who try to improve their businesses are being penalised, despite the fact that if they moved into the larger towns, many of which have designated areas, they would benefit from tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine this issue and immediately ensure that where a person improves their shop front, for example, without increasing <Col N="1307" /> the retail space there will not be an increase in the retable valuation.  I also ask him to examine the position of people living in small towns with no designated areas and consider a scheme similar to that which operates in seaside towns, giving people tax relief for refurbishing buildings, particularly derelict buildings.  I believe that would be selffinancing. The Minister referred to the urban renewal scheme and the way in which it has transformed many derelict areas in our larger towns and cities. Where derelict buildings in towns are refurbished, a tax relief should be available similar to that which is available in designated areas.  That would result in increased employment and additional business being generated in these areas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the case I am making and to introduce some equity into the rating system.  I hope this matter will be addressed when we come to deal with local government funding, a matter that should be dealt with urgently.</P>

      <P>I believe he is seeking an amendment to the Valuation Act, which is only being operated in relation to the rental income.  Improvements of any kind, including to the shop front, even without increasing the retail space, can improve the rental value.  That is the basis on which the Valuation Act currently operates.  Coming from a rural area, like the Deputy, I would have considerable sympathy with his point in that regard and in regard to tax relief, which is a matter for the Finance Act.  Perhaps <Col N="1308" /> if the Deputy makes further inquiries in relation to the Finance Act and the Valuation Act he may make more progress.</P>
      <P>The basis used in determining the rateable valuation of a commercial property is net annual value, that is, the rental value of the property where the tenant also pays any taxes, rates and charges due on the property.  This methodology is prescribed in the valuation legislation, and could only be changed by amending that legislation.  Under the Valuation Acts, any improvements, alterations or change of use that affects the rental value of a property, including alteration of the shop front, the example given by the Deputy, must be taken into account in assessing the rateable valuation of a property that has been listed for revision.  During the course of a valuation, it is not open to a valuer of the Valuation Office to totally disregard any factor that influences the rental value of a property.  Such a valuer must determine the rateable valuation of a property in its actual state.</P>
      <P>The provision of a new or improved shop front might or might not lead to a change in the rateable valuation. Whether an improved shop front leads to an increased rateable valuation, and thus to an increased rates liability, depends on whether it is considered that such an improvement has increased the rental value of the shop.</P>
      <P>The Valuation Office is frequently asked by local authorities to revise the rateable valuations of properties where shop fronts have been improved.  Such requests reflect the added value of a property that can result from an improved shop front.</P>
      <P>Any ratepayer dissatisfied with a valuation assessment has a right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance, and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of the urban renewal scheme, under which reliefs from rates were granted, was to encourage private sector investment in specially designated areas of our towns and cities where decades of physical, <Col N="1309" /> social and economic decline had rendered them devoid of development potential.  The criteria for designating areas under the urban renewal scheme include the extent of urban decay and the potential for redevelopment.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that the urban renewal scheme has been instrumental in transforming many formerly derelict areas of our towns and cities.  While the designated areas are obviously the direct beneficiary of the urban renewal scheme, the whole community has benefited from the reversal of the economic and social decline of the designated areas.  Even ratepayers who are not in a position to benefit from the rates reliefs available under the urban renewal schemes enjoy the benefits of the economic and social development that have resulted from halting what had been the long-term decline of many urban centres.</P>
    <P>The availability of a relief from rates, in one form or another, since the inception of the urban renewal scheme in 1984 has obviously been a major factor in promoting the location or start-up or expansion of business premises in the designated areas.  It should be emphasised that relief from rates is only available to businesses that have made capital investment in premises in designated areas. This capital investment has often taken the shape of the refurbishment or reconstruction of buildings that would otherwise have fallen into dilapidation.</P>
    <P>It should also be stated that the extent of rates relief has been curtailed. Up to 1994, a total exemption from rates for qualifying properties in designated areas was available for ten years. Since August 1994, relief from rates is available to qualifying properties on a sliding scale for ten years.  That is to say, 100 per cent relief in year one, 90 per cent relief in year two and so on until only 10 per cent relief is available in year ten.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the provision of an exemption from rates for certain businesses in designated areas is not confined just to cities or to larger towns. Although the original scheme applied <Col N="1310" /> only to the designated areas of Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick &mdash; we have the former Minister for the Environment, John Boland, to thank for that &mdash; the scope of the current scheme is considerably wider.  Twenty-four urban centres have now been designated, including several smaller towns, enabling them to take advantage of the development opportunities available under the urban renewal schemes.  Such smaller towns include Castlebar, Ballinasloe, Longford, Roscommon, Mullingar, Ballina and, in Deputy O'Hanlon's constituency, Monaghan.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to again raise the issue of the Monagear investigation as many unanswered questions remain.  When I first raised this matter on 22 February last I stated that there were serious questions to be answered about the investigation of at least five allegations of child sexual abuse in Wexford in 1988.  Now that the internal Garda report has been submitted to the Garda Commissioner, there are still unanswered questions and we need answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to make the report public?  Does the report answer the accusation that a garda was instructed to call on the priest to request him to leave the parish with a caveat that if he refused he would be arrested? Does it reveal on whose instructions the investigating officer acted when he was <Col N="1311" /> told to send handwritten statements to Garda headquarters in Wexford without making copies of them, which is the normal procedure?  Does the report indicate who in Garda management made the decision to drop the case and why? Does it indicate if the priest's superiors were informed of the investigation and, if so, what action was taken by them?  In this case the original file was lost.  Has that file been found?  Has the Garda inquiry established why the authorities did not proceed with the prosecution when there appeared to be more than enough evidence to send to the DPP?</P>
    <P>These questions must be answered and the Garda report must be published, particularly in view of the fact that the victims of the abuse wish its findings to be made known.  The statement from the Garda Commissioner last Friday stated that the health board acted properly, as did the local gardaí, and declared that the investigation was inadequate.  We must find out exactly what that means.  Who will be held accountable?  How will the Minister respond to the wishes of the victims? How will the Minister ensure that proper procedures are put in place so that this will never happen again?</P>

      <P>There can be no doubt as to the conclusions in the report.  These were summed up succinctly in the press release issued by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on 21 June which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> A senior Garda officer has conducted a review into the Garda investigation of allegations of child abuse in Monagear, Enniscorthy, County Wexford, in 1988.  This review shows that the investigation was inadequate and not brought to a satisfactory conclusion, that the South-Eastern Health Board complied fully with its obligations, that no evidence was forthcoming of any collusion between any organisation and the Garda Síochána to stifle, obstruct or abandon the investigation, and that no fault lies with the local gardaí based at Ferns.  Regrettably, as the person who was the subject of the complaint has since died, the matter cannot now be put any further.</P>

      <P>It is clear that previous attempts to prevent suicides in prisons have, tragically, not succeeded. The tragic death last Sunday of a young man in St. Patrick's Institution was the fourth in as many months and the second case of suicide by a prisoner remanded in custody.</P>
      <P>The number of prisoners on remand is rising rapidly, primarily due to intolerable delays caused by archaic criminal procedures and something as fundamental as the paucity of the number of judges.  The Courts and Court Officers Act was passed last December, yet the Minister for Justice has still to fill the existing vacancies for eight Circuit Court judges.  The net result of the Minister's failure to act, because of her inability to convince the Minister for Finance of the urgency of the problem, is that trial dates for prisoners on remand are now being put back for a further three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court it is now a weekly occurrence for cases whose date for trial has come to be put <Col N="1313" /> back to February 1997.  This means it is taking up to 15 months from the date of the offence for accused persons to be tried.  When this delay is allied to the two year delay for rape and murder trials in the Central Criminal Court, one can see that the system of criminal procedure is quickly being reduced to a shambles.  In May 1996, there were 18 murder and 46 rape cases on the Central Criminal Court list.  Fifty-one of these cases were withdrawn without a trial date being fixed.  In the Bar Council journal, the <i>Bar Review</i>, an editorial dated June 1996 stated: &ldquo;The problem has been identified and the solutions suggested.  Only the political will to implement the reforms is awaited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It can be adjudged that since the Minister for Justice cannot get the fundamentals right, it is difficult to see how she can get more complex issues right. While there can be little excuse for the Minister's inactivity in the area of court procedure, there can be none for not implementing practical measures to minimise the risk of suicides among our prison population.  It should be the norm that information on sentenced prisoners and those remanded in custody is available.  At present, the only information available about a new prisoner is that outlined on the legal warrant, with whatever information the prisoner chooses to provide.  This presents a serious difficulty for prison staff.</P>
    <P>A proper medical and psychiatric assessment process prior to imprisonment should be implemented without delay.  Further, the transfer of prisoners in Wheatfield Prison to other prisons to make way for those remanded in custody would amount to the pragmatic and inexpensive establishment of a remand centre, which is clearly badly needed.  The risk of incarcerating prisoners on remand with habitual criminals cannot be underestimated.  This applies to young people in particular.</P>
    <P>The Minister must rise to the challenge and conduct a root and branch analysis of the reason for the number of <Col N="1314" /> tragic deaths in our prisons.  The statement by the Minister that it should come as no surprise that a rise in the number of suicides in society should be reflected in the rise in the number of suicides in prisons displays a breathtaking lack of compassion and is reminiscent of the ambivalence which she displays when addressing other areas in her brief.  When addressing the issue of suicide in prison, the Minister is speaking about human life and glib, secondhand excuses to get the Minister off the hook represent a sad indictment of the inadequacy of her philosophy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express, on behalf of the Minister, her deep concern at any loss of life in prisons and particularly death by suicide.  Every such death is a tragedy not just for the family, relatives and friends of the deceased but also for the prison service.  The Minister extends her sympathy to the family of the deceased.</P>
      <P>There are elaborate strategies in place for the prevention of suicides in prisons and the Minister intends to do everything she can to support them. However, unless there is to be a total denial of personal privacy to prisoners at all times, the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be prevented, no more than it can be prevented in the wider community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister keeps under review the preventative measures currently in place to deter suicides.  She recently established a national steering group under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor to oversee the local suicide awareness groups which exist in the various institutions.  The steering group, which met for the first time yesterday, includes in its membership some of the most experienced representatives of prison management and staff and medical practitioners who are now involved in prison management.  The steering group has also been assigned the task of reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths published in 1991.  It will also provide a <Col N="1315" /> forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups within the institutions and disseminating significant findings or lessons learned throughout the prison system.  Trends in prison suicide in other countries and strategies used for their prevention will also be examined and any lessons learned from them will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I understand that 50 of the 57 recommendations of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths, which reported in Auguest 1991, have been or are in the course of being implemented.  The report of the advisory group is available in the Dáil library.  I also understand that last week the Minister explained to Deputies in the Dáil the nature of the seven outstanding recommendations and that these are for consideration in the longer term.</P>
    <P>All deaths which take place in custody are the subject of a public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest.  The circumstances of each death in custody are also examined by the suicide awareness group in each prison.  The examinations carried out by these groups cover the background and circumstances of each death.  Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken in the future to contribute to the prevention of tragic deaths of this nature.  This is an important mechanism for absorbing the lessons to be learned in each case.</P>
    <P>There are also procedures in place for identifying and monitoring offenders at special risk.  Such offenders are usually placed under special observation. However, we cannot escape the fact that where an offender is determined to take his or her life &mdash; and not infrequently there is no prior warning of any such intent &mdash; the scope for prevention is limited. The Advisory Group on Prison Deaths acknowledged in chapter 4 of its report that it has to be accepted that if a person is sufficiently determined to take his or her own life it is virtually impossible to prevent them.  Suicide is not a completely preventable act in a <Col N="1316" /> free society or in a prison system which accords any respect to the personal dignity and privacy of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the death of the young person who is the subject of this Adjournment debate.  The deceased was committed to St. Patrick's Institution on Saturday, 22 June last, charged with possession of a knife and was remaded in custody to appear at Dublin District Court 4 on Thursday, 27 June.  He was reasonably well known to staff and was placed, with all other remands, in the B wing of St. Patrick's Institution.  He was placed on special observations, along with four others on the same landing, as he was on medication for detoxification purposes.  He had commenced this course of medication on committal to prison and it was administered to prevent physical distress.  On Sunday, 23 June the deceased was not showing any signs of physical or personal distress. Earlier that day the deceased had asked the chaplain to let his parents know where he was, and the chaplain did so.</P>
    <P>As a special observation prisoner, the deceased was checked in his cell by staff every 15 minutes.  He was checked by an officer at 9.55 p.m. and the officer found nothing amiss.  When an officer checked him again at 10.08 p.m. the offender was found hanging from the cell window.  He was immediately attended to by staff who tried to revive him.  He was taken to the Mater Hospital at 10.15 p.m. and was pronounced dead in the casualty department at 10.25 p.m.</P>
    <P>The death of the unfortunate young man will be the subject of a public inquiry in the form of an inquest.  The circumstances of the death have also been examined by the suicide awareness group in St. Patrick's Institution.  The governor has advised that he has examined the circumstances surrounding the death and is satisfied that the staff made every effort they could to save the deceased.  The Minister is also satisfied that there is nothing more that could have been done to prevent this tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>On the demands for a separate remand facility, in common with the <Col N="1317" /> vast majority of remands in custody, the young man who is the subject of this debate had several previous convictions and had previously served prison sentences. He was held with the other remands to St. Patrick's Institution in its B wing which holds 61 new committals-remands at any one time.  All prisons try, as far as possible, to keep remands and new committals apart from other prisoners for operational and management reasons.  For example, in Mountjoy Prison, remands and new committals are generally held in its B division which holds up to 120 prisoners at a time.  One of the reasons these categories of prisoners are held apart as far as possible from other prisoners is to enable staff to keep a special watch on them in case they experience distress in the earlier stages of custody.  Four other prisoners in St. Patrick's Institution on the same landing as this young man were under &ldquo;special observation&rdquo; which means they were checked every 15 minutes during the night.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the benefits attached to having a separate remand prison or institution and will keep the matter under active review.  Such a remand facility can be provided only in the context of additional prison accommodation generally and the provision of that accommodation is being given priority at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Given the number of Deputies who wished to raise other matters, this is an indication that even his office recognises the substantial difficulties caused by the BSE crisis. When the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, played football he was very versatile.  He is being called on to display that versatility again tonight &mdash; he is playing full back, midfield and full forward, a one man team.  When the Minister of State is wheeled out to reply to issues the news is normally bad.  The <Col N="1318" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is away at present and I wonder how effective he will be.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the BSE crisis, which began on 20 March last with the now infamous House of Commons announcement, is that Irish beef farmers who have suffered losses of the order of £260 million are being offered compensation by the EU of 25p in the pound.  By any standard, this represents a colossal political failure by the Minister, Deputy Yates.  The negotiations in Luxembourg today about the premia Ireland will be paid is, to put the issue in perspective, like rearranging the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i>.  It is outrageous that Ireland, the most beef dependent EU economy, could not have its concerns addressed at EU level between 20 March and 21 June when the Florence Summit eventually solved the British impasse.  The compensation package is finally being discussed in Luxembourg but the offer is derisory.</P>
      <P>I understand that, contrary to explicit assurances given by the Minister in the Dáil, the compensation package will be paid on 1996 applications, not on 1995 applications.  Payments will not be made until 1997.  Will the Minister clarify this point?  If this is the case it is totally unacceptable and makes a joke of the already small sum on offer.  Like other Deputies and farmers, I am very conscious that not one penny has yet been paid to farmers under the great sheep deal which was to be delivered in January by the Minister.  If the Minister does not answer my question it will be totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £8 million of the package on offer has been earmarked as discretionary. If the farmers who have suffered most are to be compensated at all then that sum must be increased. Further compensation must be targeted not simply at those who lost most money <i>per se</i> but rather at those small farmers who now find themselves with a negative income.  One of the most effective ways of doing so is to compensate <Col N="1319" /> heifer beef producers; most compensation must go to farmers who have beef production as their main enterprise.</P>
    <P>What must be avoided is a rerun of the temporary milk leasing fiasco when a deal was done among the big players to the exclusion of small producers. Fianna Fáil can honestly claim to be one of the few parties lobbying for the small farmer.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry certainly is not and few of his friends within the agricultural establishment seem interested.</P>
    <P>Compensation, to be effective, must be paid on 1995 premia applications and targeted rigorously at those farmers most dependent on beef production for the greater part, if not all, of their income.</P>
    <P>Last autumn the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry sat idly by while export refunds for beef were being slashed relentlessly, repeatedly assuring Irish farmers that, as a result, the price paid to them would not suffer. It must be remembered that, ever before the beef industry was floored by the BSE crisis, it was already on its knees because of cuts in export refunds. With exports within the EU remaining down by 45 per cent, the issues of live exports and export refunds remain vital. Export refunds must be placed at the top of the EU agenda in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>It is also vital to our beef farmers that Middle Eastern markets be reopened.  If the Minister fails to secure significant trade there in the near future, next autumn farmers will face a 1974 scenario. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry may be too young to remember 1974.  However, no farmer can forget the disaster which forced many of them to give away calves at marts because buyers could not be found at any price. Farmers are rightly angry that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is not using his muscle within Europe. His ineffectiveness is exacerbated by the inactivity of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Although two Government jets are fully operational no Government Minister can find time <Col N="1320" /> to visit any of our crucial Middle Eastern markets.  Fianna Fáil has made countless calls on the Government to launch an initiative at senior ministerial level for the reopening of those markets.</P>
    <P>It is time this rainbow coalition Government got over its grudge match with the beef industry which is our largest. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry cannot deliver, the Labour Party is not bothered and Democratic Left is opposed: farm families are paying the price for Government disinterest and inaction.</P>

      <P>In sporting terms I would call his &ldquo;off the ball tackles&rdquo; at which he seems to excel.  However, despite his obstructionist tactics, I am <Col N="1321" /> pleased to set out the position regarding the BSE compensation measures at present being discussed at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg. First, I should like to set out briefly the background to these compensatory payments and Government efforts to date to ensure they are adequate to address the losses suffered by beef producers.</P>
      <P>Since last autumn, when the Commission cut export refunds for beef and live cattle in order to reduce the level of subsidised exports to comply with the GATT limits &mdash; imposed by the Deputy's party &mdash; cattle prices, particularly for finished cattle, suffered.  In the first quarter of 1996 particularly cattle prices fell by approximately 4 per cent compared with the last quarter of 1995 and 7 per cent when compared with the same period in 1995.</P>
      <P>The effect of the House of Commons speech on 20 March was an immediate, serious fall in consumption in the EU along with the closure of important third country markets.  Since that date the response and approach of the Government to the crisis has been clear, sure and effective.  Following the onset of the crisis the full services of my Department, the diplomatic services and An Bord Bia were mobilised to reassure the authorities in our export markets of the safety and quality of Irish beef and beef products.  We also ensured that Ireland was not caught in the scope of any measures taken against the UK.</P>
      <P>Effective market support measures were also put in place quickly at EU level to help the industry.  The opening up of intervention with the lifting or easing of weight restrictions along with the inclusion of 04 grades has been very helpful in clearing the backlog of cattle which has built up since the crisis.  The increase in the export refunds by 12 per cent since 1 May has boosted third country trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister has always been conscious of the fact that, while market support measures were essential in stabilising the industry in the face of <Col N="1322" /> this crisis, alone they would not be sufficient to sustain reasonable cattle prices for producers.  This has been borne out by the fall in prices since the scare amounting to some 8 per cent for steers and heifers and 12 per cent for cows. Accordingly from the early stages of the crises we have insisted on provision being made for compensation to producers through direct income payments to make up for losses incurred.</P>
    <P>At the Council of Ministers meeting on 29 May last the Commission proposed a financial package of 650 mecu for all EU producers based on the topping-up of the suckler cow premium and the special beef premium along with a special allocation for targeting those most affected.  The package involved a proposal to increase the suckler cow premium by 25 Ecu &mdash; £20.73 &mdash; and the special beef premium by 21 Ecu &mdash; £17.42 &mdash; costing a total of 534 mecu with the balance of 116 mecu divided between member states on the basis of the number of non-dairy cattle in each country.  For Ireland the total package was worth some £58 million, of which some £8 million was available for targeting those producers whose income losses were not addressed by the topups in the suckler cow and special beef premium.  While this package was substantial, it was still considered inadequate to meet the current and projected losses for the year.  Accordingly, the Government's efforts in getting additional compensation were rewarded at the Florence Summit when the Taoiseach, along with Heads of other member states succeeded in getting the Commission to agree to a further increase in the ceiling of the order of 200 mecu. This brings the total value of the package to 850 mecu, or £700 million.  In the Commission's view, this is the maximum possible under the 1996 EU budgetary guidelines.</P>
    <P>The BSE compensatory package and the EU price proposals for the 1996-97 marketing year are the major issues for discussion and possible decision, at this week's Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Luxembourg.  At this <Col N="1323" /> moment the Minister is negotiating an enhanced deal from the EU based on the increased funds which have now been earmarked for EU producers.  In particular the Minister is seeking an increase in the flexible package so that those farmers involved in winter finishing are adequately compensated.  In this regard, compensation for specialist heifer fatteners is also being sought.</P>
    <P>However, I should point out that producers in all member states have suffered losses because of the BSE crisis and each will be pressing for a fair division of the funds available.  Many member states are unhappy with the approach adopted by the Commission in the division of the funds.  This division is mainly based on the number of premiums claimed on cattle in each member state and not on production.  This <Col N="1324" /> approach very much favours Irish producers because of our proportionately higher number of premiums claimed than in other member states due to our extensive steer-based systems of production. In this regard the Minister will be seeking to ensure that the proportion of the final package going to Irish producers will be, at the minimum, in line with the previous commission proposals.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government needs no convincing that compensation is needed to assist beef producers, as is shown by the vigour with which the issue has been pursued.  Very considerable progress has already been made.  I can assure the House, and Deputy Hugh Byrne, the Minister is determined to secure the best possible package from the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 June 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate a schedule in the Official Report which provides data on the number of school leavers, and employees in continuing training, with CERT for the years 1990 to 1995.</P>
      <P>The most recent surveys carried out by CERT cover 1990 to 1994 and indicate that 81 per cent of school leavers who undertook CERT courses during the period are still employed in the tourist industry and another 5 per cent are in further tourism training.</P>
      <P>Similar data on all full-time trainees, inclusive of those subsequently using continuing training programmes, show an estimated retention rate of some 76 per cent in the catering and hotel industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 58 and 243 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has achieved record and sustained tourism growth in recent years with 4.25 million overseas visitors in 1995.  This does not constitute mass tourism.  Unlike for example some southern European destinations where tourism is concentrated in narrow coastal areas, we can achieve a wide geographical spread of tourism.  This coupled with our low population density means we are better placed to preserve our environment, while at the same time maintaining a unique holiday experience for our visitors.  Government policy on tourism development fully recognises that Ireland's clean environment is one of our major natural tourism strengths and that a balance must be struck between conservation and development.  The targets we have set the tourism industry relate to growth in overseas revenue and job creation, emphasising the need to develop a sustainable industry by concentrating on a quality product rather than quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures to achieve this objective, as set out in the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 include the following: improving the seasonality profile of Irish tourism.  The aim is that by 1999, 75 per cent of visitors will arrive in Ireland outside the peak July-August period compared with about 70 per cent at present; attracting high yield business. Priority is given to marketing conference and incentive business and other quality niche and activity markets such as cruising, golf, equestrian, shoppers and users of paid services such as accommodation and car hire; where possible enhancing existing product investment rather than creating new developments; a wide geographical dispersal to minimise capacity problems; all developments are required to comply <Col N="961" /> with the best environmental standards; and progress on the consistency between tourism developments and the principle of sustainability will continue to be monitored as part of the programme.</P>
    <P>Statutory responsibility for environmental protection generally rests with the Minister for the Environment while the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has certain statutory responsibilities in relation to the protection of Heritage Areas.  I understand that the heritage services &mdash; national parks and wildlife service and national monuments and historic properties service &mdash; of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht operate an ongoing review of the impact of visitors on heritage sites in order that suitable control and management procedures are exercised and applied as necessary.  Similarly, the national monuments and historic properties service aims to keep visiting levels at each heritage property to the optimum number of visitors consistent with site protection and presentation and to manage such properties accordingly.</P>
    <P>The issue is best addressed in the context of the strategies and monitoring arrangements I have already outlined.  I have considered this matter in the light of discussion on Parliamentary Question No. 12 of 21 May and I am satisfied the issue is afforded a high priority by the relevant agencies.</P>

      <Col N="962" /> Earlier this year, ABT launched a special UK Task Force which aims to help companies identify new sectors of business opportunity with greater profit margins, initially focused on companies with a turnover of greater than £1 million and with a UK dependency of greater or equal to 25 per cent.  In the second phase, companies with a turnover of less than £1 million and exporting to the UK are being systematically examined by ABT.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29, 63 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in reply to previous questions on this subject, the open tendering competition to develop a national conference centre on the basis of a European Regional Development Fund capital grant of 50 per cent terminated because none of the submissions presented to Bord Fáilte, and the independent management board established to deal with grant applications under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, were considered to be within the parameters set out in the project invitation document for the competition.  Queries raised subsequently with my Department by promoters of consortia seeking clarification on the outcome of the competition have been addressed on this basis.</P>
      <P>As a possible alternative strategy to secure an international conference centre for Dublin under the Operational Programme, the Royal Dublin Society has submitted a detailed proposal to develop and operate a national conference centre at their Ballsbridge site in Dublin on the basis of possible qualification for the higher rate of European Regional Development Fund grant reserved for public and similar bodies under EU rules.  Bord Fáilte still awaits outline details of a proposal from the Carlton group for a joint venture with Dublin Corporation and Dublin City Business Association to assess its suitability for incorporation in this strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and its technical experts are working towards an early submission of their conclusions to the independent Product Development Management Board established to consider grant applications under the Operational Programme for Tourism. <Col N="964" /> However, in view of the scale of the project, the specific approval of Government and that of the European Commission will also be required, and such approval cannot be considered until the current stages of the assessment process are complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>One of the principal objectives of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is to encourage significant growth in the shoulder and off-peak periods.  Accordingly, the whole thrust of the programme is geared towards the enhancement of tourism facilities to operate on an all year round basis, as far as is feasible, and marketing to achieve this aim.  Particular priority has been given to the provision of a wider variety of weather independent visitor facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995, the number of off peak tourists is estimated to have increased by 18 per cent, a full three percentage points ahead of overall tourist growth for that year.  The addition to the range and quality of weather independent facilities in 1996 and future years, together with substantial investment in marketing, is geared towards achieving further increases in tourist numbers and revenue in the shoulder and off-season periods. The Minister of State's Domestic Tourism Marketing Initiative will provide an added boost for business in the autumn period this year.  Co-operative advertising on radio, television and in the press over the period September to <Col N="965" /> November will heighten the awareness of Irish consumers to the attractions of holidaying at home during the autumn and winter months.</P>
    <P>Seasonality was highlighted by the members of the newly-appointed Tourism Council as a major concern on the part of the industry.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the council on 20 June there was an in-depth discussion on all aspects of seasonality and arising from that, the council has set up a small group to further consider medium-term strategies to address the subject.</P>

      <P>Decisions on grant applications in respect of tourism projects under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 are made by autonomous management boards made up of representatives of the State sector and independent professionals.  These boards assess applications by reference to the criteria set out in the programme i.e. the ability of projects to attract foreign visitors, increase tourism earnings and generate sustainable employment. Obviously, the long-term commercial viability of a project is central in the evaluation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition referred to in the Deputy's question was not imposed by Bord Fáilte but was one of a number of conditions introduced by the Product Development Management Board for the Bord Fáilte area in October last in relation to the evaluation of tourism <Col N="966" /> heritage projects.

Some of the participating companies have since formed strategic alliances with US companies resulting in additional employment in the Border region and increased sales for both the Irish and US partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the White House Conference, I also signed a communiqué on tourism co-operation with the former US Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and my Northern Ireland counterpart Baroness Denton.  While the untimely death of Ron Brown and the abolition of the US Travel and Tourism Administration has resulted in less progress compared to the trade area, there has been increasingly close co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on a number of projects such as Brand Ireland and the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, which is marketing the island as a single destination in the United States and other countries. CERT is also currently involved in <Col N="969" /> a number of initiatives including the placement of Irish graduates in work experience and training programmes in the US tourism industry.</P>
    <P>The US Administration is planning a follow-up trade and investment conference in Philadelphia in the autumn which will have a particular focus on developing further business partnerships.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The tourism-culture measure of the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG II Programme (1994-1999) provides £10 million for tourism development in the Border counties.  The following table, sets out details supplied by the Joint North-South Tourism Working Group who are responsible for administering the programme, in relation to the 23 projects which have been approved to date.</P>
      <P>The Maritime INTERREG II Programme (1994-1999) provides £4.5 million on the Irish side for tourism and cultural co-operation.  The programme was launched in December 1995 and applications for a number of projects are currently being assessed by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Tourism related projects are also eligible for assistance under a number of measures of the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (1995-1999).  My Department has no direct involvement in the selection of projects or in the payment of grants to tourism projects which may be approved by the appropriate selection body.  Details in relation to the measures and eligible activities can be found in the programme which was, I understand, circulated to all Oireachtas Members shortly after the programme was adopted in July 1995.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated total number of foreign students that will visit Ireland in 1996; the number that are involved in student exchange; the number enrolled in language schools; the benefits, if any, accruing to the economy from these students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13398/96]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to overseas students who come here specifically to study English as a <Col N="973" /> foreign language and not just for general study or holiday purposes.</P>
      <P>In 1995 some 104,000 English language students, aged 16 years and over visited Ireland.  Obviously, the total English language learning (EFL) market is somewhat larger if those students aged under 16 years, for which no figures are available, are included.  Bord Fáilte expect further growth over 1996.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of English language students enrol in a language school and the trend is to stay with host families. Figures do not exist that illustrate the breakdown between those involved in student exchange and those paying the respective host families.  The trend is, however, for students to pay host families rather than engage in exchanges.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy benefits in a significant way from English language students.  EFL students are particularly valued visitors as they tend to stay for longer periods of time, without displacing other tourists as they generally stay with host families.  Typically, EFL students spend £1,000 per head in Ireland.  Bord Fáilte estimates that the English language learning market was worth approximately £104 million in 1995.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism recognises that English language learning has been a major growth area in Irish tourism in recent years and continued investment in this sector in product development and marketing, particularly co-operative marketing, will be encouraged through the programme. Spain, France and Italy remain Ireland's main sources of business, but schools are increasingly concentrating on developing other European markets, such as Germany, Switzerland, Austria, as well as co-operatively seeking to break into Eastern Europe and the lucrative Far East-South American markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main banks and investment banks generally do not invest directly in tourism product development but support through lending, private sector developers who do.  Their support for individual projects is based on normal commercial banking criteria and I have no evidence of any general reluctance on their part to support tourism projects.</P>
      <P>The banks have participated in two subsidised low fixed interest loan schemes under which tourism projects qualify.  These were the small business expansion loan scheme (SBELS) administered by the ICC Bank which allocated £25 million to tourism projects, and its successor, the access to finance scheme (AFS), administered by the four main banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank under which a minimum of £52 million was reserved for tourism.</P>
      <P>The banks also provide a range of services to tourists and, in so doing, benefit considerably from the growth in tourism. I accept, therefore, that there is scope for increasing their profile in tourism promotion in co-operation with Bord Fáilte and the industry.  There is regular informal liaison between Bord Fáilte and the banks in this regard and I expect this process to continue with productive results.</P>
      <P>Increased involvement in tourism development by the banks at local level would also be desirable through for example sponsorship of events, promotion and advertising.  This is however best addressed at regional level between the regional tourism organisations, the local tourism industry and the banks.</P>

      <P>My Department plays the lead role in co-ordinating State expenditure on tourism.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in response to a previous similar parliamentary question, the primary vehicle for grant-aiding tourism currently is the Operational Programme for Tourism (1994-1999).  A co-ordinating committee, chaired by my Department, meets on a regular basis to ensure a coherent approach to the administration of the programme.  The committee is comprised of representatives of all agencies involved in implementing and administering the programme, including the Departments of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Education, Marine, and Tourism and Trade, Bord Fáilte, Central Fisheries Board, CERT, Office of Public Works and Shannon Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> There is also a National Monitoring Committee for the Operational Programme, again chaired by my Department, comprised of representatives from the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, relevant Government Departments, the Tourism Agencies, Tourism Industry, Farming and Trade Union interests.  This committee has general responsibility for ensuring smooth implementation in pursuit of programme objectives.  In addition, my Department, and, as appropriate, Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, are represented at monitoring committee level for other Operational Programmes contributing to the development of the tourism industry e.g. INTERREG (Northern Ireland and Maritime), the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, and the International Fund for Ireland.  They are also represented on the appropriate regional structures for monitoring the implementation of the Community Support Framework as a whole.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of grant-aid for the tourism sector is afforded a high priority, and I am satisfied that the existence of these co-ordinating mechanisms will ensure that that priority is maintained and will go a long way towards eliminating the potential for overlap or duplication.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

In addition to assistance from the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG is making £10 million available for projects of a cultural, heritage, tourism and marketing nature specifically in the Border counties.  To date, a large number of applications have come forward under INTERREG and Bord Fáilte is currently evaluating all projects to ensure that those which receive support will make a significant contribution to the development of tourism in the area.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland has made £1 million available to Ireland for the development of tourism initiatives during 1996.  This includes marketing, human resource development and product development and, as in the case of INTERREG, many of the projects funded are joint initiatives between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
      <P>Finally, the special programme for peace and reconciliation hopes to use tourism as a catalyst for urban and rural regeneration and it is providing grants through county council led task forces for suitable community led projects. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte are also exploring the possibility of further joint marketing actions under the measure of the special programme which encourages interagency co-operation.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the promotion of tourism from Northern Ireland rests with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> I am advised by Bord Fáilte that it manages a marketing programme for Northern Ireland with television, radio and press advertising, a full publicity programme and a series of trade and consumer promotions in partnership with the Irish trade.  In the autumn, a specific advertising and publicity programme will take place to encourage the development of the market with an emphasis on off-season growth.</P>
    <P>Overall, tourism from Northern Ireland has grown steadily in the past few years.  In 1995 the market was worth £80.6 million to the Irish economy which represents an increase of 16 per cent over the 1993 performance.</P>

      <P>I assume that this question refers to the Tourism and Travel estimated earnings and expenditure figures published by the Central Statistics Office.  The Deputy will be aware that Ireland's trade surplus has increased over the period from approximately £2 billion in 1991 to over £7 billion in 1995.</P>
      <P>As regards tourism and travel, earnings from overseas visitors to Ireland have increased very substantially over the period 1991-95 from £1,217 million in 1991 to £1,677 million in 1995.  This is one of the fastest growth rates in international tourism and makes Ireland one of the few countries in Northern Europe to enjoy a positive tourism and travel balance.  Meanwhile Irish expenditure on foreign travel has also increased, particularly over the past two years, reflecting buoyancy in our economy, increasing prosperity and growing interest in visiting abroad.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have always played an important role in tourism development in their localities. They are represented on the regional tourism authority boards and on the county tourism committees which are the most inclusive and best placed bodies to act as co-ordinators and facilitators of local initiatives on tourism, as they are part of a national network which is full integrated with Bord Fáilte's overseas marketing operations.</P>
      <P>The success of the tourism industry in recent years has also increased pressure on local authorities to expand infrastructure, in particular, the provision of water, waste disposal and roads to facilitate the further development of the industry in their areas.</P>
      <P>While the role of local authorities is, of course, a matter in the first instance for my colleague the Minister for the Environment and while I am satisfied with their representation on the regional tourism authority boards and on the county tourism committees, I would like to encourage local authorities to continue to contribute both practically and financially to the further development of the tourism sector.</P>

      <P>In relation to the EU internal market, I will chair two meetings of the internal market council on 25 October and 26 November.  My priorities will be:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to review the functioning of the internal market and to initiate any action required in the light of the Commission's report on the effectiveness of the internal market, which is due to be published later this year; to facilitate the work being carried out by the Commission in the area of legislation simplification; to oversee the completion of the &ldquo;Citizens First&rdquo; initiative, which is designed to inform EU citizens of their rights in the internal market; to progress the work being carried out to assist the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to align their legislation to that of the EU as part of their preparations for accession; to seek to adopt measures relating to the free movement of doctors, foodstuffs, the Community Customs Code, pressure equipment, two or three-wheeled vehicles and motor vehicle frontal impact.</P>
      <P>In the external trade area, I will represent the EU Presidency at the first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore on 9-13 December.  In preparation for this conference, I will host a meeting of EU Trade Ministers in Dublin on 18-19 September. My objective for the December WTO Conference will be to ensure a strong EU contribution and an outcome reflecting the EU priority of consolidating and developing the multilateral trade system.</P>
      <P>My priority in the tourism area will be to make progress on the proposed EU Multi-Annual Programme for Tourism, having regard, in particular, to the economic importance of the tourist industry throughout Europe and the need for member states to address together its development.  I will chair a meeting of the Tourism Council on 24 October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support the Deputy's assertion that the funds allocated by the Government for the domestic tourism marketing initiative are a paltry sum.  It must be emphasised that the programme which is being overseen by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, Minister of State at my Department, is incremental and complementary to marketing activities already being undertaken by Bord Fáilte and the industry in the marketplace. The incremental State funds of £0.5 million, with investment by the commercial sector, will enable a comprehensive marketing plan to be undertaken in a communications strategy involving television, radio, print and direct consumer promotion.  The main elements of the programme will be focused on an autumn campaign which will be conducted in close association <Col N="983" /> with the industry, Bord Fáilte, the Regional Tourism Organisations and Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, a pre-summer campaign involving co-operative advertising in the press was activated to stimulate consumer interest and travel in the home market under the theme &ldquo;June Value Breaks&rdquo;.  Advertisements appeared in the <i>Sunday World, Belfast Telegraph, Sunday Independent</i> and<i> The Irish Times</i> and concluded last weekend. This was the first occasion when there has been active co-ordination, integration and partnership between the Government, State tourism agencies and industry representatives in promoting the home holiday market.</P>
      <P>This unique opportunity, through the deployment of Government funds and the active involvement, participation and investment by the trade, will heighten the awareness of the consumer to the attractions of holidaying at home.</P>
      <P>I have no particular views to offer on the level of expenditure by Irish persons who travel abroad on holidays.  This is part of an international trend of increased foreign travel.  Figures provided by the Central Statistics Office show that there was a positive tourism and travel balance for Ireland in 1995 estimated at £410 million.</P>

      <P>The report is being considered at a policy level by my Department and other Government Department and other interested local development organisations.  The report will inform the International Conference on Local Development which will be held in Dublin in November 1996.  This will be the first major international conference on local development.  It will focus on the Irish experience of local development; the role of local development in addressing critical issues facing the Union, such as unemployment and social exclusion; and it will bring together policy makers, administrators and people working in local development throughout the Union.  The aim is to promote and increase awareness of local development as a means of addressing these critical issues.</P>

      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference which opened in Turin in March of this year has been convened for the purpose of considering possible changes to the EU treaties. Each member state as well as the European Commission is free to propose amendments to the EU treaties.  A key consideration is that any treaty amendment must be agreed unanimously by the member states.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference is still at a very early stage.  There is as yet no consensus on the incorporation in the treaties of new provisions on disability or on discrimination more generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to the position of the European Commission on the question of disability.  The Commission's opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference which was adopted on 28 February 1996 expresses the view that the Intergovernmental Conference should incorporate in the treaty provisions banning discrimination of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Irish position is concerned, in line with the recently published White Paper on foreign policy, the Government attaches particular importance in the negotiations to addressing the most direct concerns of citizens.  During the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, we have taken a positive view of strengthening in an appropriate way the treaty provisions in respect of discrimination.  To an extent discussion has thus far focused on the possibility of an anti-discrimination <Col N="993" /> clause.  We have also, for example, expressed support for the incorporation in the treaty of a suitable legal base which would permit the European institutions to adopt appropriate legislative provisions in respect of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Specifically as regards disability we have been to the forefront in arguing that such anti-discrimination provisions should include discrimination on the grounds of disability.  Moreover, we have argued for an amendment to Article 100a, relating to the achievement of the internal market, with a view to ensuring that in drawing up internal market standards the Council shall take into account the needs of people with a disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been Government policy to recruit people with disabilities into the Civil Service and arrangements for doing so have been in place for many years.  Central to the Government's policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities is the commitment to achieve a quota of 3 per cent for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service.  I am happy to say that the quota was reached in the Civil Service in 1993 and has been maintained since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994 a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service was drawn up and circulated to all civil servants.  The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evacuation procedures.  The ideas for the code <Col N="994" /> of practice were developed in conjunction with the Civil Service unions, the relevant voluntary bodies and in consultation with staff with disabilities.  I have arranged for a copy of the code of practice to be sent separately to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Under the code of practice, people with disabilities are entitled to apply for any post in the Civil Service for which they are qualified and to have their applications considered on the basis of their abilities, qualifications and suitability for the work in question.  No unnecessary or irrelevant obstacle will be placed in the way of disabled candidates.</P>
    <P>Permanent appointments to established positions in the Civil Service are filled follwoing open competition held by the Civil Service Commission.  Competitions are advertised in the national newspapers.  Unestablished subordinate positions and some temporary positions, e.g. seasonal work in the Passport Office, are filled by individual Government Departments, usually by direct advertising or through the FÁS Employment Service.</P>
    <P>A person with a disability may apply for any open recruitment competition for which he or she is eligible.  Once they are notified in advance of special needs, the Civil Service Commission will make arrangements to facilitate candidates where at all possible.</P>
    <P>As a positive action measure and as a means of increasing the number of people with disabilities in the Civil Service, competitions confined to candidates with a disability are organised by the Civil Service Commission from time to time, for the main general recruitment grades of clerical assistant and executive officer and for the grade of visually impaired telephonist.  Departments are encouraged to draw from these specially targeted panels.  In general, in order to be eligible for the competitions confined to candidates with a disability, a person must be registered with, or entitled to be registered with the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>If a person with a disability is <Col N="995" /> interested in a position in the Civil Service it is recommended that he or she (a) checks the newspapers for advertisements for appointments in the Civil Service and applies for any competition for which he or she is eligible and in which he or she is interested; although the main advertising days are Thursday, <i>Irish Independent,</i> and Friday, <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Examiner,</i> from time to time the Civil Service Commission and individual Departments place advertisements which are published on other days of the week; it is advisable, therefore, to check the newspapers on a daily basis; (b) registers with FÁS Employment Services Office, D'Olier House, D'Olier Street, Dublin 2 and with any FÁS Employment Service Office which services the geographical area in which he or she would be interested in working, stating in particular that he or she is interested in any position in the Civil Service, temporary or permanent; in relation to positions in the Civil Service, he or she could ask that it be noted that he or she has a disability, as candidates with a disability may be given preference for certain positions; (c) registers with the NRB and with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, where appropriate, for any employment opportunities that may be notified to them, mentioning in particular appointments in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy would like any further information, the equality section of my Department would be pleased to assist him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The Government considered the report of the inter-agency task force on casinos at a recent meeting.  In the context of a proposal received from the RDS to construct a national conference centre without recourse to an annual subvention, the Government has decided not to give further consideration to the introduction of legislation to provide for a casino or casinos.  There are no plans to publish the task force report.  The terms of reference of the task force did not extend as far as considering the suitability of particular locations as sites for casinos.</P>

      <P>The current licence under which the An Post National Lottery Company operates the national lottery came into effect on 1 January 1994 and will run to 31 March 2000.  It replaces the earlier licence granted for a period of ten years <Col N="997" /> from October 1986.  That licence was revoked with effect from 1 January 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the player base for the national lottery continued to grow rapidly, the company concluded that substantial investment in upgraded technology was required to enhance game support services to players, <i>inter alia</i> by facilitating improved on-line access via terminals. Accordingly, following a public competitive tendering process, the National Lottery Company requested ministerial approval for contractual arrangements which would deliver improved technology on the most competitive terms. To maximise the gains under the terms negotiated, and in recognition of the need for continuity in responding to challenges in the marketplace arising, for example, from the introduction of the UK lottery, the Minister for Finance agreed, following consultation with the Attorney General, to issue a fresh <Col N="998" /> licence running from 1 January 1994 to 31 March 2000.  The new licence provides for maximum gains from the investment in new technology by the National Lottery Company and a better return to the national lottery beneficiary fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions <Col N="1001" /> Nos. 79 and 94 to 101, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department has an overall policy role in relation to all aspects of the operation of hospital services, including the generation and proper management of health care waste.  Responsibility for the day-to-day management of such waste is directly a matter for the hospital authorities concerned in consultation with the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the United Kingdom Department of the Environment has issued a Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste, which has, as a general presumption, that waste should not be imported into the United Kingdom for disposal.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has confirmed in reply to a separate question today that the management plan has, in response to a submission made by his Department, allowed for continued exports of wastes requiring high temperature incineration on an indefinite basis.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation closely and the health agencies will be kept informed of developments.</P>
      <P>Hospitals which do not have local treatment and disposal facilities available to them have tended to make arrangements with private waste management companies to have their waste disposed of in incinerators in Britain which are licensed to treat clincial waste.</P>
      <P>The detailed information which the Deputy is seeking in relation to the hospitals that export waste to the United Kingdom, quantities of waste involved, companies involved, shipment permits etc. is not available in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department, in consultation with the health boards and major voluntary hospitals, has looked at the options available for the disposal of health care risk waste and the conclusion was that the major part of the health care risk waste, sharps and infectious waste, could most economically and practicably be disposed of by non-incineration <Col N="1002" /> methods involving shredding and disinfection. It was decided to implement this option by seeking tenders, jointly with the authorities in Northern Ireland, from specialist waste disposal contractors to provide a service of collection, transport, treatment and disposal. Expressions of interest are being processed from contractors for the provision of such a service.  Contract documentation, including a detailed technical specification, will be issued shortly to the parties involved.  The siting of any treatment plant would be a matter for the successful contractor.  It is expected that the tendering process and the awarding of the contract will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified by their general practitioner as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
      <P>Last year the health boards carried out a review of the community drugs schemes generally.  In the case of the DCSS, that review showed that there were a considerable number of people who, although holding a DCSS card, had ceased to use it, indicating that they no longer had an ongoing monthly requirement for prescribed medicines in excess of £32 per month in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  A subsequent review by the Eastern Health Board of the drug cost subsidisation scheme in its own area confirmed this position.  Accordingly, card holders who did not meet the criterion for eligibility under this scheme were written to by the board and advised that arrangements are being made to cancel their cards.  The board advised such persons that they may avail of the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, where any expenditure on prescribed medication in excess of £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>The board has confirmed that should a person at a future date have an ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £32 per month, the person will be granted a new drug cost subsidisation scheme card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The long-term illness scheme had its origins in an <i>ad hoc</i> non statutory scheme for the free supply of certain requisites for the treatment of diabetes, to diabetics who were not medical card holders.  This early scheme was established in mid-1967 by administrative action.  Subsequently, section 59 (3) of the Health Act, 1970 provided that health boards shall &ldquo;make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines or medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or longterm nature&rdquo;.  The long-term illness scheme came into operation in late 1971.  Statutory regulations of 1971 and 1975 specify the 15 conditions covered under this scheme.  These are: mental handicap; mental illness, for persons under 16 only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from any of those illnesses are entitled to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme having regard to the support which is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses such as the life long requirement for anti-rejection drugs.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified by their general practitioner as <Col N="1011" /> having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above schemes, where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive <Col N="1012" /> officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through an existing range of drug schemes to those in the community with long-term medical conditions.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Pertussis immunisation is administered combined with diphtheria and tetanus and is commonly known as DPT or 3 in 1.  The Irish Medicines Board is currently assessing a product authorisation application for a DPT vaccine which contains a cellular pertussis.  The question of including this vaccine in the primary childhood immunisation scheme will be considered if and when a product authorisation is issued by the Irish Medicines Board and decided on the basis of information provided by the board and other epidemiological and scientific evidence produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee's framework plan for all major emergencies was approved by Government in 1984.  In August 1993 the interdepartmental committee on peacetime emergency planning initiated a review of the guidelines and advice on emergency planning contained in the framework document.  The committee issued new recommendations in September 1994 with a view to improving co-ordination between the main emergency services <Col N="1016" /> both at the planning stage and during the course of an emergency.</P>
    <P>All eight health boards have a comprehensive emergency plan prepared in line with the 1984 framework document.  The health boards regularly run test exercises to check on the effectiveness of their plans, and boards continually update their plans in the light of relevant experiences at home and abroad and with additions to or deletions from the lists of contact agencies, personnel, etc.  These plans are generic in character and are therefore capable of being applied to all types of emergencies including a major chemical accident. Health boards participate in initiatives to improve co-ordination of emergency planning efforts at regional level.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin area, the agencies concerned have a working group on major emergency plans engaged in an examination of the plans for the Dublin area and the appropriate co-ordinated response from each agency.</P>
    <P>The poisons information centre in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, operates a 24 hour telephone service, particularly for medical personnel, to provide information on the diagnosis and treatment of poisoning from all causes.  The centre has computer links to the UK databases and also subscribes to US databases.</P>
    <P>Within the health service there is now a well developed understanding and recognition by health agencies of their role and functions in major emergencies and the responsibilities which they carry regarding such occurrences.</P>

      <asker>Mr. E. Ryan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a media report in The Examiner on 17 June 1996 regarding the inadequacy on emergency services at Cork University Hospital to deal with a major chemical accident; the plans, if any, he has to improve facilities in this respect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13361/96]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In May 1995, the Southern Health Board established a committee <Col N="1017" /> to review the organisation and delivery of accident and emergency services in Cork.  The group completed its report in March 1996 and discussions are currently taking place within the board to address the issues identified in this report.  I expect to receive a copy of the report in the near future.</P>
      <P>At present, in the event of a chemical accident, there is a major emergency plan put into operation which involves all emergency services, i.e. the Garda, fire services, ambulance service and the accident and emergency department.</P>
      <P>It is the major emergency policy worldwide that decontamination takes place at the scene of the accident.  In this regard each chemical company has its own decontamination procedures in place.  The fire service also has specific decontamination facilities available. Once the hospitals have been notified of the accident, the hospital emergency plan is put into operation, which includes notification of all emergency staff.  The victims are then transported by ambulance to any one of three accident and emergency departments in Cork where emergency beds are made available to cope with the situation.</P>
      <P>Facilities and equipment for accident and emergency services are constantly being reviewed by my Department. However, on receipt of the report of the Southern Health Board Accident and Emergency Review Group, the question of additional resources will be considered in the context of competing demands and priorities for acute hospital services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board it has <Col N="1018" /> decided to institute summer ward closures in the general hospitals for a four week period during July and August of 1996.  The closures will mainly affect elective procedures in surgery and gynaecology.</P>
      <P>Summer bed closures are designed to coincide with consultant and other staff leave and it is a common occurrence that there is a fall off in elective procedures during the holiday period.  The board is satisfied that the proposed measures can be implemented without affecting the overall acute hospital activity projected for 1996.  Emergency services will not be affected by those measures.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The question of the level of medical equipment to be carried on Aer Lingus aeroplanes is a matter for that company to decide.  The Irish Heart Foundation, assisted by my Department, is engaged in a national campaign to educate the public to recognise the symptoms of cardiac arrest and the administration of cardio pulmonary resuscitation.  The next link in the chain of survival involves defibrillation and while first responder defibrillation does not necessarily have to be administered by a health professional proper training is essential.  Any organisation involved in training for defibrillation techniques should contact the National Ambulance Advisory Council who would supply details of the appropriate training bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Precise medical diagnosis of asthma can often be problematic, and the term is frequently used to cover a range of respiratory conditions including bronchitis.  In addition, asthma is not a notifiable disease, and most cases are treated by general practitioners rather than in hospitals.  For these reasons, national figures on the prevalence of asthma in the community are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of a three-year study of asthma funded by the health research board as part of an EU Concerted Action Programme are currently being <Col N="1026" /> finalised prior to publication.  Provisional results indicate the increase in asthma prevalence rates in the Dublin area between 1991 and 1995.  It was not possible to ascertain trends in rural prevalence rates since the study of rural areas was confined to 1993.  After controlling for age structure, smoking and other factors, no significant difference was found between urban and rural prevalence rates.</P>
    <P>The health research board is also involved in an international collaborative research project on asthma called ISAAC &mdash; International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Children.  The Irish component of the study is based on a representative survey of 3,000 school children aged 13 to 14 years, and the results are due for publication later this year.  Based on preliminary figures, the results suggest an increasing prevalence and a current rate of 15.2 per cent but show no significant difference between urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Further research, carried out under the auspices of the Department of Respiratory Medicine in James Connolly Memorial Hospital, obtained an estimate of 5 per cent prevalence of Irish adults who had physician diagnosed asthma and 2.2 per cent receiving active treatment for PDA.  No significant intercounty differences were observed.  The results, based on a postal questionnaire, were published in the Journal of the Irish College of Physicians and Surgeons in October 1994.  The relatively low response rate obtained for this survey, 43 per cent, makes it difficult to interpret these results with a high degree of confidence.</P>
    <P>In a recent study of asthma in 4-19 year old school children published in the January-February 1996 issue of the Irish Medical Journal, a prevalence rate of 11.9 per cent is reported.  This compares with a rate of 4.4 per cent from a similar study conducted in 1983-1984.  The prevalence of asthma was not found to be significantly different between urban and rural children.</P>
    <P>National results from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, HIPE, can be used to <Col N="1027" /> compute asthma hospitalisation rates by age group and urban-rural area of residence. These figures for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995 are set out in the following table.  Prior to 1992, HIPE coverage is not sufficiently complete or consistent for analysis of hospitalisation rates.  In the interpretation of HIPE data, it should be noted that information is not available from private hospitals and, in addition, that a person attending <Col N="1028" /> hospital several times in a given year is counted separately in the statistics for each visit.  The figures reported as follows give discharge rates per 100,000 population where asthma has been recorded as the principal diagnosis. From this analysis, the concentration of asthma prevalence in the youngest agegroup is apparent and there is some evidence of an increased rate of hospitalisation for urban areas.  No overall trend in rates over the three years is evident.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 to 114, inclusive, together.  As the Deputy will be aware, section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, enables health boards to make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home. This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.  It is a matter for each health board, within the overall financial allocation notified by my Department, to decide the level of funding for the home help service.  As the level of funding for the home help service is a matter for each health board, my Department does not consider it necessary to issue guidelines on funding voluntary home help organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the voluntary committee in the home help service is to provide a service, on the Eastern Health Board's behalf, to those persons requiring care and assistance at home so that they can continue to live independently within the community.  Organisations are notified by the board of their allocation <Col N="1030" /> each year and advised that the level of services should be contained within the approved allocation.  The board's local community care staff have ongoing consultation with the organisations to assist in ensuring that levels of services are in line with the funds available and that deficits are not incurred.</P>
    <P>In allocating funding to an organisation, the Eastern Health Board takes account of the level of service development of the organisation, their financial position at the end of the previous year and the organisation's anticipated income from recipients' contributions.</P>
    <P>The level of funding provided by the Eastern Health Board to provide home help service in the last five years is as follows:</P>

    <P>The allocation to the service in 1996 increased by 0.9 per cent to £4,404 million. In general the allocation provided to each organisation enables it to continue the agreed level of service reached in the previous year.  The 1996 allocation was finalised with each organisation when the audited accounts for 1995 were received.  I understand that these accounts are currently outstanding for one organisation in Area 7 and consequently the allocation to this group must remain at the 1995 level until the accounts are received.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of additional funding for holiday pay, my Department made a special allocation available to the Eastern Health Board in late 1994 to meet a claim in respect of holiday pay from voluntary agencies providing services in the Eastern Health Board area.  This allocation enabled the board to fund the cost of holiday pay <Col N="1031" /> already paid or due to be paid by the voluntary home help organisations.  The board is now reviewing with each organisation the service provision-expenditure in 1996 including any outstanding claims for holiday pay from 1995 and ongoing in 1996.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department is continuing the development of detailed mechanisms for attributing acute hospital costs to the different elements of a hospital's activity.  At present, this information is available for 26 of the biggest hospitals, and the average in-patient cost per bed-day has been extracted from the cost and activity information supplied by those hospitals and is set out for 1994 in Table 1.  These figures exclude costs and activity attributable to day-cases, out-patient services, long-stay cases, dialysis, obstetrics and psychiatry.  They do not take account of capital costs.  It should be noted that there are many factors which affect in-patient cost per bed-day and these include, in particular, case mix workload and teaching obligations.</P>

      <P>The proposals for the future development of these areas are set out in the management plan for Killarney National Park, which was published in 1990.  The development scheme proposed contains the following main elements:&mdash; a major tree planting programme, with considerable irregularly patterned woodland, is to be established on the southern edge of the parkland; restoration of the internal roadway linking Knockreer and the Demesne for jaunting car, pedestrain and cycle use; the location in parkland paddocks along this roadway of rare breeds of livestock and horses, both as a visitor feature and for grassland maintenance; development of car parks at Ross Road and at Knockreer; specific landscape development of the Demesne area to the West of Killarney House and restoration of many formal features in the Demesne area, particularly in the immediate precincts of Killarney House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management plan also sets out the future proposals for the two large buildings in this area of the Park. Knockreer House will continue to be the main research and education centre within the national park.  The use of Killarney House, together with its outbuildings and gardens, is legally reserved to Mrs. Mary McShain for her lifetime.  In the future, it is intended to retain and preserve the integrity and character of the House and surrounding area, and to provide visitor access to it. However, the full implementation of these proposals must await the handing over of Killarney House to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The major <Col N="1036" /> tree planting programme on the southern edge of the Woodland has been completed, however, and some landscaping works have been carried out in Knockreer.</P>
    <P>Killarney is one of the few towns in the world which can boast of having part of a national park within its boundaries. It is important, therefore, that any developments within the town area of the park is in keeping with its status as an internationally recognised national park.  I consider the proposals I have outlined above to be the most appropriate in this context.</P>
    <P>The provision of a town park in Killarney is a matter for the local authority in the first instance.  While I would welcome such a development in Killarney, I do not consider it appropriate to locate it within the national park itself.</P>

      <Quest>the areas designated to date as national heritage areas in County Mayo; if the local farmers in each area were notified by letter by the Office of Public Works in respect of such designation; if so, the date on which they were so notified; the number of letters that were sent out; if it is intended to make further additions to the current list; if such designation will impose restrictions on farming activities; and if so, if the farmers concerned will be compensated.</Quest>

      <P>I have not yet designated any natural heritage areas and do not propose to make any such designations until the Oireachtas has passed an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976.  I anticipate that I will be in a position to bring the matter before this House in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, has advertised the areas proposed for designation as part of the consultation process.  Public notification took place through the provincial newspapers and advertisements were placed in <i>The Connaught Telegraph, The Mayo News</i> and <i>The Western People</i> on 14 December 1994.</P>
      <P>The Bill to amend the Wildlife Act, 1976, will set out the requirements for NHAs and the question of compensation if any will have to be viewed in the light of those requirements.  Provision will be made for the notification, where possible, of landowners in the areas which are proposed for designation as NHAs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A list of the proposed sites in County <Col N="1040" /> Mayo is given in Table A.  Maps at sixinch scale may be viewed in County Mayo at the county council planning office, Mayo Teagasc and farm development service offices and by arrangement with the deputy regional manager of the NPWS, Mr. Michael Sweeney, &ldquo;Ralaoi&rdquo;, Kilmaine Road, Ballinrobe, County Mayo (Phone 092-41269).</P>
    <P>I understand that some land owners and farmers, whose lands are currently excluded from the proposed NHAs, have expressed a desire to have their land designated.  These lands will be investigated and, where they meet the scientific criteria, will also be proposed for designation.</P>

    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I am responsible for the development and co-ordination of waste management policy generally, alongside the Environmental Protection Agency and local <Col N="1047" /> authorities who have planning and licensing roles.  In this capacity, I have extended the regulatory requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 to hospital incinerators to ensure that all such facilities operate to high environmental standards.</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility for promoting good health care waste management policy lies with the Minister for Health, who published a health service waste policy in June 1994.  There is ongoing liaison between the Departments of the Environment and of Health within this framework.</P>
    <P>My Department has no direct function in relation to the collection of statistical information on health care waste but has access to data compiled by the Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The policy of successive Governments is that Ireland should operate self-sufficiently in relation to the disposal of wastes, with the exception of certain industrial wastes requiring high temperature incineration for which it would be uneconomic to provide specialised facilities in this country. Consistently with this policy, the Minister for Health is pursuing with the Northern Ireland authorities the development of an all-Ireland non-incineration waste management system <Col N="1048" /> for health care waste; the tendering process for this is under way.</P>
    <P>Following the publication by the United Kingdom authorities in February 1995 of a consultation draft of a waste strategy for England and Wales, my Department responded with a submission in March 1995 in support of the continued export to the UK for disposal of wastes requiring high temperature incineration, which would include some hospital wastes.  This case was based on Article 4.3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93.  Interested bodies, including the Department of Health, were informed.  The UK authorities accepted the Irish submission and the UK Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste, which was published on 16 May 1996, allows for continued exports of relevant Irish wastes on an indefinite basis.</P>

      <P>Outturn figures in respect of the years 1990-93 are contained in the returns of local taxation publications for the years 1990-93, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The outturn figures in respect of 1994 are set out in Table A.  Outturn figures for 1995, in respect of both current and capital expenditure, are not yet available in my Department but estimates of current expenditure are contained in the 1995 Local Authority Estimates publication, which is also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As EU funding is channelled through a number of Departments and agencies, information on the overall proportion of local authority expenditure which is funded by the EU is not available in my Department.  Details of grants paid directly to local authorities by my <Col N="1050" /> Department during the period from 1990 to 1995 in respect of EU co-financed projects are set out in Table B. This expenditure would normally be assisted by the EU at aid rates ranging between 50 per cent and 85 per cent.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> The felling of a tree does not normally constitute development and does not require planning permission. However, where a TPO is made, a planning authority may apply all the development control provisions of the planning Acts to applications for consent to fell a tree covered by the order. Guidelines issued by my Department in March 1994 advise local authorities that provisions relating to public notice, objections and appeals should be included in all TPOs.  A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999, outlines the strategy for the development of the network of national roads over that period. The development strategy for national primary roads focuses on the following four key corridors: North-South Corridor (Euroroutes E01 and E30, National Routes N1, N11 and N25); Southwest Corridor (Euroroutes E20 and E201, National Routes N7, N8, N18 and N19); East/West Corridor (National Routes N4, N6 and N16); and the Western Corridor (National Routes N17, N18, N24 and N25).</P>
      <P>The programme provides that priority is to be given to these strategic corridors and that at least 70 per cent of the total investment on national primary routes will be allocated to them.  I am satisfied that the mid-east region will be well served by the development of these corridors.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances of the school in question and the efforts being made by the school's board of management, teachers and parents to ensure the well-being of the pupils in their care.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently launched an important new initiative which seeks to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  This initiative is in response to reports which I commissioned from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations in the reports, a targeted programme of supports is being made available to 25 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford urban areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, 25 clusters of small schools with fewer than five teachers, and particularly those in rural areas with high levels of disadvantage, will receive a targeted programme of supports. Schools from all parts of the country with fewer than five teachers are eligible to apply for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, on the basis of the information currently available to my Department, the <Col N="1065" /> school in question is eligible for consideration for support under the scheme and will have recently been invited by the Education Research Centre to submit an application for inclusion in the scheme.  The centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit five-year development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 1995 was 56 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and one assistant teacher for the 1996-97 school year. Accordingly, the second assistant's post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question has been placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment which will not take place prior to 1 September 1996.</P>
      <P>Difficulties relating to the provision of a remedial service at this school have been brought to my attention.  Currently, the special education section of my Department is reviewing this matter. When a final decision has been made, the managerial authorities will be informed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to make remedial teacher posts available to the schools referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>I consider that the substantial improvements which I have already achieved in this area provide practical confirmation of my commitment to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  During the period 1994-95, in addition to allocating an extra 155 remedial teachers, I adopted a particular focus on the needs of children attending special schools and classes.  In addition to reducing the pupil teacher ratios in all such facilities, I provided a very substantial increase in the special capitation rates applicable in such cases.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>

      <P>I have received the submission to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre has recently been in touch with all eligible schools, including schools in the Ballyfermot area, inviting them to apply for inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  On the basis of the information currently available to my Department, I would expect that a significant number of schools from the area in question would be eligible to apply for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Education Research Centre will prioritise all applicants in terms of level of need as represented by the data submitted by the schools and will advise my Department of the outcome.</P>
      <P>Schools selected as a result of this process will be invited to submit fiveyear development plans.  Each such plan will be required to identify current difficulties and put forward specific proposals and targets for addressing the problems of educational disadvantage. Qualification for support will depend on the submission of suitable development plans.</P>

      <P>The provisions in relation to tax relief on tuition fees in the Finance Act, 1995 apply to approved courses in approved private colleges in the State.

In fact much favourable comment was received from teachers <Col N="1074" /> and the newspapers carried clarifications refuting complaints ascribed to individual teachers in their reports on the examination which had been carried in previous editions of the papers.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the application from County Wexford Vocational Education Committee to cover the central courtyard at New Ross vocational school.  A number of issues which have been raised by officials from the building unit of my Department in relation to this project are currently being addressed by County Wexford Vocational Education Committee.  The commencement of the project is dependent on the successful completion of architectural planning and available resources.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate when work may commence on the project.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1995 has declined to 215 pupils which warrants a staffing in the 1996-97 year of a principal and six <Col N="1078" /> assistant teachers.  Accordingly, the seventh assistant's post at the school will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question has been placed on the relevant diocesan panel for redeployment which will not take place before 1 September 1996.</P>

      <P>A vacancy has arisen for a permanent teacher in the school to which the deputy refers.  The post must therefore be filled by a permanent teacher.  Permanent posts can only be filled from relevant panels or, following the clearance of panels, by open competition.</P>
      <P>Since the school in question is under the patronage of the Archbishop of Dublin, the vacancy must be filled from the Dublin Archdiocese panel.  Currently, there is a number of teachers on this panel.  A teacher on a panel cannot refuse any written offer of a vacancy unless he or she is currently serving in a school which is located more than 28 miles from the school in respect of which the offer is made, or unless the teacher has an exemption on the grounds of maternity.</P>
      <P>A board of management with a fillable vacancy is required to make a written offer to a teacher and allow the teacher seven days to respond.  I regret, therefore, that it is not possible for me to authorise the employment of a temporary teacher to the school in question.</P>

      <P>My Department does not keep detailed records of the number of children with Down's Syndrome attending mainstream primary schools. At present, the visiting teacher service in County Donegal caters for six children with Down's Syndrome.  Two of these children are visited twice a week. Each such visit is of one to one-and-a-half hours duration.  The other four children are visited once a week.  These visits last approximately one-and-a-half hours each.</P>
      <P>In County Galway, a visiting teacher calls on one child with Down's Syndrome attending a mainstream primary school.  Such visits generally take place every third week and last approximately three-quarters of an hour.  Outside of post-primary school terms, this child is visited on a weekly basis.</P>

    <P>The visiting teacher service is just one of the supports available for pupils with special educational needs, including Down's Syndrome, attending mainstream primary schools.  Pupils with learning difficulties are also supported by the remedial and resource teacher services.  For example, ten children with Down's Syndrome in County Donegal are currently supported by a specially allocated resource teacher.  These children are visited every second day for approximately one hour each visit. Comparable figures for County Galway are not readily available.  However, seven of the 36 resource teachers currently in place nationwide are based in <Col N="1082" /> County Galway and serve special needs children in 32 primary schools in the area.</P>

      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is a new 12 classroom school completed in 1992 at a cost of £0.85 million.  The project was designed and supervised by the manager's architect. There was a disagreement between my Department and the school authorities concerning the final account for this project and the matter remained <Col N="1083" /> unresolved.  The case was re-examined in late 1995.  Following this re-examination the Department agreed a final account figure with the school authorities.

      <P>I am aware of the details as set out by the Deputy in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my Department first became aware of alleged irregularities at Ramsgrange community school, inquiries were immediately initiated to establish the extent of any loss and if further action was necessary.  Arising from these inquiries, a formal complaint was made to the Garda by the board of management and the principal was suspended on 22 October 1993.  My Department also decided that the scale of the alleged irregularities warranted a special audit of the school's financial operations and the circumstances giving rise to the loss.  Following the Garda <Col N="1088" /> investigation, criminal proceedings were initiated against the principal in December 1994.  Proceedings of this nature are a matter for the DPP and the Department does not have any involvement. Subsequently, the principal was convicted in the Circuit Court of charges arising from the irregularities which were discovered in the finances of the school.  A suspended prison sentence of two years was imposed.  As a result of this, the pension, to which the person concerned was legally entitled and which was granted prior to conviction, was forfeited with effect from the date of conviction and sentence.</P>
    <P>The legal representatives of the person concerned instituted High Court proceedings on this matter and judgment was reserved.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this aspect of the case at this time.</P>
    <P>I should point out that no gratuity has been paid to the person concerned.  My Department has sought legal advice on legal remedies available to seek reimbursement of any outstanding money.</P>
    <P>The Department's special audit concluded that the irregularities arose primarily as a result of weak internal financial and management control systems at the school and made a number of recommendations which I understand have been or are in the course of being implemented by the board of management.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that boards of management are primarily responsible for the governance and direction of community and comprehensive schools. My Department has advised each board of the importance of ensuring there are adequate internal controls and segregation of duties in their operations to help prevent losses of this nature arising. A special audit unit has been established in the Department to facilitate more regular audits for all schools in the sector.  My Department is also engaged in the review of the financial guidelines applicable to these schools in consultation with the representative managerial body for the sector.  This review <Col N="1089" /> will take account of the very complex nature of the financial operations of schools.</P>
    <P>From the time that the difficulties at Ramsgrange were brought to the attention of my Department, the main priority of my Department has been to ensure that the school authorities continued to be in a position to provide a high standard of education for its pupils while also addressing the serious financial issues which had arisen at the school.  Additional financial resources were allocated to clear the serious deficit position which has arisen including a bank overdraft which had not been disclosed previously.  I understand that all liabilities have now been cleared.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my Department took all appropriate steps in dealing with this matter.  I am also satisfied that the steps taken will prove a valuable support to school management and help to prevent further losses arising in the sector.</P>

      <P>The Government policy agreement contains a commitment to introduce legislation to abolish ground rents as a specific lien on residential property and convert them into normal commercial debt.  I am examining at present the measures which would be necessary to give effect to this with a view to putting the matter before Government.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what specific point the Deputy has in mind in relation to householders whose levies have run out or are due to run out but it is the case that under section 7 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1984 a distinction is made between leases which have more or less than 15 years to run and that generally where the lease has less than 15 years to run the price payable for acquiring the fee simple is at its highest reflecting the increasing pecuniary interest of the landlord in the property.  I am informed that the intention of the provision was to have due regard for the property right of both ground rent landlord and ground rent tenant within the context of constitutional requirements.</P>

      <P>To date the Irish Association for Victim Support, who run the Court Victim Witness Programme, have been provided with two permanent rooms in the Four Courts, Dublin.  Elsewhere, in completed Courthouse refurbishment projects such as Athlone, Ballinasloe, Clonmel, Cork District Court complex, Galway and Letterkenny a room is available to the association on day of use basis.  Within the Courts Building Programme it is policy to provide the association with a room on day of use basis, in all major court venues.</P>

      <P>The allocation of Garda personnel is the responsibility of the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>They have informed me that the Templeville and Fortfield area of Templeogue is policed by the gardaí attached to Terenure Garda Station.  There is one garda employed on community policing in the area.  In addition, there are regular foot and mobile patrols, both uniform and plain clothes, of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is as yet no neighbourhood watch scheme operating in the Templeville-Fortfield area.  However, the Garda authorities have informed me that in December 1995 the community garda responsible for the area, together with an inspector from Rathmines station, met residents from both Fortfield and Templeville and outlined the benefits and operation of such a scheme.  I understand from the Garda <Col N="1094" /> authorities that, apart from a small minority of residents, there has been a poor response to date to the suggestion of implementing a neighbourhood watch scheme in the area.</P>

      <P>My Department did not receive a letter or request from the subject's solicitors as suggested by the Deputy nor would it have a role in providing the information sought by them.  However, it has been ascertained from the Chief State Solicitor's Office &mdash; an office for which I have no responsibility &mdash; that the letter in question was received by that office.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the State solicitor dealing with the matter has now confirmed in writing to the subject's solicitors in Northern Ireland that he is endeavouring to get a copy of the extradition order made in the Northern Ireland courts in or about July 1993.  As orders such as that sought are normally retained by the relevant court office in Northern Ireland, the State Solicitor has also suggested in writing to the subject's solicitors that it may be more expeditious if they were to apply to the court office in Belfast for a copy of the extradition order which the subject requires.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that one of the reasons tourists are being targeted by criminals is the belief that the victim will have returned home before the case comes to court and that the victim will therefore be unable to give evidence; the action, if any, she plans to take to deal with this loophole; the current arrangements for dealing with crimes against tourists; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that tourists who have been victims of crime often have to return home before their cases can be dealt with in the courts.  However legislative provisions are in place under the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 to enable a tourist who is the victim of a crime to make an immediate statement before a District Judge which is admissible as evidence in court and can be used without the necessity of the victim attending the subsequent trial.  This provision has been in force since 7 October 1992 and is operating successfully.  In addition, section 29 of the Act provides that any person (other than the accused) who is outside the State may give evidence from abroad by live television link.  This section of the Act is not yet in operation and its implementation is under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the legislative provisions in place ensure that even where tourists who have been victims of crime have to return home prior to the criminal trial, their evidence can be made available to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of crime against tourists is one which receives the highest priority from my Department and the Garda authorities.  Close co-operation is maintained with Bord Fáilte and other tourist interests to ensure that crimes of this nature are minimised to the greatest possible extent.  A number of measures have been taken by the Garda to deal with the problem of attacks against tourists.  These include the deployment of additional gardaí in areas of high tourist interest and locations which frequently feature in instances of crime against tourists.  A Garda office on O'Connell Street is also helpful and serves as a central location for advising tourists on preventative measures. Information leaflets, written in three European languages are provided by the Garda to advise tourists on how to protect their property and personal belongings and these are available at all sea ports and airports.  Another initiative has been the launch by Garda Community Relations Unit of a street map <Col N="1102" /> for tourists in Dublin listing places of current and historical interests, showing supervised car parks and giving crime prevention advice.  I understand that it is intended to extend this project to other areas frequented by tourists.  Gardaí have also carried out security surveys of all youth hostel accommodation and have advised on how best to secure entry and exit points to these buildings and to provide facilities which will enable tourists to store luggage securely.</P>
    <P>For those tourists unfortunate enough to end up as victims of crime, there is the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service which was launched on 14 April 1994 and which is being operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support. The service, which is modelled on the Amsterdam Tourist Assistance Service, provides tourists who have been victims of crime with help in overcoming the initial trauma of their experiences.  The Garda Síochána has been involved in setting up this service and have provided premises for its operation at the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters at Harcourt Square.  The service is grant aided by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  A Co-ordinator with a victim support background has been appointed to head the team of volunteers who provide the service.  All volunteers have a wide range of foreign languages and have received extensive training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together.</P>
      <P>Under the &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, the spouse of a person receiving, <i>inter alia,</i> deserted wife's benefit must contribute to the Department towards the cost of that benefit in respect of his family.  This liability may be offset, in whole or in part, by the transfer to the Department of any maintenance payments which are being made in compliance with a court order.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded £60 per week maintenance for herself under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 in the District Court.  She is receiving deserted wife's benefit at the maximum rate of £85.10 per week for herself and one dependent child.  She is also receiving half-rate disability benefit of £32.25 per week since August 1995.  Prior to that she was in various employments and received half-rate unemployment benefit periodically in addition to her deserted wife's benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has been seeking for <Col N="1106" /> some time the consent of the person concerned to the transfer of her maintenance order moneys in accordance with legislation.  She was informed on 11 June 1996 that if her signed consent to the transfer of the maintenance payments (net of any mortgage repayment for which she is solely responsible) was not received within 14 days a reduction would be applied to her weekly rate of deserted wife's benefit.</P>
    <P>The legal provisions are based on the widely accepted obligation on people to maintain their spouse and children.  The payment of deserted wife's benefit guarantees the person concerned a regularity in weekly income which she might not otherwise enjoy if solely dependent on maintenance payments. The transfer of a maintenance order ensures this continuity of social welfare income and, at the same time, compliance with the &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions mentioned above.</P>
    <P>If the spouse of the person concerned is successful in an application to the District Court to have the family law maintenance order varied or set aside in the light of his current employment circumstances, the Department will review the position.  Otherwise, agreement to the transfer of the existing order is required. In the event that this is not agreed to by the person concerned the Department will have no option but to make an appropriate reduction in her rate of deserted wife's benefit.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to change the social welfare code to permit married women to be treated as persons in their own right rather than as dependants of their husband; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that when a woman dependant of a recipient of unemployment assistance seeks split payments, the dependant is obliged to seek the claimant's permission; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that this can expose a woman to violence in many situations; and the plans, if any, he has to change this specific aspect of the social welfare code.</Quest>

      <P>The conditions for entitlement to the various social welfare payments are the same for both men and women.  It is thus open to married women to claim social welfare payments in their own right provided they satisfy the appropriate conditions for payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to split or separate payments is provided for in regulations made pursuant to section 207 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  The Minister <Col N="1110" /> may, where it appears to him that the circumstances so warrant, appoint a person to receive and deal with, on behalf of a claimant or beneficiary, so much of the benefit as is payable in respect of qualified adult dependants and child dependants.</P>
    <P>Separate payments are typically made when it is concluded that the dependant allowances would otherwise be used by the claimant for the purposes other than those intended i.e. for the maintenance of the family.  While the claimant must be informed of the decision to introduce separate payments and his or her written agreement is sought as a matter of course, the claimant's permission is not an essential requirement in administering separate payments.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a widow's contributory pension at the maximum over-80 rate of £73.10 per week, with an additional £5 weekly fuel allowance during the winter heating season.  This pension entitlement is based on her late husband's social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to old age contributory pension is based on the social insurance contribution record of applicants.  As the person concerned has no reckonable social insurance contributions paid in her own right she does not qualify for an old age contributory pension.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the level of refusal in respect of the students' summer jobs scheme of almost one in four is too high in view of his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 279 of 18 June 1996; his views on whether students in continuing third level education, though different to aspects of the course they are taking, are eligible for the scheme; if he will grant them a place on the scheme where required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The underlying purpose of the students' summer jobs scheme is to provide income support for the less well off third level students who have been disqualified by law since 1993 from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer period and are unable to obtain work.</P>
      <P>Students who have completed a course of study are not disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance and are, therefore, not eligible for the scheme.  It is not my intention to modify this year's scheme to allow such students to take part.</P>
      <P>The level of participation of students in the 1996 scheme is expected to be at least as high as the 1995 participation level.  The primary reason the number of students who have been refused entry to this year's scheme is higher than last year is that this year I decided to limit participation to those less well off students who have no alternative income support from my Department during the summer months if they cannot find work.</P>

      <P>The primary reason for the <Col N="1112" /> decision to discontinue the payment of £200 under the 1996 students' summer jobs scheme to students whose parents are reliant on social welfare payments was to allow the maximum number of eligible students from low income families who are denied unemployment assistance as a result of legislation passed in 1993 to avail of the scheme this year within the budget allocation of £10.2 million.  This is £4 million more than the budget allocation of last year and £5.4 million more than the budget allocation of 1994.</P>

      <P>An appeal against a decision of a deciding officer is determined by an appeals officer having regard to the relevant legislation and to the facts and circumstances of the individual case.  All decisions by appeals officers are notified as a matter of course to the relevant section of the Department who are responsible for implementing the decision, for example, to restore payment.</P>
      <P>Where decisions of appeals officers have wider implications, action is taken to ensure that account is taken of the appeals officer's approach in such cases. This is done by bringing the case to the attention of the deciding officers in the area.</P>
      <P>To help ensure consistency in decision making, a senior officer of the Department provides a decisions advisory service to deciding officers across the Department.  This officer regularly liaises with the social welfare appeals office about decisions of appeals officers which have wider significance and ensures that the outcome of such discussions is conveyed to deciding officers.</P>
      <P>To assist deciding officers in carrying out their duties, training courses are organised.  These courses cover aspects of social welfare legislation, including EU regulations, interpretation of legislation, natural justice requirements, relevant case law and presentations on the separate schemes, the decisions advisory officer and the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <Quest>the current level of integration of information within his Department's computer system for recipients with records across more than one social welfare scheme; the degree of record linkage within family units; and his plans for enhancements in each instance.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is engaged in a modernisation programme to provide a more personalised service to customers across the full range of social welfare schemes and services.  In support of this, my Department has adopted an integrated approach to computerisation of systems.  The key to this integration strategy is the Revenue and Social Insurance &mdash; RSI &mdash; number which is the main reference number under which information is held across my Department's computer systems. Most people have RSI numbers and are registered on the central records computer system at the Department.</P>
      <P>The feature to link records of members of a family unit within this computer system was brought into operation during 1995.  At this stage, the linkages are in place for the vast majority of children and linkages for adult dependants will be built up over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of different computer claim and payment processing systems that cater for the social welfare schemes.  During 1995, a new integrated system to cover short-term payments schemes &mdash; ISTS &mdash; was implemented in local offices throughout the country. <Col N="1118" /> This system is designed to cater for processing of claims for unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit, occupational injury benefit, maternity benefit and supplementary welfare allowance, which is administered by the community welfare officers in the health boards.</P>
    <P>Last week the process of extending the system to supplementary welfare allowance claims commenced and will continue until the middle of next year. This is the first time that the processing of supplementary welfare allowance claims has been computerised and benefits are already being achieved.</P>
    <P>Later this year disability, maternity and occupational injury benefits will be processed on the new system.  The new computer system is tightly integrated with the central records computer system. The registration of a claim triggers an automatic check on central records to establish that identity details are correct and to facilitate payment of the correct adult dependant and child dependant allowances.  There is also a check to determine whether another social welfare claim is already in payment.</P>
    <P>Work has recently commenced on a major study to review the business processes and procedures in connection with the administration of the long-term payment schemes, such as old age pension, lone parent's allowances, child benefit, etc.  It is planned that the development of a new computer system to support more modern, customer focused and cost effective procedures for the long-term schemes will commence in early 1997.  The new system will provide close integration with the central records system.</P>
    <P>There is a cross-scheme inquiry facility which allows information officers and other staff of the Department deal with inquiries from the public and to check the status of claims and payments.  As the systems are developed further, more detailed information will become available in this way.  These developments are part of my wider agenda of providing a comprehensive, responsive and integrated service to <Col N="1119" /> members of the public who come in contact with the Department's schemes and services.</P>

      <P>In the run-up to the 1995 budget, a portion of the contents of a draft social welfare factsheet containing details of the main social welfare increases and rates was reproduced in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 8 February 1995.  Subsequent inquiries in my Department revealed that there was a breach of confidentiality on the part of an official of the Department.  The case was dealt with as a disciplinary matter under the terms of the disciplinary code applicable to civil servants.  Formal disciplinary action was taken against the officer concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information is one of the key assets of my Department.  As one of a series of measures aimed at safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the information, whether in computerised or other format, held in the Department, a business information protection policy, which applies equally to the staff and agents of my Department, has been formulated.  As part of this policy, a comprehensive programme has been initiated to increase awareness among staff of the importance of the need to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Department's information is maintained.  This has involved the circulation to all staff of the Department's policy document on information protection, the inclusion of information protection awareness in <Col N="1120" /> a range of training courses and the carrying out of periodic surveys on the effectiveness of security measures.  My Department is also a member of the European Security Forum which aims to increase awareness of security issues and encourage best practice.</P>
    <P>In relation to information technology, the security of computer systems receives a high degree of attention within the Department and a number of reviews are carried out regularly.  This issue is also covered in regular audits by the Department's internal audit unit. For obvious reasons, it would be inappropriate for me to disclose the range of security measures in place which are aimed at safeguarding the integrity of my Department's information technology systems.</P>
    <P>On a general basis, all staff of the Department, established and unestablished, are required to sign the acknowledgement, nothing its contents, to Circular 15/79: Official Secrecy and Integrity. In relation to the confidentiality of Government memoranda, the procedures followed in my Department are those set out in the Government Procedures Instructions, 1983, as amended. Staff are also subject to the terms of the Data Protection Act, 1988 which provides for heavy penalties in the event of breaches of the legislation.  Staff are constantly reminded of their responsibilities under the act and comprehensive guidelines in this regard have been issued to them.  In addition, consultants engaged by the Department are required to sign an undertaking for the purposes of complying with the Official Secrets Act, 1963 and the Data Protection Act, 1988.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for the scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is broadly similar to that which is applied for entitlement to unemployment assistance.  Those who established a minimum entitlement of unemployment assistance are approved to participate and issued with a job certificate. Students residing with parents can qualify for the scheme provided that they satisfy the means test.</P>

The overall target for 1999 is, therefore, for the number of jobs in the tourism industry to rise to 120,000.  The programme also aims over the duration to generate some 6,000 jobs in construction and associated capital works.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1995, the estimated number of jobs in the tourism industry had arisen to 102,000, which is well in line to achieve and mid-term strategic employment target of 105,000 set in the Operational Programme for the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at present no European Commission proposal to impose a 100 per cent duty levy on imports of luggage, travel goods, briefcases and school bags originating in China.  However, a European Commission investigation is currently under way into a complaint that these goods are being dumped on the Community market and thereby causing material injury to the Community industry.  The complaint was lodged by the European Committee for Leather Goods Industries on behalf of seven of its national producer associations and notice of the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation into the matter was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 17 April last.</P>
      <P>Under Council Regulation No. 384/96, the Commission is required to make a proposal to Council on whether or not to impose provisional anti-dumping measures within nine months of the publication of the notice of initiation of anti-dumping proceedings.  In this case, a proposal is not expected for another five or six months.  The Commission can only propose such measures if their investigation establishes that dumping has taken place, that injury has been caused to Community industry and that there is a causal link between the two. Another important consideration in such an investigation is Community interest which takes account of the impact of anti-dumping measures on consumers of the products in question.</P>
      <P>Once the Commission makes its formal proposal, member states are asked for their views.  It is at this point that my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, examines the case bearing in mind the consequences that such measures would have on the Irish industry as a whole.  Our considered opinion is communicated to the Commission via the anti-dumping advisory committee which meets in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> To date, I have not received any representations on the case and in the absence of a formal proposal from the Commission, it would be premature for my Department to adopt a policy on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 originally provided EU grant aid of £12.03 million for specialist accommodation-related developments.  In 1995, the National Monitoring Committee, which oversees the implementation of the programme, agreed to provided additional resources for this measure amounting to £4.052 million.  These additional funds were sourced from provisions provided by the EU for the programme to compensate for inflation, and from Measures 1 and 4 of the product development sub-programme as identified by the implementing tourism agencies.</P>

      <P>Neither my Department nor ABT have been approached by any companies who had opened new markets in Northern Ireland over the past 24 months and experiencing difficulties as a consequence of the breakdown of the ceasefire.</P>
      <P>It is too early yet to assess the actual impact the current breakdown of the ceasefire may have on North-South trade and it would be premature to make any predictions at this stage. Meanwhile ABT continues to work with companies seeking new business opportunities in the Northern Ireland market and many of the initiatives put in place during the ceasefire will continue to operate.  These include the EU Peace and Reconciliation Operational Programme for Northern Ireland and the Border counties now in place which will fully support projects both North and South.</P>
      <P>Finally, ABT will continue its efforts to assist southern companies to identify business opportunities in the North and will build on the range of initiatives already in place.</P>

      <P>Rates of pay and other conditions of employment of certain workers employed in catering establishments anywhere throughout the State except the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire are prescribed in an Employment Regulation Order, ERO, made by the Labour Court on the basis of proposals from the Catering Joint Labour Committee.  A separate ERO for workers in hotels operates throughout the State except the County Boroughs of Dublin and Cork and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  A review of the rates of pay under these orders is a matter for <Col N="1132" /> the relevant joint labour committee.  I understand that the Labour Court has recently made a new ERO for workers covered by the Hotels Joint Labour Committee and is to consider proposals for a new ERO for workers covered by the Catering Joint Labour Committee.</P>
      <P>A joint labour committee for catering establishments in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, which do not come within the scope of the existing ERO, has also been established.  The JLC is still in discussions in relation to the rates of pay and other conditions of employment of the workers in respect of whom it operates.</P>

Its objective is to provide temporary work experience opportunities together with some training that would enhance the employment prospects of those whom the programme is targeted at.  Current resources constraints rule out the possibility of widening the eligibility pool for this programme, to include those signing for credits.</P>

      <P>I understand all of the employees have been offered employment in Kiltimagh but a number of these are reluctant to move to the new location.  I have been informed that the company and the unions have had discussions in relation to a voluntary redundancy package.  In this regard the parties have agreed to attend a conciliation conference, to be held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, later this week.  I hope these discussions will provide the basis for reaching agreement on this issue.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland is at an advanced stage of negotiations with Donegal County Council regarding the development of a high quality business park in Letterkenny.  The proposed business park will be located on 25 acres at Lisnenan, Letterkenny and will be developed to an international standard.</P>
      <P>It is planned to have a 20,000 sq. ft. building constructed on the site at an early date.  The building will then be marketed aggressively to overseas investors in the areas of data processing, software development, medical devices-health care and new high-tech jobs will result.</P>
      <P>Over the last two years, Forbairt in conjunction with the International Fund for Ireland has been promoting the North American Partnership Programme. This is an innonvative programme to develop business linkages between companies in the Border region and North America.  To date agreements have been signed by a number of Donegal companies including International Test Technologies, Falcarragh, BMR Teo., Bunbeg, MDR Electronics, Bunbeg and Flite Software, Letterkenny. The programme is being extended at present.</P>
      <P>Forbairt's international services programme provides advice and consultancy support on services business development and a package of incentives and support facilities for Irish companies involved in a range of internationally traded services.  A number of small companies in the Donegal area have benefited from this programme and are creating highly skilled employment in software development and information technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> Forbairt's Techstart programme, where young graduates are supported to take up employment in manufacturing-internationally traded services companies, has been very successful in the Donegal area.  Many young graduates are currently working in areas such as research and development and quality control and contributing to the growth of technology based developments.</P>
    <P>Forbairt extended its regional linkage programme to Donegal in early 1996. This assists existing sub-supply companies to increase the volume of business with existing multinationals.  Most of these companies provide high quality/ technology based employment in engineering and plastics.  There are six Donegal companies presently participating in the programme with assistance from Forbairt, two of whom are from the Letterkenny area.</P>

      <P>Measure 5 &mdash; pilot training projects &mdash; of the small business operational programme is intended to improve the business knowhow and the business environment of the small business sector by developing the strategic focus and skills of owners and managers.  This measure of the SBOP is specifically designed to support innovative programmes of small business training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advertisements inviting applications for funding were placed in the national papers last February.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 15 March 1996.  Seventy applications for funding under this measure were received and have been considered by a working group within my Department.  To date, eight projects have been approved for funding and it is intended that the <Col N="1145" /> remaining applicants will be informed of the outcome of their applications very shortly.  The ongoing implementation of individual projects will be monitored by my Department for the duration of each project.</P>
    <P>Measure 2 &mdash; public procurement &mdash; is designed to improve access to public markets for small business through a number of multi-faceted actions addressing market identification weakness among small businesses and barriers to entry in public procurement, whether arising on the demand or supply sides.  The operational programme, as published, includes a number of submeasures and states that these &ldquo;will include the establishment of relevant databases, general advisory services and specific support services related to sub-supply and tendering.  A support service along similar lines will be developed in recognition of the North-South dimension of public procurement in Ireland.&rdquo; The measure is to be implemented by An Bord Tráchtála in co-operation with Forbairt.</P>
    <P>A selection-implementation committee representative of my Department, the Department of Tourism and Trade, the Department of Finance, An Bord Tráchtála, Forbairt, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Institute of Purchasing Managers, Irish Small and Medium Enterprises and Small Firms Association was set up in February 1996 to select proposals from the agencies and to monitor their implementation.  A detailed joint paper is being prepared by the two principal agencies &mdash; An Bord Tráchtála and Forbairt.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the design of this measure is nearing completion and that details of assistance to suppliers will be set down in an explanatory leaflet which will be distributed in the near future.  This will list relevant contact names and phone numbers in An Bord Tráchtála and Forbairt.</P>

      <P>The question of increasing the overall numbers entering apprenticeships was addressed earlier this year by a working group of the Central Review Committee, CRC.  In these discussions, the reduction of the apprentice population in the construction industry in recent years was considered, as was the possible connection between this reduction and the recent structural changes in the industry where an increasing proportion of construction activity is carried out by sub-contractors. It was noted that Clause 10 of the Registered Employment Agreement for the Construction Industry, which deals with sub-contracting, is currently being renegotiated, with discussions at an advanced stage.  It is possible that the new clause could contain a statement regarding the obligations of sub-contractors for the recruitment and training of apprentices.  If agreed, the new clause could have the effect of increasing the intake of apprentices by construction sub-contractors.  Furthermore, as a result of the CRC discussions, FÁS in a series of ongoing meetings with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has agreed an approach to the intake of apprentices into the construction trades and in particular has focused on those trades which are currently most at risk to shortage of skilled craftspersons, such as bricklaying, plastering and painting/ decorating.  FÁS and the CIF are jointly developing promotional materials specifically for these trades aimed both at prospective apprentices, to encourage them to consider these trades as career options, and at employers to urge them to examine their human resource requirements and to recruit sufficient apprentice numbers to meet their future demands for qualified craftspersons. These materials will shortly form the basis of a promotional campaign in the <Col N="1147" /> run-up to the main apprentice recruitment period in the last quarter of this year.</P>

      <P>The National Microelectronics Research Centre in Cork is a strategic national asset. Increasingly, our success as a country in the coming decades will depend on our ability to adapt to a society of high skills and specialised knowledge.  In this regard all our universities and research institutes, including the NMRC, will have a critical role to play.</P>
      <P>Growth based on a market-led approach must be at the heart of the NMRC's mission.  It must sell itself, by every means available, as a postgraduate/technology-driven centre of excellence to potential industrial clients.</P>
      <P>The NMRC has made major strides in expanding its links with industry, both overseas and indigenous.  In addition, it has been successful in expanding its facilities by use of own resources.  A major extension has been completed which, for the first time in many years, puts all the NMRC activities under one roof &mdash; a major proportion of the cost of this has been contributed by the NMRC's industrial clients.  In the coming years, I look forward to the NMRC continuing to expand its technological capability and to a continuation of the positive dynamism which the NMRC has displayed in providing an ever broadening range of microelectronics services to Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the NMRC also participates with Trinity College <Col N="1148" /> Dublin and Queen's University Belfast in combining their expertise in the Institute for Advanced Microelectronics, IAM, established with IFI help.  The achievements of the Institute &mdash; technical and non-technical &mdash; are impressive. Collaboration and exchange between the three parties is now commonplace; the institute has played an active role in attracting major new industrial concerns to both parts of Ireland.  Perhaps the greatest achievement of the institute is in becoming self-supporting.  The original work has moved from academic research to industrial exploitation.</P>
    <P>For the NMRC, it is also essential in the longer term that it will continue to develop with a greater focus on income generation and with a greater participation by the shareholders.  To this end, strategic plans which underpin the NMRC need to be agreed between all the shareholders.  The nature of the longer-term relationship between the NMRC and the Programmes in Advanced Technology, PATs, also needs to be defined and consideration is being given to this in the context of the public response to the STIAC report which is now at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that matters relating to project applications to county enterprise boards fall within the day-to-day responsibility of the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the number of projects which applied to the 35 county enterprise boards for grant aid in 1995.  Very many applications are <Col N="1149" /> received by each board, some of which are not considered appropriate to a particular board; others are refused because the project is not considered by the board to be a worthwhile or viable proposal.</P>
    <P>The information concerning the number of projects approved by each CEB in 1995 is contained in table (1), which I am circulating with the Official Report. The average level of grant aid approved by each board in 1995 is set out in table (2), which I am also circulating with the official report.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Non-Nationals <Col N="1151" /> was established by the Government in 1993 to examine all matters relating to non-nationals in the State.  It comprised senior officials from the Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs and my Department. The committee's first report, which was submitted to Government in November 1993, dealt with asylum seekers and refugees and the second report deals with matters relating to admission and residence in the State.</P>
      <P>The second report has not yet been submitted to Government.  Therefore I am not in a position to comment on its contents.</P>
      <P>However, the subject of work permit policy is under review in my Department. Any submission from the Deputy regarding this matter will be very welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the internal report commissioned by the Office of Public Works national parks and wildlife service into the problem of overgrazing.  My Department recognised this problem as being most pronounced in many hill areas.  When drawing up the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; my Department included a specific supplementary measure aimed at combating this problem. An assessment of the problem was carried out by my Department.  As a result of this assessment a number of commonage areas in counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Galway, Mayo and Kerry were designated as &ldquo;degraded areas&rdquo; under the scheme i.e. areas to which the <Col N="1152" /> specific measure would apply.  The measure as originally devised and introduced in June 1994, did not prove sufficiently attractive to farmers in these areas and the overgrazing situation was not being improved.  As a result my Department sought and obtained the approval of the European Commission for a revised package of measures to tackle the problem under REPS.  The revised measure, which became effective in January 1996, is more flexible and financially attractive for farmers and is essentially geared towards enticing farmers in such areas to reduce stock numbers to sustainable levels for the five-year duration of a REPS plan. A significant element of the revised measure is the introduction of a group incentive which applies where two or more shareholders in a designated commonage who, taken together, own 50 per cent or more of the sheep on the commonage join REPS.  In such cases the group incentive is available to all the commonage shareholders who join the scheme, including those who are already in the scheme.  My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, held a number of information meetings in the areas in question in early 1996 to advise farmers of the provisions of the revised measure.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I will keep this matter under review and will consider taking further appropriate action should that be necessary.</P>

      <P>The scientific information available on the problem of overgrazing is limited.  Against this background Teagasc is carrying out research, mainly at its Hill Sheep Farm, Leenane, County Mayo, to determine the effect of controlled sheep grazing on hill vegetation.  This research commenced in 1995.  As a result it is far too soon to draw any conclusions.  However, details of the physical features and a baseline of the vegetative cover have been established.  Initial results were published in the spring 1996 issue of Teagasc's publication &ldquo;Farm &amp; Food&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Teagasc, in conjunction with UCD, has initiated a broader study to evaluate changes in soil, water and vegetation cover on mountain, hill and blanket peat in areas representative of the whole of the west of Ireland.  This project is co-funded by my Department and the EU through the research stimulus fund provided for under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident the findings of this research programme will provide vital, <Col N="1154" /> scientifically-based technical guidelines for future policy measures.</P>

      <P>The townland exceeded the stocking density limit of 0.99 livestock units per forage hectare.  Therefore, it was not possible for the disadvantaged areas appeals panel to recommend its inclusion in the proposal for extension of the disadvantaged areas.

      <P>The sale of timber is a matter for Coillte Teoranta in the context of its legislative mandate, as contained in the 1988 Forestry Act.  I am not, therefore, in a position to exercise a function in that regard nor would it be appropriate for me to comment on business relationships between Coillte Teoranta and any of its sawmilling customers.</P>
      <P>The Irish sawmilling sector in general is experiencing some difficulty at present in the light of an adverse international market for pulpwood, residues, chips and sawdust.  Intake of these sawmilling products from traditional users in the panel board sector has fallen which, in addition to reduced prices, is impacting adversely on sawmillers' returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> All sawmills purchase their timber from Coillte Teoranta through either its tender system or an allocation system. The price derived from the tender process and in turn the allocation system is set by sawmills themselves.  Coillte Teoranta's pricing policy is centred on all sawmills paying the same market-determined price.  Coillte Teoranta intend to dispense with the allocation system with effect from next month, so that all sales will thereafter be made on a competitive basis.</P>
    <P>The framework for the new timber sales regime was agreed between Coillte Teoranta and the Irish Timber Council in March, 1996.  This will be an auction-based, market-related system which will improve transparency and avail of the opportunity offered by new technology. Discussions between the parties on the detailed implementation of the new regime are under way.  I understand that steady progress is being made.  I have impressed on both parties the importance which I attach to a speedy and successful conclusion to their deliberations. It is intended to have most, if not all, of the elements of the new regime in place by end-1996.</P>

      <P>It is understood there was a family herd number &mdash; H240033 &mdash; registered to the father of the person named.  However it would appear that a joint application for sheep grants was made by father and son in 1995 and 1996.  Normally these would have been processed under the family herd number &mdash; H240033 &mdash; but were processed instead under a flock number &mdash; H240F27.  All flock numbers were <Col N="1160" /> replaced last year by dormant herd numbers.  If the person concerned wishes to be considered as an individual applicant in his own right in 1997 he will be required to make an application for grants and will be assessed for entitlement to a herd number under the normal criteria.  Alternatively he may make a formal application for a herd number now by contacting his local office.</P>

      <P>The use of router technology by telecommunications services providers for services such as fax and data is within the terms of their licences.  However, because the use of router technology for transmission of voice services relies on the simultaneous use of two switched network termination points, then in circumstances where all of the other essential elements of the definition of voice telephobny as set out in Irish and EU law are present, it constitutes voice telephony as defined and would not be within the terms of the licences.</P>
      <P>All licensees, including Esat Telecommunications Limited, were recently advised of this following an investigation by the regulatory division of my Department.  I should stress that this is a complicated business, both technically and legally and needed detailed consideration. I can assure the Deputy that all service providers were informed of my views at the same time and in the same terms.</P>
      <P>With regard to compliance with licence conditions and action to be taken in particular instances, this will be dealt with on a case by case basis within an overall regulatory framework which is being finalised by my Department and which will be communicated to all service providers shortly.  In connection with that framework, my Department is putting in place a mechanism to monitor the traffic of service providers to establish the facts as to compliance in any particular case.  I can also say that where necessary, direct dial capacity is being configured or restricted so as to be sufficient for the provision of liberalised services only.</P>

      <P>There is no conflict between the policy for energy conservation and the operation of the high pressure gas transmission system by Bord Gáis Éireann.  The operation of that system at a pressure of 70 bar minimises the diameter of cross-country pipelines and ensures maximum efficiency of operation of the system. Local gas distribution networks are operated at much lower pressures.  Gas consumption levels are determined by demand from consumers and are independent of system pressures.</P>
      <P>Our sole indigenous gas reserves at Kinsale Head are declining and the technical advice is that those reserves will be depleted in some five years time. Bord Gáis Éireann has provided a gas interconnector with the UK.  There are commercial gas flows being received through the pipeline.  It will provide security of supply pending depletion of the Kinsale Head gas field.  In addition the interconnector will underpin the further development of the Irish gas industry by being able to provide twice as much gas as Kinsale Head can.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313 and 316 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the preparation of plans for a response to major emergencies including transportation of dangerous substances, is a matter for the local authorities, health boards, and the Garda Síochána.  My Department co-operates, as appropriate, with these bodies in the implementation of these plans.  For instance, an inter-departmental committee on the transportation of dangerous goods by <Col N="1168" /> rail, which is chaired by my Department, has drawn up a scheme to facilitate the implementation of the emergency plans on a co-ordinated basis, in the event of an incidence involving the transportation of hazardous substances by rail.</P>
    <P>My Department regularly reviews gas safety issues with Bord Gáis Éireann and I am satisfied that transportation of natural gas is carried out in accordance with the highest international safety standards.  The Gas Technical Standards Committee, which includes a representative of my Department, has set down a comprehensive series of codes and technical standards which provide a safe technical basis for gas transportation. Bord Gáis Éireann also participates, as appropriate, in relevant emergency planning at local authority level.</P>
    <P>The transportation of radioactive materials is regulated under licence issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) in accordance with international regulations.  The RPII assists in radiological emergency planning and responses.</P>
    <P>As regards aviation, the Irish Aviation Authority is responsible for regulating the safe transportation of dangerous goods by air.  In regulating this matter, the authority applies the standards and recommended practices set out in Annex 18 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. The Irish Aviation Authority also has responsibility for surveillance of the emergency planning of aerodrome authorities. It also operated the rescue coordination centre to co-ordinate search and rescue activity in the event of an aircraft accident.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 314 and 315 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that at approximately 10.30 hours on Sunday, 16 June 1996 three discharged ammonia tank wagons on the 04.10 hours ammonia train from the NET plant at Arklow to Marino Point, Cork became derailed at low speed in Cork rail yard during shunting operations. The incident posed no threat to the public, rail staff or the environment.  The local emergency plan was implemented <Col N="1170" /> immediately and was stood down shortly after noon.  Iarnród Éireann has established a board of inquiry to determine the cause of the derailment and to recommend any necessary remedial action.</P>
    <P>I understand that the tank wagons involved in the accident were in a standard discharged state &mdash; that is to say that the bulk of the cargo of liquid ammonia had been off-loaded leaving small residues in the tanks, and in this regard, the use of the term &ldquo;empty&rdquo; was inadvertent.  I should emphasise, however, that whether laden or discharged, the tank wagons are subject to the same stringent safety standards and emergency procedures at all times.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that this question relates to the overseas observer allowance payable to personnel of the Permanent Defence Force while serving as observers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East (UNTSO), which allowance has been the subject of current, and previous, representations on behalf of former members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>UNTSO was established in 1948 to supervise the cease-fire arranged by the United Nations Security Council between Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Israel.  It is an unarmed observer mission whose duties are to observe the cease-fire and report breaches thereof.</P>
      <P>The payment of an overseas observer allowance to personnel serving as observers with UNTSO was first sanctioned in 1971.  In the exceptional conditions arising from the war of June 1967, it was decided to authorise payment of this allowance in respect of service in that particular mission area with effect from 1 June 1967.  Personnel of the Permanent Defence Force first participated with UNTSO in December 1958.  Twenty-seven officers served with this organisation prior to 1 June 1967, accounting for 15,411 man days.  The approximate cost of conceding retrospective payment of observer overseas allowance would be £181,000 at current daily rates.</P>
      <P>In view of the large cost of the concession sought and also the very considerable time, nearly 30 years, which has elapsed since the personnel concerned served on this mission, I feel that payment of retrospective observer overseas allowance at this stage is not justified. I am further persuaded in this course by the rationale adopted by my predecessor in granting retrospection of the 1971 allowance to 1 June 1967, viz. the particular conditions of hardship occasioned by the Arab-Israeli war of June 1967 and subsequently.</P>

      <P>The River Moy Harbour Board has 11 members.  The board meets if and when there is harbour business to be discussed.  The board held 14 meetings since June 1994.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a feasibility study on proposed deepwater berthing facilities at Ross Point was carried out recently. The result showed that, given the long river approach, it would be unrealistic to expect that any development works at the quay or in the estuary would increase, on a long-term basis, the size of vessels using the port.  I understand that only vessels of less than 1000 tonnes capacity can access the quay area at present, and in the circumstances I have no plans for the development of the River Moy harbour.</P>

      <P>As Minister for the Marine, I hold responsibility for safety on the water in so far as vessels, passengers and crew are concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of jet skis and fast power craft, the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 enables local authorities to propose that areas within their jurisdiction, or in the seas adjoining their jurisdiction, be designated as unsuitable for the operation of jet skis and fast power boats in the interests of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Jet skis and fast power craft used in water-skiing are prohibited from operating within an area designated under these regulations.  However, there is no legislation currently in place to control their use in waters that are not designated.</P>
    <P>I have to point out that, while I have no function with regard to swimmers and bathers, I am concerned about their safety which is arguably most threatened by such craft.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I am advised that Officials from my Department have been keeping this matter under review and are currently examining all legislative options available with a view to identifying the most effective means of controlling power craft in the interests of other water-users.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will be supportive of any recommendations made which will provide for the improvement of safety for all water users, including swimmers.</P>
